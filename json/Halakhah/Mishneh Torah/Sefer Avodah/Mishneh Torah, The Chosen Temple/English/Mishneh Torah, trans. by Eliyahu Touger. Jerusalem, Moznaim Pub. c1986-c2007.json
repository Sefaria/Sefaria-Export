            "<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam introduces each book of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> by quoting a verse from the Bible. In this case, the verse chosen does more than introduce the text to follow. It also emphasizes that we are commanded to \"seek out the welfare of Jerusalem\" and study the laws of the Temple's construction.</i> It is a positive commandment<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 20) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 95) include this as one of 613 mitzvot. The mitzvah is incumbent on the Jewish community as a whole and must be undertaken by the nation as a collective entity. See <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 1:1 which speaks of \"Israel being commanded to fulfill three mitzvot upon entering [the Promised] Land.\"</i> to construct a House for God,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are two ways to understand this mitzvah:<br>a) to build the Temple,<br>b) to ensure that the Temple be built; the mitzvah is not fulfilled until that objective is accomplished.<br>The question is whether the command is to perform an activity or to see that an objective is completed. In his commentary on the Torah (Exodus 35:10 , the Rogachover Gaon favors the latter explanation and explains a number of possible practical differences between these abstract concepts. Among them:<br>a) Must a blessing be recited before taking part in the construction of the Temple? If the mitzvah is the actual building, a blessing would be required. However, if the mitzvah is to ensure that the Temple be completed, no blessing is necessary.<br>b) Can a gentile participate in the building of the Temple? If the actual construction is the mitzvah, it would be improper for a gentile to participate. However, if the mitzvah is dependent on the completion of the objective, the construction of the Temple, there is no difference if a gentile's efforts also aided in the fulfillment of this goal.<br>c) If the Temple descends from heaven - as some maintain the Third Temple will - will it be considered as if the mitzvah has been fulfilled (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 18, p. 418).<br>From the Rambam' wording (Halachah 12 and elsewhere), it appears that he views the mitzvah as the activity of building.</i> prepared for sacrifices to be offered within.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This phrase is the subject of much commentary. In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>(<i>loc. cit.</i>) the Rambam describes the mitzvah to build a Sanctuary as : \"the command... to make a house for service where sacrifices will be offered.\"<br>In contrast, the Ramban (Nachmanides) views the construction of the Temple as a command with a self-contained objective. Thus, he writes in his commentary to the Torah (Exodus 25:2 : \"[God's] essential desire in the Sanctuary was the [construction of] a resting place for the <i>Shechinah</i>.\"<br>Some commentaries explain the disagreement between these giants simply: According to the Rambam, the Temple was built to allow for sacrifices to be offered, while the Ramban views the revelation of the <i>Shechinah</i> as the Temple's purpose.<br>However, this interpretation can not be accepted because:<br>a) the Torah itself specifically refers to the Temple as (Deuteronomy 12:5 : \"The place which God has chosen to cause His Name to dwell there,\" emphasizing the revelation of Godliness.<br>b) when describing the mitzvah to build a Sanctuary, the Rambam himself writes that we are commanded \"to construct a house for God,\" stressing that the main element of the Temple was the revelation of Godliness. It is after that statement, that he declares that the House must be \"prepared for sacrifices to be offered within.\"<br>Therefore, it must be assumed that both sages recognized the two differing elements, and the debate between them involves the question of determining which aspect is more important. The Ramban considered the fundamental goal the revelation of Godliness and viewed man's service as a means toward that end. On the other hand, the Rambam saw man's service as the ultimate objective. However, that service could only be complete when carried out in a place where Godliness is revealed (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 4, p. 1346, Vol. 11, p. 116, Vol. 24, p. 84).</i> We [must] celebrate there three times a year,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The pilgrimage festivals; Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot. On these festivals, each Jew was obligated to come to the Temple and present himself before God. In particular, the term \"celebrate\" refers to bringing the festive peace-offerings (see <i>Hilchot Chagigah</i> 1:1).</i> as [Exodus 25:8] states: \"And you shall make Me a sanctuary.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even though this verse specifically refers to the construction of the sanctuary in the desert, the construction of the later sanctuaries and the building of the Temple were also implicit in that command (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>In <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> (1:1), the Rambam writes \"Israel was commanded to fulfill three mitzvot upon its entry into <i>Eretz [Yisrael]</i>: to appoint a king..., to annihilate the seed of Amalek.., and to build [God's] Chosen House as it is said: \"You shall seek out His dwelling and come there.\" The commentaries offer different explanations why the Rambam quotes a different verse in either place.</i>\"<br>The sanctuary constructed by Moses is already described in the Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Book of Exodus, Chapters 25-40.</i> It was only temporary,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And was replaced by other structures, as described in the following Halachah.</i> as [Deuteronomy 12:9] states: \"For at present, you have not come unto [the resting place and the inheritance].\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Commenting on this verse, Zevachim 119a declares: \"'the resting place' - this is Shiloh, [for Shiloh was also merely a temporary resting place for the Divine Presence]; 'the inheritance' - this is Jerusalem.\" (Just as an inheritance reflects an everlasting chain, so too, the Divine Presence will always remain in Jerusalem.)</i>",
            "After [the Jews] entered The Land [of Israel],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the year 2488 after creation.</i> they erected the Sanctuary in Gilgal during the fourteen years in which they conquered and divided [the land].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The conquest of the Land took seven years, and the division took another seven years (<i>Zevachim</i> 118b).</i> From there, they came to Shiloh,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the year 2502, built a house of stone and spread the curtains of the Sanctuary over it. It did not have a roof. The Talmud (ibid.) explains:<br>I Samuel 1:24 declares: \"And she brought him to the House of God, Shiloh\" implying that the Ark was enclosed with a permanent structure. Another verse (Psalms 78:60  states: \"He has forsaken the tabernacle of Shiloh\" from which it can be inferred that it was a tent-like structure resembling the Sanctuary in the desert. How can the two verses be reconciled?<br>There was no roof. Though there was a structure of stone, the curtains [of the Sanctuary] were spread over it.<br></i> built a house of stone, and spread the curtains of the Sanctuary over it. It did not have a roof. The sanctuary of Shiloh stood for 369 years. When Eli died, it was destroyed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the year 2871, when the Philistines captured the Holy Ark and slew Eli's two sons.<br>The Sanctuary of Shiloh had a greater degree of holiness than the structure which preceded it and those that followed immediately thereafter. The <i>Sifri</i> states that the verse (Deuteronomy 12:5 : \"The place which God has chosen to cause His name to dwell there\" refers to \"Shiloh and the Temple.\"<br>The uniqueness of Shiloh is further emphasized by the fact that while it stood, the Jews were forbidden to offer sacrifices in any other place. While the Ark was in Gilgal, and similarly, in Nov and Givon, the Jews were allowed to bring their individual sacrifices wherever they desired. However, during all the years the Sanctuary was in Shiloh, no sacrifices could be offered in any other location.</i><br>[Afterwards,] they came to Nov<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When the Philistines returned the ark after the seven months of its captivity, they brought it to Kiryat Yearim (I Samuel, Chapters 6-7). During this time, a Sanctuary was constructed in Nov and afterwards, in Givon, to provide the Jews with a place for centralized worship. However, the ark was not kept there out of fear that it might again be captured by the Philistines (Meiri, <i>Megillah</i>, 9b).</i> and built a sanctuary.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of stone. Though the Rambam in his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i>, ibid.) states that the Jews erected the Sanctuary that had stood in the desert in Nov, here he appears to follow the view mentioned by Rashi (<i>Pesachim</i> 38 a,b) which states that a stone structure was erected there. Similarly, <i>Sotah</i> 9a states that the sanctuary's structure was entombed when the Jews entered <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. The Sanctuary of Nov stood for 44 years (<i>Seder HaDorot</i>).</i> When Samuel died, it was destroyed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">By King Saul.</i> And they came to Givon<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On the outskirts of Jerusalem (see II Samuel, ch. 6). The Sanctuary stood there for approximately 13 years.</i> and built a sanctuary. From Givon, they came to the eternal structure [in Jerusalem].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the year 2928, as described in the beginning of I Kings.</i> The days [the sanctuary stood] in Nov and Givon were 57 years.",
            "Once the Temple was built in Jerusalem, it became forbidden to build a sanctuary for God or to offer sacrifices in any other place.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbonot</i> 18:3 which describes this prohibition. <i>Zevachim</i> 112b states: \"When they came to Jerusalem [and erected the Temple], it became forbidden [to sacrifice in] the High Places and permission [to sacrifice] there was never granted [again].\"<br>That prohibition was derived from the following verses (Deuteronomy 12:5-6):<br>Only at the place where the Lord, your God, shall choose to cause His Name to dwell, may you seek Him at his dwelling...There, you shall bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices.<br>The preceding verses described how the pagans had sacrificed \"upon the high mountains, upon the hills, under every lofty tree.\" In contrast, the service of God had to be centralized in one place alone, \"the place which the Lord, your God shall choose to cause His Name to dwell.\" Nevertheless, until an abode for the <i>Shechinah</i> was constructed, there was no prohibition against sacrificing anywhere in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<br>As mentioned above, this prohibition was in effect during the time of the Sanctuary of Shiloh. After Shiloh was destroyed, there were no restrictions until the Temple was built. However, once the <i>Shechinah</i> was revealed on Mount Moriah, the Jews were never allowed to offer their sacrifices at any other place.<br>Although Shiloh and the Temple were both considered \"the place God chose...,\" there is a difference between the two. God's choice of Shiloh was for the benefit of the Jewish people. He wanted to offer them a centralized place of worship. However, the physical place of the Sanctuary did not itself become holy for all time.<br>In contrast, God chose Jerusalem as an eternal resting place for the <i>Shechinah</i>. The Divine Presence united with the place itself. After Shiloh was destroyed, no vestige of its former holiness remained. However, Mount Moriah remains \"the gate to heaven\" even after the Temple has been destroyed. Hence, permission was never granted to sacrifice in other places. See <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 24, p. 80-85.</i><br>There is no Sanctuary for all generations<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The above prohibition extends beyond the offering of sacrifices and includes the actual construction of a sanctuary. <i>Megillah</i> 10a records the construction of such a sanctuary in Alexandria by Ono, the son of Shimon HaTzaddik.</i> except in Jerusalem and [specifically,] on Mt. Moriah,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The root of the name Moriah is the word <i>hora'ah</i>, meaning instruction. The Temple was the seat of the Sanhedrin, Israel's highest court and the source of instruction for the entire Jewish nation. Others associate it with the word <i>yirah</i>, meaning \"fear,\" for from this mountain, the fear of God radiated forth.</i> as [I Chronicles 22:1] states: \"And David declared: 'This is the House of the Lord, God, and this is the altar for the burnt offerings of Israel.'<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As the Rambam explains in Chapter 2, in addition to God's choice of the site for the Temple at large, He also specifically chose the site of the Altar.<br>To emphasize this concept, the verse quoted by the Rambam contains two clauses. The first clause describes the choice of the Temple's site and the second, the choice of the site of the Altar.</i> and [Psalms 132:14] states: \"This is My resting place forever.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam views these verses as more than a statement of Jerusalem's uniqueness. They also exclude the possibility of constructing other sanctuaries.</i>",
            "The [design of the] structure built by [King] Solomon is described explicitly in [the Book of] Kings.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings, chapter 6.</i> [In contrast, the design of] the Messianic Temple, though mentioned in [the Book of] Ezekiel, is not explicit or explained. Thus, the people [in the time] of Ezra built the Second Temple according to the structure of Solomon, [including] certain aspects which are explicitly stated in Ezekiel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The commentaries on the tractate of <i>Middot</i> contrast Ezekiel's vision and the structure of the Second Temple in <i>mishnayot</i> 2:5, 3:1, 4:2.</i>",
            "The followings elements are essential when constructing this House:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e. if they are lacking, we have not fulfilled the mitzvah of constructing a Sanctuary.</i><br>a) the Sanctuary,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The holy chamber containing the Golden Altar, the <i>Menorah</i>, and the table for the Showbread.</i><br>b) the Holy of Holies,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The inner chamber containing the Holy Ark.</i><br>c) preceding the Sanctuary, there should be a place called the Entrance Hall.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to a structure positioned before the Sanctuary.<br>The commentaries note that, in general, an equivalent to each of the structures of the Temple existed in the Sanctuary of the desert. Based on this principle, they question which structure in the Sanctuary corresponded to the Entrance Hall.</i><br>The three [together] are called the Temple.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Though the three represent various levels of holiness, they are on one rung of sanctity when compared to other areas (<i>Zevachim</i> 2a).<br>The commentaries note that Jeremiah  7:4  states: \"Trust not in lying words which say: 'The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord... ' The threefold repetition alludes to the fact that the three chambers mentioned above share an equal measure of holiness.</i><br>[In addition,] we must make another partition around the Temple, set off from it [slightly], resembling the curtains surrounding the courtyard of the [sanctuary in the] desert.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As described in Exodus, chapter 27.</i> Everything encompassed by this partition is similar to the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting and is called the Courtyard.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The commentaries explain that the root of the Hebrew term <i>azarah</i> is the word <i>ezra</i> meaning \"help.\" In the Temple Courtyard, the Jewish people call to God and He responds, granting them assistance.</i><br>The entire area is referred to as the <i>Mikdash</i>.",
            "The following utensils are required for the Sanctuary:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned in the explanation to Halachah 1, the Rambam considers the purpose of the construction of the Temple the erection of \"a house ...to offer sacrifices within.\" In this context, he views the fashioning of the Temple's utensils as an integral part of the mitzvah of building a sanctuary - for without them the sacrifices could not be offered. Thus, when enumerating the mitzvot, he considers the fashioning of the Sanctuary's utensils as part of the mitzvah to construct the Sanctuary and not as separate mitzvot in their own right.<br>As mentioned above, the Ramban, Nachmanides, disputes the Rambam's view and considers the revelation of Godliness as the primary intent of the Sanctuary's construction. He also disagrees with the Rambam in regard to the fashioning of the utensils and considers them as separate independent commands. See <i>Hasagot Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, Positive command 33.<br>There is a practicable application of the above concept. The Sanctuary could only be constructed during the daytime, (see Halachah 17). If the fashioning of the Sanctuary's utensils is to be considered as part of the mitzvah of constructing the Temple, that ruling may apply to them as well (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 21, p. 255).</i><br>a) an altar for the burnt offering and other sacrifices;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Torah also refers to the outer altar as \"the altar of the burnt offering\" (Exodus 30:28, 35:16) for that was the most frequent sacrifice, offered twice daily.</i><br>b) a ramp to ascend to the altar. It was positioned before the Entrance Hall to the south.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Halachah 17.</i><br>c) a wash basin<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A large basin, with 12 taps. (<i>Yoma</i> 37a)</i> with a pedestal where the priests would sanctify their hands and feet for the (Temple) service.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Before taking part in any aspect of the Temple service, the priests had to wash their hands and feet. See <i>Hilchot Biat HaMikdash</i> 5:1.</i> It was positioned between the Entrance Hall and the altar, to the left when entering the Sanctuary.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The entrance to the Sanctuary was from the east, facing the Holy of Holies which was in the west.</i><br>d) the altar for the incense offering,<br>e) the <i>Menorah</i>, and<br>f) the table [for the showbread].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These sacred objects are discussed in detail in Chapter Two.</i><br>The [latter] three were placed within the Sanctuary, before the Holy of Holies.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Exodus 26:35.<br>The commentaries have asked why the Rambam does not consider the ark as one of the essential vessels of the Sanctuary. The commentary to Chapter 4, Halachah 1, addresses that issue.</i>",
            "The <i>Menorah</i> was in the south, to the left as one entered. The Table was to the right.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Menorah</i> was the source of spiritual inspiration, the Table of material wealth. Because of the position of these objects, our Sages declared (<i>Bava Batra</i> 25b): He who desires to become wise should face south (while praying). He who desires to become wealthy should face north.</i> The Showbread was placed upon it. Both of them were close to the Holy of Holies on the outside. The incense altar was positioned between these two, towards the outside.<br>Divisions are to be made within the Temple Courtyard to [indicate] the point to which the Israelites may proceed;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Middot</i> 2:6. There were steps dividing between the area set aside for Israelites and the area set aside for priests. An Israelite was not permitted to proceed beyond these steps, except:<br>a) to perform <i>semichah</i>, the placing of hands on an animal brought as a sacrifice. See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i>, ch. 3.<br>b) to recite confessional prayers, <i>Vidui</i>.<br>c) to slaughter an animal brought as a sacrifice,<br>d) to perform <i>Tenufah</i>, the waving of the peace offerings (<i>Kellim</i> 1:8. See also Chapter 7, Halachah 19, <i>Tifferet Yisrael, Middot</i> 2:6.)</i> the point to which the priests, [who were not able to participate in the Temple service,] may proceed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 7, Halachah 20.</i><br>[Also,] within it, we must build structures for the various necessities of the Sanctuary. These structures were called chambers.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chapter 5, Halachah 17.</i>",
            "When we build the Temple and the courtyard, we must use large stones. If stones cannot be found, we may build with bricks.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On the verse (Exodus 20:22 : \"If you shall build an altar of stone...,\" the <i>Mechilta</i> comments: \"If you desire [to build it from] stone, you may. If you desire from bricks, you may.\"</i><br>We may not split the stones used for the building on the Temple Mount.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Regarding the altar, the Torah declares (ibid.): \"Do not build it out of hewn stone. By lifting your sword against it, you will have profaned it.\" The Sages (<i>Middot</i> 3:4) explained that iron shortens man's life, and the altar prolongs it. Therefore, iron should not be used to build the Temple. As above, the Rambam draws a parallel between the altar and the entire sanctuary.<br><i>Sotah</i> 48b quotes the two abovementioned verses and records a debate among the Sages how to resolve the apparent contradiction between them. The Rambam quotes the opinion of Rabbi Nechemiah who resolves the discrepancy by explaining that the stones were hewn outside the Temple premises and then, brought in.<br>In contrast, Rabbi Yehudah explained that King Solomon employed a unique wormlike creature, the <i>Shamir</i>, which had the power to eat through stone. The Temple's builders drew lines on the stone and then placed the <i>Shamir</i> upon them. The tiny creature ate through the rock, leaving the stones finely hewn without using iron.<br>According to most opinions, when the First Temple was destroyed, this unique species was lost, and it was impossible to build the Second Temple in this miraculous manner. Nevertheless, the stones were not hewn on the Temple Mount itself.</i> Rather, we must split and chisel them outside, and [afterwards,] bring them in,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, at least, \"in the House,\" on the Temple premises, no iron tool was used.</i> as it is said (I Kings 5:31 : \"And they brought great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the House with hewn stone.\" Furthermore, it is said (<i>ibid.</i> 6:7): \"Neither hammer, nor axe, nor any tool of iron was heard in the House while it was being built.\"",
            "We must not build with any wood protruding at all,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tamid</i> 28b relates that this prohibition was enacted as a safeguard for the Scriptural commandment (Deuteronomy 16:21 : \"Do not plant an <i>Asherah</i> or any other tree near the altar that you shall make for the Lord.\" Though that prohibition only refers to a tree that grows in the ground and not to wood used for building purposes, the Sages instituted this measure as a \"fence around the Torah.\"<br>Wood could be used for the substructure of the building. Indeed, I Kings 6:10 relates how Solomon used cedar trees for that purpose. However, they could not be used for the exterior surface of the building.</i> only stone, bricks, or cement.<br>[Similarly,] we must not make wooden chambers in the courtyard. Rather, [they were made] of stone or of brick. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad objects to this Halachah, noting that there were wooden structures on the Temple Mount. The High Priest's chamber was lined with wood. In addition, wooden balconies were built in the Women Courtyard on Sukkot to allow the women to observe the <i>Simchat Beit Hashoevah</i> celebrations. Thus, he concludes that the prohibition against building with any protruding wood applies only within within the Temple courtyard, from the area set off for the priests and beyond, and not elsewhere on the Temple Mount. Only that region could be described as \"near the altar [of God].\" Rav Yosef Corcus explains that the wooden balconies were not permanent structures. Hence, they were permitted.</i>",
            "Costly stones were laid on the floor of the entire courtyard.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the verse from I Kings quoted in Halachah 8.<br>The Torah (Leviticus 26:1 , commands, \"Do not make a stone pavement in your land to bow down upon it.\" The commentaries explain that this prohibition was ordained so that the Jews would refrain from making a copy of the Temple services outside of Jerusalem.<br>Nevertheless, according to strict Torah law, it was not necessary to lay a stone floor for the Temple courtyard. <i>Zevachim</i> 24a relates that in preparation for the construction of the Temple, King David sanctified the very ground of the Temple Courtyard.</i><br>Stones which were uprooted [from their fixture] are invalidated, even though they remained in place, since they were impaired. [Thus,] a priest is forbidden to stand upon them during the [Temple] service until they become fixed in the ground [again.]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Sages explained that it was not respectful to take part in the Temple services while standing on such a stone. Nevertheless, if a priest disobeyed this prohibition and did stand on such a stone, his service was not invalidated.<br>The logic of that decision can be explained as follows: There is a principle in Jewish law that a particular substance is not considered as interposing between one object and another if it and the object beneath it are of the same type. Thus, since the stone and the earth below it are considered to be of the same substance, the stone is not considered an interruption. Since, as mentioned above, the ground itself was sanctified by King David, the priest's service is not invalidated.</i>",
            "The most preferable way to fulfill the mitzvah is by strengthening the building and raising it [to the utmost degree] within the potential of the community, as [implied by Ezra 9:9]: \"to exalt the House of our Lord.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shabbat</i> 11a interprets this verse in a very literal sense, explaining that a synagogue must be the tallest building in a city.</i><br>They must make it beautiful and attractive according to their potential.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Herod slaughtered many Sages. <i>Bava Batra</i> 4a explains that the Sages advised him to expiate a certain measure of his sin by rebuilding the Temple and making it attractive. The Talmud declares: \"Whoever has not seen Herod's building has not seen an attractive building in his life.\"</i> If possible, it is a mitzvah to plate it with gold and to magnify all of its aspects.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, <i>Pesachim</i> 57a relates that the Temple was covered with gold plates the thickness of a golden coin.</i>",
            "We must not build the Temple at night, as [Numbers 9:15] states: \"on the day in which the Sanctuary was raised up.\" [Our Sages<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sh'vuot</i> 15b.</i> interpret this phrase as implying:] We may raise it up by day and not by night.<br>We must be involved with its building from dawn until the appearance of the stars.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Generally, employees are not obligated to begin their work until the sun appears.

God fused them all into a single stone and the unified rock was embedded in the very foundation of the earth. That stone was referred to as <i>Even HaShtiah</i>, (see also Chapter 4, Halachah 1) \"the foundation stone.\" It was located in the Holy of Holies.<br>Thus, Abraham's altar was apparently not built on the site of the altar to be built by his descendants, but rather, at the ultimate location of the Holy of Holies. However, this difficulty can be resolved. Jacob \"took from the stones,\" and moved them from their original place, the Altar's future site, to a different location, that of the Holy of Holies.</i> and in Chronicles (II 3:1), it is said: \"Then, Solomon began to build the House of the Lord in Jerusalem, on Mt.

That choice was clearly expressed in the previous Halachah which states: \"the place of the Altar is extremely exact... as it is said: 'This is the altar for the burnt offerings of Israel.'<br>As such, it can be explained that the Rambam does not recount the various historical events mentioned in this Halachah just to bring further proof of the holiness of the Altar's site. That is unnecessary. Rather, he wanted to demonstrate that many righteous men were aware of the uniqueness of the Altar's site through prophetic vision, and for this reason, they made efforts to offer their sacrifices there.<br>Why does the Rambam relate all these historical events? As he clearly states in his introduction to the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, his goal is not to summarize the Talmud's teachings regarding a particular subject, but to describe how to carry out the various mitzvot. These historical facts do not seem to facilitate his objective.<br>The need for these additions may be explained by comparison to the Rambam's decisions regarding the right to the monarchy. In that context, the Rambam writes that although God chose David and his descendants as kings and endowed them with the monarchy forever, there was a Halachic legitimacy to the establishment of the Kingdom of Israel (the ten tribes). Since the first king, Jereboam, was appointed by a prophet, his regal power must be recognized. (<i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 1:7,8).<br>It could be inferred that a similar ruling might apply in regard to the altar: i.e. the Altar on Mount Moriah would remain holy forever, however, another altar of similar status could also be established. In order to eliminate that presumption, the Rambam presents a number of examples, illustrating that throughout the generations, from the time of Adam, the prophets had tried to bring sacrifices on this site alone. These efforts clearly imply that there is not, nor will there be, another place with a similar degree of holiness (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 19, p.140-7).</i> as our Sages said: \"Man was created from the place where he [would find] atonement.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This statement is somewhat problematic. Though the Rambam's statements have a basis in the Midrash (<i>Bereishit Rabbah</i> 14:8), according to <i>Sanhedrin</i> 38b, Adam appears to have been created in the Garden of Eden, a considerable distance from this location. Generally, when a conflict arises between sources, the decision is based upon the Babylonian Talmud. Hence, one might ask why the Rambam favored the other sources in this case.</i>",

In analyzing this account, the <i>Chatam Sofer</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i>, Responsum 336) explained that this must have referred to the Pascal sacrifice, which could be offered in a state of ritual impurity and yet, did not have to be purchased with communal funds.<br>Among the reasons the commentaries have given why such a sacrifice could not be offered is that we are lacking an Altar with its proper size and dimensions.

The priests were thus prevented from placing the limbs directly on the fire and were required to toss them.<br><i>Zevachim</i> 62b explains the necessity to toss the limbs, as follows: The Torah draws an analogy between the flesh of an offering and its blood, as it is written (Deuteronomy 12:27 : \"You shall sacrifice your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood.\" The blood must be tossed on the Altar, as it is written (Leviticus 1:5 : \"And they shall toss the blood on the Altar.\" Hence, the limbs must also reach the pyre in that fashion.<br>See also <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 6:4.</i><br>The height of the ramp was nine cubits minus a sixth of a cubit.

However, if there are no severe factors to invalidate the sacrifice, it would appear disrespectful to dispose of the sacrifice in that manner. Rather, the sacrifice is left overnight - an act which obligates a sacrifice to be removed and burnt - and disposed of the next morning (Rashi, <i>loc. cit.</i>.).<br>A woman who gave birth was obligated to bring a bird as a sin offering.

This table was useful on such occasions.<br>Though generally an effort was made to use precious metals in the Temple, this table was made of marble.

He shall make it with a talent of pure gold; all these vessels.\"<br>The Hebrew word <i>keilim</i>, translated as \"vessels,\" may also be translated as \"utensils.\" Thus, one might conclude that the <i>Menorah's</i> utensils must also be fashioned by hammering out the same block of gold and hence, are to be permanent parts of the <i>Menorah</i>. Indeed, Nachmanides appears to have understood the meaning of the verses in that manner. However, <i>Menachot</i> 88b explains that here the term <i>keilim</i> refers only to the lamps, and not to the other utensils.</i><br>The verse does not state: \"its lamps shall be of pure gold,\" for the lamps<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The receptacles in which the oil and wicks were placed.</i> were permanently fixed in the <i>Menorah</i>, and were included in the talent [of gold from which the <i>Menorah</i> was fashioned].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Menachot, op. cit.</i> records that this statement was the subject of a debate among the Sages.

Thus, a unique process was employed in their kindling. It was deemed disrespectful to kindle the <i>Menorah</i> from fire that was not sacred. The lamp of the central shaft was to be lit only from the fire of the Altar. All other lamps would be kindled from it or from each other. Since the lamps themselves were permanently affixed in the <i>Menorah</i>, the priests kindled them by extending their wicks with the tweezers until they reached a lamp that was burning. They would then light the wicks and return them to their own lamps. (<i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 3:13-14).<br>It was necessary that every lamp be on a separate branch. If two lamps were made on the same branch, the <i>Menorah</i> was invalid.</i>",

Nevertheless, it was given that name because it faced the Holy of Holies, which was situated in the west. The Rambam's decision follows the opinion of Rabbi Eliezar ben Shimon, who maintains that the <i>Menorah's</i> lamps spread across the width of the Sanctuary. Accordingly, there is no one lamp whose position clearly identified it as \"the western lamp.\"<br><i>Menachot</i> also mentions that Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi did not accept this opinion and maintained that the <i>Menorah</i> was positioned along the length of the Sanctuary, from east to west. Thus, there was one lamp that was \"westernmost.\"<br>Halachah is usually based on Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi's opinion. Nevertheless, the Rambam favored Rabbi Eliezer's opinion, because there is a verse from the Torah that appears to support it. Leviticus 24:3 states: \"Aharon shall prepare [the lights] continuously before the Lord,\" implying that before kindling the <i>Menorah</i>, it was necessary to prepare the wick to point \"before the Lord\" (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). This difference of opinion was preserved over the generations and many later authorities accepted the view that the lamps of the <i>Menorah</i> extended from east to west.<br><i>Shabbat</i> 22a relates that the western lamp was \"testimony to the entire world that the <i>Shechinah</i> rests in Israel.\" Each day, the western lamp was the first lamp kindled. Exactly the same measure of oil was placed in it as in the other lamps, yet it was always the last to burn out.

A goblet serves two functions: it enables the collection of liquids, and offers the opportunity of pouring the liquids where desired. Thus, the goblets are symbolic of the Heavenly spheres, which receive influence from Heavenly sources and convey it to our lowly world.<br>The main purpose of the <i>Menorah</i> was to shed light on the world.

With the statement, \"[The mechanism] was not sacred and thus, the water remaining in it did not become invalid,\" the Rambam seems to imply that the mechanism itself contained water, but the water did not become disqualified, because the mechanism, unlike the washbasin itself, was not a sacred vessel. This would seem to contradict the Talmudic passages which describe the mechanism as a crane.<br>This difficulty is further magnified by the fact that in <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 5:14, the Rambam himself writes that each night, the washbasin was submerged in a natural reservoir of water and raised again the next morning.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains the Rambam's statements as follows: These Talmudic passages use the expression <i>muchani</i> to refer to the mechanism. Though that expression can be rendered as a pulley-operated crane, as above, it can also be explained as a circular reservoir for water, into which the washbasin was placed. This explanation resolves the contradiction between the Rambam and the Talmud. However, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> is also puzzled by the seeming contradiction in the Rambam's own words.<br>The <i>Tosefot Yom Tov</i> (<i>Tamid</i> 1:4) quotes the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Tamid</i> 3:8). It explains that the \"mechanism\" was a vessel of water which would be raised each morning and submerged each evening by a pulley-operated crane. It would be placed over the washbasin to keep it filled with water.<br>The <i>Tzurat Habayit</i> maintains that throughout the ages, various techniques were devised to solve the problem of the water which remained overnight in the washbasin. The Mishnah (<i>Eruvin</i> 10:14) relates that pulley-operated cranes were used to draw water during the days of the prophets. Thus, it was likely that a similar technique was employed for the washbasin. Since ben Katin lived in the later years of the Second Temple, it is likely to suppose that his mechanism was more sophisticated.</i>"

You will no [longer] carry it on your shoulders. Now, serve the Lord, your God.'<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The entombment of the Ark is the subject of a debate among the Sages in the Talmud (<i>Yoma</i> 53b) and the <i>Tosafta</i> (<i>Sotah</i> 13:2). Although some Sages agree that the Ark was entombed as explained above, others maintain that it was one of the sacred articles plundered by the Babylonian conquerors. A third opinion agrees that it was entombed, but argues that it was entombed under the Chamber of Wood in the Woman's Courtyard and not under the Holy of Holies.</i><br>When it was entombed, Aharon's staff, the vial of manna, and the oil used for anointing were entombed with it. All these [sacred articles] did not return in the Second Temple.<br>Similarly, the <i>Urim V'Tumim</i> that existed in the Second Temple did not answer with <i>Ruach HaKodesh</i> (Divine inspiration)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yoma</i> 73b and the commentaries (Nachmanides and Rabbenu Bachai on Numbers 28:21  explain that the <i>Urim V'Tumim</i> were consulted as oracles by the High Priest. They provided guidance on all important questions involving the people as a whole. See the conclusion of <i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i> for a discussion of this issue.</i> and questions were not asked of them, as stated [in Ezra 2:63]: \"until a priest will arise with the <i>Urim V'Tumim</i>.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yoma</i> 21b mentions the <i>Urim V'Tumim</i> as one of the five miraculous aspects of the First Temple service, which were lacking in the Second Temple. The Rambam quotes that statement in <i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i> 10:10.<br>Nevertheless, they were not completely lacking. Exodus 28:43 commands the priests to wear all of the garments prescribed for them during their service in the Sanctuary. If even one garment was lacking, they would be punished by death. Thus, the High Priest had to wear the breastplate with the stones, the <i>Urim V'Tumim</i>. Otherwise, he would lack one of the eight garments he was required to wear. The Rambam explains that although the stones were embedded in the breastplate in the Second Temple as well, they lacked the spiritual dimension that they had possessed in the First Temple.</i> [In the Second Temple,] they only made them to fulfill the requirement of eight garments for the High Priest.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These garments are described in Exodus, Chapter 28, and in <i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash</i>, ch. 8.</i> Thus, the High Priest would not lack one of the required garments.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad does not accept the Rambam's statements concerning the <i>Urim V'Tumim</i>. He interprets the <i>Urim V'Tumim</i> as being mystical names of God engraved on the breastplate, rather than the stones themselves.<br>In his <i>Chiddushim</i>, Rav Yaakov Emden questions the reason for including this Halachah: \"On the surface, there is apparently no practical relevance to these matters in our behavior....The Rambam generally does not include aspects which have neither Halachic nor ethical significance in this text.\" Why then is it important for us to know whether or not the ark was entombed and where it was entombed?<br>Rav Emden then explains the question he posed, based on the Rambam's statements in Chapter 6. There, the Rambam stated that after the exile, the sanctity of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> was nullified regarding the laws of the Sabbatical year, the tithes, and certain other agricultural rulings. However, the holiness of Jerusalem and the Temple Mount always remained intact because:<br>The holiness of the Temple and Jerusalem comes about because of the <i>Shechinah</i>, and the <i>Shechinah</i> can never be nullified. Behold, God declared (Leviticus 27:31 : \"I shall destroy your Sanctuaries.\" and the Sages commented (<i>Megillah</i> 28a): \"Even though they are destroyed, their holiness remains intact. \"<br>The <i>Shechinah's</i> resting place was the Ark. Therefore, had the Ark not been \"entombed...in deep, maze-like vaults,\" on the Temple Mount, the sanctity of that site would also have been nullified. See also <i>Chatam Sofer, Chullin</i> 7a.<br><i>Likkutei Sichot</i> (Vol. 21, p. 156-160) also discusses the same question. It explains that the Ark is a fundamental element of the Temple and the Temple building cannot be complete without it.<br>Therefore, from the very beginning of the Temple's construction, the Ark had two locations:<br>a) the place for the ark in the Holy of Holies,<br>b) the hidden vault where the Ark would be kept in the event of the Temple's destruction.<br>On this basis, we can see the Sanctuary built by Moses, the two Temples in Jerusalem, and the Messianic Temple, as unified by one essential bond. Since the same Ark was present in all previous structures and they will be revealed again in the Messianic age, all four buildings share the same essence.</i>",
            "The First Temple had a one-cubit thick wall which separated the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As the Rambam states in the conclusion of the halachah, a divider was necessary between the sanctity of the Holy of Holies and the Sanctuary. In the Tabernacle in the desert, a curtain, the <i>parochet</i>, alone served this function. In the First Temple, a wall was also built in addition to the curtain.</i> When the Second Temple was constructed, they were unsure whether the width of that wall was included in the measure of the Sanctuary or the Holy of Holies.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Kings 6:2 states: \"And the length of the Temple Solomon built was 60 cubits.\" The narrative continues (<i>ibid.</i>:17, 20): \"The Sanctuary was 40 cubits long...and the space for the ark was 20 cubits long.\" Since the combined length of both chambers was only 60 cubits, the width of the wall had to be included in the measure of one of the chambers. However, it was not clear from which chamber it should be built (Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Kelayim</i> 8:4; see also <i>Yoma</i> 52a for a slightly different explanation).</i> Therefore, the Holy of Holies was made a full twenty cubits long, and the Sanctuary a full forty cubits long, and one additional cubit was left between the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Marginita D'Rabbi Meir</i> asks why the builders of the Second Temple were willing to add an extra cubit between the two chambers, when they hesitated to increase the width of the dividing wall. In resolution, it is explained that originally the eastern wall built by Solomon was seven cubits thick, while in the Second Temple, it was only six cubits thick. Thus, there was no change in the total length of the Temple building.</i><br>They did not build a wall in the Second Temple.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bava Batra</i> 3a,b explains that they did not build a wall because the Second Temple was higher than the First. The First Temple was only 30 cubits high. The Second Temple was 100 cubits high. A wall only a cubit thick would not be sturdy if built to such a height. Nevertheless, the width of the wall was not increased, because its original width was established by <i>Ruach HaKodesh</i>, Divine revelation. Thus, they returned to the pattern established in the Sanctuary of Moses and utilized curtains as dividers.</i> Rather, they hung two curtains, one from the side of the Sanctuary and one from the side of the Holy of Holies, with a cubit between them<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yoma</i> 52b relates that the external curtain had an opening on the south and the inner curtain had an opening on the north. Thus, to enter the Holy of Holies, the High Priest had to go through the entire width of the Temple between the two curtains.</i> in place of the width of the wall of the First [Temple].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Yoma</i>, ibid.) asks why they were not able to resolve their dilemma by hanging one curtain, a cubit in width.<br>In response, the commentary states that both curtains were necessary because the verse quoted above, \"the curtain shall divide...\" clearly implies that the sanctity of the Holy of Holies begins with the outer surface of the curtain. Thus, based on the possibility that the wall of the First Temple was included within the 20 cubits of the Holy of Holies, an additional cubit would have been included in this sacred area if only one curtain was used. From this perspective, the inner curtain had to be a distinct entity, marking the beginning of the most sacred chamber.<br>Conversely, based on the view that the wall had been included in the measure of the Sanctuary and that the wall and the Holy of Holies encompassed 21 cubits, a thick curtain would have been unnecessary, since the outer curtain was located where the division was required to be made.</i> However, in the First Temple, there was only one curtain,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the expression \"First Temple\" refers to the Sanctuary, for the First Temple itself had a wall rather than a curtain. However, Rav Yaakov Emden disputes this issue, quoting <i>Yoma</i> 54a which brings a number of <i>Aggadot</i> concerning the Ark and the curtain in the First Temple. The Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Middot</i> 4:7) specifically states that there was a curtain in addition to the wall in the First Temple.</i> as [Exodus 26:33] states: \"The curtain will divide for you [between the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies.]\"",

The Entrance Hall and its adjoining chambers were 100 cubits wide. However, the Entrance Hall was only eleven cubits long. The remaining 89 cubits of the Temple's length were only 70 cubits in width. The Mishnah states, \"from north to south there were 70 cubits\" and lists the division of that area. Afterwards, it concludes: \"The Entrance Hall extended fifteen cubits to the north and fifteen cubits to the south...\" implying, according to these authorities, that there were two measurements of the Temple's width, one including the Entrance Hall and one without it.<br>In contrast, the Rambam conceived of the Temple as being shaped like a trapezoid. See the accompanying drawing taken from his Commentary to the Mishnah. See also Halachah 9.<br>At its easternmost point, the Entrance Hall, it was 100 cubits wide. However, that width was slightly diminished as one proceeded westward, so that it would be \"lion-shaped.\" His opinion is reinforced by the opening statement of Mishnah 4:6, which declares: \"The Temple was 100 cubits by 100 cubits and 100 cubits tall,\" implying that it was shaped like a cube, except for the slight reduction of its width towards the rear.</i><br>The Sanctuary had six walls, one within the other, with five vacant places between them:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The abovementioned Mishnah reads:<br>The wall of the winding stairwell, five; the winding stairwell, three; the wall of the cell, five; the cell, six; the wall of the Sanctuary, six; the [Sanctuary's] enclosed area, twenty; the wall of the Sanctuary, six; the cell, six; the wall of the cell, six; the drainage chamber, three; and the [outer] wall, five.<br>Again, the Rambam explains that the walls mentioned by the Mishnah were not solid, but rather, each was a cubit thick, with a hollow space in between.

There was a projection of six cubits [the projection mentioned in the verse.] The middle one was six cubits, and there was an additional projection of seven cubits. The upper one was seven cubits wide.<br>The Rambam's diagrams show a straight outer wall of the Temple, and balconies which diminish in length on their outer side (in contrast to the explanation offered by the <i>Tosafot Yom Tov</i>).<br>The balconies in the Rambam's drawings were built as a protective measure, to insure that the priests show proper respect for the Temple and do not lean against its walls.</i><br>Similarly, [there were projections] from bottom to top, around the wall of the Entrance Hall. The [pattern] was as follows:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These projections also are the subject of a difference in opinion between Rashi and the Rambam. The source for the debate is the interpretation of <i>Middot</i> 3:6 which states:<br>There were 22 cubits between the Entrance Hall and the Altar. There were twelve steps there. Each step was half a cubit high and one cubit wide.<br>A cubit, a cubit; and a protrusion of three; a cubit, a cubit, and a protrusion of three; on the highest level, a cubit, a cubit, and a protrusion of four.<br>Rashi interprets the entire mishnah as referring to the steps leading to the Entrance Hall. In order to fill the space between the Altar and the Entrance Hall, platforms were inserted into the steps. Thus, there were three empty cubits before the first step, a step, a step, and a platform of three, etc. until one reached the Entrance Hall.<br>Rav Kapach's translation of the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah sees the mishnah as referring to two separate subjects, the steps which had been mentioned previously and protrusions which he describes as follows:<br>Afterwards, [the mishnah] states that the wall of the Entrance Hall was built in the following pattern. A cubit long portion of the wall was left vacant as all the other walls...Above it there was a structure protruding from the wall, three cubits high... called a projection. Similarly, the entire height [of the wall] ...had one cubit of [vacant] wall space, a projection of three cubits... until the uppermost projection, which was four cubits high.<br>Note the accompanying drawing copied from Rav Kapach's edition of the Commentary to the Mishnah. Rather than picture the front wall of the Temple as a flat structure, the Rambam depicts it as being covered with these projections.</i><br>one vacant cubit,<br>a projection of three cubits,<br>one vacant cubit, and then,<br>a projection of three cubits.<br>This pattern was followed until the top [of the wall.] Thus, the projections surrounded the walls.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">All four walls of the Temple were covered with projections to prevent the priests from leaning against them.</i> Each projection<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Extending out from the front facade.</i> was three cubits wide until the top [of the wall], and between each projection was a [vacant] cubit. The uppermost projection was four cubits wide.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the accompanying diagram for an artist's conception of the Temple's front facade.</i>",
            "All the vacant spaces between the walls are called cells.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned in the commentary on Halachot 4 and 5, the Rambam has a different conception of the cells than the other commentaries.<br><i>Middot</i> 4:3 states:<br>There were 38 cells: five in the north, five in the south, and eight in the west. In the north and in the south, there were five above five, with five above them. In the west, there were three above three, with two above them.<br><i>Middot</i> 4:7 states:<br>The wall of the winding stairwell, five; the winding stairwell, three; the wall of the cell, five; the cell, six; the wall of the Sanctuary, six; the [Sanctuary's] enclosed area, twenty; the wall of the Sanctuary, six; the cell, six; the wall of the cell, six; the drainage chamber, three; and the [outer] wall, five.<br>Rashi and the Ra'avad explain the two mishnayot simply: The chamber referred to as \"the cell\" in mishnah 4:7 was, in fact, divided lengthwise into five cells on the northern and southern sides of the Temple, with three cells on the western side. All the other specific dimensions mentioned by the mishnah can thus be understood without any difficulty.<br>In contrast, the Rambam explains that the walls mentioned in the mishnah 4:7 were not solid, but rather, double walls, each a cubit in thickness, and with a hollow space in between. The five cells mentioned in 4:3 thus, refer to the five vacant spaces between the walls. These spaces extended the entire length of the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies on the northern and southern sides, and the three cells extended to the three vacant spaces between the walls on the western side.<br>Note the accompanying drawings copied from Rav Kapach's edition of the Commentary to the Mishnah. The three divisions must be seen as being placed one on top of the other.</i> Thus, five cells surrounded the Sanctuary on the north, five on the south, and three on the west.<br>There were three levels [of cells,] one level above the other.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The lowest level was six cubits high, equal to the height of the Temple's base. The other two levels were each twenty cubits high. As the Rambam states in Halachah 12, the roof of the cells was on the same level as the upper storey of the Sanctuary.</i> Thus, there were fifteen cells on the south; five above five, with five above them. Similarly, in the north, there were fifteen cells.<br>There were eight cells in the west; three above three, with two above them on one level.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The addition of the words \"on one level\" is necessary. Since the pattern of cells differed in the west, one might think that rather than have only three levels as in the north and south, the mishnah's words \"two above them\" could be interpreted as follows: There were four levels of cells, the latter two each possessing one cell. With this addition, the Rambam prevents this misconception from arising.</i> Thus, there were a total of 38 cells.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They were used for storage.</i>",
            "Each cell had three entrances: one to the cell on the right, another to the cell on the left,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The source for this Halachah is <i>Middot</i> 4:7. The Rambam's interpretation again differs from that of Rashi.<br>Rashi would interpret right and left as lengthwise in the row of cells.

The Rambam cannot contradict an explicit mishnah, yet his interpretation of the mishnah's text is by no means straightforward.<br>According to the Rambam, this cell is positioned above the cell called \"the winding stairwell.\" Though it is not the northernmost cell, it is still referred to as \"the cell in the northeast corner.\"</i> one to the cell on its right,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To the northernmost cell, the cell over \"the wall of the winding stairwell.\"</i> one to the cell above it,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the third storey of cells.</i> one to the winding stairwell,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The cell below it.</i> one towards the cell with the wicket,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">\"Towards,\" but not \"to.\" The cell did not possess an entrance to the cell with the wicket, the latter being the second of the cells and the cell in question being the fourth.</i> and one to the Temple.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here, the word Temple is being used loosely. It does not refer to the Sanctuary itself, but to the Entrance Hall. Nevertheless, the latter can also be called the Sanctuary as evidenced by the Rambam's statements in Chapter 1, Halachah 5.<br>Furthermore, there is an additional problem: The mishnah appeared to intend to single out this cell by the fact that it had five entrances. However, according to the Rambam's interpretation, the cell with the wicket also possessed five entrances: One to the Sanctuary, one to the Entrance Hall, one to the cell above it, one to the cell below it, and one to the cell on its right.</i>",

            "Mount Moriah, the Temple Mount, measured 500 cubits by 500 cubits.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The commentaries, basing themselves on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Eruvin</i> 2:5), explain that this figure was derived as follows:<br>Exodus 27:18 states: 'The length of the courtyard shall be 100 cubits and its width, 50 by 50.' This verse can obviously not be understood literally, for area has only two coordinates. Hence, the Sages explained that rather than refer to the courtyard of the Tabernacle, the verse describes a measure related to the future Sanctuaries. The Temple Mount measured a total of 50 x 100 x 50 cubits in area, i.e., a total of 250,000 sq. cubits.<br>The <i>Piskei Tosafot</i> (<i>Middot</i> 5) relate that the total area of the Temple Mount was greater than 250,000 sq. cubits. However, only the latter figure was consecrated.</i> It was surrounded by a wall.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With the exception of the wall on the eastern side, the walls on all sides were very high.

Even thought the corpse is buried, ritual impurity can be contracted unless there is a vacant space between the corpse and the earth above it. To prevent the possibility of impurity from a grave under the Temple courtyard, the entire earth below was hollowed out. See <i>Parah</i> 3:3.</i> Arches above arches were built underneath [for support].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Though the Mishnah (<i>Parah, loc. cit.</i>) states that the earth beneath the Temple was hollowed out, it does not mention the construction of arches. However, since the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>:6) states that arches supported the ramp leading from the Temple Mount to the Mount of Olives, we may assume that a similar technique was used in the instance (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).

This gate was used when someone was forced to leave the Temple, but he did not want to publicize the circumstances (<i>Middot</i> 1:9, 2:2). Its construction differed from that of the other gates. Rather than have an ordinary lintel, it had two stones leaning against each other (<i>ibid.</i>:3).</i> and two from the south.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These were the gates most frequently used to enter the Temple Mount. They were named after the prophetess Chuldah. In the time of the First Temple, she stood before these gates and urged the people to repent.<br>The tractate <i>Sofrim</i> 19:12 relates that there were two additional gates to the Temple Mount: one for mourners and one for grooms. The Jewish people would sit between these two gates waiting to console the mourners and join in the celebration of the grooms. The <i>Kaftor ViPerach</i> states that these gates were on the east, to the north of the gate of Shushan. They were called the 'gates of mercy.' Today, the term is used to refer to the two gates on the east side of the Temple Mount, which can be seen from the Mount of Olives and are permanently shut.</i> Each gate was 10 cubits [wide] and twenty cubits high.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This was the standard size of the gates in the Temple complex.</i> [Each gate] had doors.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In contrast to the gateway to the Entrance Hall, which had no doors.</i>",

Therefore, it was made 10 handbreadths high. The Temple Mount was surrounded by a wall and, therefore, could not be considered a public domain. Nonetheless, its size exceeded the limits placed by the Sages, and without this partition, there would have been a Rabbinic prohibition against carrying on the Sabbath.<br>The <i>Tosafot Yom Tov</i> (<i>Middot</i> 2:3) objects to this reasoning, explaining that the Rabbinic prohibitions regarding the Sabbath were generally relaxed within the Temple premises.

In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Middot</i> 1:4), the Rambam describes the <i>Chayl</i> as a rampart. He, therefore, interprets this statement as referring to its height. In contrast, Rav Ovadiah of Bartinura does not define the <i>Chayl</i> as a wall. Rather, he refers to it as an empty space, 10 cubits wide.</i> It is referred to in the [Book of] Lamentations [2:6]: 'The wall and the rampart mourned.'

Abba Yossi ben Chanan declared: [These were instituted] because of the thirteen gates...<br>It is difficult to conceive that the Mishnah would contradict itself within the same tractate. The apparent discrepancies can be explained as follows: The Sages do not disagree about the number of entrances to the Temple Courtyard. They did, however, debate the question of which entrance met the legal criteria for a gate. Guards were required to stand watch over every entrance that was considered a gate.<br>Similarly, although a person who is ritually impure may not enter the Temple premises, it is not clear whether he would be obligated to bring a sin offering if he came in through an entrance which is not considered a gate.

After other measures failed, the crew members decided to jettison some of the ship's cargo to reduce its weight. Immediately, they tossed one of the heavy bronzed gates to the waves.<br>The danger did not cease, and the crew wanted to cast the second gate overboard as well. Hearing this, Nicanor protested and declared that he would have to be thrown into the sea before the gate. Directly after he made that statement, the storm subsided and the ship was able to proceed.<br>Throughout the remainder of the journey, Nicanor was overcome with remorse. Why, he thought, hadn't he defended the first gate as well? How great was his joy when the ship docked at Acre and the gate emerged from under its hull.<br>When the financial situation of the Jewish people improved, they replaced all the Temple's bronze gates with gold-covered gates.

Should they open up to the outside, they are not sacred. According to the Rambam's diagram, the two southern chambers of the Chamber of the Hearth faced the Temple Courtyard, while the two northern chambers faced the <i>chayl</i>.

If the wall is higher than the Courtyard, it is not considered consecrated.<br>The following explanation may be offered for the decision rendered by the Rambam: Rashi (<i>Pesachim, loc. cit.</i>) relates that the <i>chayl</i> was the major wall around the inner Temple complex and the wall of the Courtyard itself was not high. Since the Temple was built on an incline, it was possible that the latter wall would be on the same level as the floor of the Courtyard, even though the Courtyard wall was raised above the ground in front of it.<br>However, the Rambam himself definitely cannot accept such an interpretation. He already stated (Chapter 5, Halachah 3) that the <i>chayl</i> was only 10 cubits high. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that it would be the major wall surrounding the inner Temple complex. That likelihood is further reduced by the fact that the <i>chayl</i> was set off from the Temple Courtyard by a considerable distance, especially on the northern and southern sides. See also <i>Tosefot Yom Tov</i>, <i>Middot</i> 2:3.<br>The above three halachot also apply to the city of Jerusalem as a whole. As stated above, the sacrifices of the most holy order could only be eaten within the Temple Courtyard. Similarly, a limitation was placed on where the sacrifices of lesser sanctity could be eaten. One could only partake of those offerings within the confines of the city of Jerusalem, and the definition of the city's limits were therefore of consequence.

There, it is related that:<br>At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, they sought Levites...to bring them to Jerusalem to carry out the dedication with joy and thanksgiving, with songs, with cymbals, with harps, and with lyres....Then, I asked the princes of Judah to ascend the wall, and I brought up the greater portion of two thanksgiving offerings....They ascended to the wall by the stairs of the city of David....They offered great sacrifices that day, for God had made them rejoice with great joy....and the joy of Jerusalem was heard from far away.<br></i> The <i>Sanhedrin</i> must offer two thanksgiving offerings.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A thanksgiving offering includes three elements: the leavened breads, an animal which is sacrificed and loaves of unleavened bread.<br><i>Sh'vuot, loc. cit.</i>, explains that the leavened breads were chosen because Nechemiah's description of Jerusalem's dedication relates that he \"brought up the greater portion of two thanksgiving offerings.\" That phrase alludes to the leavened breads of the thanksgiving offerings which rose, and thus, were more substantial than the unleavened breads.</i> [Then, two priests]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The bracketed addition was made on the basis of Rashi's commentary, <i>Sh'vuot</i> 16b.</i> take the leavened breads from these offerings [and proceed].

Many versions of that mishnah, including the one quoted in the Talmud, add the phrase: \"And all of Israel followed after them.\" However, the Rambam's version of the text omits that phrase. Hence, it is also not included in this halachah.</i> The thanksgiving offerings [would not proceed together, but] one would follow the other.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Similarly, in Nechemiah's narrative, the two offerings were separated.</i><br>They would stand on each and every corner and every single stone in Jerusalem, [playing] harps, lyres, and cymbals, and reciting [Psalms 30]: \"I exalt you, Lord, for You have uplifted me....\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalm 30 is called \"the song of the dedication of the House.\" Hence, it is appropriate for this occasion.<br><i>Sh'vuot, loc. cit.</i>, also relates that other Psalms, including 3, 91, and 100, were recited.</i><br>[They would proceed] until reaching the end of the place [which they desired to] consecrate.

Similarly, in this context, a consecration which lacks all the elements listed previously in the Mishnah is not totally effective.

The prophets assured them that \"all sacrifices could be offered on that Altar, even though the Temple itself was not [built] there [yet.]\" The construction of the Temple took another twenty two years to complete.<br>Even in later generations, our spiritual leaders have desired to offer sacrifices on the Temple Mount. In the Middle Ages, the Sage, Rabbi Chayim (according to other sources, Rabbi Yechiel) of Paris made <i>Aliyah</i> and settled in Jerusalem. He was prepared to offer sacrifices on the Temple site and refrained from doing so only after his colleagues explained that sacrifices could not be offered because they were unaware of the proper location, size, and dimensions of the Altar.</i> Similarly, sacrifices of the most holy order can be eaten in the entire [area of the] Courtyard, even though it is in ruin and not surrounded by a divider.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Twenty two years passed between the time that the exiles return to Jerusalem and the completion of the Second Temple.

Furthermore, there are other inconsistencies between the Rambam's statements here and in <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i>.<br>Even according to the Rambam's statements here, we are now prohibited from eating <i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> in Jerusalem.

There, the Rambam states that the original consecration of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> was nullified after the Babylonian conquest.

Nevertheless, his consecration remained in effect even after the Gentiles' subsequent conquests. Indeed, on the basis of that consecration, these agricultural laws must be observed in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> today.<br>To resolve that contradiction, the Rambam explains that the \"consecration\" of Jerusalem and of the Temple differs from the \"consecration\" of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> as a whole. Jerusalem and the Temple were consecrated by the revelation of the <i>Shechinah</i> in the Temple. That Divine act can never be nullified by man's deeds.

Why should the conquest detract from the consecration of the land?<br>These questions can be explained as follows: The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Challah</i> 5:1) interprets Genesis 15:18: \"I have given this land to your seed to mean that from Abraham's time onward <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> became the property of the Jewish people. Though the land was still possessed by the Canaanites, the Jews were already its legal owners. See <i>Bava Batra</i> 119b.<br>Despite this claim of ownership, the sanctity of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> came about only after the Jewish people entered the land, after the redemption from Egypt. At that time, they were commanded to conquer the land and take it forcefully from the Gentiles (See Numbers 32:29, Deuteronomy 3:21, etc.) Since God made the consecration of the land dependent on its conquest by Israel, it follows that conquest by a Gentile nation can nullify that holiness.<br>In contrast, Ezra was not commanded to reconquer <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, but to settle it. In this instance, God made the sanctity of the land dependent on the Jewish people manifesting their ownership over the land which had been given to them as an eternal inheritance. Since <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> remains our land, regardless of how many times it has been conquered by Gentiles, the sanctity effected by that manifestation of ownership is also eternal.

The Rambam describes this mitzvah in <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i>, which describes the construction of the Temple, but not the details of the priests' service.<br>On this basis, the commentaries explain, we can understand two dimensions implicit in this mitzvah:<br>a) The priests' responsibility to prevent those forbidden to enter from entering; and<br>b) The responsibility incumbent on the entire Jewish people to construct and maintain the Temple in the most fitting manner.<br>Since the presence of guards enhances the glory of the Sanctuary, the mitzvah of guarding the Sanctuary can be seen as an aspect of its very structure.

Nevertheless, an exception was made to allow \"the officer of the Temple Mount\" to perform his task (<i>Yeriot Shlomo</i>).</i> He was even granted permission to burn [a sleeping guard's] clothing.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although generally, one may not destroy things of value (<i>bal tashchit</i>), an exception is made in this case to allow the Temple to be guarded properly.<br>The \"officer of the Temple Mount\" could be authorized to destroy private property on the basis of the principle: <i>Hefker Beit Din, Hefker</i>, i.e., a Jewish court may forfeit a person's ownership over an article (Rabbenu Asher, Commentary to <i>Middot</i> 1:1).<br>The <i>Ezrat Kohanim</i> does not accept this explanation because the prohibition against destroying things of value applies even in regard to ownerless articles.<br>Another possible explanation is that this step is taken for the watchmen's own good. A father or a teacher is allowed to hit a student to shape his character. Similarly, in this instance, \"the officer of the Temple Mount\" was entitled to burn a watchman's clothing so that he will perform his task more effectively (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 18, p.465).</i><br>Thus, it was commonly said in Jerusalem: \"What is the noise in the Temple Courtyard [at night]? It must be the voice of a Levite being beaten and his clothes burned because he slept on his watch.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned in the commentary to Halachah 6, there is a debate among the Rabbis if the priests were allowed to sleep on their watch or not. Rav Ovadiah of Bartinura (<i>Shekalim</i> 5:1) states that both priests and Levites would be beaten for sleeping. However, the <i>Tosafot Yom Tov</i> argues that this punishment was only administered to Levites.<br>It would appear that the Rambam subscribes to the latter view. In <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i> (7:4), he writes: \"The officer of the Temple Mount walked around, [checking on] the Levites...\"</i>",
            "In the morning, shortly before dawn,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Temple services began with the removal of the ashes from the Altar. Generally, this was done at dawn.<br>The term dawn, <i>alot hashachar</i>, refers to the time before sunrise when the first rays of the sun begin to illuminate the horizon. This is more than an hour before sunrise.</i> the overseer of the Sanctuary<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This does not refer to the \"officer of the Temple Mount\" mentioned above. In <i>Hilchot Temidim U'Musafim</i> 6:1, the Rambam describes this entire procedure a second time. There, he ascribes the waking of the priests to the priest responsible for delegating different sacrificial functions. See also <i>Tamid</i> 26a.</i> came<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From the <i>chayl</i>.</i> and tapped<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On the external gate of the Chamber of the Hearth,</i> to awaken the priests sleeping in the Chamber of the Hearth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As explained in Halachot 5 and 6.</i> [When] they opened [the gate] for him, he took the keys<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Middot</i> 1:7 mentions that the keys to the Courtyard were hung on a ring in the Chamber of the Hearth. See also the notes to Halachah 5.</i> and opened the small gate leading from the Chamber of the Hearth to the Temple Courtyard.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tamid</i> 28a relates that there was a small wicket next to the large gate leading from the Chamber of the Hearth to the Temple Courtyard. The large gate would not be opened until dawn. Therefore, the priests entered through the wicket to prepare the Courtyard for the service of the coming day.</i><br>[Then] he entered the Courtyard, and the priests followed him. They held two torches of fire in their hands and divided into two groups. One proceeded eastward and the other, westward.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As explained in Chapter 5, the Chamber of the Hearth was positioned on the north side of the Temple Courtyard, slightly beyond the entrance of the Temple building. From this point, one group would proceed westward, towards the western end of the Courtyard. The other group walked towards the east, in the direction of the Gate of Nicanor, the major entrance to the Courtyard. Both groups walked near the walls, so that they would make a complete circuit around the Courtyard.</i><br>They walked on, checking the entire Temple Courtyard.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To make sure all of the sacred utensils were in their proper places.</i> Both groups [met when they] reached the Chamber of the Bakers of the <i>Chavitin</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 5, Halachah 17, where this chamber is described.<br>The Chamber of the Bakers of the Chavitin was located on the southern side of the Courtyard's eastern wall. Thus, the group of priests who turned westward had a much longer route than those who proceeded to the east.</i> When both groups reached [that point], they declared: \"Peace be unto you. Everything is at peace.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad in his commentary to <i>Tamid</i> 28a explains that each group would greet the other in this manner.</i> [Afterwards,] they prompted the bakers of the <i>Chavitin</i> to begin their work.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Chavitin</i> was offered each day by the High Priest shortly after the morning sacrifice.<br>A general question may be asked concerning this and the following halachah: Why did the Rambam include them in <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> which describes the construction of the Temple? It would appear more appropriate to mention them in <i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i>, where the laws governing the daily service in the Temple are described. Indeed, we find that these laws are repeated there.<br>The reason is based on the explanation of Halachah 1. There, the Rambam states that the watch kept over the Temple was an act of deference, enhancing the glory of the Temple. Thus, maintaining that the watch is part of the responsibility of the entire Jewish people to construct and maintain the Temple in the most fitting manner.<br>A similar principle can be explained in regard to this inspection of the Courtyard. Over and above the need for checking to see that all the sacred utensils were in there appropriate positions, this inspection was an act of deference and honor which enhanced the importance of the Temple (Likkutei Sichot, Vol. 18, p. 244-249).</i>",
            "<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>This is the final halachah of <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i>. There are a total of 7 halachot in the text. The latter figure matches the age of Levi when he passed away. Levi was the ancestor of the priests and the Levites who served in the Temple.</b></i> This pattern was followed each night except on Sabbath eve. [Then,] they did not hold torches in their hands.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because it is forbidden to carry a flame on the Sabbath.</i> Rather, they checked by the light of the candles, which remained burning from the Sabbath eve.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Kessef Mishnah, Tosafot Yom Tov</i>, and other commentaries, question why they were not permitted to carry the torches with them. Although carrying fire is prohibited on the Sabbath, the prohibition is only Rabbinic in origin in the category of <i>shvut</i>. The Rambam states (<i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 21:27) that all Rabbinic prohibitions of this nature were suspended in the Temple.<br>Among the explanations offered are: Since it was possible to use candles which were lit before the Sabbath, there is no need to violate even a Rabbinic prohibition. Alternatively, this inspection was carried out in preparation for the service of the entire day to follow and, as above, it was an act of deference to the Temple. Therefore, to emphasize the holiness of the Temple, it was proper that it be carried out without violating any prohibition whatsoever.<br>The structure of the final chapter of <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> can be explained homiletically: It begins with the obligation to guard the Temple at night, and concludes with the preparations for the Temple services at dawn.<br>As mentioned above (Halachah 2), the commentaries explain that the mitzvah of guarding the Temple was instituted so that the Temple would be prominent in our minds at all times. Thus, during the day, there was no necessity to stand guard, for that purpose was accomplished by the Temple service. However, at night, when there was no service, we were required to keep a watch around the Temple.<br>The period of exile is often described as night and the advent of the Messianic era, as dawn. By guarding the Temple at night, and studying the laws of its construction during the exile, we will merit the coming of the dawn, the coming of Mashiach.<br>A similar idea can be seen in the last halachah, which deals with the priests' procedure on the Sabbath. The Sabbath is described as <i>me'ein olam haba'ah</i>, a microcosm of the world to come, and the time of the coming of the <i>Mashiach</i>. On the Sabbath, in the Messianic age, the preparations for the Temple service will be carried out with the light kindled on the Sabbath eve, representing the present age - and before the coming of the Mashiach. Our service at present generates spiritual light. We will use that light to prepare for the sacrifices to be offered in the Third Temple.<br>May we merit the Messianic redemption and the rebuilding of the Temple speedily, and in our days. 47Then, shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasing to God, as in days of old and former years 48 (Malachi 3:4 .</i>"
