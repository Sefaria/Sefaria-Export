            "It is forbidden for an ordinary person to benefit from articles sanctified unto God, whether they are entities that are offered on the altar or articles consecrated for the improvement of the Temple. Anyone who derives a <i>perutah'</i> worth of benefit from an article sanctified unto God, is considered as having misappropriated a consecrated article.",
            "The concept of <i>me'ilah</i>, misappropriating consecrated articles, does not apply to sacrificial entities from the sacrifices that are permitted to be eaten, e.g., the meat of sin-offerings and guilt-offerings after their blood was cast on the altar, the two breads after the blood of the two sheep was cast on the altar. This applies even if these or the like are eaten by a non-priest. Since it is permitted for some people to benefit from them, anyone who benefits from them is not considered to have misappropriated consecrated articles. Even if they were disqualified and prohibited to be eaten, since there is a time when they are permitted to be eaten, one is not liable for <i>me'ilah</i>.",
            "Anyone who purposely misappropriates consecrated articles is liable for lashes and must pay the value he decreased the value of the sacred articles. The warning against <i>me'ilah</i> is derived from Deuteronomy 12:17: \"You may not partake of the tithes of your grain... your pledges... in your outlying cities.\" According to the Oral Tradition, we learned that this is a warning against one who partakes of the meat of a burnt-offering for it must be offered entirely to God. The same applies to all other consecrated articles that are dedicated to God alone, whether something consecrated for the altar or for the improvement of the Temple. If one derives a <i>perutah's</i> worth of benefit, he is liable for lashes. If he misappropriated a consecrated article unknowingly, he must make restitution for the benefit he received and add a fifth. Also, he must bring a ram worth two <i>selaim</i> and have it sacrificed as a guilt-offering. This brings atonement for him and it is called: \"the guilt-offering for misappropriation,] as Leviticus 5:15-16 states \"And he sinned inadvertently, misappropriating what was consecrated unto God and he shall bring his guilt-offering... and he should make restitution for what he misappropriated from the consecrated articles, adding a fifth.\" Paying the principal with the additional fifth and bringing the sacrifice is a positive commandment.",
            "Payment of the principal and bringing the guilt-offering are essential for the atonement; payment of the additional fifth is not essential. This is derived from the prooftext that speaks of: \"the ram of the <i>asham</i>.\" Our Sages interpreted the term <i>asham</i> as referring to the principal and stated: The ram and the payment of the principal are fundamental requirements. The additional fifth is not a fundamental requirement.",
            "If the person brought the guilt-offering before he made restitution for the principal, he did not fulfill his obligation. If one is in doubt whether he derived benefit from a consecrated article or not, he is exempt from making restitution and bringing a sacrifice.<br>The additional fifth is considered as a consecrated article itself. If one benefits from it, he should add a fifth to the fifth. We have already explained several times that the fifth is one fourth of the principal so that the principal and the fifth will be five units.",
            "There are articles for which one is not liable for <i>me'ilah</i> according to Scriptural Law, but from which it is forbidden to benefit according to Rabbinic decree. A person who derives benefit from them must only make restitution for the principal. He need not add a fifth, nor must he bring a guilt-offering.",
            "All of the sacrifices offered on the altar - whether sacrifices of the highest degree of sanctity or sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity - are forbidden to be shorn and it is forbidden to perform work with them, as Deuteronomy 15:19 states: \"Do not perform work with the firstborn of your oxen and do not shear the firstborn of your sheep.\" The same applies to all other sacrificial animals. One who shears an ox or works with a sheep is liable for lashes according to Scriptural Law.<br>One who pulls out hair is not considered as if he shears it. It appears to me that one is not liable unless he shears double the width of a <i>sit</i>. This prohibition should not be more severe than the prohibition against shearing on the Sabbath.",
            "When there is a doubt whether an animal is consecrated, e.g., an animal concerning which there is a question whether it is a firstborn or the like, it is forbidden to shear it or work with it, but one who shears it or works with it, is not liable for lashes.",
            "When a sacrificial animal contracted a physical blemish and it was redeemed as we explained, it is not permitted to shear it or to work with it. The prohibitions are still in effect until it is slaughtered. If it was slaughtered after it was redeemed, it is permitted to partake of it.<br>When does the above apply? When the animal was consecrated before it contracted a permanent blemish or it contracted a temporary blemish before it was consecrated. If, however, one consecrated an animal with a permanent physical blemish as a sacrifice for the altar, it is only forbidden to be shorn and for work to be performed with it according to Rabbinic Law. If it is redeemed, it is like an ordinary animal in all regards and like an ordinary animal, it may be shorn and work may be performed with it. The only exceptions to this principle are a firstborn animal and one separated as the tithes. In these instances, the holiness falls on their physical bodies even if at the outset they have permanent physical blemishes. They are never considered as ordinary animals entirely and it is always forbidden to shear them or perform work with them.<br>It is forbidden to mate an animal that is a firstborn or a sacrificial animal that was disqualified.",
            "It is permitted, even as an initial preference, to pull off hair from a sacrificial animal in order to show a physical blemish to an expert. It is forbidden to benefit from the hair that was pulled off or which fell from a consecrated animal, a firstborn animal, or one designated as the tithes, even after it was redeemed and slaughtered because of its blemish. This is a decree lest the sacrifice of such an animal be delayed, because it does not come to bring about atonement.<br>It is, by contrast, permitted to benefit from wool which fell from an animal designated as a sin-offering or a guilt-offering after it has been redeemed and slaughtered because of a physical blemish. The rationale is that since these offerings come to bring about atonement, the owners will not delay their sacrifice. There is an unresolved doubt if it is permitted to benefit from wool that was pulled off from a burnt-offering.<br>It is permitted to benefit from any wool that becomes pulled off from sacrificial animals after they have contracted a blemish, for it was not pulled off intentionally. The only exception is the wool of a firstborn animal and one designated as a tithe. In those instances, it is forbidden to benefit from wool even if it was pulled off from such an animal after it contracted a blemish.",
            "When a person slaughters a firstborn or another consecrated animal, he may pull off the wool from either side to make a place for the knife, provided he does not remove the wool from its place.",
            "It is forbidden to shear and perform work with animals consecrated for the improvement of the Temple according to Rabbinic decree. According to Scriptural Law, they are not forbidden. Therefore one who shears such animals or performs work with them is not liable for lashes. He does, however, receive stripes for rebellious conduct.",
            "When one consecrates a fetus for the altar, it is forbidden to perform work with its mother according to Rabbinic decree. The rationale for this decree is that work weakens the fetus. It is, however, permitted to shear the mother, because this does not harm the fetus.<br>When one consecrates one limb of an animal - whether for the improvement of the Temple or for the altar - there is an unresolved doubt whether or not the entire animal is forbidden to be sheared or for work to be performed with it. Therefore, if one performs such an activity, he is not liable for lashes."

            "The prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> does not apply to sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity until the blood has been cast on the altar. If the blood has been cast on the altar, the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> applies to the fats and organs until they are taken to the ash heap, for they are designated for the altar's pyre. The prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> does not apply to an entity that is to be eaten, as explained.<br>Even if the fats and the organs were brought to the altar before the blood was cast upon it, the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> does not apply until the blood is cast. If the fats and the organs were taken outside the Temple Courtyard before the blood was cast, the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> does not apply until the blood is cast. If the blood was cast while they were outside and they had not been brought back in, the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> does apply, for casting the blood has an effect on the status of a sacrifice, whether it leads to a lenient ruling or a stringent one.",
            "The prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> applies to all the sacrifices of the most sacred order from the time they were consecrated until the blood is cast upon the altar. Once the blood is cast, the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> applies to the portions of them that are to be consumed entirely by the altar's pyre until they are burnt and taken to the ash heap. The prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> does not apply to the portions that are to be eaten, as explained.",
            "What is implied? The prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> applies to a burnt-offering - both of fowl and of an animal, the handful of meal and the frankincense from a meal-offering, a meal-offering of priests, the <i>chavitin</i> offering of the High Priest, and the meal-offering of the accompanying offerings, from the time they were consecrated until they were taken out to the ash heap after being burnt on the altar.",
            "Similarly, the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> applies to the bull and the goats that are burnt from the time they were consecrated until they are burnt - and their burning is complete - in the ash heap and their meat is burnt thoroughly, in their entirety. Before it is burnt thoroughly, the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> applies to it even though it is in the ash heap.",
            "Similarly, the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> applies to the red heifer from the time it was consecrated until it was reduced to ash. Even though its status is that of an entity consecrated for the improvement of the Temple, concerning it, Numbers 19:9 states: \"It is a sin-offering.\" It is one of the conditions established by the court that a person does not violate the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> with the ashes of the red heifer.",
            "The prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> applies to all the following: sin-offerings of animals, guilt-offerings, and communal peace-offerings from the time they were consecrated until the blood is cast on the altar. Once the blood is cast, the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> applies to their organs and fats until they are taken to the ash heap. The prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> does not apply to the meat.<br>Similarly, the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> applies to a sin-offering of fowl from the time it is consecrated until its blood is presented on the altar. After its blood was presented, the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> does not apply. It is, however, forbidden to benefit from its <i>murah</i> and its feathers. If one benefits from them after the blood is presented, he does not violate the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i>.",
            "The prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> applies to meal-offerings from the time they were consecrated, even though they have not become consecrated by being placed in a sacred utensil, until the handful of meal is offered on the altar's pyre. Once the handful is offered, the remainder of the offering is permitted to be eaten. If the remainder of the offering becomes disqualified or lacking in substance and then the handful is offered, a question arises. Since offering the handful does not cause the remainder to be permitted to be eaten in such a situation, there is an unresolved doubt if the meal-offering is absolved from the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> or not.",
            "The prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> applies to the showbread from the time it was consecrated - even though it was not baked - until the bowls of frankincense are offered on the altar's pyre. Once the bowls of frankincense were offered, it is permitted to be eaten. Similarly, the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> applies to the two loaves of Shavuot from the time they were consecrated, even before they were baked, until the blood of the sheep is cast on the altar. After the blood of the sheep was cast, they are permitted to be eaten.",
            "The prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> applies to the libations once they have been consecrated. Once they are poured and descend to the <i>shittin</i>,the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> no longer applies.<br>As long as the water which is poured as a libation on the Sukkot holiday is in the golden jug, benefit should not be derived from it, but one who benefits is not liable for <i>me'ilah</i>. If it was placed in the pitcher, the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> applies to it in its entirety, for it is one of the libations.",
            "The prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> applies to the <i>log</i> of oil brought by a person afflicted by <i>tzara'at</i> from the time that it was consecrated in a sacred vessel until the blood of the guilt offering was cast on the altar. Once the blood of the guilt-offering was cast, one should not benefit from it until the placements are made from it, but the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> no longer applies. After the placements were made, it is permitted for the priests to partake of the remainder of the oil like the meat of sin-offerings and guilt-offerings.",
            "The prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> does not apply to any of the blood of sacrificial animals that were slaughtered whether before atonement is attained or after atonement is attained until it flows out to the Kidron River. Once it flows out to the Kidron River, the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> applies to it because it was sold as fertilizer for gardens and the proceeds of the sale are consecrated. If, however, one lets the blood of a consecrated animal, it is forbidden to benefit from that blood and the prohibition of <i>me'ilah</i> applies to it. Since the animal cannot exist without blood, it is considered as its body.",
            "With regard to the bones, the <i>giddim,</i> the horns, and the hoofs which were separated from sacrificial animals of the highest degree of sanctity. The prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> applies to those separated before the blood was cast on the altar, but not to those which were separated after the blood was cast.<br>With regard to the bones of a burnt-offering that were separated before the blood was cast on the altar, once the blood is cast, the prohibition no longer applies. The casting of the blood causes them to be permitted. If they were separated after the blood was cast, the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> applies to them forever.<br>When the bones of a burnt-offering fly off the altar before midnight, the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> applies. After midnight, that prohibition no longer applies even though they flew off before midnight. The rationale is that since midnight arrived, all of the bones are considered as if they have been consumed by fire and as if they have been reduced to ash.",
            "When a coal flies off the altar - whether before midnight or after midnight - it is forbidden to benefit from it, but the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> does not apply. The prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> applies to a coal that was consecrated for the improvement of the Temple. It is forbidden to benefit from a flame, but the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> does not apply to it.",
            "The prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> applies to the ashes of the outer altar, both before the ash is removed from the altar and after it was removed.",
            "With regard to the ashes of the inner altar and the ashes of the <i>Menorah,</i> we may not benefit from them, but the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> does not apply to them.",
            "Whenever there is an animal that was consecrated for a sacrifice of the most sacred order that contracted a disqualifying physical blemish - whether the blemish preceded its consecration or came afterwards - the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> applies until it is redeemed. This even applies if the animal is unable to be sacrificed because of a time factor.<br>A different law applies with regard to turtle-doves whose time to be offered has not arrived and young doves whose time to be offered has passed that were consecrated to be offered on the altar. Even though it is forbidden to benefit from them, one who derives benefit has not violated the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i>. The rationale is that since they are not fit to be redeemed, they are comparable to sin-offerings consigned to death. Therefore the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> does not apply to them."

            "When animals consecrated as sacrifices for the altar die, the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> no longer applies to their carcasses according to Scriptural Law. Nevertheless, the prohibition continues to apply according to Rabbinic Law. Similarly, if sacrificial animals will become disqualified because of matters that disqualify such animals as we have already explained, the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> continues to apply according to Rabbinic decree.<br>When does the above apply? When there was no time that the sacrificial animal could be eaten by the priests. Different rules apply, however, if animals consecrated as sacrifices of the highest order of sanctity which are intended to be eaten had a time when they were permitted and then disqualified and forbidden to be eaten. Since they were permitted at a given time, the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> does not apply to those entities that are fit to be eaten, as we explained.<br>What is implied? When sacrifices of the highest order of sanctity were disqualified before their blood was presented on the altar according to law, e.g., they were slaughtered in the southern portion of the Temple Courtyard even though the blood was received in the north, they were slaughtered in the north, but the blood was received in the south, they were slaughtered during the day and the blood was cast on the altar at night, they were slaughtered at night, but the blood was cast during the day, they were offered with a disqualifying intent concerning time or place, the blood was received by unacceptable persons even though it was cast by acceptable ones, it was cast by unacceptable persons even though it was received by acceptable ones, all of the blood and the meat were taken out of the Temple Courtyard before the blood was cast, or the blood remained overnight - in all these instances, the principle of <i>me'ilah</i> applies forever, because there was never a time when these offerings were permitted to be eaten.<br>If, however, the blood reached the altar as commanded, but afterwards the meat or the portions to be offered on the altar remained overnight, or the meat or those portions became impure, or were taken outside the Temple Courtyard, or a portion of the meat was taken outside before the blood was cast, in all these instances and the like, the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> does not apply to the remainder of the meat, because there was a time when it was permitted to be eaten, as explained above.",

The rationale is that the sacrifice is acceptable, because the unacceptable persons do not cause the remainder of the lifeblood to be considered as remnants unless he is unacceptable due to ritual impurity. In that instance, since he is fit for communal Temple service, he causes the remainder of the blood to be considered as remnants.",
            "What is implied? If an impure priest received the blood and cast it on the altar, even if afterwards an acceptable person received the remainder of the life blood and cast it on the altar, this sacrificial animal never had a time when its meat was permitted and the prohibition of <i>me'ilah</i> applies to the meat in its entirety. The rationale is that this blood is considered as \"remnants\" and the casting of \"remnants\" on the altar is not effective.<br>We have already explained that the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> does not apply to sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity except to the fats and organs after the blood is cast on the altar, provided the casting is effective. If, however, sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity have been disqualified as <i>piggul</i>, the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> does not apply to their fats and organs even though the blood has been cast.

If both of them were slaughtered at the same time and the blood of one of them was cast, the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> does not apply, neither to the meat whose blood was cast on the altar, nor to the meat of the other even though the second one is not fit to be eaten. The rationale is that if one desires one may cast the blood of this one or the other one. If, however, one slaughtered one after the other, the blood of the first one is not effective with regard to the other, even after it is cast on the altar, for there was no time that it was fit for its meat to be permitted.",

An exception is a burnt-offering of a fowl on which <i>melikah</i> was performed on the lower half of the altar for the sake of a sin-offering. Although it did not fulfill the obligation of the owners, the prohibition of <i>me'ilah</i> does not apply, since he changed its intent, the place where it was offered, and the manner in which it was offered to a type of sacrifice to which the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> does not apply.",

One should take a non-consecrated <i>p'rutah</i> or any non-consecrated utensil and say: \"Wherever the consecrated <i>p'rutah</i> is its holiness should be transferred to this.\" The <i>p'rutah</i> or the utensil become consecrated and the storekeeper is permitted to use all the money he received.<br>Similarly, if a consecrated <i>p'rutah</i> becomes intermingled with all the money in a purse or one said: \"A <i>p'rutah</i> in this purse is consecrated,\" he should transfer its holiness and afterwards, he may use all the coins in the purse. If he used coins from the purse without transferring the holiness of the consecrated coin, he does not definitely violate the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> until he used all the coins in the purse.",
            "If a person said: \"One of my purses is consecrated\" or \"One of my oxen is consecrated,\" the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> applies to all of them and to some of them. What should he do? He should bring the largest of the purses or the oxen and say: \"If this is consecrated, it should remain consecrated. If not, wherever the consecrated one is, its holiness should be transferred to this one.\" He may then use the smaller ones.",
            "When a person misappropriates less than a <i>p'rutah's</i> worth of consecrated property, whether intentionally or unintentionally, he must make restitution for the principal, but he need not pay an additional fifth or bring a sacrifice. It appears to me that he is not liable for lashes for misappropriating less than a <i>p'rutah's</i> worth if he acted intentionally.",
            "When a person entrusts consecrated money to a homeowner and the homeowner uses them and spends them, he violates the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i>. The rationale is that he does not have permission to use these funds and the owner did not grant him license to.",
            "Different rules apply if he entrusted them to a money-changer or a storekeeper and they were not sealed or tied close with an unusual knot. In these situations, since he is permitted to use them according to law, if he spent them, they are both exempt. The owner of the entrusted article is exempt because he did not tell the storekeeper or the money-changer to use them. And the store-keeper is exempt, because it is as if he used them with permission since they were not tied closed with an unusual knot or sealed.",
            "When a woman brought consecrated money to her husband's domain or her testator consecrated property and then died and the consecrated property fell to her as an inheritance, when her husband spends the money on his personal needs, he violates the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i>."

            "When workers are working in consecrated orchards, even though it was agreed that they would receive food, they should not eat consecrated figs. If they do, they violate the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i>. Instead, the Temple treasury should give them money to purchase food.",
            "When a person is threshing vetch that is consecrated, he must muzzle the ox. Although Deuteronomy 25:4 states: \"Do not muzzle an ox while it is threshing,\" the latter phrase can be interpreted as \"threshing appropriate for it.\"",
            "The holiness of consecrated property should not be transferred as payment for work, but only on money.<br>What is implied? When a craftsman performs a <i>maneh's</i> worth of work for the Temple treasury, he should not be given a consecrated animal, nor a consecrated garment as payment unless its holiness is first transferred to money. After the article became ordinary property, it can be given to the craftsman as his wages. If the treasurers desire, they may then purchase the animal from the Temple treasury.",
            "When the Temple is being built, consecrated wood and stones should not be taken, nor should the building be built with the intent that it is consecrated. Instead, everything should be built from ordinary property. This is a decree lest one of the workers benefit from the shade of the building or lean on a stone or beam while working. After the building is completed, the holiness of consecrated funds is transferred to the building.<br>If the treasurers need wood for the Temple for that day alone, they may purchase it with consecrated funds, for they are not delaying the matter for days in which instance it would be necessary to take precautions lest one lean on them and thus violate the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i>.",
            "When an agreement is made with workers to build in the Temple and its courtyards, the agreement is made for so-and-so many <i>selaim</i> for so-and-so many cubits, considering a cubit as containing 20 thumbbreadths. When a measurement is made of what they built, it is measured and payment determined, considering a cubit as containing 24 thumbbreadths, so that the workers will not take unfair benefit from the Temple treasury, because they are not exact in measurement.",
            "It is a stipulation of the court that the priests may benefit from consecrated salt and wood while partaking of the sacrifices granted to them as their portion. They may not, however, use the salt of the Temple on their ordinary food.",
            "The prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> applies to salt that is on a limb from a sacrifice to be offered on the altar. It does not, however, apply to salt on the ramp and the top of the altar.",
            "It is appropriate for a person to meditate on the judgments of the holy Torah and know their ultimate purpose according to his capacity. If he cannot find a reason or a motivating rationale for a practice, he should not regard it lightly. Nor should he break through to ascend to God, lest God burst forth against him. One's thoughts concerning them should not be like his thoughts concerning other ordinary matters.<br>See how severe the Torah rules concerning misappropriating sacred property. Now if wood, stones, earth, and ash become holy because the name of the Lord of the world was called upon them through speech alone and anyone who treats them as ordinary articles violates the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i> and even if he acted unknowingly, he is required to secure atonement, how much more so with regard to the mitzvot which God ordained for us should a person not treat them derisively, because he does not understand their rationale. He should not conjure up matters that are not true concerning God, nor should he think about them with his mind as he would ordinary matters. For Leviticus 19:37 states: \"And you shall guard all My decrees and all My judgments and perform them.\" Our Sages commented:This adjures us to guard and perform both the decrees and the judgments. The meaning of \"performing\" is well known, i.e,. that one should observe the decrees. \"Guarding\" means to treat them with caution and not think that they are any less than the judgments.<br>The judgments are those mitzvot whose motivating rationale is openly revealed and the benefit of their observance in this world is known, e.g., the prohibitions against robbery and bloodshed and honoring one's father and mother. The decrees are the mitzvot whose motivating rationales are not known. Our Sages said: \"I ordained decrees and you have no license to question them.\" A person's natural inclination confronts him concerning them and the nations of the world challenge them, e.g., the prohibition of the meat of a pig, milk and meat, the calf whose neck is broken, the red heifer, and the goat sent to Azazel. To what degree did King David suffer because of the heretics and the idolaters who would issue challenges concerning the decrees! As long as they would pursue him with false retorts that they would arrange according to man's limited knowledge, he would increase his clinging to the Torah, as Psalms 119:69 states: \"Willful transgressors have stacked falsehoods against me, but I guard Your precepts with a full heart.\" And <i>ibid.</i>:86 states concerning this matter: \"All of Your mitzvot are faithful; they pursue me with falsehood; help me.\"<br>All of the sacrifices are in the category of decrees. Our Sages said: \"The world exists for the sake of the service of the sacrifices.\" For through the performance of the decrees and the judgments the righteous merit the life of the world to come. And between the two of them, the Torah gave precedence to the command for the decrees, as Leviticus 18:5 states: \"And you shall heed My decrees and judgments which a person will perform and live through them.\""
