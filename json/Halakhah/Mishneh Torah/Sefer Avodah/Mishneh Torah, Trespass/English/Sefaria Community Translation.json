            "It is fitting for a person to investigate the laws of the holy Torah and to know their ultimate notions according to his ability. And about something which he cannot find a reason nor a rationale, let it not be light in his eyes. And he should 'not break [it] to go up to the Lord, lest He burst forth against him.' And his thought about it should not be like his thought about other common things. Come and see how much the Torah was stringent regarding trespass [of sanctified objects]. And if with wood and stones and dirt and ashes - once the name of the Master of the world is called upon them with mere words - become sanctified and anyone that treats them the way one treats common objects, and even if it was accidental, requires absolution; all the more so regarding the commandments that the Holy One, blessed be He, legislated for us, should one not rebel, if one does not know their reason. And he should not make things up that are not so about God, and he should not think about them his thought as with common things. Behold, it is stated in the Torah (Leviticus 19:37), \"And you shall guard all of my statutes (<i>chukim</i>) and all of my judgments (<i>mishpatim</i>) and do them.\" The sages said, \"[This is] to give guarding and doing on the statutes, like upon the judgments.\" And the doing is known, and that is that he do the statutes. And the guarding is that he be careful with them and not imagine that they are less than the judgments. And the judgments are the commandments the reasons for which are revealed and the benefit of doing them in this world is known - for example, the prohibition of theft, murder and honoring father and mother. And the statutes are the commandments the reasons for which are not known. The sages said, \"<i>Chukim</i> have I legislated (<i>chakoti</i>) upon you, and you do not have permission to muse about them.\" And [these are the laws that] the inclination of a person troubles him about, and the nations of the world reply to - for example the prohibition of eating pig meat and milk in meat and the [laws of the] beheaded calf and the red heifer and the scapegoat. And how much did King David anguish from the sectarians and from the gentiles that persecuted him with lying replies that they set up according to the smallness of human knowledge, as it is stated (Psalms 119:69) \"The evil ones have forged a lie against me; with my whole heart will I keep Your precepts.\" And it is stated there about the matter (Psalms 119:86), \"All of your commandments are faithful; falsehood pursues me, help me.\" And all of the sacrifices are included in these statutes. The sages said that because of the service of the sacrifices does the world stand. For through the performance of the statutes and the judgments, the straight ones merit life in the world to come. And the Torah had the command for the statutes come first, as it is stated (Leviticus 18:5), \"And you shall keep my statutes and my judgments, that a man should do them and live by them.\" "
