            "A non-priest is forbidden to derive any benefit from things consecrated to God, whether they are designed as offerings upon the altar or as offerings for the repair of the Temple. Anyone who derived personal enjoyment from things consecrated to God to the extent of a penny has committed sacrilege."

            "One ought to consider the laws of the Torah and to penetrate into their ultimate significance as much as he can. If, however, he cannot discover the reason and is ignorant of the basic cause of a law, he should not regard it with contempt. Let him not break through to ascend to the Lord, lest he break out against him (Exodus 19:24). His thinking about it must not be like his thinking concerning secular matters.<br>Consider, for example, how strict the Torah is with regard to sacrilege. If wood and stones, earth and ashes, became consecrated as soon as the name of the eternal Lord was called upon them, and anyone who put them to secular use committed sacrilege and required atonement even if he acted unwittingly, how much more should man take care not to regard with contempt the laws which God wrote down for us, simply because he happens to be ignorant of their basic reason. One must not impute to God things that are not right, nor regard the precepts as he would secular things. It is indeed written in the Torah: \"You shall faithfully observe all my statutes and all my laws and do them\" (Leviticus 19:37). The sages interpreted this verse to mean that we must observe and do the statutes just as well as the laws. What <i>performance</i> denotes is known, namely: one must do the statutes; <i>observance</i>, on the other hand, means that one should be careful about them and not imagine that they are less important than the laws. The laws are duties the reason of which is obvious, and the benefit derived in this world from doing them is known; for example, the prohibition against robbery and bloodshed, or the precept of honoring father and mother. The statutes are precepts the reason of which is not known, — — such as the prohibition against pork and that against meat-milk mixture, the laws concerning the heifer with the broken neck, the red cow, or the goat that is sent away to the wilderness. — — The Torah places the commandment concerning the statutes first, as it is written: \"You shall observe my statutes and my laws, by the performance of which man shall live\" (Leviticus 18:5)."
