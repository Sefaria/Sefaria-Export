            "While in the desert, Moses our teacher [had]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This addition is necessary, for as indicated by Exodus 37:29, Moses himself did not prepare the anointment oil.

He took the equivalent of 500 <i>shekel</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Scriptural Law, based on the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Bechorot</i> 8:8), in modern measure a <i>shekel</i> of the Torah is equivalent to 16 grams of pure silver. Nevertheless, as the Rambam states in <i>Hilchot Shekalim</i> 1:2, in the era of the Second Temple, our Sages increased its measure by almost a fourth. Accordingly, the measure of silver required for the redemption of the firstborn and other obligations where a <i>shekel</i> is required is significantly larger.</i> of the holy <i>shekalim</i> of musk, cinnamon, and costus<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam describes these spices in the following halachah.</i> and the equivalent of 250 <i>shekel</i> of fragrant cane. The Torah's statement [<i>ibid.</i>:23]: \"And fragrant cinnamon, half its measure, 250,\" implies that [the entire quantity] should be weighed out in two measures, 250 each time. Each one should be ground separately, mixed together<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that the obligation to grind the herbs is derived from a comparison to the incense offering. The order in which they are ground and then mixed is a logical deduction. If they are ground first, they will be mixed more thoroughly and more effectively.</i> and then soaked in pure, sweet water until all of its power was extracted into the water.

            "Musk refers to the blood contained with a wild beast from India that is of universal renown which people everywhere use as a fragrance.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam is referring to a secretion of the abdominal gland of the male musk deer, a large animal that roams the mountains of Nepal and Tibet. The secretion is reddish-brown, with a honeylike consistency and a strong fragrance. After the gland is cut open, the secretion hardens, assumes a blackish-brown color, and when dry becomes granular.<br>The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's definition, stating that it is improper that the blood of a beast - and certainly, a non-kosher beast - be used in the Sanctuary. He interprets the term <i>mor</i> as referring to the fragrant herb, myrrh. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> supports the Rambam's view, explaining that the loathsome quality one would associate with the blood of a beast departs from it when the secretion dries and becomes granular. See also the Ramban's commentary to Exodus 30:23, where he discusses both positions.</i> Cinnamon is a tree that comes from the Indian islands which has a pleasant fragrance and which people use as incense. The term <i>kidah</i> refers to costus.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is the root of a tall herb, whose botanical name is <i>Saussurea lappa</i>, which even today grows only in the highlands of Kashmir.</i> Fragrant cane, this refers to thin canes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his notes to his translation of the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Keritot</i> 1:1), Rav Kapach identifies this as the acorus calamus plant. In his Living Torah, Rav Aryeh Kaplan identifies this as the cymbopogon martini or palmarosa plant.</i> like red straw that come from the Indian islands and have a pleasant fragrance.

From that point onward, neither the High Priests or kings were anointed.<br>On the surface, one might ask: Since no other oil was ever made, why is making the oil considered one of the 613 mitzvot? For as the Rambam clarifies several times in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, if an obligation is not ongoing, it is not appropriate to consider it as a mitzvah. On that basis, a number of commands, for example, the command to wage war against Midian (Numbers 7:2 , were excluded from this reckoning.<br>The <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> (positive mitzvah 107) notes that the prooftext quoted by the Rambam concludes \"for your generations,\" i.e., for all time. The mitzvah was to have the oil made by Moses available at all time. After the oil was entombed by King Josiah, new oil was not made, because the oil which Moses made is still available. At the coming of <i>Mashiach</i>, that oil will surface and again be used.</i>",
            "[One is liable] whether he anoints himself or others,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Radbaz maintains that if the others willfully allow the oil to be applied to their flesh, they are also liable.

He is not mentioned, because his regal line did not continue for posterity.</i> Even a High Priest who is the son of a High Priest should be anointed,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In contrast, the kings were anointed only when there is a dispute over the inheritance or during a civil war (<i>ibid.</i>:12 and Halachah 11 of this chapter).</i> as [Leviticus 6:15] states: \"The priest from his sons anointed in place of him....\"",

The Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> note that the simple meaning of <i>Keritot</i> 6b appears to support the Ra'avad's position.

In contrast, the dynasties of the kings of Israel will eventually be interrupted [see <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 1:9 (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>)].<br>Accordingly, King David ordered that Solomon be anointed at the Gichon Stream (1 Kings 1:33 .</i> We do not anoint the king who is the son of a king, for the kingship is a hereditary position for the king for all time,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When mentioning this law, <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 1:7 continues: \"Not only the monarchy, but all other positions of authority and appointments in Israel, are transferred to one's children and grand-children as inheritances forever.\" The order of inheritance of the crown follows the order of inheritance of property as explained in <i>Hilchot Nachalot</i>, ch. 1. The first in line for the monarchy are the deceased king's sons, in order of age. Should none of his sons be alive, the right is passed to his grandchildren. The children of the elder son are granted preference. If the king has no male descendents, the monarchy is given to his brothers. If they are not alive, it is granted to their sons. From them, the right to the throne passes to the deceased king's nephews (his sister's sons), then to his uncles, to his first cousins.</i> as [Deuteronomy 17:20] states: \"[Thus] he and his descendants [will prolong their reign] in the midst of Israel.\" If there is a controversy, he should be anointed to resolve the controversy and to notify to all that he alone is the king, as Solomon was anointed because of the controversy [stirred up by] Adoniyahu.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">1 Kings, Chapter l, describes Adoniyahu's abortive attempt to declare himself as David's successor.</i> Yoash was anointed because of Atal'ya,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Kings, Chapter 11, describes Atal'ya's murder of the children of King Achazyahu, her assumption of the throne, and the revolt which established Yoash as king.</i> and Yehoachaz was anointed because of his brother Yehoyakim.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yehoachaz was younger than Yehoyakim.

The Rambam is emphasizing the contrast between a High Priest and a king. A king does not perform <i>chalitzah</i> because such an act would be a compromise to his honor.

[Ezekiel 44:18] states: \"They shall not gird themselves <i>bayeza</i>, [interpreted<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">By <i>Zevachim</i> 18b.</i> to mean] \"in a place where one perspires.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., a place like the armpits or loins where flesh covers flesh leading to perspiration.</i> Yonason, the son of Uziel,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A renowned student of the Sage Hillel, who translated the Tanach into Aramaic.</i> received the same tradition from the prophets<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Megilah</i> 3a which ascribes this translation to the prophets Chaggai, Zechariah, and Malachi who accompanied the Jews back from the Babylonian exile to Jerusalem.</i> and translated the phrase: \"They will gird themselves over the heart.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">At elbow height.</i><br>Afterwards, he should arrange the headpiece as a hat.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 8, Halachah 2.

            "After the High Priest girds himself with the sash,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., he puts on the first three garments in the same manner as an ordinary priest does.</i> he puts on the cloak, and on the cloak, the <i>ephod</i> and the breastplate. He girds himself with the belt of the <i>ephod</i> over the cloak, below the breastplate. Therefore [the cloak] is called \"the cloak of the <i>ephod</i>,\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 28:31.</i> the cloak that is girded closed with the <i>ephod</i>.<br>Afterwards, he winds the headgear like a turban.

            "It is a positive commandment to make these garments and for the priests to serve in them,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 33) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 99) includes this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. The wording in <i>Sefer Hamitzvot</i> implies that the fundamental mitzvah is for the priests to wear these garments for their Temple service. Making the garments is merely a preparatory phase that enables that mitzvah to be fulfilled.</i> as [Exodus 28:2] states: \"And you shall make holy garments,\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to the garments of the High Priest.</i> and [<i>ibid.</i> 29:8] states: \"And drew near his sons and dress them in tunics.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to the clothes of an ordinary priest.</i><br>When a High Priest serves with less than these eight garments or an ordinary priest serves with less than these four garments, he is called lacking garments. His service is invalid and he is liable for death at the hand of Heaven, like a non-priest who serves. [This is indicated by <i>ibid.</i>:9 which states:] \"And you shall gird them with a sash... and their priesthood shall be for them....\" [Implied is that] when their garments are upon them, their priesthood is upon them. [Conversely,] if their garments are not upon them, they are like non-priests, concerning whom [Numbers 1:51] states: \"A non-priest who draws close [to the service of the Sanctuary] shall die.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 9:1.</i>",
            "Just like a priest who is lacking garments is liable to die and invalidates the service he performs, so too, one who wears extra garments<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i> 2:1), it appears that wearing any extra garment, not only an extra priestly garment, causes one to be liable.</i> - e.g., he wears two tunics, two sashes, or an ordinary priest who wears the garments of the High Priest and performs service - profanes his service and is liable for death at the hand of Heaven.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We see this concept in several other contexts. When there is an extra entity, it is as if it and the entity that is required to be present is lacking. See <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 6:2.</i>",
            "It is said with regard to the priestly garments:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam is not quoting a verse exactly. Similar phrase exist in Leviticus 6:3 and 16:4.</i> \"on his flesh and he shall wear them.\" [Implied is that] nothing should intervene between his flesh and the garments. Even if there is one thread, earth, or a dead louse between his flesh and the [priestly] garment, it is considered an intervening substance and his service is invalid. Therefore a priest cannot serve [in the Temple wearing] his arm <i>tefillin</i>, because they intervene. The head <i>tefillin</i>, by contrast, do not intervene<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Halachah 3.</i> and if he desires to wear them at the time of his Temple service, he may.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One can infer that he is not obligated to wear <i>tefillin</i>. We apply the principle: One who is occupied in the observance of a mitzvah - the priestly service - is exempt from another mitzvah, wearing <i>tefillin</i>.<br>The <i>tefillin</i> are not considered as an extra garment, because <i>tefillin</i> are not considered a garment (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>",
            "[A priest] must be careful at the time that he puts on [the priestly garments] that there be no dust, nor a louse - even if it is alive - between his flesh and the garment. Nor should air enter between his flesh and his garment during the time of service so that the garment will become distant from his flesh. He should not place his hand in his bosom under his tunic. He should not remove his hair from the garment, nor should there be a strand hanging loose from the garment. [Although] one these factors occurs, his service is acceptable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Zevachim</i> 19a questions whether these situations are acceptable and does not arrive at a conclusion. Accordingly, the Rambam rules that as an initial preference, one should be concerned with these matters, but the difficulty is not great enough to disqualify the service. For unless the Torah or our Sages explicitly ruled that a sacrifice is unacceptable, one cannot bring another one in its place for it is possible that one will be committing the transgression of slaughtering an ordinary animal in the Temple Courtyard (see <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 2:3). The slaughter of the animal might be placed in that category, because one is bringing it as a sacrifice under the conception that he is obligated to do so, when in fact that might not be so.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that one may not bring a sacrifice and make a conditional stipulation: \"If the previous sacrifice was unacceptable, may this be considered as my obligation and if the previous sacrifice was acceptable, this is a freewill offering.\" There are some sacrifices - e.g., sin offerings, guilt offerings, and communal offerings - where such a stipulation cannot be made. Hence, our Sages enforced uniformity and prevented conditional offerings in these instances.</i>",
            "[The following rules apply if a priest] wrapped a cloth on his flesh in a place [untouched by the priestly] garments, e.g., he wrapped it on his finger or on his heel.

            "When the finger of a priest is wounded, he is permitted to tie a reed or a cloth that is not three fingerbreadths by three fingerbreadths around it on the Sabbath and perform his service.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since he is not tying a permanent not, there is no prohibition against tying. Nor is there a prohibition against performing an act of healing on the Sabbath (as is prohibited in certain instances), because such prohibitions were not applied in the Temple.</i> If he intends to release blood, it is forbidden.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For this is a transgression of the Sabbath laws and it does not aid the Temple service (Rashi, <i>Eruvin</i> 103b).</i> [Leniency is granted,] provided the reed or the cloth does not intervene between his flesh and a sacred utensil<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 5:17.</i> at the time of service.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For in this instance, even if the article is not significant, an interposition invalidates the service. The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, claiming that it is a contradiction to his ruling in the previous halachah. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> justifies the Rambam's position, explaining that in the previous halachah, the garment was not considered a garment because of its size. Nevertheless, that does not mean that it is not considered an interposition. As long as it intervenes, it disqualifies service regardless of its size.</i>",
            "In the Second Temple,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Kiddushin</i> 31a relates that the Sages sought to purchase the stones for the High Priest's breastplate in the era of the Second Temple.</i> they made the <i>Urim</i> and the <i>Tumim</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned in the notes to <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 4:1, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam considers the term <i>Urim</i> and <i>Tumim</i> as referring to the stones of the High Priest's breastplate. See also the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Sotah</i> 9:20.

            "How was inquiry made?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., in the era of the First Temple.</i> The [High] priest would stand facing the Ark.

            "Two matters should not be asked about at once. If they are, one replies only to the first. Inquiry should not be made [of the <i>Urim</i> and <i>Tumim</i>] by an ordinary person, only by a king, the court, or one who the community at large requires.
