Thus we can deduce that one who consecrates a blemished animal, slaughtered it, poured its blood [on the altar], and set afire its selected portions is worthy of four sets of lashes.",
            "One transgresses the above commandments whether the animal has a permanent blemish or a temporary blemish, he violates all of these commandments, as [Deuteronomy 17:1] states: \"Do not sacrifice to God your Lord an ox or a sheep that has a blemish.\" According to the Oral Tradition, we learned that this is a warning [against offering] an animal with a temporary blemish,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 95) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 494) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.

            "One who brings about a blemish in a sacrificial animal, e.g., he blinded its eye or cut off its hand,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The examples the Rambam gives are permanent blemishes. Generally, temporary blemishes cannot be brought about by human acts. Moreover, even if a person does cause a temporary blemish, he does not violate this prohibition. There is a logical basis for this conclusion, because as long as the animal is not permanently blemished, it is not disqualified as an offering (Radbaz; <i>Minchat Chinuch</i>, mitzvah 287).</i> is liable for lashes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 97) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 287) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> For with regard to a sacrifice, [Leviticus 22:21] states: \"It shall not have any blemish.\" According to the Oral Tradition, we learned that this is a warning not to cause a blemish.\"<br>Lashes are given [for the violation of this prohibition] only when the Temple was standing, for then [the animal] was fit to be offered as a sacrifice and [the person] disqualified it. In the present age, by contrast, even though one transgressed a negative commandment, he is not liable for lashes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Radbaz explains that this concept can be derived from the prooftext cited in Halachah 1: \"unblemished to arouse favor.\" Implied is that when a sacrificial animal can arouse favor, i.e., when there is a Temple where it can be offered, it must be unblemished. If that is not the case, there is no penalty for causing such a blemish.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and other commentaries have noted that the Rambam's ruling appears to be in contradiction with <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 13b which implies that there is no prohibition at all in causing a blemish in the present era, because there is no Temple where the sacrifices can be offered. The <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) and others explain that the difference can be resolved on the basis of the Rambam's ruling (<i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 6:15) that if the altar is constructed on the Temple Mount, sacrifices may be brought even if the entire Temple has not been rebuilt.</i>",
            "If a person brought about a blemish<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From Chapter 2, Halachah 15, it would appear that if the first merely brought about a temporary blemish, the second would be liable.</i> in a sacrificial animal and another person came and brought about a second blemish, the second person is not liable for lashes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For the animal was already disqualified due to the actions of the first person. Although the second person is not liable for lashes, he is still considered to have violated a Scriptural prohibition.</i>",
            "[This prohibition applies] both with regard to one who causes a blemish in sacrificial animals themselves or in animals to which their holiness was transferred<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although it is forbidden to transfer the holiness of a sacrificial animal to another animal, once that act has been performed, the second animal is consecrated and the prohibitions associated with a sacrifice apply to it.</i> with the exception of a firstborn or a tithed animal.

Instead, the new idea is that consecrated animals can be redeemed and then used as food. It is, however, forbidden to shear them and perform work with them even after they have been redeemed (<i>Hilchot Me'ilah, loc. cit.</i>).</i> We already explained in <i>[Hilchot] Arachin</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Hilchot Arachin, loc. cit.</i></i> that [Leviticus 27:11] states: \"With regard to any impure animal<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bechorot</i> 37b explains that the intent is not an animal from an impure species, but rather an animal from a kosher species that became disqualified because of a blemish, for there is a second verse (27:27) that speaks about evaluating non-kosher animals.</i> of which a sacrifice should not be brought as an offering to God, [you shall have the animal stand before the priest...]\",<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To be evaluated and then it may be redeemed.</i> is speaking about blemished animals that have been redeemed.",

Moreover, a formal process of evaluation by a court is not required before its redemption.</i> [The rationale is that] holiness never encompassed its actual body, only its worth, because it had a permanent blemish.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam is explaining why leniency is granted to redeem it after it died although generally we do not redeem a consecrated animal to feed its meat to the dogs (Chapter 2, Halachah 10; based on <i>Temurah</i> 6:5). In this instance, however, because the animal was blemished permanently, the consecration never affected its actual body, only its worth (i.e., it was not destined to be sacrificed itself, but rather to be sold and the proceeds used to purchase a sacrifice). Hence, after it dies, it can still be sold after it is redeemed.</i><br>If, by contrast, one consecrates an animal that possesses a temporary blemish or he consecrates an unblemished animal and after he consecrated it, it contracted a permanent blemish [different laws apply]. If it died before it was redeemed, it should be buried like other unblemished consecrated animals,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rather than redeemed. See <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 19:11.</i> because it must be stood before the court and evaluated,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And this process of evaluation must be performed while the animal is alive.</i> as we explained in <i>[Hilchot] Arachin</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Hilchot Arachin</i> 5:12.</i> If it was slaughtered before it was redeemed, it may be redeemed as long as it is making convulsive motions.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For as long as it is making convulsive motions, it is considered alive and the process of evaluation can take place (<i>ibid.</i>:13).</i> Afterwards, one may partake of it. If it gave birth, its offspring may be sacrificed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Temurah</i> 4:9.</i> If it became pregnant before it was redeemed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">But after it contracted a permanent blemish.</i> and it gave birth before it was redeemed, the offspring is forbidden.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To be used for ordinary purposes by Rabbinic decree. Although according to Scriptural Law, its holiness has departed, our Sages forbade its use, lest many such animals be maintained and flocks of them raised (<i>Bechorot</i> 15b).</i> It may not be redeemed. What should be done? Before the mother is redeemed, the offspring should be dedicated to the same [type of] sacrifice as its mother,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It then receives holiness on its own accord, independent of its mother.</i> because it may not be offered because of [the sanctification of] its mother, because its [holiness] comes from sanctification that was suspended.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the mother was unfit to be sacrificed because of its blemish, its holiness is considered to be suspended. Because the holiness of the mother was suspended, the offspring is not considered to be consecrated to the complete extent. Hence it must be consecrated again.<br>(It must be noted that the commentaries have questioned this ruling, because in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 15:4, the Rambam writes that the holiness of consecrated animals is never suspended. It can, however, be explained that a suspension stemming from a permanent blemish is different, because the animal can never be fit for sacrifice again.

Accordingly, since the obligation for lashes is explicit, even though it could be derived by logical inference, we should not make such a conclusion.

It reaches that conclusion for it is obvious that if the animal was not consecrated beforehand, its offering is not acceptable, for a person cannot consecrate an object that does not belong to him.</i> and the Holy One, blessed be He, hates it, as [Isaiah 61:8] states: \"[I am God Who...] hates a burnt offering [obtained] through robbery.\" Needless to say, it is not accepted.

Nevertheless, it is possible to say that according to Scriptural Law, the owner's despair is enough to effect the transfer of the property, further requirements are Rabbinic in origin and the Sages did not apply their decrees with regard to a sacrifice (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). Alternatively, with regard to questions of monetary law, a change of possession together with the owner's despair is sufficient to effect the transfer of the property (<i>Hilchot Geneivah, loc. cit.</i>).

Since according to Scriptural Law, he has fulfilled his obligation, bringing the second sacrifice is in fact transgressing, for he is slaughtering an ordinary animal in the Temple Courtyard (see <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 2:1). The Radbaz answers that from this we see the power of the Sages: that if there is a significant reason - as in this instance - their decrees can nullify the validity of the first sacrifice. Hence, when the person brings the second sacrifice, he is bringing a sacrifice required of him, not an ordinary animal.</i> Similar laws apply with regard to a burnt offering.",
