Hence, the problem does not arise.<br>b) the issue does not concern <i>notar</i> at all, as explained in the notes to Halachah 12.<br>c) since the absorbed fat is more than a day old when it becomes <i>notar</i>, its flavor is impaired (<i>notain taam lifgam</i>).

Even if one does so, the taste of the sacrificial offering will remain absorbed within it. The Rambam's understanding is that the Torah only required that an earthenware utensil be broken when it was used for cooking a sin-offering, if it was used for cooking other sacrifices, there is no obligation. This difference of opinion relates to a question of greater scope: the difference of opinion mentioned above whether it is necessary to purge the utensils from the food absorbed in them or not.</i> [There is] one exception: [the meat from] a sin-offering.

Consecrating the offspring certainly does not determine the mother's status. In the second clause, by contrast, the person consecrated the mother first. Now consecrating the mother determines the status of the offspring, for the offspring is considered as \"the thigh of its mother.\" Hence ordinarily if an animal is consecrated as a peace-offering, its offspring also has that status and should be offered as such a sacrifice (<i>Hilchot Temurah</i> 4:1). Nevertheless, in this instance, if the person originally had the intent of consecrating the offspring as a burnt-offering, the offspring is given that status, because it was never meant to be a peace-offering. The person could only make one statement at a time and the fact that he chose to speak about the mother first does not affect the offspring's status.</i><br>If, after he made a resolve in his heart and expressed verbally that [the offspring] should be a peace-offering, he retracted and said: \"Its offspring is a burnt-offering,\" even though he retracted immediately,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The phrase translated as \"immediately,\" <i>toch kedai dibbur</i>, has a very specific halachic meaning: \"Within the time it takes to say <i>Shalom Elecha, Rebbi</i>\" (\"Greetings my master\"; <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 2:17).</i> the offspring are [designated] as peace-offerings.

Similarly, the water libation offered on Sukkot is three <i>lugim</i> (<i>Hilchot Temidim UMusafim</i> 10:7).</i> they are not fit to be accepted within [the Temple]. Similarly, one who offers from the meat of a sin-offering, that of a guilt-offering, or that of a peace-offering whether of an individual or of the community or from the remainder of the meal-offerings, the two breads [offered on Shavuot], or the showbread outside [the Temple Courtyard] is exempt. [The rationale is that] all of these are fit to be eaten, not for the fires [of the altar].",
            "One who offers an entire animal outside [the Temple Courtyard] is liable, because of the portions offered on the altar. Even though they have not been separated, the meat of the sacrifice is not considered as an intervening substance<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i> 13:5), the Rambam explains that the rationale is that we follow the principles that two entities that are the same substance are never considered as intervening substances.</i> and it is as if he offered those portions on the pyre alone. In contrast, if one offers a meal-offering from which a handful [of meal] has not been separated, he is exempt.

Therefore [a transgressor] is not given lashes.",
            "If, [outside the Temple Courtyard,] one offered a limb that did not have an olive-sized portion of meat on it, but the bone itself caused it to reach the olive-sized measure, he is liable, because the meat is connected to the bone.

For the Torah made a distinction between [offering blood and offering limbs as indicated by the two prooftexts] \"Who will offer a burnt-offering\" and \"to offer it.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The fact that the Torah uses two prooftexts implies that two different prohibitions are involved. The prooftext \"to offer it\" refers to both the prohibitions against slaughter and against sprinkling the blood and the prooftext \"who will offer it\" refers to the prohibition against offering the limbs on the altar (Radbaz and <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, thus resolving the questions raised by the Ra'avad).</i><br>If one offered a limb that was lacking [in substance], he is exempt,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad objects to this ruling, noting that the previous halachah stated that a person is liable if the combination of a portion of a limb and the portions of the innards offered on the altar equal an olive-sized portion. This indicates that a limb need not be whole. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and others, however, justify the Rambam's ruling.</i> as [one can infer from the prooftext] \"to offer it.\" [This indicates] that one is liable [only] for a complete [limb].",

Indeed, there are some who considered its inclusion here as a scribal error.</i> If two people hold a limb [from a sacrificial animal] and offer it outside the Temple Courtyard], they are liable. [The rationale is that the prooftext states] \"Every man<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The original Hebrew repeats the word <i>ish</i> meaning man, implying that even two men can be held liable for the same activity.</i> who will offer a burnt-offering.\" Implied is that even two people who offer [a sacrifice] are liable.",

The Rambam mentions the application of the blood inside only to emphasize that offering the blood properly does not remove the liability that was already established.</i> he is liable for the portion applied outside [the Temple Courtyard]. [The rationale is that] the entire amount was fit to be offered inside.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence if he offers any of it outside first, he is liable. The fact that he does not offer the entire amount outside is not significant. As long as a portion is offered outside, he is liable.</i><br>If he applied it to [the altar] inside and then applied it outside, he is exempt, for [the blood he used] was merely remnants.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the offering was completed through the application of the blood to the altar inside. Although the remainder of the blood should also have been dashed on the altar, that is not an absolute requirement. Hence one is not liable for offering such blood outside the Temple Courtyard.</i> If, however, he received the blood in two cups, he is liable whether he applied both of them outside [the Temple Courtyard], [the first] outside and the other inside, or [the first] inside and the other outside.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad takes issue with the Rambam regarding the latter point, explaining that <i>Zevachim</i> 112a states that one is exempt in the latter instance. Since the blood was first offered inside, the sacrifice is acceptable and the fact that later blood was also offered outside is not of consequence. The Radbaz explains that, according to the Rambam, that rationale applies when the blood was offered inside according to all of its specifications. In this instance, however, the Rambam is speaking about a situation where the applications of the blood to the Temple altar were not completed. Hence, the blood in the second cup is still significant.</i>",

            "If a person slaughtered consecrated animals in the present era and offered them outside the Temple Courtyard, he is liable, because [the sacrifices] are fit to be offered inside. For it is permitted to offer sacrifices even though the Temple is not built, because [when the Temple was] consecrated originally, it was consecrated for the immediate time and for all future time.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 6:15-16 for an explanation of these concepts. See also <i>ibid.</i> 2:4 which states that as long as the altar is built in its appropriate place sacrifices may be offered even though the Temple is destroyed. Based on <i>Zevachim</i> 59a, the Radbaz states that even if the altar is not built, sacrifices can be offered on its site. Indeed, he writes that it is only because the gentiles do not allow us that we do not offer communal sacrifices in the present age. (Communal sacrifices may be offered while ritually impure.)<br>Based on this rationale, after the conquest of Jerusalem in 5727 (1967), the Lubavitcher Rebbe advised his chassidim to leave the holy city on the day before Pesach. The rationale is that the Paschal sacrifice may also be brought while ritually impure. Now anyone who is close to Jerusalem on the day before Pesach and does not bring a Paschal sacrifice is liable for <i>karet</i>. Although many factors are involved and the Rebbe did not advise his followers to actually bring a sacrifice, he felt it necessary that precautions be taken so that they would not be held liable for not bringing the offering. This situation persisted for several years until the Rebbe felt that the Jewish control of the Temple Mount was weakened to the point that it would be impossible to bring an offering.</i>",
