            "All these services that were performed every day were done by lot. How did they do it? All the priests of the subdivision of the day entered the chamber of hewn stone after daybreak — — and the officer in charge of the lots was with them. They stood in a circle, and the officer took a mitre from the head of one of them and put it back, to indicate the man from whom the counting was to begin. The lot was then cast, as will be explained.",
            "",
            "How was the lot cast? The priests stood in a circle and agreed upon a number: eighty, a hundred, a thousand, or any other number upon which they happened to agree. Then the officer said to them: \"Raise your fingers!\" They thrust out their fingers, one or two — — and the officer began to count from the indicated person whose mitre he had removed at first. He counted by their fingers, going round and round until he finally reached the number upon which they had agreed. The person at whose finger the number was reached came out first in the lot for the service.",
            "Why was the number agreed upon counted on the thrust-out fingers and not on the individuals themselves? Because it is forbidden to count Israelites except by means of some other object, as it is written: \"He numbered them by sheep\" (I Samuel 15:4)."

            "This sheaf came from barley, in accord with an ancient tradition transmitted from our teacher Moses. How was it made ready? On the eve of the festival messengers of the supreme court came out and tied the grain in bunches while still attached to the ground to make it easier to reap. All the nearby towns-people assembled, that it might be reaped with much pomp. Three measures of barley were reaped by three men, in three baskets, with three sickles. As soon as it grew dark, each reaper called out to all who were standing there: \"Has the sun set?\" They replied: \"Yes!\" \"Has the sun set?\" They replied: \"Yes!\" \"Has the sun set?\" They replied: \"Yes!\" \"Is this a sickle?\" They replied: \"Yes!\" \"Is this a sickle?\" \"Yes!\" \"Is this a sickle?\" \"Yes!\" \"Is this a basket?\" \"Yes!\" \"Is this a basket?\" \"Yes!\" \"Is this a basket?\" \"Yes!\" If it was on a Sabbath, he called out: \"Is today Sabbath?\" and they replied: \"Yes!\" \"Is today Sabbath?\" \"Yes!\" \"Is today Sabbath?\" \"Yes!\" Then he asked them: \"Shall I reap?\" and they replied: \"Yes!\" \"Shall I reap?\" \"Yes!\" \"Shall I reap?\" \"Yes!\" Everything was repeated three times.",
            "Why was all this required? Because of the heretical Sadducees who deviated from the Jewish community during the period of the Second Temple, asserting that the biblical expression <i>on the day after the sabbath</i> (Leviticus 23:11), [used in connection with the <i>omer</i> offering] refers to the original Sabbath. But traditionally interpreted, this verse refers to the festival and not to the Sabbath. This was the view of the prophets and the Sanhedrin at all times from generation to generation: they waved the <i>omer</i> on the sixteenth of <i>Nisan</i>, whether it was a weekday or a Sabbath. It is written in the Torah: \"You shall eat no bread or parched grain or fresh ears [of the new crop] until that very day\" (14); and it is written: \"The day after Passover, they ate some of the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain\" (Joshua 5:11). Were you to say that that Passover happened to occur on a Sabbath, as the foolish [heretics] have imagined, then why has Scripture made the permission to eat of the new grain depend on something that is not the essential factor but merely accidental? Since, however, Scripture has indeed made the matter depend on <i>the day after Passover</i>, it becomes obvious that <i>the day after Passover</i> is the determining factor that makes the new grain permissible, without paying attention to the day of the week that happens to coincide with it.",
            "It is forbidden to reap any one of the five kinds of grain in Eretz Yisrael before the reaping of the <i>omer</i> (sheaf of wave-offering), as it is written: \"The first of your harvest\" (Leviticus 23:10), meaning that it should be the first of all that is harvested.— —",

            "It is a biblical positive command to count seven full weeks from the day that the <i>omer</i> is brought, as it is written: \"From the day after the sabbath, the day you bring the sheaf of wave-offering, you shall count seven full weeks\" (15). The days must be counted along with the weeks, as it is written: \"You shall count fifty days\" (16). The counting must be performed from the beginning of the day. Accordingly, one is to do the counting at night, beginning with the night preceding the sixteenth of <i>Nisan</i>.",
            "If one forgot and failed to count at night, he may count at daytime. The counting must be performed while standing; but if one counted while sitting, he has fulfilled his duty.",
            "Every Jew is required to perform this duty, everywhere and at all times. Women and slaves, however, are exempt from it.",
            "Every night, before counting, one is required to recite the following blessing: \"Blessed art thou, Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us with thy commandments, and commanded us concerning the counting of the <i>omer</i>.\" If one has counted without the blessing, he has fulfilled his duty, and need not count over again."
