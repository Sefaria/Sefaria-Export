            "It is a positive commandment for the serving priest to sanctify his hands and legs, and [only] then should he serve, as it says (Exodus 30:19) \"And Aaron and his sons washed their hands and legs.\" And the priest who served in the morning without sanctifying his hands and legs is liable for death by Heaven, as it says (Exodus 30:20) \"They shall wash with water and shall not die.\" And his service is invalid, whether he is the High Priest or a regular priest.",
            "What is the source that his service is invalid? As it says (Exodus 28:43) \"It is an eternal law for him and his descendants.\" And it is regarding the priestly vestments that it is saying \"an eternal law.\" [Therefore] just as a lack of the [proper] vestments desecrates the service [and invalidates it] as we have made clear, so too someone who does not wash his hands and feet desecrates [and invalidates] the service.",
            "The priest does not need to sanctify between each and every service. Rather, once a day he sanctifies, in the morning, and he serves continually the entire day and night. This is so long as he does not leave the Temple, and he does not go to sleep, and he does not become wet [as water transfers impurity], and he does not become distracted. If he does one of these four things, he needs to sanctify again.",
            "[If] he leaves the Temple and returns and serves without sanctifying - if he did not become distracted [from the service], his service is valid. This was the rule in the Temple that no one should enter the courtyard to do the service, even should he be pure, until he dips."
