Even if his thought could be deduced from his actions, it is not considered thought where this would lead to leniency, only to stringency. How so? If a burnt-offering was standing in the south of the altar and the child dragged it over to the north side and slaughtered it, even though from his actions one could deduce his thoughts were for sacrificial slaughter - nonetheless this is invalid."

            "Whenever eating is concerned, it never refers to an amount less than the volume of an olive. So too with burning, it never refers to less than an olive’s volume. Therefore, if one thinks about eating something edible which is less than the bulk of an olive, or of burning something burnable which is less than the size of an olive - whether the thought is [invalid on account of an incorrect] time or place - the sacrifice is valid. If one thought of eating half an olive’s bulk [of the sacrificial animal] outside its correct place [in the Temple] and burning half an olive’s bulk outside of its correct place, or thought to eat half an olive’s bulk [of the animal] after its correct time for eating and burn half an olive’s bulk after its correct time for burning - the sacrifice is valid, because the acts of eating and burning do not combine. However, if one speaks using the language of ‘consuming’, and says that they will consume half an olive’s bulk [of the sacrificial animal] and that the flames [of the altar] will consume half an olive’s bulk, these do combine, because they employ the same language of consumption....       \n"
