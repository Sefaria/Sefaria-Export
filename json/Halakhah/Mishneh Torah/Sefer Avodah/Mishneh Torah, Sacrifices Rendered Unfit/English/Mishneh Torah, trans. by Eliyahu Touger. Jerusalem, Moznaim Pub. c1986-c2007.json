As stated in <i>ibid.</i> 3:18, it is forbidden for an impure person to insert his hand into the Temple Courtyard according to Rabbinic Law. Nevertheless, this person was willing to transgress. Significantly, in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>) the Rambam offers an interpretation that does not require that the person transgress: he slaughtered with a long knife.</i> [he was restricted]. This a decree, lest he touch the [sacrificial] meat.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In which instance he would make the sacrifice impure and disqualify it. That is forbidden.</i>",
            "If [an impure person] transgressed and slaughtered [a sacrificial animal], the sacrifice is acceptable.

Nevertheless, Aaron's name is explicitly associated with the verb <i>vihikriv,</i> \"and he shall offer.\" According to the Rambam, the verse should be interpreted as meaning that the offering of the bull must be performed by the High Priest, not necessarily its slaughter.</i> if a non-priest slaughtered it, it is acceptable. Even a red heifer that was slaughtered by a non-priest is acceptable,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nevertheless, as an initial preference, the slaughter should be performed by a priest (<i>Hilchot Parah Adumah</i> 3:2; 4:17).</i> for there is no slaughter by a non-priest that invalidates [a sacrifice].",

For even if the organs and fats to be offered on the altar, and the meat of sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity, were taken outside [the Courtyard] before [the blood] was presented [on the altar], the sacrifice is acceptable, as will be explained.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Halachot 32-33 of this chapter.</i>",
            "If the entire body of [such an] animal was inside the Temple Courtyard and its foot was outside and it was slaughtered, the sacrifice is unacceptable.

            "If one slaughtered [a sacrificial animal]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From the sacrifices of the most sacred order.</i> while it was located entirely in [the Temple Courtyard], and afterwards, it moved one of its feet outside, he should cut off the meat until he reaches the bone,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He should not, however, cut off the bone, because that would render the animal as blemished before the reception of the blood and thus disqualify it (see <i>Zevachim</i> 26a and commentaries).</i> and afterwards, the blood should be received. If he received the blood and afterwards, cut off the meat, it is disqualified because of the fat of the meat that is outside [the Temple Courtyard].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As indicated by <i>Zevachim, op. cit.</i>, the problem is not because of the blood from the meat that was outside the Temple Courtyard, because our Sages made a distinction between the blood that flows from the animal at the time of ritual slaughter and the blood that remains within its body (see <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 6:4). Nevertheless, the fat from the portion of the animal that is outside the Temple Courtyard becomes mixed with its blood. This blood could also be part of the blood which is received, causing that blood to be disqualified (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, maintaining that sacrificial animals of the highest degree of sanctity become disqualified when they are removed from the Temple Courtyard whether before the blood was presented on the altar or afterwards. Moreover, even if the meat is cut off as the Rambam suggests, the animal will become ritually impure, because there is an unresolved doubt whether our Sages decreed that any animal that is removed from the Temple Courtyard becomes ritually impure. Hence, because of the doubt, we should rule stringently (see <i>Pesachim</i> 85a). The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and Rav Yosef Corcus resolve the Rambam's ruling.</i><br>With regard to sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity, there is no need to cut off [the meat]. Instead, he should bring its foot back inside [the Temple Courtyard], and receive the blood. For [even] if meat from sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity were taken out [of the Temple Courtyard] before their blood was cast [on the altar], [the sacrifice] is acceptable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Provided of course that the animal was returned to the Temple Courtyard, and the blood received there. Even if a portion of the animal was outside the Courtyard, as long as the blood was received inside the Temple Courtyard, the sacrifice is not disqualified. Nevertheless, the portion that was outside the Temple Courtyard is forbidden to be eaten (see Halachah 32).<br>The Ra'avad states that after the blood was cast on the altar, the meat may be taken out of the Temple Courtyard. Rav Yosef Corcus states that this is obvious, because the meat of sacrifices of a less degree of sanctity may be eaten throughout the city of Jerusalem (<i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 11:5-6).</i>",
            "If one hung the animal [above the earth] and slaughtered it in the free space of the Temple Courtyard, it is unacceptable, for [Leviticus 1:11] speaks [of slaughtering animals] \"on the flank of the altar,\" implying that one must slaughter on the ground.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Based on <i>Zevachim</i> 26a, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> interprets this halachah as referring only to sacrifices of the most sacred order. (This is reflected also in the prooftext which refers to such a sacrifice.) Sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity, by contrast, may be slaughtered if they are hoisted in the air, as long as they are within the space above the Temple Courtyard.</i>",
            "If the [sacrificial] animal was on the ground, but [the slaughterer] was hanging in the air and he slaughtered the animal while hanging, this disqualifies sacrifices of the most sacred order. Sacrifices of lesser sanctity, by contrast, are acceptable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Based on <i>Zevachim, op. cit.</i>, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> - and his objections are also seconded by Rav Yosef Corcus - suggests emending the text of this halachah. As stated in Halachah 19, there is a difficulty in receiving the blood of a sacrifice while hanging in the air, because this is not befitting to the Temple service. Nevertheless, slaughtering an animal is not a formal part of the Temple service (and hence can be performed by a non-priest). Therefore there is no difficulty in performing it while hoisted in the air. And as stated in Halachah 20, the open space of the Temple Courtyard is considered as the Temple Courtyard, so it is as if the slaughterer is standing in the Temple Courtyard.</i>",

            "If one was standing in the Temple Courtyard and hung a receptacle over his arm and received the blood in the air, or lifted the animal and thus received the blood in the air, [the act] is acceptable, for the open space above the place is considered as the space itself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus the animal's blood is considered to have been received in the Temple Courtyard.</i>",

If, however, one does this while taking a handful of flour from a meal offering and took the handful with the fibers, it is unacceptable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The difference is that the blood will flow through the fibers, but the flour will not.</i>",
            "Receiving the blood [of a sacrificial animal], bringing it to the altar, casting it on the altar and bringing the limbs [of a sacrificial animal] to the ramp, are all tasks<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., they are considered integral parts of the process of offering a sacrifice and therefore require a priest's involvement.</i> that are only acceptable if performed by a priest who is fit to perform service, as we explained with regard to taking the handful of flour from a meal offering<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 12:23; 13:12.</i> or snipping of the head of a fowl.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that this refer to <i>ibid.</i>, ch. 6.

Hence, in the situation at hand, it would appear that if there is sufficient blood left in the receptacle, the sacrifice should not be disqualified. A distinction can however be made between Halachah 28 which speaks about blood that remains in the body of the sacrificial animal and this situation where the blood is remaining in the receptacle from which other blood was taken (<i>Tosafot, Zevachim</i> 92a). If the blood was not cast on the altar as required by law, the sacrifice is not disqualified and it is acceptable if that service is performed properly by an acceptable priest (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> the sacrifice is disqualified.

            "When a sin-offering of a dove becomes intermingled with a burnt-offerings of doves or a burnt-offering of a dove becomes intermingled with sin-offerings of doves,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned in the previous chapter and notes, a <i>zav,</i> a <i>zavah</i>, and a woman who gave birth are required to bring two doves as offerings, one as a sin-offering and one as a burnt-offering. The designation of the doves for these offerings is made either by the owner at the time of purchase or - and this is the most common instance - by the priest when he offers them. If the person bringing the doves did not designate them, the doves are referred to as a <i>chovah</i>, which we have translated as \"the unspecified group.\"</i> even one in a myriad, they should all be consigned to death.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A dove designated as a sin-offering may not be offered as a burnt-offering, nor may one designated as a burnt-offering be offered as a sin-offering, as explained in Chapter 7, Halachot 5-8. Since the identity of the dove is not known, some of the offerings will be unacceptable. Hence none are offered and instead, they are consigned to die.</i><br>When does the above apply? When their identity had been explicitly determined when they were purchased by the owner, [saying]: \"This is a sin-offering. This is a burnt-offering.\" Different rules apply, however, if one brought doves to fulfill his obligation, some [for] a sin-offering and some for a burnt-offering, without stating explicitly [what each was, instead, they were brought] without specification and then a [dove designated as] a sin-offering or as a burnt-offering became mixed with these undesignated [doves] brought to fulfill his obligation.",
            "What are the appropriate laws? If [a dove designated as] a sin-offering becomes intermingled with this unspecified [group of doves] brought to fulfill one's obligation, only the number of doves to be brought as sin-offerings in the unspecified [group] are acceptable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The rationale is that half of the doves in the unspecified group are sin-offerings. Hence even if another dove that was designated as a sin-offering becomes intermingled with a group of four unspecified doves, there are definitely two doves that can be selected to be offered as sin-offerings (either two are from the unspecified group or one is from the unspecified group and one is the sin-offering that became intermingled).<br>A third sin-offering may not be brought because it is possible that the third dove is from the unspecified group and it should be designated as a burnt-offering.</i> The number of burnt-offerings in the unspecified [group] and the sin-offering that became intermingled with them are disqualified, for a sin-offering has become intermingled with burnt-offerings.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Either the dove designated as the sin-offering is among the three.

It appears to me that [the priest offering the sacrifices] should offer all of them on the lower portion of the altar according to the rites appropriate for a sin-offering.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The expression \"It appears to me\" indicates a conclusion the Rambam reached through the process of deduction without any clearcut prior Rabbinic source. It appears that the Rambam is saying that all of the doves, even those which are disqualified, should be offered on the lower half of the altar. The Ra'avad takes issue with the Rambam, asking how is it possible for him to suggest that unacceptable doves should be offered as sacrifices. (If, he states, the Rambam's intent was that all of the sin-offerings should be offered on the bottom half of the altar, that is obvious and does not need the introduction \"It appears to me.\")<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that with the expression \"It appears to me,\" the Rambam is introducing a new idea. The previous halachah is speaking about an instance where the priest offered only half the doves in the unspecified group on the lower half of the altar. If, however, he offers more than half of the doves (half of the unspecified group and the number of doves designated as sin-offerings that became intermingled with them) on the lower half of the altar, not only is half the unspecified group acceptable, the sin-offerings that became mixed with the unspecified group are also acceptable. The priest is allowed to offer the majority of the unspecified group on the lower half of the altar because the other doves were never specified as burnt-offerings. Although they would have to be offered as burnt-offerings (and hence, are disqualified), since they were never specified as such, they may be offered on the lower half of the altar. Rav Yosef Corcus adds that according to the Rambam, the intent is the sacrifices are acceptable. It is just that the owners can fulfill their obligation only for half of them.</i>",

Therefore if the unspecified group was twice as large as the number of doves that became intermingled with them, half of the unspecified group is acceptable, and half are disqualified.

Were that to have been the case, of the two offered on the upper portion of the altar, only one was acceptable and another dove must be brought as a sin-offering to fulfill her obligation.<br>The above explanations are based of Rav Kappach's edition of the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah. The initial version (preserved in the standard printed texts) reads differently, stating that this situation is considered like a burnt-offering that became intermingled with an unspecified group. See in Chapter 8, Halachah 4.</i> The two should be offered on the upper portion of the altar. [The rationale is that] she made her vow explicit and possibly the two brought because of her vow were offered on the lower portion, thus disqualifying them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For they are burnt-offerings which must be offered on the upper portion of the altar.</i><br>When does the above apply?

If, however, [she brought them from] two types, she must bring four other doves:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here the difficulty is that since the woman specified that the doves for her vow should come from a specific type and the priest did not remember whether he in fact offered that pair of doves as a burnt-offering. In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Kinnim</i> 3:5), the Rambam explains this law. In the original sacrifice, perhaps the two turtle doves that were intended as burnt-offerings were sacrificed on the lower portion of the altar and were thus disqualified. Thus her vow was not fulfilled and she must bring two turtle doves. The two young doves were offered on the upper portion of the altar as burnt-offerings. Hence it is necessary for another young dove to be offered on the lower portion as a sin-offering to fulfill her obligation.<br>It is, however, also possible that the two young doves were offered on the lower portion of the altar.

In the previous halachah, we are speaking about an instance where the woman defined which doves were to be offered for which sacrifice at the time she gave them to the priest to offer and the priest forgot how he had offered them. In this instance, in addition to defining them when giving them to the priest, she pledged to bring them from a specific type and then she forgot which type of doves she pledged to bring for each particular sacrifice.</i> [which types of doves to be offered to fulfill] her vow, saying: \"If I give birth to a male, I pledge two turtle doves,\" and she gave birth and brought four doves:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of one type, as stated below.</i> two for her vow and two for her obligation. The priest offered two on the upper portion [of the altar] and two on the lower portion, but did not know which were offered on the upper portion and which were offered on the lower portion and she also forgot and did not know the type of doves she had pledged for her vow, whether turtle doves or young doves. She should bring two turtle doves and two young doves for her vow.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The doves offered previously as a burnt-offering are of no consequence, because we are not certain that her vow was fulfilled. Because she is in doubt regarding which type she had specified in her vow, she must bring both types to fulfill it.</i> [All] four should be offered on the upper portion of the altar. She should bring another dove to complete her obligation and it should be offered on the lower portion. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam explains that this follows the same rationale as above. One of the burnt-offerings is acceptable. Hence it is necessary to bring a sin-offering to complete her obligation. He continues explaining that this decision is somewhat of a leniency, because it is possible that she will be offering the sin-offering from a different type of dove than the burnt-offering. Nevertheless, since we do not know of which type the original four doves were, this leniency is granted.<br>The above explanations are based on Rav Kappach's edition of the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah. The initial version (preserved in the standard printed texts) reads differently. Similarly, this explanation requires - as suggested by the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> - amending the standard printed text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> to read:<br>it should be offered on the upper portion, for two were already offered on the lower portion as sin-offerings.</i><br>When does the above apply? When originally she brought all of the four of one type. If, however, they were of two types, she must bring six other doves: two turtle doves and two young doves for her vow<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To be offered as burnt-offerings, for as above, it is possible that the ones designated as her vow were not offered as burnt-offerings and she does not remember which type she specified.</i> and for her obligation, she should bring either two turtle doves or two young doves<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In contrast to the previous situations, she must bring two doves to fulfill her obligation.

Hence she must bring an entire pair to fulfill her obligation.<br>The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam's rulings based on his interpretation of the Mishnah in <i>Kinnim</i> (which is also supported by Rashi).

            "There are three improper intents that disqualify sacrifices.

See also <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 4:10.</i> [The animal was designated as] a burnt-offering and [the priest] had the intent that it was a peace-offering, he slaughtered it for the sake of a burnt-offering and a peace-offering, or for the sake of a peace-offering and a burnt-offering, or he did not slaughter the sacrifice for the sake of its owners.

[The priest] slaughtered the sacrificial animal for the correct purpose with the intent of casting its blood [on the altar] after sunset which is not the time at which its blood may be cast, with intent of offering a portion of it that was fit to be offered on the altar's pyre] on the next day, after dawn, which is not the time when it may be offered, or to partake of a portion of it that is fit to be eaten after the time when it is fit to be eaten.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Most sacrifices must be eaten on the day they were offered and on the following night. Certain others may also be eaten on the following day.</i> These are all examples of \"intents [to offer a sacrifice] at an [improper] time.\" Sacrifices [that were slaughtered] with such an intent are called sacrifices that were slaughtered outside their proper time. They are also referred to be the term <i>piggul</i>. This is the meaning of the term <i>piggul</i> mentioned in the Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 7:18; 19:7.

Instead, it is speaking about one who has the intent while offering the sacrifice that it will be eaten on the third day.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the verse states: \"if it was eaten on the third day, it is unacceptable.\" Peace-offerings may be eaten only for two days. The Oral Tradition explains that the intent is not that eating the sacrifice on the third day disqualifies it, but that having the intent that it be eaten on the third day while offering disqualifies it from the outset.<br>Although this interpretation is communicated by the Oral Tradition, there are allusions to it in the Torah's words. The above verse uses the term: \"the one who offers it,\" implying that the disqualification involves the offering. And it uses the phrase <i>venechshav</i> (\"and it will be considered\"), implying that the disqualification has to do with thought.</i> The same applies with regard to every sacrifice that, while offering it, one had the intent to partake of it after the time that is appropriate to partake of that type of sacrifice.<br>Similarly, [the sacrifice is disqualified] if one had the intent to offer portions of it that are fit to be offered on the altar's pyre after the time appropriate for them to be offered. According to the Oral Tradition,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Zevachim</i> 28b explains that since the above verse uses a twofold construction for the term \"eat,\" <i>haechol yaechol</i>, our Sages interpreted it as referring to two types of consumption: consumption by the altar and consumption by man.</i> the following concept was derived: With regard to both consumption by man and consumption by the altar, if one had the intent that [sacrifices] be consumed after the appropriate time, the sacrifice is considered as <i>piggul</i>.",
            "When, however, a sacrifice was not disqualified because of an improper intent, but instead, its blood was cast on the altar in the proper manner, but it remained after the time allotted for it to be eaten, the portion that remains is considered <i>notar</i>. It is forbidden to eat it,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 18, Halachah 10, for more details regarding this prohibition.</i> but the sacrifice was already accepted and atonement was achieved. It is written with regard to the blood [of a sacrifice, Leviticus 17:11]: \"And I gave it to you upon the altar to bring atonement.\" [Implied is that] since the blood reached the altar according to law, the owners achieved atonement and the sacrifice was acceptable. Therefore the concept of <i>piggul</i> applies only to entities that possess services that will enable [them to be consumed] either by men or by the altar, as will be explained.<br>The same laws apply if one had one of these three disqualifying intents when slaughtering a sacrifice, receiving its blood, taking its blood to the altar, or casting it on the altar.",
            "We derive from the above that it is with regard to these four services that a sacrifice can be disqualified because of an [improper] intent: slaughter, receiving the blood, bringing it [to the altar], and casting it on the altar.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The rationale is that these four services are necessities for the offering of a sacrifice (<i>Zevachim</i> 1:4.)</i>",
            "A fowl [can be disqualified because of an improper intent] in two services: <i>melikah</i> and squeezing out the blood [on the altar].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i> 6:7), the Rambam writes that performing <i>melikah</i> is equivalent to slaughter and squeezing a fowl's blood on the altar equivalent to casting an animal's blood. In this instance, there are no parallels to receiving the blood or carrying it to the altar.</i>",
            "The meal-offerings from which a handful is taken [can be disqualified because of an improper intent] in four services: taking the handful, placing the handful in a sacred utensil, bringing the utensil to the altar, and casting it on the pyre.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For these four services are comparable to the four services mentioned in Halachah 4 (<i>Zevachim</i> 13b). As the Rambam writes in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 1:3) separating the handful is equivalent to ritual slaughter and the handful of meal, equivalent to the blood of a sacrificial animal.</i>",
            "If, however, one had an improper intent while performing services other than these: e.g., one had such an intent when skinning [sacrificial animal], when cutting it into pieces, when bringing its internal organs and fats to altar,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">All of these services are not essential to the offering of a sacrifice.

            "What is meant [by the concept that these principles apply only with regard] to \"performing service with an entity fit for service\"?

Hence even if one had the intent to offer it as another type of offering, that intent is of no consequence. (The meal-offering of a <i>sotah</i> is also brought from barley, but there are fundamental differences between it and the <i>omer</i> offering.)<br>The Rambam's understanding is based on his understanding of <i>Menachot</i> 5b which states that the <i>omer</i> offering is a <i>chidush</i>, something new and different than other meal-offerings, for it is from barley, as explained. The Ra'avad follows a different version of the text which states that the <i>omer</i> offering is different, because it is brought from <i>chadash</i>, wheat from the new harvest.<br>There is an advantage to the Ra'avad's understanding, because - as he explains - according to the Rambam, the same rationale could seemingly be used with regard to the <i>sotah</i> offering mentioned in the second clause of the halachah. There would be no necessity to mention frankincense. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> favors the Rambam's version and explains that by mentioning frankincense, our Sages (and the Rambam) chose one of two possible answers.

For example, one slaughtered [an animal designated as] a burnt-offering as a peace-offering. It does not fulfill the obligation of the owner, neither for the burnt-offering for which he is obligated or for a sin-offering. Instead, he is obligated to bring another sacrifice.

It is only when the blood is cast on the altar for the sake of another person that he is not considered to have fulfilled his obligation. Nevertheless, the Rambam's statements can be interpreted as referring to an instance when one slaughtered the animal with the intent to cast its blood on the altar for the sake of another person.</i><br>When does the above apply? When one changed the purpose of the sacrifice intentionally. If, however, one erred and had the impression that the [animal designated as] a burnt-offering was [designated as] a peace-offering and carried out all of its services for the sake of a peace-offering, the owner is considered to have fulfilled his obligation.

If, however, he partakes of an olive-sized portion of the blood, he is not liable for <i>karet</i>, because [the casting of] the blood permits the fats and the organs to be offered on the altar and [the offering of] the fats and the organs permit the meat [to be eaten by] a person.

The Ra'avad mentions, based on <i>Pesachim</i> 83a, it can be concluded that only bones that had marrow and which were cracked open and the marrow removed must be burnt. If they have no marrow at all, there is no need to burn even the bones of the Paschal sacrifice.<br>According to this view, the difference between the law governing the bones of the Paschal sacrifice and those of other sacrifices can be explained as follows. It is forbidden to break open the bones of the Paschal sacrifice. Therefore if the bones of a Paschal sacrifice were broken open, we can assume that this was done after the Paschal sacrifice became <i>notar</i>, for, according to many authorities, there is no prohibition against breaking the bones of a Paschal sacrifice once it has been disqualified. In such a situation, the bones are forbidden, because they served <i>notar</i> (i.e., the marrow). (See the gloss of the <i>Mishneh LiMelech</i> who notes that in <i>Hilchot Korban Pesach</i> 10:6, the Rambam writes that even in such a situation, it is forbidden to break the bones of a Paschal sacrifice, and offers a possible resolution.)<br>With regard to other sacrifices, by contrast, there is no prohibition against breaking their bones even during the time the sacrifice is acceptable. Hence we can assume that they were broken during that time and the marrow removed. Thus there is little likelihood that they served <i>notar</i> and thus became forbidden. According to this understanding, if a sacrifice was <i>notar</i>, any bone that contains marrow should be burnt.

            "[If] any of the entities that must be buried [are burnt], it is forbidden to benefit from their ashes. It is permitted to benefit from the ashes of all of the entities that must be burnt, [even if] they are sacred, with the exception of the ashes of the outer and inner altars and the ashes of the <i>Menorah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Temurah, op. cit.</i>, derives this concept from the exegesis of the statements of Leviticus 25:3 with regard to the ash of the inner altar. From those statements, a parallel is established with regard to the other ashes mentioned here.<br>The Ra'avad takes issue with the Rambam and maintains that it is only forbidden to benefit from the ashes which the priest removes when taking out the ash in the morning. He maintains that the ash on the altar is permitted. The Rambam, by contrast, maintains that all of the ash of the altar is forbidden.</i>",
            "None of the entities to be burnt should be buried<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because in all these instances, the mitzvah is that the article be burnt.</i> and none of the entities to be buried should be burnt. [The rationale for the latter point is that] even though he is stringent by burning it, he is being lenient with regard to its ash, for the ashes of the entities that are buried are forbidden.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">While the ash of entities that are to be burnt is permitted.</i>",
            "If a person was offering sacrifices together with [a priest] and he told him: \"[The sacrifices became] <i>piggul</i>,\" or if he was involved with entities that are ritually pure with a person and he told him, \"They became impure,\" his word is accepted.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad states that, on the basis of <i>Gittin</i> 54b, both of these statements should be understood as applying while the article in question is in that person's hands. The rationale is that since he could now make the article <i>piggul</i> or impure, his word is accepted when he says that it was previously brought to that state.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that although that is the opinion of Abbaye in <i>Gittin, loc. cit.</i>, Ravva differs, maintaining that the law applies even when the articles in question are not in his hand. Generally, the halachah follows Ravva's opinion, but in this instance, Abbaye's view is favored.</i> A Jew is not suspected of lying in such an instance.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For this would cause acceptable sacrifices to be burnt unnecessary, and articles and pure entities to be destroyed.</i> If, by contrast, he told him: \"The sacrifices which I offered for you on this and this day became <i>piggul</i>\" or \"those pure objects became impure,\" [different rules apply]. If [the person is one] whom he trusts, he should rely on his word. If not, according to the letter of the law, his word [need] not be relied upon. One who wishes to be stringent<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And accept the other person's statements.</i> is praiseworthy.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The wording of the Talmud that the Rambam quotes, \"according to the letter of the law, his word [need] not be relied upon,\" implies that it is desirable to go beyond the letter of the law. See the parallels in <i>Hilchot Korban Pesach</i> 4:1; <i>Hilchot Mitamei Mishkav UMoshav</i> 13:8.</i>"
