            "Whenever a person inadvertently violates one of the negative commandments that involve a deed and for which one is liable for <i>karet</i>, he is obligated to bring a sin-offering. It is a positive commandment for him to offer a sin-offering for his inadvertent transgression.",
            "All transgressions for which one is liable for <i>karet</i> for their willful violation, one is liable to bring a sin-offering for their inadvertent violation except for three transgressions: blasphemy, negating circumcision, and negating the Paschal sacrifice. Negating circumcision and the Paschal sacrifice does not require such an offering, because they are positive commandments and a sin-offering is brought only for the inadvertent violation of a negative commandment, as Leviticus 4:27 states that the offering should be brought for violating: \"one of the commandments of God that forbids an act to be performed.\" And blasphemy does not involve a deed. Thus a sacrifice is not necessary, because Leviticus 4:27 states: \"Acting in violation of one.\"",
            "With regard to all the transgressions punishable by <i>karet</i> in the Torah except for the three which were mentioned, if a private individual violated one of these prohibitions inadvertently, he must bring a fixed sin-offering with the exception of an impure person who partook of sacrificial meat and an impure person who entered the Temple. These two do not bring a fixed sin-offering, but rather an adjustable guilt-offering, as will be explained.",
            "Only an animal is brought as a fixed sin-offering. In contrast, an adjustable guilt-offering is a sacrifice whose object is not fixed. If one is rich, he must bring an animal as a sin-offering. If he is poor, he brings a fowl or a tenth of an <i>ephah</i> as a meal-offering, as will be explained. Thus all the sins for which a private person brings a fixed sin-offering are 43. They include:<br>a) one who is intimate with his mother,<br>b) one who is intimate with his wife's mother,<br>c) one who is intimate with his maternal grandmother,<br>d) one who is intimate with his paternal grandmother,<br>e) one who is intimate with his daughter,<br>f) one who is intimate with his daughter's daughter,<br>g) one who is intimate with his son's daughter,<br>h) one who is intimate with his wife's daughter,<br>i) one who is intimate with the daughter of his wife's daughter,<br>j) one who is intimate with the daughter of his wife's son,<br>k) one who is intimate with his sister,<br>l) one who is intimate with his sister who is the daughter of his father's wife,<br>m) one who is intimate with his father's sister,<br>n) m) one who is intimate with his mother's sister,<br>o) one who is intimate with his wife's sister,<br>p) one who is intimate with his father's wife,<br>q) one who is intimate with the wife of his father's brother,<br>r) one who is intimate with his son's wife,<br>s) one who is intimate with his brother's wife,<br>t) one who is intimate with another man's wife,<br>u) one who is intimate with a woman in the <i>niddah</i> state,<br>v) one who is intimate with a male,<br>w) one who is intimate with his father,<br>x) one who is intimate with his father's brother,<br>y) one who is intimate with an animal,<br>z) a woman who has an animal engage in relations with her. Thus all the prohibitions involving forbidden relations punishable by <i>karet</i> are 26.<br>Among other sins, there are seventeen. They are: a) one who serves a false deity by performing a deed,<br>b) one who gives his descendants to <i>Molech</i>,<br>c) one who divines through an <i>ov</i>,<br>d) one who performs a deed while divining with a <i>yidoni</i>,<br>e) one who desecrates the Sabbath,<br>f) one who performs forbidden labor on Yom Kippur,<br>g) one who eats or drinks on Yom Kippur,<br>h) one who eats <i>chametz</i> on Pesach,<br>i) one who partakes of fat,<br>j) one who partakes of blood,<br>k) one who partakes of sacrificial meat after the time for eating it passes,<br>l) one who partakes of sacrificial meat that was disqualified, because of an undesirable intent concerning time,<br>m) one who slaughters a sacrificial animal outside the Temple Courtyard,<br>n) one who offers a sacrifice outside the Temple Courtyard,<br>o) one who prepares anointing oil like that used in the Temple,<br>p) one who prepares incense like that used in the Temple,and<br>q) one who anoints himself with the anointing oil of the Temple. These are the 43 transgressions for which one brings a fixed sin-offering for their inadvertent violation.<br>What is the sacrifice that a person who inadvertently violates one of these transgressions should bring? If he inadvertently violated the prohibition against worshiping a false deity, he must bring a female goat in the first year of its life. This is the sacrifice mentioned in the portion <i>Shelach Lecha</i>. This applies whether the transgressor is an ordinary person, a king, a High Priest, or the priest anointed to lead the people in war. Every one is equal with regard to the inadvertent transgression of the worship of false divinities.<br>If, however, one inadvertently violated one of the other 42 transgressions mentioned above, different rules apply. If the transgressor was an ordinary person, he should bring a she-goat or a ewe. This is the sin offering of one of the common people mentioned in the portion <i>Vayikra</i>. If the king inadvertently violated one of these trangressions, he should bring a male goat as a sin-offering. If the transgressor is an anointed priest, he should bring a bull, the offspring of an ox as a sin-offering. It is burnt, as described there.",
            "The same laws apply whether one person inadvertently violates one of these transgressions or many do, as implied by Numbers 15:29: \"There will be one law for those who transgress inadvertently.\"<br>What is implied? If the people of a city inadvertently transgressed and thought the day was an ordinary day, but it was Yom Kippur. As a result, they all ate and performed work, each one of the transgressors should bring two sin-offerings, ewes or she-goats. Similarly, if they all inadvertently transgressed and offered incense to a false deity, each one of the transgressors must bring a goat in its first year of life as a sin-offering."

            "A person is not liable for a sin-offering for an inadvertent transgression unless he acts inadvertently from the beginning to the end. If, however, he acted inadvertently at the beginning, but acted willfully at the end or began acting willfully, but acted inadvertently at the end, he is exempt from the obligation to bring a sin-offering.<br>What is implied? A person transferred an article from one domain to another on the Sabbath. If one lifted up the article willfully, but placed it down inadvertently or lifted it up inadvertently, but placed it down willfully, he is exempt. To be liable for a sin-offering, he must lift it up inadvertently and place it down inadvertently. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.",
            "If a person violated a transgression knowing that involved violation of a negative commandment, but he did not know that he is liable for <i>karet</i> for its violation, he is considered to have transgressed inadvertently and he must bring a sin-offering. If, however, he did know that it was punishable by <i>karet</i>, but was unaware of the obligation for a sacrifice, i.e., he did not know whether or not he was liable for a sacrifice for the transgression, he is considered to have acted willfully. For the lack of knowledge concerning a sacrifice is not considered as a lack of knowledge concerning these transgressions for which one is liable for <i>karet</i>.",
            "When a person does not know the nature of the transgression that he violated, even though he definitely knows that he violated a negative commandment punishable by <i>karet</i>, he is exempt from bringing a sin-offering, as implied by Leviticus 4:23: \"that he transgressed with regard to it,\" implying that he must know the transgression that he violated.<br>What is implied? There was a piece of forbidden fat and meat from a sacrifice left beyond its permitted time before him and he partook of one of them, but did not know which he ate; his wife who was in the <i>niddah</i> state and his sister were at home, he inadvertently was intimate with one of them, but did not know with whom he had relations; the Sabbath and Yom Kippur passed, he performed a forbidden labor on one of them, but did not know on which, he is exempt from the obligation to bring a sin-offering.",
            "If a person transgressed, became aware of the transgression, and then forgot which transgression he violated, he should bring a sin-offering for whichever transgression he violated. This offering should be eaten, like the other sin-offerings that are eaten.",
            "If one inadvertently committed one transgression, but there are two persons involved and he is unaware of the one with whom he committed the transgression, he is liable.<br>What is implied? There were two women in the <i>niddah</i> state. Inadvertently, he was intimate with one of them, but he did not know with whom. He had two sisters. Inadvertently, he was intimate with one of them, but he did not know with whom. In these instances, he is liable for a sin-offering. To what can this be compared? To two lamps that are burning and one extinguished one of them on the Sabbath without knowing which one he extinguished or two pots of forbidden fat from which he ate one and yet, he did not know the identity of the one from which he ate.In these instances, he is liable. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.",
            "In all situations when a person is obligated to bring a fixed sin-offering for his inadvertent transgression and he transgressed inadvertently and he becomes aware of the transgression after violating it, he is liable for a sin-offering, even though initially, he was not aware that this act is a a transgression.<br>What is implied? A child was captured by gentiles and raised by them without knowing who are the Jewish people or what their faith is. He performed labor on the Sabbath, ate forbidden fat, blood, and the like. When he discovers that he is Jewish and commanded to eschew all of the above, he is obligated to bring a sin-offering for every particular sin. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.",
            "When a person transgresses unintentionally by engaging in forbidden sexual relations or partaking of forbidden foods, he is liable for a sin-offering. If he does so with regard to the Sabbath, he is exempt from the obligation of a sin-offering.<br>What is implied? If he was acting casually with a woman and engaged in relations with her without intending to engage in relations and she is forbidden to him as an <i>ervah</i>, he is liable for a sin-offering. This ruling also applies if he thought that what was in his mouth was spittle and he swallowed it without the intent of eating at all and then he discovered that it was forbidden fat. If, by contrast, his intent was to lift up produce that was already cut and instead, he cut off a plant that was growing without intending to cut it off, he is exempt from a sin-offering, for the Torah forbade only the performance of purposeful labor, as explained in the appropriate place.",
            "Whenever one performs one of the mitzvot and while he was performing it, a transgression punishable by <i>karet</i> was violated inadvertently, he is not liable for a sin-offering, because the person was acting with license.<br>What is implied? A man engaged in intimacy with his <i>yevamah</i>. She was in the <i>niddah</i> state, but he was unaware. He is exempt from a sin-offering, for he acted with license. If, by contrast, one was intimate with his wife when she was in the <i>niddah</i> state, he is liable, because he did not ask her before engaging in relations. With regard to his <i>yevamah</i>, however, he is not familiar with her, so that he might ask her.<br>Similarly, if a person had two infants to circumcise, one, on the Sabbath, and one on Friday or on Sunday, should he have forgotten and circumcised them both on the Sabbath, he is exempt from bringing a sin-offering. For he was licensed to circumcise one of them on the Sabbath, the Sabbath laws are suspended in his regard, and he performed a mitzvah. Even though two bodies are involved, since it is a pressing time, he is not precise. If, however, neither of the children was scheduled to be circumcised on the Sabbath and on the Sabbath, he circumcised a person who was not fit to be circumcised on the Sabbath, he is liable for a sin-offering.",
            "The following rules apply when a proficient expert comes to circumcise a child before sunset on the Sabbath and he is told: \"There is not enough time in the day left to perform the circumcision. If you begin circumcising, you will not be able to complete the act before the Sabbath departs. Thus you will have made a wound on the Sabbath without performing a mitzvah.\" If he says: \"I am familiar with the task and deft and I will circumcise him speedily,\" should he not complete the circumcision until after the conclusion of the Sabbath, he is liable for a sin-offering, for they warned him.",
            "When a person takes a <i>lulav</i> out to the public domain on the first day of Sukkot which falls on the Sabbath in order to fulfill his obligation or carries it four cubits in the public domain inadvertently, he is exempt from a sin-offering, because he acted with license.<br>Similarly, if one slaughters an animal for a Paschal sacrifice on the fourteenth of Nisan which fell on the Sabbath and afterwards, he discovered that the owners removed their connection from it, they died or became impure before it was slaughtered, or it became <i>tereifah</i> in a hidden place, e.g., its intestines or lungs were perforated, he is exempt, because he slaughtered it with license. If, however, it was discovered to be blemished or there was a readily apparent factor that caused it to be deemed <i>tereifah</i>, he is liable for a sin-offering, since he should have checked it before slaughtering. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.",
            "If one slaughtered a Paschal sacrifice on the Sabbath for the sake of another sacrifice in error, he is exempt, because the sacrifice is acceptable. For supplanting the designation of a sacrifice in error is not considered of consequence, as explained in <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i>.",
            "The following rules apply if, on the Sabbath, one slaughtered animals designated for other sacrifices for the sake of a Paschal sacrifice in error. If they are fit to serve as a Paschal sacrifice, he is free from the obligation of bringing a sin-offering, because he slaughtered with license. If they are not fit to serve as a Paschal sacrifice, e.g., the animal was female or in its second year of life, he is liable for a sin-offering, because they are not fitting for this sacrifice.<br>Similarly, one is liable for a sin-offering if he slaughtered an animal as a Paschal sacrifice on the Sabbath for the sake of individuals who cannot partake of it, for those who were not enumerated on it, for the uncircumcised, or for the ritually impure. If, however, he slaughtered it on the Sabbath for the sake of individuals who can partake of it and for those who cannot partake of it, for those enumerated on it and for those who were not enumerated on it, for the circumcised and for the uncircumcised, or for the pure and for the impure, he is exempt from bringing a sin-offering, because the Paschal sacrifice is acceptable. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.",
            "When a person slaughters an animal designated for a communal sacrifice on the Sabbath for an intent other than that for which it was designated, he is obligated to bring a sin-offering. Nevertheless, the fats and the organs from the sacrificial animal should be offered on the altar's pyre on Saturday evening. Similarly, if on the Sabbath one slaughtered other animals besides those required as the day's obligations, he is liable for a sin-offering for the additional animal.",
            "A person who slaughters animals for individual sacrifices whose offering does not supersede the Sabbath prohibitions on the Sabbath inadvertently is liable for a sin-offering. One is, however, permitted to benefit from the meat of those sacrifices and the blood should not be cast on the altar. If he transgressed and cast the blood on the altar for the intent of those sacrifices whether without knowing it is a transgression or knowingly, the owner is considered to have fulfilled his obligation, the organs and fats may be offered on the altar's pyre, and the meat should be eaten. The one who slaughtered the animal should bring a sin-offering for his inadvertent violation.",
            "The following laws apply when, on the Sabbath, there were two animals designated for communal offerings before a priest, one lean, and one stocky, and the sacrificial obligation of the day required - as either a sin-offeringor a burnt-offering - the offering of only one of them and he inadvertently slaughtered them both. If he slaughtered the lean one first and afterwards, slaughtered the stocky one, he is exempt from the obligation to bring a sin-offering. Indeed, he is told: \"Bring the stocky animal and slaughter it as an initial preference.\" If, however, he slaughtered the stocky animal initially and then the lean one, he is liable for a sin-offering for the additional slaughter.<br>Nevertheless, in the latter instance, there is room for leniency if the stocky animal was slaughtered first and discovered to be <i>tereifah</i> because of a disqualifying factor in its intestines. Even though he did not know that the stocky one was <i>tereifah</i> when he slaughtered the lean one and he did not have that intent, since the last one was slaughtered as required by law, he is exempt from a sin-offering for its slaughter.<br>A similar law also applies if one spreads out a net to catch fish at sea on the Sabbath unknowingly and lifts up a child with the fish, he is exempt from bringing a sin-offering. Even though his intent was only to catch fish, since he acted unknowingly and lifted up a child with the fish, he is exempt whether he heard that a child had fallen into the sea or not, he is exempt. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.",
            "When, on the night of Pesach, a person had roasted meat from the Paschal sacrifice and meat that was left over from other sacrifices before him and intended to partake of the roasted meat which is a mitzvah and inadvertently partook of the leftover meat, he is liable for a sin-offering, since he did not perform a mitzvah when eating. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations."

            "When witnesses testify that a person violated a transgression that is punishable by a fixed sin-offering, but they did not warn him, instead, they told him: \"We saw that you performed forbidden labor on the Sabbath\" or \"...that you partook of forbidden fat\" and he replied: \"I know that I did not perform that act,\" he is not liable for a sin-offering. The rationale is that since he would be exempt from bringing the sacrifice if he said: \"I acted intentionally,\" when he says: \"I did not eat\" or \"I did not perform,\" it is as if he said: \"I did not eat inadvertently, but rather intentionally,\" in which instance, he is exempt from bringing the sacrifice and did not contradict the witnesses.",
            "If the alleged transgressor remained silent and did not contradict the witnesses - indeed, even if a woman told him: \"You partook of forbidden fat\" or \"...performed forbidden labor on the Sabbath\" and he remained silent - he is liable to bring a sin-offering. If one witness told him: \"This is forbidden fat\" and he remained silentand then he partook of it inadvertently, he must bring a sin-offering. If he warned him, he is liable for lashes, even though the essence of the testimony depends on one witness.",
            "We already explained in <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> that a person who set aside a sin-offering for eating forbidden fat should not bring it for the desecration of the Sabbath or for partaking of blood, as implied by Leviticus 4:28 which states: \"And he shall bring his sacrifice, a she-goat... for the transgression that he committed.\" The sacrifice must be for the sake of the particular sin; one should not offer one designated for one sin for another. If he offered it, he disqualifies it.<br>In addition, our Sages said that if one set aside a sin-offering for forbidden fat that he ate on the previous day, he should not bring it for fat that he eats on the present day. Nevertheless, if he brings it for that purpose, he finds atonement. Needless to say, if a father sets aside a sin-offering and dies and the son was liable for that same transgression, the son should not bring his father's sacrifice for his transgression, as explained there.",
            "When a person brings an animal as a sin-offering for two transgressions, it should be left to pasture until it contracts a disqualifying blemish and be sold. Half of the proceeds should be used to bring a sin-offering for one transgression and half for a sin-offering for the second transgression.<br>Similarly, if two people bring one animal as a sin-offering for two transgressions, it should be left to pasture until it contracts a disqualifying blemish and be sold. One should bring his sin-offering with half of the proceeds and the other should bring his sin-offering with the other half.",
            "If one brings two animals as sin-offerings for one transgression, he should sacrifice whichever one he desires. The second should be left to pasture until it contracts a disqualifying blemish and be sold. A freewill offering should be brought with the proceeds.",
            "If, however, a person brings two animals for sin-offerings for two transgressions without specifying the transgression for which each sacrifice is being brought, he should make that determination and slaughter one for one transgression and the other for the second.",
            "We already explained in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i>, that no sacrifices at all are accepted from an apostate who worships idols or desecrates the Sabbath in public. When a person is an apostate with regard to a particular sin, we do not accept a sin-offering for him for that sin.<br>What is implied? If a person was an apostate with regard to partaking of forbidden fat and then he inadvertently partook of fat and brought a sin-offering for this transgression, it is not accepted until he repents.<br>Even if he was an apostate with regard to partaking of forbidden fat to fulfill his desires and once he accidentally partook of forbidden fat instead of permitted fat and he brought a sacrifice in atonement, it is not accepted from him. Since he partook of the forbidden fat willfully, whether to purposefully anger God or merely to fulfill his desires, he is considered as an apostate with regard to that transgression.<br>If a person was an apostate with regard to partaking of forbidden fat and then he inadvertently partook of blood, we accept a sin-offering he brings for partaking of blood, as we explained.",
            "When a person committed a transgression punishable by <i>karet</i> inadvertently and set aside an animal as a sin-offering, and afterwards, became an apostate and then repented or he lost control of his intellectual or emotional faculties and then regained control, that animal may be brought as a sacrifice even though there was a time when it was not to be offered. The rationale is that living animals are not deemed unacceptable forever, as we explained in <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i>. Therefore that animal itself should be sacrificed. Just like if it contracted a temporary blemish and was healed, it returns to an acceptable state, so too, if the owners became disqualified and then became acceptable, it should be sacrificed.",
            "Those liable for sin-offerings and definitive guilt-offerings remain obligated to bring those offerings even after Yom Kippur passed. Those liable for tentative guilt-offerings, by contrast, are exempt after Yom Kippur passes, as indicated by Leviticus 16:30: \"From all of your sins before God will you be purified.\" According to the Oral Tradition, it was taught: Any sin that only God recognizes will be granted atonement. Therefore if a person enters a situation where he is in doubt of whether he transgressed on Yom Kippur, even at nightfall, he is exempt from the obligation to bring a tentative guilt-offering, for the entire day of Yom Kippur generates atonement.<br>Thus we learn that a conditional guilt-offering is not brought for a situation concerning which one does not know which occurred on Yom Kippur, unless Yom Kippur will not generate atonement for that person, as will be explained.",
            "Yom Kippur, sin-offerings and guilt-offerings do not generate atonement unless one repents and believes in the atonement they grant. If, however, one rebels against them, they do not generate atonement for him.<br>What is implied? A person was in a state of rebellion, but brought a sin-offering or a guilt-offering, saying or thinking in his heart that these will not generate atonement. Accordingly, even though they were offered as commanded, they do not generate atonement for him. When he repents from his rebellion, he must bring another sin-offering and/or guilt-offering.<br>Similarly, when one is in a state of rebellion on Yom Kippur, Yom Kippur does not atone for him. Therefore if he was obligated to bring a tentative guilt-offering and Yom Kippur passed while he was in a state of rebellion, Yom Kippur does not generate atonement for him. When he repents after Yom Kippur, he is obligated to bring all the tentative guilt-offerings for which he is liable.",

            "When a person performs many transgressions for which one is required to bring a sin-offering in one lapse of awareness, he is liable for a sin-offering for every individual transgression. Even if he performs all the 43 transgressions that we listed in one lapse of awareness, he is liable for 43 sin-offerings.<br>Similarly, if a person performed one deed for which he is liable for many transgressions, he is liable for every transgression, provided all of the prohibitions involved take effect at once, the latter prohibition causes the entity to be forbidden to additional people, or the scope of the latter prohibition encompasses other entities together with the entity that was originally prohibited.<br>What is implied? A person who slaughters consecrated animals outside the Temple, on the Sabbath, for the sake of a false divinity is liable for three sin-offerings, one for slaughtering consecrated animals outside the Temple Courtyard, one for desecrating the Sabbath, and one for serving false divinities, for the three transgressions take effect at the same time.<br>When does the above apply? When the person serving the false divinity states that he is serving it at the conclusion of the slaughter of the animal. If, however, this was not his intent, as soon as he performed a portion of the slaughter for the sake of a false divinity, it becomes forbidden. Since he is not liable for slaughtering an animal outside the Temple Courtyard until he slits the two organs, necessary to slit for ritual slaughter or the larger portion of these two organs, when he completed the slaughter, he will have slaughtered an animal that is forbidden to be offered as a sacrifice, in which instance, he is not liable for slaughtering it outside the Temple Courtyard, as we explained.<br>If it was a sin-offering of fowl and half of its windpipe was cut and a person increased the slit even the slightest amount on the Sabbath for the sake of a false divinity, he is liable for three sin-offerings, for the three prohibitions take effect at the same time.<br>Similarly, a person who performs forbidden labor on Yom Kippur when it occurs on the Sabbath, is liable to bring two sin-offerings, because the two prohibitions take effect at the same time. Also, a person who is intimate with the wife of his brother who is alive while she is in the <i>niddah</i> state, he must bring three sin-offerings: one because he was intimate with a married woman and one, because she was his brother's wife; these are two prohibitions that take effect at the same time; and one, because she was in the <i>niddah</i> state, which is a prohibition that forbids additional entities besides the entity that was originally prohibited. Since this prohibition would apply with regard to her husband, it also applies to her brother-in-law.<br>In the same vein, one who sodomizes his father is liable for two sin-offerings, one because of the prohibition, Leviticus 18:7: \"Do not reveal the nakedness of your father\" and one because of the prohibition, <i>ibid.</i>:22: \"Do not lie with a man.\" Similarly, one who sodomizes his father's brother is liable for two sin-offerings, one because it is written <i>ibid.</i>:14: \"Do not reveal the nakedness of your father's brother\" and one because of the general prohibition against sodomy.<br>When one sodomizes a male and has a male sodomize him in one lapse of awareness, he is liable for only one sin-offering, even though there are two bodies involved. This is derived from the prohibition: \"Do not lie with a man\" which makes both positions equally liable. Similarly, when one sodomizes an animal and has an animal sodomize him in one lapse of awareness, he is liable for only one sin-offering. One is deemed equally liable for either position of intimacy when engaging in relations with an animal or a male.",
            "It is possible that there be an instance where a person engages in a single act of intimacy and he is liable for eight sin-offerings.<br>What is implied? Jacob begat a daughter whose name was Timna from his wife Zilpa. Lavan married Timna and begat a daughter named Serach from her. Lavan does not have any daughters other than Rachel. Thus Serach is the daughter of Jacob's daughter, and his wife's sister on her father's side. These are two prohibitions that take effect at the same time. Serach married Reuven. She became forbidden to Jacob's other sons and thus became forbidden to Jacob as well, as his son's wife. If Reuven died or divorced her and Serach married Jacob's maternal brother, since she became forbidden to Jacob's other brothers through this marriage, she becomes forbidden to Jacob on another count, because she is the wife of his brother. If her husband died or divorced her and Serach married Yishmael, since she becomes forbidden to Yishmael's other brothers, a further prohibition takes effect with regard to Jacob, the prohibition against relations with the wife of his father's brother. If Yishmael died and Serach became eligible to undergo <i>yibbum</i> with Isaac and Isaac transgressed and performed <i>yibbum</i> with her even though she is forbidden to him as a secondary relation, since she became forbidden to Jacob's other paternal brothers, she also became forbidden to Jacob because she is his father's wife and because she is a married woman, for these are two prohibitions that take effect at the same time.<br>Now if Jacob acted inadvertently and was intimate with Serach when she was in the <i>niddah</i> state, during the lifetime of Isaac, her husband, and during the lifetime of Rachel, Jacob's wife, he is liable for eight sin-offerings because of his relations with her.

If, however, they are not alive, we do not say that since, would this man have had brothers or sons, she would have been forbidden to them, hence she is forbidden to the elder person.

The rationale is that the Torah uses the same phrase, Leviticus 18:17: \"They are close relatives; it is a depraved design\" with regard to relations with a woman and her daughter, her son's daughter, and her daughter's daughter. Thus the Torah considered the three as one body. Therefore the three prohibitions are considered as one.",

A man was intimate with his mother and begat two daughters with her. He was intimate with one of these daughters and begat a son.

For with regard to an inadvertent transgression, the transgressor carries a certain amount of culpability, for he should have checked and been careful. Had he examined the matter thoroughly and been careful in asking questions, he would not have transgressed. Since he did not take the trouble to examine and research the matter before acting, he requires atonement. In this situation, however, what should the person have done? She was pure and they were intimate at a time when menstruation was not expected. This is considered as a matter beyond their control.

            "There are five sins for whose violation one must bring a guilt-offering. It is called a definitive guilt-offering, because it is not brought because of a doubt. They are: a) intimacy with a consecrated maid-servant, b) robbery, c) misappropriation of sacred articles, d) the contraction of ritual impurity by a nazirite, and e) purification from the infliction of <i>tzara'at</i>.<br>What is implied by intimacy with a consecrated maid-servant? When a man is intimate with a consecrated maid-servant whether intentionally or inadvertently, he must bring a guilt-offering, provided she is past majority, aware of the transgression, willfully participating, and she had previously engaged in relations in the ordinary manner, and the relations were completed, so that she will also be liable for lashes, as Leviticus 19:20-21 states: \"There will be an investigation... and he will bring his guilt-offering,\" i.e., she receives lashes and he brings a sacrifice.",

Therefore if two people tell him: \"You were intimate with a consecrated maidservant,\" and he said: \"I was not intimate with her,\" his word is accepted and he does not bring a sacrifice as a result of their statements. For he knows whether or not he completed the relations and his statement: \"I was not intimate\" can be interpreted as \"I did not complete relations.\"",

A man was intimate with a consecrated maidservant many times intentionally or was intimate with her inadvertently, he became aware of the matter, and then he was intimate with her inadvertently again and became aware of the matter - even if the sequence occurs 100 times in 100 lapses of awareness, he is only liable for one guilt-offering. It atones for him for everything, for both his intentional and inadvertent transgressions with her.<br>When does the above apply? When he was intimate with only one consecrated maidservant.

Setting aside a sacrifice creates a distinction. Thus it is as if he offered the sacrifice and then was intimate with the consecrated maidservant again.<br>Similarly, if a man was intimate with one consecrated maidservant five times in a single lapse of awareness, he then became aware of one transgression and set aside a guilt-offering and then became aware of the second, he must set aside another one even though both transgression were committed in a single lapse of awareness. Since he did not become aware of the transgression until after he set aside the offering, it is as if he was intimate with her after he set aside the offering.

The rationale is that the different dishes create a distinction and they are considered as different types of food even though they are not considered as different transgressions with regard to the liability for <i>karet</i>. The rationale for this is that there is an added dimension of severity to the prohibition against misappropriating consecrated property, for one who causes others to derive benefit is liable just as one who benefits, the measure for which one is liable can be accumulated over time, and when an agent performs the mission with which he is charged, the principal is liable.

Although this interpretation was conveyed by the Oral tradition, it is as if it was stated explicitly, for the Torah explicitly obligated an impure person who partook of consecrated food or who entered the Temple for <i>karet</i>.
