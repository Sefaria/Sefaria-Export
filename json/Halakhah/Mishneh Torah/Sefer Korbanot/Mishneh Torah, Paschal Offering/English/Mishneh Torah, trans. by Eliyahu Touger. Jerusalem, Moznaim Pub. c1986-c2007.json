            "It is a positive commandment to offer the Paschal sacrifice on the fourteenth day of the month of Nisan after midday. This offering is brought only from lambs or goats, a male in its first year. Both men and women are obligated in this mitzvah.",
            "One who willfully nullifies this mitzvah and allows the fourteenth of Nisan to pass without him offering the Paschal sacrifice despite the fact that he is not impure or not on a distant journey, he is liable for <i>karet</i>. If he neglected the offering of this sacrifice inadvertently, he is exempt.",
            "The Paschal sacrifice may be slaughtered only in the Temple Courtyard like other sacrifices. Even when sacrificing in high places was permitted, the Paschal sacrifice would not be offered on an individual altar. Anyone who offers the Paschal sacrifice on an individual altar is liable for lashes as if he offered it in the market place, as Deuteronomy 16:5 states\" \"You may not sacrifice the Paschal sacrifice in one of your gates.\" According to the Oral Tradition, it was taught that this is warning not to slaughter a Paschal sacrifice on an individual altar even during the time when sacrificing on the high places was permitted.",
            "The slaughter of the Paschal sacrifice takes place after midday. It should not be slaughtered until the afternoon daily offering is slaughtered. After the afternoon incense offering is brought and the lamps of the <i>Menorah</i> are kindled, they begin slaughtering the Paschal sacrifices and continue until the end of the day.<br>If one slaughtered the Paschal sacrifice after midday, but before the afternoon daily sacrifice was offered, it is acceptable, but one should stir the blood of the Paschal sacrifice until the blood of the daily offering is cast on the altar. Afterwards, the blood of the Paschal sacrifice should be cast after it. If, however, the blood of the Paschal sacrifice is cast before the blood of the daily offering, it is acceptable.",
            "A person who slaughters the Paschal sacrifice at the appropriate time while possessing an olive-sized portion of <i>chametz</i> is liable for lashes, as Exodus 23:18 states: \"Do not slaughter sacrificial blood over <i>chametz</i>, i.e., that one should not offer the Paschal sacrifice while <i>chametz</i> continues to exist in his possession.<br>Whether one slaughters, casts the blood on the altar, or offers the organs and fats, if one of these individuals or one of the members of the company partaking of this Paschal sacrifice possessed <i>chametz</i> in his domain at the time it is offered, he is liable for lashes. The sacrifice is, however, acceptable.",
            "The blood of the Paschal sacrifice should be poured out on the base of the altar. After the blood was poured, its belly should be opened up, the fats and organs to be offered on the altar removed. The fats of each Paschal sacrifice should be offered on the pyre individually. The owner of the sacrifice should take his Paschal sacrifice with its hide to his home in Jerusalem.There he roasts it and eats it in the evening.",
            "When one leaves these fats and organs and does not offer them until they remain overnight and thus become disqualified because they remained overnight, he violates a negative commandment, as Exodus 23:18 states: \"Do not leave over the festive fats until the morning.\" Even though he transgresses, he is not liable for lashes, for the prohibition does not involve a deed.",
            "The fats of the Paschal sacrifice may be offered on the altar's pyre until dawn.<br>When does the above apply? When the fourteenth of Nisan falls on the Sabbath, for fats of sacrifices offered on the Sabbath may be offered on a festival. If, however, the fourteenth fell on a weekday, this leniency is not taken, because we do not offer the fats of sacrifices offered on a weekday on a festival.",
            "The Paschal sacrifice should be offered in three groups, as implied by Exodus 12:6 \"And all of the congregation of the community of Israel shall slaughter it.\" Three collective terms are used \"congregation,\" community,\" and \"Israel.\" There should be no less than 30 people in each group.",
            "If there were only 50 people who came to slaughter the Paschal sacrifice, thirty enter the Temple Courtyard and slaughter their sacrificial animals. Ten depart and another ten enter. Then ten more depart and another ten enter.",
            "If there are less than 50 people who seek to offer Paschal sacrifices, the initial preference is not to offer that sacrifice. If, however, it was offered, it is acceptable. If all the Jewish people slaughtered their Paschal sacrifices at one time, it is acceptable.<br>How is the Paschal sacrifice slaughtered? The first group enters the Temple Courtyard until it is full. Its gates are locked and they begin slaughtering their Paschal sacrifices. As long as they are slaughtering and offering the blood, the Levites recite the <i>Hallel</i>. If they completed its recitation before the group completed its sacrifice, the <i>Hallel</i> is repeated. If they completed its repetition before the group completed its sacrifice, the <i>Hallel</i> is recited a third time. There was never a situation where the <i>Hallel</i> was completed a third time.",
            "For every time the <i>Hallel</i> is read, three blasts are sounded with the trumpets, a <i>tekiah, teruah</i>, and <i>tekiah</i>. Since these sacrifices are not accompanied by libations for the trumpets to be sounded when they are offered, they are sounded when the sacrifices are slaughtered.",
            "The priests stand in lines, holding silver and gold vessels in their hands. One line would all hold silver ones and another, all gold, without them mixing together so that it would be attractive.<br>The vessels did not have flat bottoms so that they would not be placed down and the blood allowed to coagulate.",
            "A slaughterer slaughters the sacrificial animal and a priest receives its blood, gives it to his colleague, who gives it to his colleague - so that many will be involved in the mitzvah - until the blood reaches the priest near the altar. He should pour it in a single action towards the altar's base. He receives a full vessel and returns the empty one.<br>Afterwards, the sacrificial animal is hung and skinned entirely. Its belly is ripped open and its innards are pressed until the filth and waste are removed from them. The organs and fats to be offered are removed, placed in a vessel, salted, and offered by a priest on the altar.<br>How is the sacrificial animal hung and skinned? There were iron pegs affixed in the walls and the pillars of the Temple Courtyard. The sacrificial animals were hung and skinned on them. For those who did not find a place to hang his animal, there were thin, smooth rods. One would place the rod on his shoulder and on his friend's shoulder and hang the sacrificial animal on it and skin it.",
            "After the sacrifice was completed, the gates of the Temple Courtyard are opened. The first group departs and the second group enters. Then the second group departs and the third group enters. The manner in which it was offered the first time was repeated the second time and the third time. When the third group completed its sacrificial service and departed, the Temple Courtyard is washed.",
            "If the fourteenth of Nisan fell on the Sabbath, it was offered on the Sabbath in the same way as it was offered during the week. The floor of the Temple Courtyard would be washed, for prohibitions of the category of <i>shvut</i> are not observed in the Temple, even when the matter is not necessary for the Temple service. For the prohibitions of <i>shvut</i> are released entirely in the Temple.",
            "No one would bring their Paschal sacrifices to their homes on the Sabbath. Instead, the first group would depart with their Paschal sacrifices and sit on the Temple Mount. The second group would depart with their Paschal sacrifices and sit on the surrounding rampart. And the third group would stand in their place in the Temple Courtyard. They would all wait until the conclusion of the Sabbath and then everyone would bring their Paschal sacrifice to his home.",
            "The slaughter of the Paschal sacrifice, pouring its blood on the altar, pressing out its innards, and offering its fats supersede the Sabbath prohibitions. For it is impossible to perform these before the Sabbath, because the sacrifice has a fixed time, as implied by Numbers 9:2 which states that the sacrifice must be brought \"at its appointed time.\" Nevertheless, carrying it through the city, bringing it from outside the Sabbath limits, cutting off its wart with a utensil do not supersede the Sabbath prohibitions, because these activities could be performed before the Sabbath. If, however, he could cut it off by hand on the Sabbath, he may. If it was dried up, he may cut it off, even with a utensil, for the prohibitions defined as <i>shvut</i> do not apply in the Temple at all.<br>Similarly, roasting it and washing out its innards do not supersede the Sabbath prohibitions, because these activities can be performed after the Sabbath.",
            "If one forgot and did not bring a knife, he should not bring it on the Sabbath. Instead, he should place it between the horns of the lamb or in its wool and spur it on until it brings it to the Temple. There he should consecrate it. Although he is having an animal carry a burden for him on the Sabbath, since he is doing this in an abnormal manner and because of the mitzvah, it was permitted.<br>When does this apply? When he has not consecrated his Paschal sacrifice as of yet or said: \"This is a Paschal sacrifice.\" If, however, he consecrated it, he should not have a knife carried upon it, because he is having work performed by a consecrated animal.<br>Why was a person permitted to consecrate his Paschal sacrifice on the Sabbath? Since the sacrifice has a fixed time, it is permitted to consecrate it on the Sabbath. Similarly, a person may consecrate his festive offering on a festival without any concern.",
            "When a person slaughters his Paschal sacrifice and it is discovered to have a disqualifying physical blemish or it is <i>treifah</i>. he may slaughter another one whether on the weekday or on the Sabbath. He may proceed and slaughter one hundred one after the other until one is acceptable or until night falls and his offering of the sacrifice is postponed until the Second Pesach, because he was prevented by forces beyond his control."

            "The Paschal sacrifice should be slaughtered only for the sake of those who were enumerated for partaking of it, as Exodus 13:4 states: \"Everyone... should be enumerated on the lamb.\" The implication is that one should be enumerated on it while it is alive. Those enumerated on a Paschal sacrifice are referred to as \"the members of the company.\"",
            "When one individual sacrifices a Paschal sacrifice for himself alone, it is acceptable, provided he is capable of partaking of it in its entirety. As an initial preference, an endeavor is made not to sacrifice the Paschal sacrifice for the sake of one individual alone, for Numbers 9:12 states: \"They shall offer it.\"",
            "The Paschal sacrifice should be slaughtered only for those who are fit to partake of it. If one of the members of the company was a minor, an elder person, or infirm, he may be counted among those for whom the Paschal sacrifice is slaughtered if he is capable of eating an olive-sized portion. If not, he may not be counted among them, as implied by Exodus 12:4: \"A person according to his capacity to eat,\" indicating that he must be fit to partake of it. Even if the company includes 100, if any one of them is not capable of eating an olive-sized portion, he may not be counted among those for whom it is slaughtered.",
            "A company should not be composed of solely women and servants or minors and servants so that frivolity will not be found among them. A company may, however, be made entirely of women even for the second Paschal sacrifice or entirely of servants. Minors may be counted among the company for whom the Paschal sacrifice is slaughtered, but a company may not be comprised solely of minors, for they are not intellectually mature.<br>Similarly, a company should not be made up solely of the infirm, the elderly, or those in an acute state of mourning. Even though they are capable of eating, since they will eat only a meager amount, it is possible that they will leave over from the Paschal sacrifice and cause it to become unacceptable. If they transgressed and had a Paschal sacrifice slaughtered for such a company, it is acceptable. Similarly, a company should not be made up solely of converts, lest they not be precise concerning it and cause it to be disqualified. If a Paschal sacrifice was slaughtered for such a company, it is acceptable.",
            "If a Paschal sacrifice was slaughtered for people who were not enumerated upon it or for individuals whom none could eat an olive-sized portion or it was slaughtered for the uncircumcised or those impure, it is unacceptable. If it was slaughtered for one who could partake of it and one who could not partake of an olive-sized portion, for those enumerated on it and for others not enumerated on it, for circumcised and uncircumcised, for the pure and the impure, it is acceptable. Those who are fit to partake of it eat according to law; it is as if he did not have the others in mind.",
            "If the Paschal sacrifice was slaughtered for the sake of the circumcised, but its blood was cast on the altar for the sake of the circumcised and the uncircumcised, it is unacceptable. The rationale is that casting the blood is more severe, because it is the fundamental dimension of the sacrifice.<br>If he slaughtered it for the circumcised so that the uncircumcised will derive atonement through it, it is unacceptable, because he had the uncircumcised in mind when casting the blood. If he slaughtered it for the sake of those who would partake of it so that its blood would be cast for those who would not partake of it, the Paschal sacrifice is acceptable, but no one fulfills their obligation with it, because the ones who will partake of it were not in mind when the blood was cast.",
            "When one was healthy at the time the sacrificial animal was slaughtered, but sick at the time its blood was cast or sick at the time of slaughter, but healthy at the time the blood was cast, the sacrificial animal should not be slaughtered, nor its blood cast for him unless he is healthy from the time it was slaughtered until its blood was cast.",
            "A person may have a sacrificial animal slaughtered for the sake of his son or daughter who are below majority and for his Canaanite servants and maidservants, whether with their consent or without their consent. He may not, however, slaughter for the sake of his son or daughter who are above majority or for the sake of his Hebrew servants and maidservants or for the sake of his wife without their consent. If they were silent and did not protest, they are considered to have consented.",
            "If one slaughtered a sacrificial animal for the sake of his son or daughter who are below majority and/or for his Canaanite servants and maidservants and they went and had one slaughtered for themselves, they fulfill their obligation by partaking of their master's sacrifice.",
            "If one slaughtered a sacrificial animal for the sake of his wife, his son or daughter who are above majority and/or for his Hebrew servants and maidservants and they went and had one slaughtered for themselves, there is no greater protest than this. They fulfill their obligation by partaking of their own sacrifice.",

If she was hurrying to go to her father's home on the first festival after her wedding as is the pattern of all women and both her father and her husband slaughtered for her, she should partake of her father's. From this point onward, she should eat at the place she desires, provided it is clear where she desires to eat at the time of slaughter.<br>Similarly, if two guardians sacrifice on behalf of an orphan, the orphan should eat where he desires. When does the above apply? To an orphan below majority. If, however, he is above majority, it is as if he was enumerated on two Paschal sacrifices. And when one enumerates himself on two Paschal sacrifices, he may partake only of the one slaughtered first.",
            "With regard to a Canaanite servant of two partners, if they are untrusting of each other, suspecting that the other will steal the servant, he should not partake of either of their Paschal sacrifice. If they are not untrusting, he may eat where he desires.",

Until there is an olive-sized portion for each one.<br>One may be enumerated upon it and remove himself from it until it is slaughtered. Once it is slaughtered, he may not remove himself from it, for it was already slaughtered on his behalf.<br>The following rules apply when some people were enumerated on a sacrificial animal and others came and enumerated themselves on the same animal. If there is an olive-sized portion for the first, they may partake of it and are exempt from bringing a second Paschal sacrifice. The later ones who were added until there was not an olive-sized portion for each person should not partake of it and are obligated to offer a second Paschal sacrifice.",

If he told me to slaughter a lamb, the lamb should be his and the kid, mine.\"<br>In such a situation, if the principal also forgot what he told the agent, both animals should be taken to the place where sacrifices are burnt.

And one shall be yours on the condition that your master has no portion in it.\" If the shepherd does this, it will be possible for the servant to make the stipulation described above.",

One may not roast it with a metal spit, because the entire spit will be hot and will roast the meat where it touches it.",

One pierces it from its mouth until its anus with a wooden spit and hangs it in an oven with the fire beneath it.. One hangs its legs and its intestines in the oven, outside of it. One should not place them inside of its body cavity, for this is comparable to cooking. They would choose a pomegranate spit to roast it so that it will not cast its sap into the meat and cook it.",

One purchased a servant after the slaughter of the Paschal sacrifice or one had a son whose time for circumcision did not arrive until after the slaughter of the Paschal sacrifice.

Because some of the statutes of the Paschal sacrifice are explicitly mentioned with regard to it. This teaches that it is analogous to the first only in those matters which are stated explicitly regarding it. They are the mitzvot that concern the body of the sacrifice.
