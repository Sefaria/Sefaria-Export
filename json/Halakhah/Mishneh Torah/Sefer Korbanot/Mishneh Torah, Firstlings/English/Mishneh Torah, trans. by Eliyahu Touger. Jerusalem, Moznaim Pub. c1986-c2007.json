            "It is a positive commandment to set aside all the male first issues of the womb, whether among humans, kosher animals, and donkeys. This applies whether the animals are healthy or <i>treifot</i>. Thus Exodus 13:2 states: \"Consecrate unto Me all firstborn, the first issue of the womb among the children of Israel, in humans and in animals.\" All of the above are given to the priests.\"",
            "Firstborn humans and firstborn donkeys are redeemed and the redemption is given to the priests. A firstborn kosher animal should be slaughtered in the Temple like other sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity. Its blood is cast on the altar and its fats and organs are burnt on the altar's pyre, as explained in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i>.<br>The remainder of the meat is eaten by the priests, as Numbers 18:15-18 states: \"You shall surely redeem firstborn humans and you shall redeem firstborn non-kosher animals, but firstborn oxen... you shall not redeem. They are holy.... Their flesh will be for you.\"",
            "When a firstborn kosher animal is blemished - whether it was born blemished or contracted a blemish after being born unblemished - it should be given to a priest. If he desires, he may eat it anywhere, or sell it or feed to whoever he desires, even a gentile, because it is ordinary property, as Deuteronomy 15:21-22 states: \"If it has a blemish - lameness or blindness... the pure and the impure shall partake of it, like a deer or a hart.\" It is the priest's private property.",
            "It is a mitzvah to sanctify a firstborn kosher animal and say: \"Behold, this is holy,\" as Deuteronomy 15:19 states: \"Every firstborn shall you sanctify unto God your Lord.\" Even if the owner did not sanctify it, it is sanctified as a matter of course. It is sanctified upon its emergence from the womb.",
            "The mitzvah of the firstborn kosher animal is observed in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and in the Diaspora. Firstborn animals from the Diaspora should not be brought to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. This is derived from <i>ibid.</i> 14:23: \"And you shall eat before God your Lord... the tithes of your grain, your wine, your oil, the firstborn of your herds and your sheep.\" Implied is that from the place where you bring \"the tithes of your grain,\" you should bring firstborn cattle and sheep. From where you do not bring \"the tithes of your grain,\" you should not bring firstborn cattle and sheep. Instead, those firstborn animals are like ordinary property and should be eaten after they become blemished. If one brings firstborn animals from the Diaspora to Jerusalem, they should not be accepted, nor should they be sacrificed. Instead, they should be eaten after they become blemished.",
            "This mitzvah is observed whether the Temple is standing or not, like the tithes of grain. It does not apply to the offspring of consecrated animals - whether consecrated to be offered on the altar or consecrated for the Temple treasury - while they remain consecrated before they are redeemed.",
            "Everyone is obligated in the mitzvah of setting aside a firstborn issue of a kosher animal: priests, Levites, and Israelites. Even though a firstborn issue is given to a priest, if a firstborn issue is born to a priest, he must offer its blood and fats and organs, as stated. And he must eat the remainder of the meat according to the laws pertaining to a firstborn, as Deuteronomy 15:19 states: \"Every firstborn that is born in your herds and your cattle, you shall sanctify.\" The priests and the Levites are, however, exempt with regard to the mitzvot applying to the firstborn of humans and the firstborn of non-kosher animals, as we explained in <i>Hilchot Matanot Kehunah</i>.",
            "A firstborn animal should be eaten within the first year of its life, whether it is unblemished or blemished, as <i>ibid.</i>:20-22 states: \"Eat it before God your Lord, year after year.... If it has a blemish,... eat it in your gates.\"<br>From when is the year calculated? If it is unblemished, it should be calculated from the eighth day of its life, for then it is fit to be offered as a sacrifice. If it was born blemished, the year should be calculated from the day of its birth, because it could be eaten on that day, provided it was born after a full-term pregnancy. If, however, it is not known whether it was born after a full-term pregnancy, the year should be calculated from the eighth day.",
            "If a firstborn animal contracts a blemish in the midst of its year, it is permitted to keep it for twelve months. If it contracts a blemish at the end of its year, it is permitted to keep it for thirty days from the day it contracted the blemish, even though this delays eating it after its year.<br>What is implied? For example, it contracted a blemish on the fifteenth day before the end of its year, it is granted another fifteen days after its year. If it contracted a blemish after its year, he may not keep it more than 30 days. Afterwards, it must be eaten.",
            "In the present age, a firstborn animal should be left until it contracts a blemish and then eaten.",
            "If a blemish did not appear so that it could be shown to a sage, one may keep the animal for two or three years. Should a blemish appear so that it could be shown to a sage, if the blemish is contracted within a year, it is permitted to be kept for an entire twelve month period. If it contracts a blemish after its first year, one may maintain it for thirty days.",
            "The year of a firstborn animal is a full lunar year, twelve months from day to day. If it was a leap year, it benefits from the addition and it is granted thirteen months.<br>If two lambs were born to a person, one on the fifteenth of the first Adar and one on the first day of the second Adar, when the first day of Adar in the following year arrives, the second lamb is considered to have its year completed. The one born in the middle of the first Adar, by contrast, is not considered to have its year completed until the middle of the Adar in the following year. Since it was born in the extra month, it is counted for it.",
            "If a person transgressed and kept a firstborn animal for more than a year, although he violates a negative commandment, it is not disqualified from being brought as an offering if it is unblemished. If it is blemished, it may be slaughtered anywhere as evident from the prooftext that states: \"the tithes of your grain, your wine, your oil, the firstborn of your herds and your sheep.\" An association is made between the firstborn animal and the tithes. Just as the tithes are not disqualified from one year to the next, so too, a firstborn animal is not disqualified from one year to the next.<sup>41</sup>",
            "A firstborn animal should not be given to a priest directly after it was born, for this is not respectful to the priest. Instead, the owner of the animal should care for it until it matures slightly. Then he should give it to the priest.<br>For how long is an Israelite obligated to care for a firstborn animal? For a small animal, for 30 days. For a large animal, 50 days.<br>If a priest tells him: \"Give it to me in the midst of this time and I will tend to it myself,\" he is not allowed to give it to him, for this is like a priest helping in order to receive his presents. We already explained in <i>Hilchot Terumot</i>that priests who assist in the granaries, the butcher shops, and among the shepherds should not be given their presents as wages.",
            "If the firstborn animal was blemished and a priest told the owner in the interval mentioned above: \"Give it to me so that I can partake of it now,\" or if it was unblemished and he told him: \"Give it to me in this interval so that I can offer it now,\" he may give it to him.<br>It appears to me that a person may give a firstborn animal to any priest that he desires.",
            "When a priest eats an olive-sized portion of an unblemished firstborn animal outside of Jerusalem, he is liable for lashes according to Scriptural Law, as Deuteronomy 12:17 states: \"You may not eat the tithes of your grain, your wine, your oil, the firstborn of your herds and your sheep... in your gates.\"<br>Similarly, a non-priest who partakes of an olive-sized portion of a firstborn animal whether before its blood was poured on the altar or afterwards is liable for lashes. According to the Oral Tradition, it was taught that this admonition applies also to a non-priest who partakes of a firstborn, whether before its blood was poured on the altar or afterwards.",
            "A firstborn kosher animal should not be redeemed, as Numbers 18:17 states: \"But the firstborn of an ox, the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat should not be redeemed. Similarly, it should not be sold if it is unblemished. The rationale is that since the animal is intended as a sacrifice, the priest does not have the right to sell it.<br>In the present age, when there is no Temple, since the firstborn is intended to be eaten, it is permitted to sell it, even though it is presently unblemished. It may be sold either to a priest or to an Israelite.",
            "A priest may sell a blemished firstborn animal, in every age, whether the Temple is standing, whether it is not standing, whether it is alive, whether it has been slaughtered.<br>When one sells a blemished firstborn, he should sell it at home, but not in the market-place, as we explained in <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i>. The meat of an unblemished firstborn animal, by contrast, should not be sold, because it is consecrated meat. Priests who are partners in the ownership of a firstborn animal are permitted to weigh one portion against another.",
            "When a person skins a blemished firstborn animal, he is permitted to skin it in any manner he desires. If he desires to employ the technique called <i>riggul</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As explained in Hilchot Shivitat Yom Tov 3:6, riggul refers to a technique where the hide of an animal is skinned off entirely as one unit via its feet, so that it will be useful as a pouch, as a bellows, or the like. Rashi (Temurah 24a) maintains that this method of skinning is forbidden because it is comparable to performing labor with consecrated animals. The Tur and the Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chayim 307:1) accept Rashi’s view.</i> he may. The same applies to other consecrated animals that were disqualified. If he desired to skin it from the foot up, he may skin it in that manner."

            "If any of the permanent blemishes which disqualify consecrated animals and require them to be redeemed is contracted by a firstborn animal, it may be slaughtered for this reason in any place. We have already explained those blemishes in <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i>. Those that are appropriate to apply to a male animal number 67.",
            "All of the conditions mentioned there which cause a sacrifice to be considered as less than desirable and hence, due to them, a consecrated animal is not offered, but also is not redeemed cause a firstborn not to be slaughtered due to them, nor offered. Instead, the animal remains until it contracts a permanent blemish. Similarly, if a firstborn contracts a temporary blemish, it should not be slaughtered in any place, nor should it be offered. Instead, it should pasture until it contracts a permanent blemish and is slaughtered because of it.",
            "Similarly, if a transgression was performed with it or it killed a human according to the testimony of only one witness or the owner, it was set aside to be worshiped as a false deity or it was worshiped, it should be left to pasture until it contracts a disqualifying blemish, as explained in <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i>.",
            "Neither an animal born through Cesarean section, nor one born afterwards are considered as firstborn animals. The first is not, because it is not the first issue of the womb. And the second is not, because the first preceded it. Even if a female was born through Cesarean section and a male later emerged from the womb, it is not a firstborn.",
            "When a firstborn animal is an <i>androgynus</i>, it does not have any sacred quality associated with it. It is like a female, concerning which the priest has no claim at all. One may perform labor with it and shear it like other ordinary animals.<br>When an animal is born as a <i>tumtum</i>, it is considered as a firstborn of doubtful status. It may be eaten by its owner after it contracts a blemish. This applies whether it urinates from a place that appears to indicate that it is male or it urinates from a place that appears to indicate that it is female.",
            "When a sheep gives birth to an offspring that appears like a goat or a goat gives birth to an offspring that appears like a lamb, it is exempt from the mitzvah of a firstborn, as indicated by Numbers 18:17 which speaks of \"the firstborn of an ox.\" Implied is that it must be an ox and the firstborn must be an ox.<br>If it has some of the distinguishing characteristics of its mother, it is considered as a firstborn and it is considered as having a permanent blemish, for there is no blemish greater than a deviation from the norms of creation, as explained in <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i>.<br>Even if a cow gives birth to an offspring that resembles a donkey, but it has some of the signs of a cow, it is a firstborn that must be given to a priest. The rationale is that, with regard to the species of donkeys, there is a concept of a firstborn. If, however, it gave birth to an offspring resembling a horse or a camel, even if it has some of the signs of a cow, it is merely a firstborn of doubtful status. Therefore it may be eaten by its owners. If, however, a priest takes possession of it, it is not expropriated from his possession.",
            "When a person imparts a blemish to a firstborn animal, since he performed a transgression, he is penalized. License is not granted to slaughter the firstborn because of this blemish until it contracts another blemish on its own accord. If, however, this transgressor dies, his son may slaughter the animal because of the blemish inflicted by his father, for his son was not penalized after him.",
            "If one indirectly caused a firstborn to contract a physical blemish, e.g., one placed a fig on its ear, leaving it there until a dog came and took it and cut off its ear, he caused it to pass through jagged iron and pieces of glass so that its forefoot would be cut off and it was cut off, or he told a gentile to blemish it, the animal should not be slaughtered because of this blemish.<br>This is the general principle: Whenever a blemish was brought about with a person's knowledge, it is forbidden for him to slaughter it because of this blemish. If it was brought about without his knowledge, it is permitted for him to slaughter it because of this blemish.",
            "If one said: \"If this firstborn animal would contract a blemish, I would slaughter it\" and a gentile heard and caused it to become blemished, he may slaughter it, because it was not brought about with his knowledge.",
            "If we saw a person perform a deed that would indirectly cause a firstborn to contract a blemish, it contracted a blemish, but we do not know whether he intended that this blemish be caused, he should not slaughter the firstborn, because of it.<br>What is implied? He placed barley in a narrow place where the walls were studded with thorns, when the firstborn ate the barley, its lip became split. Even if the owner was a Torah sage, he should not slaughter the firstborn because of it. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.",
            "If a firstborn animal was pursuing a person and he kicked it to divert it, or even if he kicked it because it pursued once before, should he have caused a blemish when he kicked it, he may slaughter the firstborn because of it.",
            "When children caused a firstborn to become blemished through sport and similarly, if a gentile caused a blemish intentionally, the firstborn may be slaughtered because of it. If they did so in order to cause it to be permitted, it may not be slaughtered because of it.",
            "When the blood of a firstborn ceased flowing freely, its blood may be let, provided one does not intentionally cause a blemish. If a blemish was caused through the bloodletting, the animal may be slaughtered because of it.",
            "It is permitted to cause a firstborn animal to become blemished before it emerges into the world and the firstborn may be slaughtered as a consequence.<br>When does this apply? When the Temple is not standing. Then leniency is granted, because ultimately the animal will be eaten after it becomes blemished. When, however, the Temple is standing, this is forbidden.",
            "When one witness testifies in the name of another witness that a blemish was not brought about knowingly, his word is accepted. Even a woman's word is accepted if she says: \"This blemish was caused on its own accord in my presence,\" and the animal may be slaughtered.",
            "A shepherd's word is accepted when he states that any blemish that could have been caused by human activity came about on its own accord. The animal may be slaughtered because of such blemishes.<br>When does the above apply? When the shepherd was an Israelite and the firstborn animal is in the possession of a priest. If, however, the shepherd was a priest and the firstborn was still in the possession of its Israelite owner, the shepherd's word is not accepted and we suspect that perhaps he caused it to become blemished so that it would be given to him.",
            "The word of a priest who testifies on behalf of another priest that a firstborn became blemished on its own accord is accepted. We do not suspect that they are acting in collusion with each other.<br>The rationale is that all of the priests are suspect to cause a blemish to a firstborn so that they can partake of it outside the Temple Courtyard. Therefore their own word is not accepted with regard to their own concerns. A colleague may, however, testify on his behalf, because a person will not transgress on behalf of another. Even a priest's children and the members of his household may testify with regard to a firstborn on his behalf. His wife may not, however, because she is considered as his own person.",
            "Leniency is, however, shown in the following instance. A firstborn animal was in the possession of a priest and it became blemished. One witness testified that the blemish came as a matter of course, but we do not know whether the blemish is of the type that enables a firstborn to be slaughtered or not. If the priest who is in possession of the firstborn states that he showed this blemish to an expert and he permitted the firstborn to be slaughtered because of it, his word is accepted. We do not suspect that he did not show the animal to the expert and that the firstborn is considered as unblemished. For the priests were not suspected of slaughtering consecrated animals outside the Temple Courtyard, because this is a sin punishable by <i>karet</i>, as we explained.",
            "Similarly, a priest's word is accepted if he states concerning a blemished firstborn animal: \"An Israelite gave me this firstborn animal after it was blemished. It did not become blemished in my domain.\" As a result, we do not suspect that he caused the blemish. The rationale is that the matter will inevitably become revealed and the priest will be scared to lie, lest the Israelite owner be asked and state: \"It was unblemished at the time it was given to him.\""
        ],
        [
            "A firstborn animal may not be slaughtered because of its blemish unless a ruling to that effect was delivered by an expert who was authorized to do so by the <i>nasi</i> and told by him: \"Give license for slaughter of firstborn animals because of their blemishes.\" Even if a blemish was large and obvious to everyone, license to slaughter it should not be granted by anyone other than an expert who was granted authority.<br>Such an expert may inspect all firstborn animals except his own.",
            "If there is no expert in a locale and the blemish was one of the blemishes that are obvious and distinct, e.g., the animal's eye was blinded, its forefoot was cut off, or its hindfoot was broken, it may be slaughtered with license of three members of the synagogue. Similarly, if a firstborn animal was taken to the Diaspora and contracted a distinct blemish, license for its slaughter can be granted by three members of the synagogue.",
            "An expert should not inspect a firstborn animal in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> unless he is accompanied by a priest, lest the expert tell the owner: \"It is a blemish and it is permitted to slaughter the animal because of it,\" and he slaughter it for himself without giving it to the priest. For although he is not suspect to slaughter sanctified animalsoutside the Temple Courtyard, he is suspect to steal the presents given to the priests.<br>Therefore if the owner was a wise man who is known to be careful in his observance, an animal may be inspected for him without a priest. If the blemish was something obvious to all, e.g., the firstborn's foreleg or hindleg was cut off, since he brought to a sage expert for inspection, we assume that he is careful in his observance. Hence the experts inspects the animal for him even though he is not accompanied by a priest.",
            "When a person slaughters a firstborn animal and afterwards shows its blemish to an expert - even if the blemish is overtly recognizable and will not be affected by ritual slaughter, e.g., its foreleg or hindleg were cut off - since it was not slaughtered with license granted by an expert - it is forbidden to benefit from it and it should be buried like a firstborn animal that died.",
            "When a firstborn had only one testicle, but two sacs, it was sat on its rear, and its genital area kneaded without finding the second testicle, an expert granted permission for its slaughter and it was slaughtered, it is permitted to be eaten even though the second testicle was found clinging to the flanks. Since its genital area was kneaded, the original ruling is not rescinded. If, however, its genital area was not kneaded, even though permission to slaughter it was granted by an expert, it must be buried.",
            "When a person who is not an expert inspects a firstborn and has it slaughtered, it should be buried and he must make restitution from his personal resources.<br>How much should he pay? A fourth of the worth of a small animal and half the worth of a large animal. Why does he not pay its entire worth? Because the owner of the animal was penalized so that he not delay offering the firstborn and so that he not raise a small animal in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.",
            "When a person receives a wage for inspecting a firstborn animal for a blemish, the animal may not be slaughtered on the basis of his rulings unless he was a great expert and the sages knew that there were none like him and they allotted a fee to him for the visit and inspection whether a blemish was found or not.He should not take a fee for any given animal more than once and should continue to inspect it as long as it is brought to him, so that no suspicions will be aroused.",
            "When a person is suspect to sell firstborn animals as ordinary animals, one may not purchase even the meat of deer from him, because it resembles the meat of a calf. One may not purchase from him hides that have not been processed, even the hides of a female animal, lest he cut off the place of the male organ and say: \"This is the hide of a female animal.\"<br>One may not purchase wool from him, even wool that has been whitened. Needless to say, this refers to wool that is still soiled. We may, however, purchase from him spun wool, rolls of wool and processed hides. The rationale is that one will not process the hide from an unblemished firstborn animal, because he fears to leave it in his domain, lest the judges hear and penalize him according to his wickedness.",
            "When one slaughtered a firstborn and sold its meat and afterwards, it became known that he did not show it to an expert, what was eaten was eaten. The owner should, however, return the money paid by the purchasers. What was not eaten should be burned and the money returned. This law also applies when one feeds meat from an animal that is <i>treifah</i>, as will be explained in <i>Hilchot Mikach UMemcar</i>.",
            "The following rules apply when it is discovered that a firstborn was <i>treifah</i>. If it was unblemished and it was discovered to be <i>treifah</i> after it was skinned, the hide should be burnt, as explained in <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i>, and the meat should be buried. If it was slaughtered because of a blemish, the meat should be buried and the priests should be allowed to benefit from its hide, provided it was slaughtered on the basis of the ruling of an expert.",
            "When the meat of a firstborn animal, whether unblemished or blemished, has been eaten according to law, just as it is permitted to benefit from its hide, so too, is it permitted to benefit from its shearings. Nevertheless, it is forbidden to benefit from any wool which is cut off from it while it is alive - and even from wool that it shed, and even to wool that was shed after the animal contracted a blemish. Even after it was slaughtered, and, needless to say, after it died, the wool remains forbidden. For the same wool that was shed from the animal during its lifetime remains forbidden even after these events take place. These same laws apply with regard to the tithes of animals.<br>We have already explained in <i>Hilchot Me'ilah</i> that this decree was instituted only with regard to the firstborn and tithe sacrifices, because they do not come to secure atonement. Hence with regard to these sacrifices, there is room to suspect that the owner will leave them in his domain to take all the wool that sheds from them. This is undesirable, because as we have already explained, it is a mitzvah to eat the firstborn in the first year of its life, whether it is unblemished or blemished.",

It is permitted to benefit from the loose-hanging wool that resembles the animal's other wool. It is, however, forbidden to benefit from the loose-hanging wool that does not resemble the animal's other wool, i.e., its roots are turned in the opposite direction and face its tips, for this is considered as if it were shed while the animal was alive.",
            "When the shearings of the wool from a firstborn animal, even one that was blemished, become intermingled with the shearings of ordinary animals - even one with several thousand - they are all forbidden. The rationale is that the shearings are a significant entity and even the slightest amount causes the entire mixture to be considered as consecrated.<br>When one weaves a full length of a <i>sit</i> of wool from a firstborn animal in a garment, it should be destroyed by burning.

This applies even though it did not depart, nor was it designated as the tenth, because the tenth is consecrated on its own accord.<br>If the tenth died in the corral, the ninth should be eaten after becoming blemished and the eight which departed after being counted are exempt even though the tenth among them was not consecrated to be offered, but instead, died before departing, because once animals have been counted in a manner that was fitting for them to be tithed, they are exempt.",
            "When one brought ten lambs into a corral and proceeded to count, if one of those counted died, he should continue counting and complete the reckoning in its ordinary manner, consecrating the tenth, even though there are only nine that are alive at the time.",
            "If after a person began counting, one of the animals in the corral died, those which were counted are exempt, because once animals have been counted in a manner that was fitting for them to be tithed even though one was not separated for them, they are exempt, as stated. Those that remained in the corral should be left for a later \"threshing floor\" until others are added to them.<br>Similar concepts apply when one had fourteen lambs and brought all of them into a corral and four departed through one opening and were counted, then six departed through another opening and were counted and four remained in the corral. If the four depart through the opening that the six departed, one should be taken as the tithe and all the others are exempt. The four that departed at first through the first opening are exempt, because once animals have been counted in a manner that was fitting for them to be tithed, they are exempt.<br>If the remaining four departed from the opening through which the first four departed, the four that departed at the outset and the six that departed afterwards through the second opening are exempt, because each one of them was counted in a manner that was fitting for them to be tithed. For at the time each of the groups departed, others remained in the corral to complete the counting and the tithing. The four that remained, however, although they departed through the first opening and were counted, were not counted in a manner appropriate for tithing. Therefore they must be included in another \"threshing floor.\"<br>The following laws apply if four departed through one opening, four departed through another opening, and six remained. If all six departed from the same one of the two openings, one should be taken as a tithe and all the lambs are exempt from being tithed again. If, however, the six departed from both openings, some from one and some from the other, the six are included in another \"threshing floor.\" The eight that departed from the two openings at the outset, however, are exempt, for each set of four was counted in a manner appropriate for ten to be counted and the tithe taken, for there were six remaining in the corral.",
            "If there were nineteen lambs in the corral and nine departed from one opening and nine departed from the other opening, the last one should be taken as the tithes and all the previous are exempt, for both sets of nine were counted in a manner appropriate for tithing.",
            "If one was counting and a lamb stuck out its head and the majority of its body from the corral and then returned, it is considered as having been counted in all contexts.",
            "If a person was counting and interrupted the reckoning because his colleague spoke to him or because night fell beginning the Sabbath, he should continue and complete his counting afterwards.",
            "When one was counting those that departed one by one and one consecrated the tenth and one of those which had been counted jumped back into the corral, becoming intermingled with those which had not been counted as of yet and which were not tithed, all of those in the corral are exempt. The rationale is that there is a doubt concerning every lamb in the corral: Is the one that was counted and jumped back in or is it another one? And we have already stated, that all those which were counted are exempt.",
            "If one of the animals selected as the tithes jumped back into the corral and became intermingled with the remaining animals, they should all be left to pasture until they contract a disqualifying blemish. Then they should be eaten after acquiring the blemish."
