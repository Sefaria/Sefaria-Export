            "There are four individuals who are referred to as \"requiring atonement\": a <i>zavah</i>, a woman after childbirth, a <i>zav</i>, and a person afflicted by <i>tzara'at</i>.<br>Why are they referred to as \"requiring atonement\"? Because even after each one of them has become pure from the condition that caused his impurity, he has immersed in a <i>mikveh</i>, and the day of the immersion has passed, the person's status is still lacking. His attainment of purity is not complete to the extent that he may partake of sacrificial foods until he brings the sacrifice required of him. Before he brings this sacrifice, he is forbidden to partake of sacrificial food as explained in <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i>.",
            "When a convert becomes circumcised, but has not brought his sacrifice, although he is forbidden to partake of sacrificial food until he brings his sacrifice, he is not considered as one requiring in atonement. It is merely that failing to bring his sacrifice prevents him from being a complete convert and being from the full-fledged members of the Jewish people. Accordingly, he may not partake of sacrificial foods, because he has not become a full-fledged member of the Jewish people. Once he brings his sacrifice and becomes a full-fledged member of the Jewish people, he may partake of sacrificial foods in the evening.<br>If he brings one dove as a sacrifice in the morning, he may partake of sacrificial foods and bring the second dove at a later time. For the sacrifice of a convert is an animal brought as a burnt-offering or two young doves or two turtle doves both brought as burnt-offerings, as explained in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i>.",
            "The sacrifice brought by either a <i>zav</i> or a <i>zavah</i> is two turtle doves or two young doves, one brought as a burnt-offering and one brought as a sin-offering. The sacrifice of a woman after childbirth is a sheep as a burnt-offering and a young dove or turtle dove as a sin-offering. If she lacks the means for that offering, she must bring two turtle doves or two young doves, one as a burnt-offering and one as a sin-offering. The sacrifice of a person afflicted by <i>tzara'at</i> is three sheep, one as a burnt-offering, one as a guilt offering, and a ewe as a sin-offering. If he does not have the means, he may bring two doves, one as a burnt-offering and one as a sin-offering, and a sheep as a guilt-offering.",
            "Each of the three, a <i>zav</i>, a <i>zavah</i>, and a person afflicted by <i>tzara'at</i>, bring the sacrifices for their atonement on the eighth day after they become purified from their condition. For each one of them must count seven days of purity, immerse on the seventh day, wait until the conclusion of that day, and offer his sacrifices on the eighth day.",
            "A woman does not bring her sacrifices on the fortieth day after the birth of a male or the eightieth day after the birth of a female. Instead, she waits until that day is completed and on the following day, the forty-first day after the birth of a male and the eighty-first day after the birth of a female. This is the day concerning which Leviticus 12:6 states: \"And upon completion of her days of purity for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring....\" If she brings the sacrifices in the midst of these days, she does not fulfill her obligation. Even if she brings these sacrifices for a previous birth in the midst of the days of purity for her present offspring, she does not fulfill her obligation.<br>If these days passed and the individuals mentioned above did not bring the sacrifices for their atonement, they should offer them afterwards. As long as they have not brought the sin-offering for which they are liable, they are forbidden to partake of sacrificial foods. Failure to bring their burnt-offering and guilt-offering does not hold them back.<br>We already explained in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> that a sacrifice may not be brought on behalf of anyone obligated to bring it without their consent with the exception of the sacrifices of those requiring atonement. In this instance, the consent of the principals is not required, as evident from the fact that a person may bring sacrifices on behalf of his sons and daughters who are below majority if they require atonement and allow them to partake of sacrifices.",
            "What is meant by a <i>zavah</i>? A woman who experienced uterine bleeding for three consecutive days at a time other than the days when she usually menstruates. She is considered a greater <i>zavah</i> and is required to count seven spotless days and bring a sacrifice. We have already explained with regard to the laws of <i>nidah</i>, when a woman will be considered as a <i>zavah</i> because of uterine bleeding that she discovers and when she will not be a <i>zavah</i>, but rather a <i>nidah</i> or ritually pure, and when there will be a question whether she is a <i>zavah</i>. In all situations that we said that she was a <i>zavah</i> and should count seven \"spotless\" days, she is obligated to bring a sacrifice and her sin-offering should be eaten. Whenever we said that there is a question of whether she was a <i>zavah</i>, she should bring a sacrifice, but her sacrifice is not eaten. We have already explained that a sin-offering of fowl brought because of a questionable situation should be burnt.<br>We have already explained what type of birth or miscarriage will cause a woman to contract impurity because of birth and which will not cause her to contract impurity. Whenever we stated that she contracts impurity because of birth, she must bring a sacrifice and her sacrifice is eaten. Whenever we stated that she is not impure because of birth, she is exempt from bringing a sacrifice.",
            "When a woman was uncertain whether or not she was pregnant and then miscarried and she did not know the nature of the fetus that she miscarried, whether she was required to bring a sacrifice for it or not, she is considered as a woman in childbirth of doubtful status. She must bring a sacrifice, but her sin-offering is not eaten. Similarly, if two women both miscarried, the fetus that one had carried was mature enough to warrant a sacrifice, but the other fetus was not, and the women did not know which of them had carried which fetus, they should each bring a sacrifice because of the doubt, but neither of their sin-offerings are eaten. For a sin-offering of fowl that is brought because of an unresolved question is burnt, lest the woman bringing it not be liable. In such a situation, this sin-offering would be a non-consecrated animal slaughtered in the Temple Courtyard, from which it is forbidden to benefit, as explained in <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i>.",
            "Whether a woman who gives birth or miscarries gives birth or miscarries to one offspring or many offspring, she may bring one sacrifice that includes all of them. This applies provided the births or the miscarriages take place within the days associated with the prior birth or miscarriage. If, however, they take place afterwards, a separate sacrifice must be brought for the second birth or miscarriage.<br>What is implied? When a woman gives birth to a girl, any miscarriages that occur from the day of that child's birth until the conclusion of the eightieth day are grouped together with the first child. It is as if she gave birth to twins, one after the other, and she is only required to bring one sacrifice. If she miscarried on the eighty-first day or from that date onward, should it be mature enough to require a sacrifice, she must bring a sacrifice for it independently.<br>Should she have given birth to a girl and after sixty or seventy days, miscarry a female fetus, she is exempt from bringing a sacrifice for any fetus she miscarries within the eighty days associated with this second female. Similarly, if she miscarries a third female after sixty or seventy days since the miscarriage of the second female, she is exempt from bringing a sacrifice for any fetus she miscarries within the eighty days associated with this third female. The rationale is that it is taken into account with the third miscarriage and the third birth is taken account with the second birth, because it is within the days associated with it. The second birth is taken into account with the first birth. Thus the woman is required to bring only one sacrifice for everything.",
            "When a woman gives birth to a <i>tumtum</i> or an <i>androgynus</i>, and then miscarries after forty days from the birth of the first child, she should bring a sacrifice for this miscarriage, for perhaps the first one was a male and thus the miscarriage took place after the days associated with its birth. Nevertheless, her sin-offering is not eaten, lest the first birth have been a female and thus the miscarriage took place in the days associated with its birth, in which instance, she is exempt from a second sacrifice.",
            "When there are five births or miscarriages of questionable status for which a woman might be liable or five states of <i>zivah</i> of questionable status for which she might be liable, she may bring one set of sacrifices and partake of sacrificial food. The remainder are not considered as an obligation that she must requite. If she was obligated to bring sacrifices for five definite births or five definite <i>zavah</i> bleedings, she may bring one set of sacrifices and partake of sacrificial food. The remainder are considered as an obligation that she must requite. Similar concepts apply to a <i>zav</i>.<br>If a woman is liable for five definite births or miscarriages and five births or miscarriages of questionable status or five definite births or miscarriages and five <i>zivah</i> bleedings of questionable status, she must bring two sets of sacrifices. One is for the definite obligations. That sin-offering is eaten; the sacrifices for the other definite births remain an obligation for her. And she brings one set of sacrifices for the questionable situations. That sin-offering is not eaten; the sacrifices for the other questionable situations do not remain an obligation for her. She may then partake of sacrificial food.",
            "When a woman converted and it was not known whether she gave birth before she converted or afterwards, because of the doubt, she must bring a sacrifice for the birth, but the sin-offering is not eaten.<br>In <i>Hilchot Shegagot</i>, we already explained that whenever there is an unresolved question whether or not a person requires atonement and Yom Kippur passes, they must bring the sacrifices after Yom Kippur, because it is these sacrifices which make them fit to partake of sacrificial food.",
            "When a woman is obligated to bring a sacrifice for a birth or a <i>zivah</i>, she should bring money for the set of doves and place it in the appropriate chest. She may then partake of sacrificial food in the evening, relying on the assumption that the court of priests will not depart from the Temple until all of the money in the chest is used and sets of doves are offered for it, as we explained in <i>Hilchot Shekalim</i> and in <i>Hilchot K'lei HaMikdash VeHaOvdim Bo</i>.",
            "When a woman brought her sin-offering and then died, her heirs should bring her burnt-offering even if she did not separate it during her lifetime. The rationale is that a lien for the sacrifice was already established on her property and this lien has the power of Scriptural Law."

            "The term <i>zav</i> used by the Torah refers to a discharge of sperm that is released because of an internal sickness that effects the organs of the body in which it collects. When a <i>zav</i> emission is discharged, it is not released with an erection like semen and its release does not involve any desire or satisfaction. Instead, it is drawn out like a barley dough and is dark like the white of an unfertilized egg. In contrast, viable sperm is white and adhesive like the white of a fertilized egg.",
            "If a person releases a discharge which would have caused him to be deemed a <i>zav</i> because of another sickness or because of factors beyond his control, he is not deemed a <i>zav</i>, as implied by Leviticus 15:2: \"A man who will release discharges from his flesh.\" That phrase can be interpreted to mean: He will become impure \"because of his flesh,\" and not due to any other factor.<br>On this basis, our Sages said: we check a <i>zav</i> with regard to seven factors: food, drink, burdens, jumping, infirmity, provocative sights, and thoughts.<br>What is implied? If a person overate or overdrank or he ate or drank foods or beverages that lead to the discharge of seed, he carried a heavy burden, he jumped from place to place, included in this category is also his being beaten on his back, he was sick, he saw a woman and desired intimacy with her, or he thought about sexual relations even if he did not think specifically about a particular woman whom he knew - if any of these factors preceded his discovery of a <i>zav</i> discharge, we account the discharge to it and it does not render him impure.",
            "When a person has a seminal emission, he is not rendered impure as a <i>zav</i> for an entire 24-hour period, for the <i>zav</i> comes as a result of the seminal emission. Similarly, we attribute a discharge to provocative sights and lustful thoughts for 24 hours afterwards. By contrast, with regard to food, drink, jumping, and a burden, we attribute a discharge to them only for as long as this factor causes discomfort.",
            "When a man, whether a gentile or a Jew, becomes circumcised and then sees a discharge, we attribute it to the circumcision as long as he is suffering. When a gentile has a seminal discharge and converts afterwards, he can become impure because of <i>zivah</i> immediately. We do not attribute any discharges in a 24-hour period to the seminal emission.<br>When a minor has a discharge, we do not attribute it to provocative sights and lustful thoughts, for there are no provocative sights and lustful thoughts that will cause a minor to have a discharge. Therefore we check him only with regard to five factors.",
            "Just as we attribute the discharges of a minor to his sickness, so too, we attribute his discharges to the sickness of his mother if he is nursing or in need of her care.<br>When does the statement that we check a <i>zav</i> with regard to these matters apply? With regard to his second discharge of <i>zivah</i>, for that characterizes him as a <i>zav</i>, as will be explained. If, however, he has one discharge due to factors beyond his control and one \"because of his flesh,\" he is impure with the impurity of <i>zivah</i>. Nevertheless, he should also be checked initially, in order to count three discharges so that he will be liable for a sacrifice.<br>He is not checked for the third discharge. Instead, even if he experiences it due to factors beyond his control, since he was already categorized as impure - because the first two discharges that caused him to be characterized as a <i>zav</i> were \"because of his flesh\" - he is therefore obligated to bring a sacrifice.",
            "When a person experiences one <i>zav</i> discharge, his status is equivalent to that of one who had a seminal emission. If he experiences two discharges, this is a <i>zav</i> condition. He must count seven clean days and immerse in \"living water.\" He is not, however, obligated to bring a sacrifice.<br>If he experiences three discharges, he is a <i>zav</i> in the full sense of the term and is obligated to bring a sacrifice. There is no difference between a <i>zav</i> who experienced two discharges and one who experienced three except the obligation to bring a sacrifice. All of these matters are part of the Oral Tradition conveyed from Moses from Sinai.",
            "Whether a person experiences two discharges or three in one hour one after the other or experienced one discharge a day for three consecutive days, he is categorized as a <i>zav</i>. For the Torah made the categorization of a <i>zavah</i> dependent on days, as Leviticus 15:25 states: \"If she will experience a flow of blood for many days,\" It did not make the categorization of a <i>zav</i> dependent on days.",
            "If the <i>zav</i> experienced an interruption of an entire day between one discharge and another, they are not linked together.<br>What is implied? A man experienced a discharge on the Sabbath and a second discharge on Monday, they are not linked together and he is not categorized as a <i>zav</i>. Similarly, if he experienced a second discharge on Sunday ands experienced a third discharge on Tuesday, he is not obligated to bring a sacrifice, for it is not linked to the first two, for there was an interruption of a day between them. If, however, he experienced a discharge during the day and another, on the following night, they are linked together. Needless to say, if he experienced one discharge at night and the second, on the following day, that they are linked together. Similarly, if he experienced three discharges, one on each of three consecutive nights, they are linked together.",
            "There is no minimum measure for the discharge of a <i>zav</i>. Instead, even a discharge of the slightest size renders him impure, as Leviticus 15:3 states: \"or whether it seals his flesh.\" Implied is any discharge that is apparent on his flesh renders him as ritually impure.",
            "The following rules apply when a <i>zav</i> discharge flowed without interruption for an extended time. If the time that elapsed from the beginning of the discharge until its end was as long as it takes to immerse oneself and dry or longer, it is considered as two discharges, because it takes as long a time as two would. If it did not take that long, even if it ceased in the middle, and he had a second discharge within that time period, it is considered as one discharge.<br>Similarly, if one discharge lasted the amount of time that three discharges would take - i.e., from its beginning to its end, there was enough time for a man to immerse himself and dry himself twice - it is considered as three discharges and he must bring a sacrifice.",
            "If a person experienced a discharge during the day, it ceased for the amount of time it takes to immerse and dry oneself and afterwards, he experienced another two discharges or one discharge that lasts as long as two or if he experienced two discharges or one discharge that lasts as long as two, and then it ceased for the amount of time it takes to immerse and dry oneself and afterwards, he experienced another discharge, he is a <i>zav</i> in a full sense.",
            "A discharge is considered as two discharges even though it did not last for the time two discharges last, if part of it was experienced at the end of the day and part at the beginning of the night. The rationale is that the change of dates divides the discharge as it were, and causes it to be considered as two.<br>Therefore if a man experiences a discharge <i>bein hashamashamot</i> concerning which there is an unresolved doubt whether it is considered as day or as night, there is an unresolved doubt whether he is impure.",
            "If a man experiences one discharge during the day and another <i>bein hashamashot</i>, he has definitely contracted the impurity of a <i>zav</i>, but there is an unresolved doubt whether he must bring a sacrifice. He must bring a set of doves as sacrifices, but the sin-offering is not eaten.",
            "If a person experienced a discharge during <i>bein hashamashot</i> on the night of the Sabbath and another discharge on the night following the Sabbath there is an unresolved doubt whether he contracted <i>zav</i> impurity and there is an unresolved doubt whether he is obligated for a sacrifice.<br>There is an unresolved doubt whether he has contracted <i>zav</i> impurity, for perhaps the first discharged took place on Friday and the second on Saturday night. Thus the Sabbath intervened between them and there is no concept of <i>zav</i> impurity at all. And there is an unresolved doubt whether he is obligated to bring a sacrifice, for perhaps one of them took place, partially during the day and partially during the night, in which instance, it is considered as two. Thus he would have experienced three discharges and would be liable for a sacrifice. Therefore he brings a sacrifice, but it is not eaten."

            "During all the days when a <i>zav</i> experiences <i>zav</i> discharges, he is ritually impure. When the <i>zav</i> discharges cease, he counts seven clean days, like a <i>zavah</i> must, immerses himself on the seventh day, and waits until nightfall. On the eighth day, he brings his sacrifice if he had experienced three discharges.<br>If he experienced a <i>zav</i> discharge even at the end of the seventh day after he immersed himself, he negates his entire counting and must begin to count seven clean days from the day of his last discharge.",
            "When a <i>zav</i> has a seminal emission during the seven clean days he counts, he only nullifies that day. From the following day onward, he completes the seven days and then brings his sacrifice.<br>What is implied? He had a seminal emission on the fifth day, He counts another three clean days afterwards, immerses himself on the third day and brings his sacrifice on the fourth day.",
            "When a <i>zav</i> checks himself on the first day of his counting and finds himself pure and does not check himself for the remainder of the seven days until the seventh day when he checks himself and finds himself pure, he may rely on the presumption that he is pure. Even if he checked on the day when he had an impure discharge and saw that he was pure and that the discharge had ended and he did not check himself throughout the seven days, but did check himself on the seventh dayor the eighth day, should he find himself pure, the days of counting are significant and he may rely on the presumption that he is pure.",
            "Any discharge that causes the counting of the days to be nullified does not bring about an obligation for a sacrifice.<br>What is implied? A man experienced two discharges and then had an interruption for a day or two and thus he began counting his seven clean days. Although he experienced a <i>zav</i> discharge in the midst of the seven days, it is not combined with the previous two. Instead, it nullifies the counting and he must begin to count over again, as we explained.<br>Moreover, even if he experienced three consecutive discharges in the midst of the counting - even if he experienced them on one day, and even if that was on the conclusion of the seventh day of the seven clean days - he should not bring a sacrifice. For these discharges are considered as nullifying the clean days that were being counted. If he experienced three discharges on the night of the eighth day, he must bring a sacrifice, because these discharges do not nullify the previous counting.<br>To whom does the above apply? To a <i>zav</i> who has experienced two discharges. A <i>zav</i> who experienced three discharges previously, by contrast, who experiences three discharges on the eighth night after the seven clean days does not bring a second sacrifice because of these three discharges, only one sacrifice for the first three discharges. Although these three discharges do not nullify the clean days that were counted, the man has not entered a time when it is fit for him to bring a sacrifice, since the preceding night is considered as \"lacking in time,\" with regard to all Torah laws, with the exception of a woman after childbirth who miscarried on the night of the eighty-first day. She brings a second sacrifice, as we explained. This concept was communicated by the Oral Tradition.",
            "If a man experienced one discharge on the eighth night and two discharges on the eighth day, they are linked together and he is required to bring a sacrifice because of the two latter discharges. The rationale is that a <i>zav's</i> first discharge is considered as a seminal emission. If he experiences two others afterwards, it is combined together with them to obligate him for a sacrifice. If, however, he experienced two discharges on the eighth night and one on the eighth day, they are not linked together and he is not required to bring a second sacrifice because of the latter <i>zav</i> discharges.",
            "Every male can contract <i>zav</i> impurity, even an infant on the day of his birth, a convert, a servant, a deafmute, and an intellectually and/or emotionally unstable person. It appears to me that atonement is brought for them so that it is possible for them to partake of sacrificial food. Their sin-offering should be eaten, for they are like a child who is not intellectually capable.<br>A person who was castrated or one who is born sexually impotent may contract impurity because of a <i>zav</i> discharge like other men.",
            "The stringencies that apply both to males and females are placed upon a <i>tumtum</i> and an <i>androgynus</i> They contract ritual impurity because of uterine bleeding like a woman or because of clear discharges like a man. Their impurity is of questionable status. Therefore if one such person had three <i>zav</i> discharges or discovered <i>zavah</i> bleeding for three consecutive days, he must bring a sacrifice, but it is not eaten. If he was counting seven clean days to purify himself from a <i>zav</i> discharge and he experienced uterine bleeding or he was counting to purify himself from uterine bleeding and experienced a <i>zav</i> discharge, the counting is not disrupted."

            "When a person afflicted by <i>tzara'at</i> is healed of his affliction, and he has been purified with a cedar branch, a hyssop, a crimson thread, and two birds, all of his flesh is shaved and he is immersed in a <i>mikveh</i>. After this entire process, he may enter Jerusalem. He then counts seven days and on the seventh day, he shaves a second time like the first shaving. He then immerses himself. His status is then that of a <i>t'vul yom</i>. He waits until the evening. On the morrow, on the eighth day, he immerses a second time and then he brings his sacrifices.<br>Why must he immerse himself on the eighth day if he immersed himself previously? Because he had become habituated to contracting lesser types of impurity during the days that he was identified as one afflicted by <i>tzara'at</i> and he would not show care not to contract impurity and perhaps he contracted impurity after he immersed. Therefore, he would immerse himself on the eighth day in the Women's Courtyard, in the Chamber for those Afflicted by <i>Tzara'at</i>,even though he did not divert his attention after his immersion.",

One receives it in a receptacle and casts it on the altar and one receives it in his right hand. He pours it into his left hand and sprinkles it with the index finger of his right hand. If he deviated and received it in his left hand first, it is disqualified.<br>The priest who received a portion of the blood in a receptacle should carry it and cast it on the altar first. Afterwards, the priest who received the blood in his palm should approach the afflicted person at the entrance. The priest stands inside and the afflicted person outside.

Afterwards, the afflicted person inserts his right hand and the priest applies the blood to his thumb. Afterwards, he inserts his right foot and the priest applies the blood to his large toe. If he applies it the left organs, the afflicted person does not fulfill his obligation. Afterwards, his sin-offerings and burnt-offering are sacrificed.<br>After he applied the blood to his thumb and toe, the priest takes the <i>log</i> of oil and pours it into the left palm of a colleague. If he pours it into his own palm, the person fulfills his obligation. He dips his right index finger in the oil in his palm and sprinkles seven times toward the Holy of Holies.

If he desires to alter the designation of the <i>log</i> and designate it for the guilt-offering of another afflicted person, he may although he has already had it consecrated in a sacred utensil. If the amount of oil decreased before it was poured into the priest's hand and was less than a <i>log</i>, the measure should be refilled. If it decreased after it was poured, another <i>log</i> should be brought instead.",
            "The following laws apply if the oil was poured into the priest's hand, his colleague began to sprinkle it and then the <i>log</i> spilled. If it spilled before he completed the seven sprinklings, he should bring another <i>log</i> of oil and begin the seven sprinklings. If he completed the seven sprinklings and then the <i>log</i> of oil spilled, he should bring another <i>log</i> and begin applying the oil to the thumb and toe. If he already began applying the oil to the thumb and toe and the <i>log</i> spilled before he could complete it, he should bring another <i>log</i> and begin applying the oil to the thumb and toe. If he completed applying the oil to the thumb and toe and the <i>log</i> spilled before he placed the remainder of the oil on the head of the person being purified, he does not have to bring another <i>log</i>, for the application of the oil to his head is not an indispensable requirement, as implied by Leviticus 14:17, 18 which mentions \"the remainder of the oil,\" and \"the additional oil.\"",
            "If the priest applied the oil before he applied the blood, he should fill the <i>log</i> container with additional oil and apply the oil after the blood. If the oil was applied to the thumb and toe before the seven sprinklings were made, the <i>log</i> container should be filled with additional oil which should be applied to the thumb and toe after the seven sprinklings. These laws are derived from Leviticus 14:2 which states: \"This is the law applying to one afflicted with <i>tzara'at</i>.\" Implied is that the entire law should be carried out according to the prescribed sequence.",
            "If the seven sprinklings were made without the proper intent, the offering does not find favor Above, but the afflicted person regains his status of purity.",
            "When a person who had been afflicted with <i>tzara'at</i> becomes afflicted again after bringing his guilt-offering, he must bring another set of sacrifices for the second affliction. Similarly, if he brings his guilt-offering for the second affliction and becomes afflicted again, he must bring a sacrifice for every time he became afflicted. If, however, he became afflicted and was healed and brought the birds and then became afflicted again, when he was healed a second time and brings his birds, it is sufficient to bring one set of sacrifices for all the times he was afflicted.",
            "The following laws apply when an afflicted person brings the sacrifices required of a poor person and then he becomes rich, or he brought the sacrifices required of a rich person and he became poor. Everything depends on his status at the time he brings his guilt-offering. If he was wealthy at the time the guilt-offering was slaughtered, he should complete the offering of a wealthy person. If he was poor at that time, he should complete the offering of a poor person.",
            "There were two afflicted persons whose sacrifices became intermingled and the blood of one of the sin-offerings was sprinkled on the altar and then one of the afflicted persons died. What should the afflicted person who is alive do? He may not bring an animal as a sin-offering, for perhaps the sin-offering whose blood was cast on the altar was his and we follow the principle: an animal is not brought as a sin-offering when there is a doubt whether one is liable. He may not bring a sin-offering of fowl, because a rich man who brings a poor man's offering does not fulfill his obligation.<br>What then should he do? He should sign all his property over to another person. Thus he will be poor. Hence he may bring a sin-offering of fowl, because of the doubt. It is not eaten, as we explained. He may then partake of sacrificial foods.",
            "When a rich man says: \"I take responsibility for the sacrifices of this afflicted person,\" and the afflicted person was poor, he must bring the sacrifices of a wealthy man, for the person who took the vow has the financial capacity. If a poor person said: \"I take responsibility for the sacrifices of this afflicted person,\" and the afflicted person was wealthy, he must bring the sacrifices of a wealthy man, for the person who took the vow obligated himself to bring the sacrifices of a wealthy man."
