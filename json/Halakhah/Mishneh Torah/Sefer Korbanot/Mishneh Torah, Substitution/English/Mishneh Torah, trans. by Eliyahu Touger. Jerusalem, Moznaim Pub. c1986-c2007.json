            "Anyone who transfers holiness from one animal to another is liable for lashes for every animal from which he transferred the holiness, as Leviticus 27:10 states: \"Do not exchange it and do not transfer its holiness,\" even though he did not perform a deed. According to the Oral Tradition, it was taught that any negative commandment that does not involve a deed is not punishable by lashes with the exception of one who takes a false or unnecessary oath, one who transfers the holiness of a sacrificial animal, and one who curses a colleague mentioning God's name. These three negative commandments can never involve a deed at all, and yet one is liable for lashes for their violation.<br>Why is one liable for lashes for transferring the holiness of an animal, it is a negative commandment that can be corrected by a positive commandment, as <i>ibid.</i>:33 states: \"If he will transfer its holiness, it and the animal to which its holiness will be transferred shall be consecrated\"? Because it has one positive commandment and two negative commandments and because the negative commandment it involves is not of the same nature as the positive commandment.This is reflected in the ruling that if the Jewish community or partners try to transfer the holiness of a sacrificial animal, the transfer is not effective. Nevertheless, they are warned not to transfer the holiness. Thus when an individual transfers the holiness of a sacrificial animal, the animal to which he transferred the holiness is consecrated. Even if he transfers holiness on the Sabbath, he is liable for forty lashes. If, by contrast, a partner in a sacrificial animal endeavors to transfer its holiness or an endeavor is made to transfer the holiness of an animal designated for a communal sacrifice - since that person has a share in these sacrifices he is liable for lashes, but the animal to which he endeavored to transfer the holiness is not consecrated.",
            "Whether one transfers the holiness of an animal as an intentional transgression or one does so inadvertently, the transfer of holiness is effective and the person is liable for lashes.<br>What is implied? One intended to say: \"This animal should be considered as an exchange for an animal consecrated as a burnt-offering that I possess,\" and instead, he said: \"This animal should be considered as an exchange for an animal consecrated as a peace-offering that I possess,\" the transfer of holiness is effective and he is liable for lashes. If, however, he thought that it was permitted to transfer holiness or he said: \"I will enter that house and transfer the holiness of a sacrificial animal willfully,\" and instead, he entered and transferred the holiness of the animal unknowingly, the transfer of holiness is effective, but he is not liable for lashes for it.",
            "A person cannot transfer the holiness of a sacrificial animal that does not belong to him. If the owner of a sacrificial animal says: \"Whoever desires to transfer the holiness of my sacrificial animal may come and do so,\" another person may transfer the holiness of that animal.<br>If a person transferred the holiness of a sacrificial animal belonging to him to another animal that does not belong to him, the transfer is not effective. The rationale is that a person cannot consecrate an entity that does not belong to him.",
            "It is the one who will receive atonement who has the potential to exchange the holiness of a sacrificial animal, not the person who consecrates it.<br>What is implied? A person consecrated an animal so that his colleague could gain atonement through its sacrifice, e.g., one consecrated the animals required for the sacrifices of a nazirite so that so-and-so, the nazirite, could gain atonement thereby. It is that nazirite who can transfer their holiness, but not the person who consecrated them, because they do not belong to him.",
            "An heir can transfer the holiness of a sacrificial animal he inherits. If a person dies, leaving a sacrificial animal to his two sons, this animal should be offered, but its holiness cannot be transferred. The rationale is that the sons are partners and partners cannot transfer the holiness of a sacrificial animal, as we explained.",
            "The holiness of sacrificial animals consecrated by gentiles may not be transferred according to Scriptural Law. According to Rabbinic Law, however, if a gentile transfers the holiness of a sacrificial animal, the transfer is effective. If a gentile consecrated a sacrificial animal with the intent that a Jew receive atonement through its being offered and then the gentile transferred its holiness to another animal, there is an unresolved question whether the transfer is effective.",
            "When either a man or a woman seek to transfer the holiness of a sacrificial animal, the transfer is effective.",
            "Even though he is not liable for lashes, there is an unresolved question whether a transfer of holiness made by a minor who has reached the age when his vows are binding is effective or not.",
            "The priests cannot transfer the holiness of animals to be sacrificed as sin-offerings and guilt-offerings that were given to them to offer. Although portions of the animal belong to them, they do not acquire them during the lifetime of the animal, for they do not receive a portion of the meat until the blood is cast on the altar.<br>A priest cannot transfer the holiness of a firstborn animal; even though he does acquire it while it is alive, he does not acquire it at the outset. On the contrary, at the outset, it should be in the home of the Israelite. When, by contrast, an owner transfers the holiness of a firstborn animal, as long as it is in his household, the transfer is binding.Similarly, when a priest transfers the holiness of a firstborn animal born in his herd, not a firstborn animal given to him by an Israelite, the transfer is binding.",
            "The holiness of the ram of the High Priest can be transferred to another animal. The holiness of his bull, by contrast, cannot be transferred to another animal. Even though it is brought from his own resources, since his priestly brethren derive atonement through its sacrifice, they are considered as partners in it.",
            "The holiness of fowl and meal-offerings cannot be transferred, for the relevant verses mention only animals.",
            "The holiness of animals consecrated for the upkeep of the Temple may not be transferred, for with regard to the tithe offering, Leviticus 27:33 states: \"He shall not distinguish between good and bad and he should not transfer its holiness.\" Now the tithe offering was part of the general category of all the sacrifices, why was it singled out?To teach us a concept that applies to the entire general category. The tithe-offering is the sacrifice of an individual, thus excluding communal offerings and sacrificial animals owned by partners. The tithe-offering is a sacrifice offered on the altar, thus excluding animals consecrated for the sake of the upkeep of the Temple. There is an association between the tithe-offerings and the tithes of the crops in which are obligated Jews and not non-Jews; thus excluding sacrifices of the gentiles whose holiness cannot be exchanged as stated.",
            "When a person consecrates an animal that has a permanent disqualifying blemish, its holiness cannot be transferred to another animal, because its body has not been consecrated in a complete way; only its worth was consecrated. If, however, one consecrates an animal with a temporary blemish or one consecrates an unblemished animal and then it contracted a permanent blemish, its holiness can be transferred.",
            "Whether one transfers the holiness of a blemished animal to an unblemished one or that of an unblemished animal to a blemished one, one transferred the holiness of sheep to cattle, or the holiness of cattle to sheep, or that of goats to sheep or that of sheep to goats, or that of males to females or that of females to males, or transferred the holiness of 100 animals to one or that of one to 100, whether he did so all at once or one after another, the transfer is effective and he is liable for the same number of sets of lashes as animals to which he transferred holiness.",
            "The holiness of an animal to which holiness has been transferred cannot be transferred to another animal, nor may the holiness of the offspring of a consecrated animal be transferred to another animal. This is derived from Leviticus 27:10: \"And it and the animal to which its holiness was transferred shall be holy.\" Implied is \"it\" and not its offspring, \"the animal to which its holiness was transferred\" and not an animal to which there was an attempt to transfer the holiness of the animal to which its holiness was transferred. If, however, one transferred the holiness of an animal and then transferred its holiness a second time, even 1000 times, the holiness has been transferred to each of them, and one is liable for lashes for each transfer, as we explained.",
            "The holiness of an entire animal may not be transferred to limbs or fetuses, nor may the holiness of the latter be transferred to an entire animal.<br>What is implied? If one says: \"The hindfoot of this animal...\" or \"Its forefoot should be substituted for this burnt-offering,\" or he said: \"The fetus of this animal should be substituted for this burnt-offering,\" the holiness is not transferred. Similarly, if one says: \"This animal should be substituted for the forefoot...\" or \"the hindfoot of this burnt-offering,\" or he said: \"This animal should be substituted for the fetus of this sin-offering,\" the holiness is not transferred.",
            "When one seeks to transfer the holiness of a consecrated animal to a hybrid, an animal that is <i>tereifah</i>, one born of Caesarian section, a <i>tumtum</i>, or an <i>adrogynus</i>, the holiness is not transferred to them and it is as if one sought to transfer the holiness of a sacrificial animal to a camel or a donkey. The rationale is that this type of animal is not fit for sacrifice. Therefore one who tries to transfer the holiness of a sacrificial animal to it is not liable for lashes.<br>What is the difference between these and an animal that is blemished? There is the possibility of the type of animal that is blemished serving as a sacrifice, while these types of animals cannot serve as sacrifices.",
            "An animal that was engaged in intercourse with humans - whether it acted as the male or female - is considered as a blemished animal and the holiness of a sacrificial animal can be transferred to it. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.",
            "When an animal was half consecrated and half unconsecrated, holiness cannot be transferred to it, nor may its holiness be transferred.",
            "The holiness of all of the sin-offerings that are consigned to death may not be transferred to another animal. By contrast, the holiness of all of the sin-offerings that are designated to pasture until they contract a blemish and are sold may be transferred to another animal.",
            "When a person sets aside a female animal for his Paschal sacrifice, burnt-offering, or guilt-offering, its holiness can be transferred even though it is not fit to be offered. The rationale is that since its worth is consecrated and it is unblemished, it is considered as if its body was consecrated.<br>If, by contrast, one separated a goat as a sin-offering, a king separated a she-goat as a sin-offering, and a High Priest separated a cow as a sin-offering, their holiness cannot be transferred. The rationale is that anyone who deviates from the commandments prescribed for a sin-offering does not cause the designated animal to be consecrated at all, not even its worth, as we explained in <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i>."

            "The act of transferring the holiness of a sacrificial animal involves the owner of the animal saying with regard to an ordinary animal that he possesses: \"This should be substituted for this\" or \"This is a replacement for this.\" Needless to say, holiness is transferred if one says: \"This should be substituted for this sin-offering\" or \"... substituted for this burnt-offering.\" Similarly, holiness is transferred if one says: \"This should be substituted for the sin-offering I possess at home\" or \"...substituted for the burnt-offering I possess in such-and-such a place.\"<br>If, by contrast, one said with regard to an ordinary animal: \"This should be substituted for a burnt-offering\" or \"This is substituted for a sin-offering,\" his words are of no consequence. If he states: \"The holiness of this is conveyed to this,\" a transfer of holiness is not brought about.",
            "The following rules apply when there were two animals before a person, one ordinary animal and one consecrated animal that became blemished. If he placed his hand on the ordinary animal and said: \"This one is substituted for this,\" he has brought about a forbidden exchange of holiness and he is liable for lashes. If, by contrast, he placed his hand on the consecrated animal and said: \"This is substituted for this,\" he has exchanged its holiness and transferred it to the ordinary animal. This is not a forbidden exchange of holiness, but instead, is comparable to redeeming the blemished sacrificial animal with this ordinary animal.",
            "The following rule applies when there were three animals consecrated for the altar before a person and one of them was blemished and awaiting redemption and also three unblemished ordinary animals. If he says: \"These are substituted for these,\" the holiness of two of the consecrated animals is transferred to two of the ordinary animals through the convention of <i>temurah</i> and he is liable for two sets of lashes. The third ordinary animal is substituted for the blemished animal through the convention of <i>chillul</i>. We assume that he sought to use that convention rather than the convention of <i>temurah</i>. The rationale is that since the person had a forbidden course of action, <i>temurah</i> and a permitted course of action, <i>chillul</i>, we operate under the assumption that a person will not abandon the permitted course of action and follow the forbidden one. Therefore he is not liable for three sets of lashes.<br>Similarly, if one says: \"These ten ordinary animals are substituted for these ten consecrated animals,\" and one of the consecrated animals is blemished, the person is liable for only nine sets of lashes, for he intended to transfer the holiness of the tenth animal through the convention of <i>chillul</i>. Even though he had established a halachic presumption by being liable for many sets of lashes, since there is a permitted way for him to transfer the animal's holiness, we presume that he will not abandon the permitted course of action and follow the forbidden one.<br>When there are two consecrated animals and one of them is blemished and two ordinary animals and one of them is blemished, and one says: \"These are substituted for these,\" the holiness of the unblemished animal is transferred to the unblemished animal through the convention of <i>temurah</i> and he is liable for one set of lashes and the holiness of the blemished animal is transferred to the blemished animal through the convention of <i>chillul</i>. The rationale is that we presume that he will not abandon the permitted course of action and follow the forbidden one.",
            "When one says: \"The holiness of an animal designated as a burnt-offering and one designated as a peace-offering is transferred to this animal,\" his statements are of consequence. The animal should be sold and half of the proceeds used to bring the exchange of a burnt-offering and half used to bring the exchange of a peace-offering.<br>If one said: \"The holiness of an animal designated as a burnt-offering and the holiness of an animal dedicated as a peace-offering are transferred to this animal,\" we examine if that was his original intent. If it was, his words are of consequence. If his original intent was merely to transfer the holiness of a burnt-offering, and he afterwards, added \"the holiness of a peace-offering\" later, only his original statements are of consequence. Even though he retracted them immediately thereafter, only the holiness of a burnt-offering was transferred to the animal."

            "What are the laws governing the offering of an animal to which holiness was transferred? A male animal to which the holiness of a burnt-offering was transferred should be sacrificed as a burnt-offering. If the animal to which the holiness of a burnt-offering was transferred was female or blemished, the female should be left to pasture until it contracts a disqualifying blemish. Then it should be sold and a burnt-offering brought with the proceeds of the sale.<br>An animal to which the holiness of a sin-offering was transferred should be consigned to death, as we explained in <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i>. An animal to which the holiness of a guilt-offering was transferred should be left to pasture until it contracts a disqualifying blemish. Then it should be sold and freewill offerings brought with the proceeds of the sale. An animal to which the holiness of a peace-offering was transferred is like a peace-offering in all respects: It requires <i>semichah</i>, accompanying offerings, and the waving of the breast and the thigh.<br>An animal to which the holiness of a thanksgiving-offering was transferred is like a thanksgiving-offering except that it does not require bread, as we explained in <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i>.The following laws apply to an animal to which the holiness of a Paschal sacrifice was transferred. If the transfer was made before noon on the fourteenth of Nisan, the animal to which the holiness was transferred is not offered. Instead, it should be left to pasture until it contracts a disqualifying blemish. Then it should be sold and a peace-offering brought with the proceeds of the sale. If the transfer was made after noon, the animal to which the holiness was transferred should itself be sacrificed as a peace-offering.<br>An animal to which the holiness of a firstborn offering or a tithe offering was transferred should never be sacrificed. This is derived from Leviticus 27:26 which states with regard to a firstborn: \"It is God's.\" According to the Oral Tradition, it was taught: \"It\" is sacrificed, but an animal to which its holiness is transferred is not sacrificed. The laws pertaining to the tithe offering are the same as those pertaining to the firstborn offering. An animal to which the holiness of these offerings was transferred should be left to pasture until it contracts a disqualifying blemish. Afterwards, it may be eaten.",
            "An animal to which the holiness of a firstborn is transferred should be given to the priests and an animal to which the holiness of a tithe offering was transferred is given to its owners. Just as a firstborn animal or a tithe offering that contracts a disqualifying physical blemish is not redeemed, as explained in <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbeiach</i>, so too, an animal to which their holiness is transferred is not redeemed.",
            "When an animal was consecrated half as a burnt-offering and half as a peace-offering, an animal to which its holiness was transferred is given the same status. Similarly, when the holiness of any consecrated animal which should not be sacrificed because of a difficulty at the time of its consecration was transferred to another animal, that second animal should also not be sacrificed.<br>If one said: \"The holiness of a sacrificial animal should be transferred to half this animal and the other half should be consecrated as a burnt-offering,\" it should be offered as a burnt-offering. If he consecrated it half as a burnt-offering and half, as a tithe offering, it should be sacrificed as a burnt-offering. If he transferred the holiness of a sacrificial animal to half of it and he consecrated half as a tithe offering, its status is in doubt and it should not be sacrificed.",
            "The following rules apply when a person consecrates an animal with a temporary blemish or, needless to say, an unblemished animal and then it contracts a permanent blemish and it is redeemed. If one endeavored to transfer its holiness after it was redeemed, the transfer is binding, but the animal to which the transfer was made should neither be sacrificed, nor redeemed. Instead, it should be left until it dies. It should not be sacrificed, because it comes from holiness that was already deferred. Nor may it be redeemed, because its holiness does not have the strength to encompass the entity used to redeem it.",
            "When any animal to which holiness was transferred was permanently blemished from the outset, they should be redeemed. Nevertheless, they do not become ordinary animals in a complete sense to the extent that it is permitted to shear them or perform work with them after they are redeemed. For holiness that is transferred can encompass an animal that possesses a permanent blemish, as evident from Leviticus 27:10 which speaks of transferring holiness \"from the good to the bad.\" Here the intent of the term \"bad\" is an animal that is blemished or the like and thus is not fit to serve as a sacrifice. Nevertheless, concerning it, the verse continues: \"It shall be consecrated.\"",
            "The following laws apply when an animal consecrated as a burnt-offering became intermingled with sacrificial animals consecrated as peace-offerings and one transferred the holiness of one of the animals in the mixture to an ordinary animal.One should bring another animal and consecrate it, saying: \"If this one had the holiness of a burnt-offering transferred to it, this animal is a peace-offering. And if this one had the holiness of a peace-offering transferred to it, this animal is a burnt-offering.\" Thus the animal which he brought together with the animal to which the holiness of the animal was transferred are like animals consecrated as burnt-offerings and as peace-offerings that became intermingled.<br>If the person transformed the holiness of one of these two to a third animal and it is not known which one's holiness he transferred, he should bring another animal fit for sacrifice from his home and consecrate it conditionally, saying with regard to the second animal to which holiness is being transferred: \"If this is an animal to which the holiness of an animal was transferred, the animal that was brought remains an ordinary animal. If this animal is an animal to which the holiness of a burnt-offering or a peace-offering was transferred, the animal that was brought is a burnt-offering or a peace-offering.\" Thus the animal which he brought with the second animal to which holiness was transferred is like a sacrificial animal that became intermingled with an animal to which holiness was transferred. We have already explained the laws pertaining to the intermingling of animals to which holiness was transferred in <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i>.",
            "When an animal consecrated as a peace-offering became intermingled with a firstborn animal or a tithe offering and one transferred the holiness of one of the animals of the mixture to another animal, that animal should not be offered.

For bread is brought only for a thanksgiving-offering itself.

The court sacrifices freewill burnt-offerings with that money. The accompanying offeringsare brought from communal funds and they do not require <i>semichah</i>.

The Sages of the early generations said that King Solomon understood most of the rationales for all the statutes of the Torah.<br>It appears to me that the verse Leviticus 27:10: \"It and the animal to which its holiness will be transferred shall be consecrated\" shares a similar motivating rationale as the verse <i>ibid.</i>:15: \"If the one who consecrates it shall redeem his house, he shall add a fifth of the money of the redemption valuation to it.\" The principle behind these laws is that the Torah descended to the bottom of a person's thoughts and the scope of his evil inclination. For human nature tends to increase his property and attach importance to his money. Even though he made a vow or consecrated something, it is possible that he will reconsider, change his mind, and redeem it for less than its worth. Hence the Torah states: \"If he redeems it for himself, he must add a fifth.\" Similarly, if he consecrated an animal in a manner that its physical person becomes consecrated, he might reconsider. In this instance, since he cannot redeem it, he will exchange it for a lesser one. If he was given permission to exchange an inferior animal for a superior one, he will exchange a superior one for an inferior one and claim that it was superior. Therefore, the Torah removed that option, forbidding all exchanges and penalized him that if he made an exchange, \"It and the animal to which its holiness will be transferred shall be consecrated.\"<br>All of these ordinances are to subjugate one's evil inclination and improve one's character. Similarly, most of the Torah's laws are nothing other than \"counsels given from distance\" from \"He Who is of great counsel\" to improve one's character and make one's conduct upright. And so it is written Proverbs 22:20-21: \"Behold, I have written for you in the Torah prominent matters, to inform you of the veracity of the words of truth, so that you will respond truthfully to those who send to you.\""
