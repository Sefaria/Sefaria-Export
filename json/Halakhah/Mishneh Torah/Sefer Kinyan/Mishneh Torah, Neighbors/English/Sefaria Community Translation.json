            "[In the case of] a courtyard that is jointly owned and is large enough to be split into two sections; or one that was divided with their consent, even though it was not large enough to be split into two sections: Each person can force the other to build a wall in the middle, so that the other person will not see them while they are using their section. This is because sight damage (<i>hezek re'iyah</i>) is an actual form of damage, and there is no concept of established use (<i>chazakah</i>) in a courtyard [without a divider]. On the contrary, even if they have jointly owned the courtyard for many years without a divider, one person may [still] force the other to have a divider constructed at any time. "

            "Brothers or joint owners that came to divide a joint field, that each would take their share - if it was all equally valuable and there was no part that was of greater value than another part (lit: a good place and a bad place) rather it was all [of] one [quality] - they divide it by measurement alone.  And if one said \"give me my portion from this side so that it will be adjacent to another field of mine and it will all be one [adjoined] field\" - he is listened to, and he can force him on this, for blocking of this [type of] matter [of benefit to one with no harm to another] is the nature of Sodom.  But if one portion was better [quality land] or nearer to a river or near the road, and they evaluated the better [portion] relative to the worse [portion]. and he said \"give to me according to my estimate from this side [of the field] - he is not listened to - rather he takes according to drawn lots.  [If] he said \"Give me half its measured size from the inferior side without appraisal and you take from the better side, so that my portion will abut my field, some of the Gaonim instructed that we listen to him [and force the other to agree]. And according to this [ruling] my own mind is inclined [accordingly], and so is fitting to rule."
