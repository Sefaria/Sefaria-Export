            "When a person tells a colleague: \"Go out and sell landed property for me,\" \"...movable property...,\" or \"...purchase for me...,\" then the person should perform his agency, selling or buying. All his deeds are binding.<br>It is not necessary for a person who appoints an agent to perform a <i>kinyan</i> or have the appointment observed by witnesses. Instead, the statement he makes to his colleague is sufficient. Witnesses are necessary solely to reveal what transpired if one of the two denies the matter, as is the case with regard to other claims.",
            "When an agent intentionally violates the instructions of his principal, his deeds are of no consequence. Similarly, if he erred even with regard to the slightest amount, the transaction - whether involving landed property or movable property - is nullified. For the principal can claim: \"I sent you to improve my position, not to impair it.\"<br>The principle is that with regard to movable property, the laws of <i>ona'ah</i> do not apply unless one pays a sixth or more than the proper price for an article, and that these laws do not apply at all with regard to the sale of servants, promissory notes and landed property. They do, however, apply when the seller or the purchaser himself conducts the transaction. When, however, it is conducted by an agent, and he erred in his valuation with regard to even the slightest amount, the transaction is nullified.",
            "When a person gives money to an agent to purchase landed property, and the agent purchases it for him without requiring the seller to accept financial responsibility if it is expropriated from the purchaser, he is considered to have damaged the principal's position. The agent must purchase the property without financial responsibility, as he did, for himself. Then he must sell it to the principal and accept financial responsibility. This decision is rendered because the agent purchased the property with money belonging to the principal. The agent must accept the financial responsibility himself. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.<br>Therefore, if the principal explicitly stipulates that he is appointing the agent in that capacity, whether he improves his position or impairs it, he may not retract, even if the agent sold a field worth 100 <i>dinarim</i> for a <i>dinar</i> for him, or purchased one worth a <i>dinar</i> for 100. And the principal must pay the agent as he originally stipulated.",
            "When a person tells his agent: \"Sell a portion of my field large enough to sow a <i>se'ah</i>,\" and he sells a portion large enough to sow two <i>se'ah</i>, the agent is considered to have added to the principal's instructions, and the purchaser acquires only an area large enough to sow one <i>se'ah</i>.<br>If the principal told the agent: \"Sell a portion large enough to sow two <i>se'ah</i>,\" and the agent sold only an area large enough to sow one <i>se'ah</i>, the agent is considered to have violated the principal's instructions, and the purchaser does not acquire anything.<br>If the principal told the agent: \"Sell my field to one person for me,\" and the agent sold it to two people, the sale is nullified, for he violated the principal's instructions. If the principal told the agent: \"Sell the field for me\" without giving further instructions, the sales made by the agent are binding, even if he sold the property in 100 portions.",
            "When a person gives money to his agent to purchase wheat or any other type of merchandise, and the agent does not make the purchase, the principal does not have a financial claim against the agent, only complaints.<br>The following rules apply if a principal gives an agent money to purchase wheat - whether to eat or to use as merchandise - and the agent purchases barley. If the price of the barley that he purchased becomes less than the price of wheat, the agent must bear the loss, because he deviated from the instructions he was given. If the price of the barley increases more than the price of wheat, the profit belongs to the owner of the money.<br>If the price of merchandise was fixed, and an additional quantity, weight or measure was given the agent, whatever was added by the seller should be divided between the two; i.e., the additional measure should be split between the agent and the principal. If the object sold does not have a fixed price, everything should be given to the principal.",
            "The following rules apply when a person owes a colleague money, whether because of a debt, an entrusted article or a wage, and he gave the money to an agent and told him: \"Bring this money to my creditor,\" the agent is not required to take special care of the matter and pay the creditor in the presence of witnesses.<br>If the principal told the agent: \"Do not pay the debt unless witnesses observe it, \" and he paid the debt in the absence of witnesses, the agent is liable should the creditor demand payment of the debt again. Similarly, if the debt was recorded in a promissory note, and the agent paid the debt outside the presence of witnesses, and did not take the promissory note, the agent is liable should the creditor demand payment of the debt again.This applies whether the debtor told the agent: \"Take the promissory note and give him the money,\" or \"Give him the money and take the promissory note.\" For by not taking the note, the agent impaired the principal's position and did not improve it.",
            "The following rules apply when a person sends money that he possesses with an agent, saying: \"Bring this money to so and so, because I owe it to him,\" and the agent went and gave the creditor the money outside the presence of witnesses. If the agent said: \"I paid,\" and the creditor or the worker said: \"I did not receive it,\" and the three are standing together the following course of action should be taken.<br>The agent should take a <i>sh'vuat hesset</i> that he paid the debt. The creditor or the worker should take an oath that he did not receive anything, and then the principal should pay the creditor or the owner of the entrusted object. Even if there were two agents entrusted with making the payment, their testimony is of no consequence, because they are involved parties - for they are required to take a <i>sh'vuat hesset</i>.<br>When does the above apply? When the agent denies the statements of the creditor and the three are standing together. If, however, the agent comes to the principal and tells him: \"I paid your creditor as you instructed me,\" the principal may not require him to take an oath that he performed the mission, for there is no one who issues a definite claim that he did not perform his mission.<br>Similarly, if the agents died or traveled overseas, and the creditor came and demanded payment of the debt, the debtor may not require him to take a <i>sh'vuat hesset</i> that the agent did not pay him, for there is no one who issues a definite claim that he received the money. Instead, the debtor should have a ban of ostracism issued against anyone who demands payment a second time. Afterwards, he must pay the debt he owes. Similar principles apply in other analogous situations.",
            "The following laws apply when Reuven sends a letter to Shimon telling him: \"You owe me a <i>maneh</i>. Send it to me with Levi.\" If Shimon is willing to send the money with him, he is no longer responsible for it. This applies whether a loan or an entrusted object is involved, provided he recognized that the letter was written in Reuven's handwriting.<br>If the creditor claims \"I did not write the note or send it to you,\" the debtor must take a <i>sh'vuat hesset</i> that he received a note and he therefore sent the money. He is not under any further obligation. This is the manner in which my teachers ruled.<br>Different rules apply, however, if the note was not written in the principal's handwriting, or the debtor did not know that it was written in his handwriting - even if it contained signs and letters that only they knew about. If Reuven claims: \"I did not send a letter; other people tricked you,\" Shimon is responsible for the funds and must pay Reuven if the funds do not reach him after he issues a ban of ostracism against anyone who intentionally sent a letter and denies it. There are those who rule that Reuven must take an oath before collecting the money, as is required of others who take oaths before collecting their due.",
            "The following laws apply when Levi comes as an agent of Reuven and takes 50 <i>zuz</i> from Shimon, and then Reuven comes and claims: \"I sent him to take only 20, and all that he brought me was 20.\" Reuven must take an oath supporting his claim, as is required of anyone who admits a portion of the claim made against him. And Levi must take a <i>sh'vuat hesset</i> that he gave Reuven the 50 <i>zuz</i> that were given to him.<br>If the above scenario was repeated in an instance where Shimon owed money to Reuven, Shimon must pay the difference from his own resources. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations."

            "A non-Jew may never be appointed as an agent for any mission whatsoever. Similarly, a Jew may never be appointed as an agent for a non-Jew for any mission whatsoever. These concepts are derived from Numbers 18:28: \"And so shall you offer, also yourselves.\" This is interpreted to mean: Just as you are members of the covenant, so too, your agents must be members of the covenant. This principle is applied to the entire Torah.<br>Moreover, the converse is also true: Just as your principals are members of the covenant, so too, in every aspect of Torah law, the principal must be a member of the covenant.",
            "A man may appoint either a man or a woman as an agent. He may even appoint a married woman, a servant or a maidservant. Since they possess a developed intellectual capacity and are obligated to perform some of the mitzvot, they may serve as agents with regard to financial matters.<br>A person who does not have a developed intellectual capacity - i.e., a deaf-mute, a mentally or emotionally unsound individual or a minor - may not be appointed as an agent, nor may they appoint agents. This applies to both a male minor and a female minor.<br>Accordingly, if a person sends a son who is below the age of majority to a storekeeper for oil, the storekeeper measures out an <i>isar's</i> worth of oil for him and gives the child an <i>isar</i> as change, but the child loses the oil and the <i>isar</i> he gave him, the storekeeper is liable to pay. For the father sent the child only to inform the storekeeper that he needed the oil, and the storekeeper should have sent it with a mature person. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations. If, however, the recipient explicitly told the storekeeper: \"Send it to me with the child,\" the storekeeper is not liable.",
            "When a person tells a colleague: \"You owe me a <i>maneh</i>, send it to me with so and so\" - if the debtor desires to send it to the creditor with that person, he discharges his obligation and is no longer responsible for the money even if the person named was a minor. This applies regardless of whether the money was given as a loan or as an entrusted object.<br>Similarly, when two people agree on a stipulation between themselves that whoever desires to send an object to his colleague may send it with whomever the sender desires, the sender may send it with whomever he sees fit, provided he is appropriate to transfer such an article. If the article is stolen or lost on the way, or the agent denies receiving it, the sender is not liable. The rationale is that every stipulation regarding financial matters that is accepted is binding.",
            "When an agent buys or sells an article and notifies the other party that he is acting as an agent for another person in this transaction, and it is discovered that he violated the instructions given him by the principal, the sale is nullified and the article must be returned, even if <i>meshichah</i> was performed.<br>If the agent did not notify the other party that he was an agent, the transaction is binding, and the agent must then satisfy the principal.",
            "The following rules apply when Reuven purchased a field from Shimon and told him: \"I purchased it on behalf of Levi,\" Reuven drew up a deed of sale for Levi, and afterwards Reuven said: \"I purchased the field for myself. Draw up a deed of sale for me.\" The seller is not compelled to draw up another deed of sale for Reuven.<br>If, however, Reuven made a stipulation at the outset, telling the seller: \"I am purchasing it for myself, I am having the deed of sale drawn up on behalf of Levi only so that people will not know that I am the buyer,\" Reuven may compel Shimon to compose another deed of sale in his own name.",
            "A broker is an agent, except that he receives a fee for his services. Therefore, if he deviates from the instructions of the owners, he must take responsibility for the loss he caused.<br>What is implied? Reuven gave an article to Shimon - a broker - and told him: \"Sell this article for me, but do not sell it for less than 100 <i>zuz</i>.\" If Shimon sold it for 50, he must pay Reuven 50 from his own resources. If he sold it for 200, Reuven receives everything. Similar principles apply in all analogous situations.<br>If Reuven claims: \"I told you to sell it for 100,\" and the broker says: \"You told me 50, and I sold it for 50,\" the broker must take an oath mandated by Scriptural Law, for he admitted a portion of the plaintiff's claim. If he already gave him the 50, he is required to take only a <i>sh'vuat hesset</i> that he carried out the mission, and the purchaser acquires the article.<br>If the purchaser knew that the article belonged to Reuven and that the person selling it to him was only a broker, he must return the article to its owner. He may, however, have a ban of ostracism issued against anyone who gave permission for an article to be sold for 50 <i>zuz</i> or agreed to the sale at 50 and then retracted after the sale was made.",
            "The following rule applies whenever a broker informs the purchaser that a specific article or piece of property belongs to a principal, Reuven. If, after the purchaser acquires the article, Reuven says: \"I don't want to sell at this price,\" the purchaser must return the article. For Reuven did not specify a price and tell the agent: \"Sell the article for this and this much.\"<br>Whenever a broker loses an article, or it is stolen or broken, he is liable to reimburse the owner, for he is considered a paid watchman.",
            "The following rules apply when a person takes articles from a craftsman's workplace to send as presents to his future father-in-law's home and tells the craftsman: \"If they accept them from me, I will pay you for them. If not, I will reimburse you slightly for the favor.\" If the presents were destroyed by forces beyond his control while they were being delivered, the giver is liable to pay. If they were destroyed by forces beyond his control while they were being returned, he is not liable.<br>More stringent rules apply if he took the articles with the intent of selling them to others, telling him: \"If they will be able to be sold in such and such a place,\" or \"until such and such a time, I will pay you such and such. If they will not be sold, I will return them to you.\" If they were destroyed by forces beyond his control, whether while they were being transported or while they were being returned, the person who took the articles is liable to pay.",
            "Whenever an agent claims that a loss beyond his control occurred, causing him to lose this and this amount, he must take the oath required of agents to support his claim, and then he is released of responsibility.<br>If the loss occurred in a place where it was likely that he would be able to find witnesses to corroborate his statements or the matter is of public knowledge and witnesses could thus be found, he must bring witnesses to substantiate his claim. If he does not bring witnesses, his claim is not accepted, and he is required to pay.<br>An incident occurred concerning a person who told his agent: \"Buy 400 measures of wine for me with money of mine that is in your possession.\" The agent bought the wine for him and it turned out to be vinegar. The Sages said: \"Such a large quantity of vinegar is bound to have been spoken about publicly.\" Since it is possible to substantiate the claim with witnesses, the agent must bring witnesses that the wine had not turned into vinegar at the time of the purchase, and thus free himself from responsibility. If he does not substantiate his claim, he must pay. Similar laws apply in all instances regarding entities where it is feasible to substantiate a claim.<br>When, by contrast, the claim concerns a hidden matter that is not easy to substantiate, the agent must take an oath concerning it. Similar laws apply to all claims to be issued by a partner and the like. And similar laws apply with regard to watchmen. If it is likely that the claim can be substantiated, the watchman must substantiate it, as will be explained."

            "The following laws apply when a person owns landed property that another person is using or he has movable property that he had given him as an entrusted object, and he seeks to appoint an agent to carry out legal procedures with that other person and expropriate that property or entrusted object from his possession. He must compose a deed granting him power of attorney. And he must perform a <i>kinyan</i> certifying that he was granted power of attorney, telling him: \"Take it to court, acquire it, and expropriate it for yourself,\" or the like.<br>If the principal does not compose such a deed for the agent, he may not enter into litigation on his behalf, for the defendant will argue: \"You are not the party with whom I have contention.\"<br>Even if the principal does compose such a deed, the agent is no more than that, and any property that he acquires belongs to the principal. And any expenses undertaken by the agent with regard to the dispute for which he was given power of attorney must be borne by the principal. For this is also written in the deed granting power of attorney: \"Any expenses that you undertake in this case, I undertake to pay.\"",
            "If the principal transfers ownership to the person to whom he gave power of attorney, granting him only a third or a fourth of the property his colleague is holding, the person granted power of attorney may enter into litigation concerning the entire holding. Since he is entitled to enter into litigation concerning the portion that he owns, and he is justified to enter into litigation with him on that, he may enter into litigation concerning the entire amount.",
            "When one of a group of brothers who have not divided an estate between themselves, or one of a group of partners comes and lodges a claim on a portion of the property they assert to be their own, his claim involves the entire property. The defendant must respond to him. Since this person owns a portion of the property in question, he does not need power of attorney from the other partners.<br>If the defendant prevails, another one of the partners cannot lodge a claim against the partner who engaged in the litigation, telling him: \"If I had been there, I would have raised other arguments and caused the defendant to be held liable,\" for the partner who engaged in the litigation can tell him: \"Why didn't you come and raise those arguments?\"<br>For this reason, if the other partner was in another country, that partner can seek out the defendant and enter litigation against him, telling him: \"I do not agree with all the arguments my partner raised.\"<br>Accordingly, the defendant can delay, telling the first partner: \"Either enter into litigation concerning only your share, or bring me power of attorney from the other party. For I am holding property belonging to both of you, and you both are involved parties in this case. Tomorrow, your brother - or your partner - will come and also lodge a claim against me.\"",
            "A husband needs power of attorney to lodge a claim concerning his wife's property. If, however, there is produce on the property, he has the right to lodge a claim concerning the produce - for it belongs to him - he may also lodge a claim about the property itself. For if his wife does not own the property, he has no right to the produce.",
            "Although a person has entrusted an object to a colleague or given him a loan - whether movable property or money - and appointed an agent in the presence of witnesses to bring that object or loan back to him, the option belongs to the borrower or the lender. If he desires to give it to the agent, he is no longer liable, and is free of responsibility if it does not reach the principal, for he gave it to his agent.<br>If he does not desire to give it to the agent, he is not required to do so. For the agent is not the litigant. This applies unless the agent brings power of attorney from the owner of the entrusted object.<br>Every person who comes to demand payment from a colleague, using power of attorney, is described by the verse (Ezekiel 18:18 : \"He did what is not good among his people.\"",
            "When a person lodges a court claim against a colleague for either movable property or money he entrusted to him, and the defendant has already denied it, the plaintiff cannot write a bill giving another person power of attorney to collect this property or money from that person. The rationale is that he appears to be making a false statement. For he says: \"I am granting you power of attorney to take everything that I own that so and so has,\" and so and so has already denied possessing anything belonging to the principal.<br>Similarly, if a person is required to take an oath in response to a colleague's claim, that colleague cannot grant another person power of attorney to have the oath administered. The rationale is that he is not transferring to the prospective agent an object of substance. And a person cannot transfer power of attorney on a claim that involves merely words. For words cannot be transferred unless they are associated with a financial claim.",
            "When a person has entrusted money to a colleague and desires to grant an agent power of attorney to bring it, a <i>kinyan chalifin</i> is not effective. For money is not acquired through a <i>kinyan chalifin</i>.<br>What should he do? He should give the agent a portion of land of any sizeand transfer the money to him by virtue of his acquisition of the land with the intent that he expropriate it with this power of attorney. The agent may then go, enter into litigation, and expropriate the money.<br>If a person lent money to another person, he cannot compose a bill transferring power of attorney concerning it. This applies even if the loan is recorded in a legal document.The rationale is that a loan was given with the intent that the borrower spend the money. Thus, the money given by the lender no longer exists. And a person cannot transfer ownership over an entity that does not exist. The only way a person can transfer ownership of a debt is through a <i>ma'amad sh'loshtan</i> - which is a dictate whose rationale cannot be explained, as mentioned above, or through transferring the debt by writing a deed transferring ownership of the promissory note and giving it to the recipient, for in this way one transfers the lien that the note conveys.<br>This is my understanding of the law from the <i>Gemara.</i> The <i>Geonim</i> have, however, ordained that one may also grant power of attorney with regard to a loan, so that no one should take money belonging to a colleague and go to a distant country.<br>They also ordained that if a person was granted power of attorney to collect money belonging to a colleague that was held by another person or to demand payment of a loan from him, and the person transferring the debt did not own land, he could transfer to him four cubits of his heritage in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, and then transfer the money to him, by virtue of his acquisition of the land.<br>Such statements appear to me extremely flimsy and insubstantial. For who is to say that this person has a portion in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>? And even if he is fit to receive a portion of the land, it is presently not in his possession. The <i>Geonim</i> who ordained this ruling did not say: \"Let the law pierce the mountain.\" Instead, they explained that the ruling was issued only to intimidate the defendant, so that if he desires to enter into litigation and pay the money when presented with this power of attorney, he is no longer under obligation.<br>Why is he no longer under obligation? For a person who brings this insubstantial power of attorney is no worse than an agent appointed in the presence of witnesses. If, however, the defendant does not desire to enter into litigation with the person granted the power of attorney, he is not compelled to give him the money or take an oath until the principal comes himself.<br>Similarly, the <i>Geonim</i> ruled that if a person granted a colleague a loan, whether it is supported by a promissory note or by a <i>kinyan</i> observed by witnesses, even though the person denied his obligation in court, a deed granting power of attorney can be composed, because the defendant is denying a claim involving a lien on property. If, however, the loan is supported by a verbal commitment alone, and it is denied, the <i>Geonim</i> did not ordain that a deed granting power of attorney be composed concerning it.",
            "When a person granted power of attorney to one individual and then desired to nullify his agency and grant power of attorney to someone else, he may nullify his first appointment.<br>The person granted power of attorney, however, may not grant power of attorney to another person. For the principal might not agree, saying: \"I do not want my property entrusted to another individual.\" Therefore, if the agent had stipulated that he be given the right to grant power of attorney to someone else, and have that person grant power of attorney to another, the agent may write a deed granting power of attorney to a second individual, and the second individual may do so for a third. Everything follows the stipulation.",
            "When a person who was granted power of attorney waives the payment owed by the defendant, sells him the article he was sent to collect, waives his obligation to take an oath, or negotiates a compromise with him, his actions are of no substance. For the principal will tell the agent: \"I sent you to improve my position, not to impair it.\"<br>Therefore, if the agent had the principal stipulate that the agency is effective whether he improves his position or impairs it, his acts are binding, even if he waives payment of the entire obligation.",
            "When Reuven is granted power of attorney and files a claim against Shimon, Shimon cannot turn him away, saying: \"Maybe the principal who sent you appointed another person and nullified your agency.\" For Reuven will tell him: \"Give me the article that was entrusted, and I will leave the deed recording my power of attorney with you.\" If the principal does in fact grant another person power of attorney, he has caused himself a loss. Shimon is not liable, for he gave the object to a person with power of attorney.",
            "The following law applies when Reuven comes with power of attorney from Shimon and demands payment from Levi, and Levi tells him: \"Nothing like that ever happened, but if Shimon wants, he may take an oath and collect the article he claims.\" We expropriate the money from Levi and have it kept in court until Shimon comes, takes the oath and collects the article.<br>Similarly, with regard to any other claim that Levi makes that is dependent on Shimon, Reuven should enter into litigation regarding the matter, and the property should be placed in the court until Shimon comes and is questioned. Reuven may have a ban of ostracism issued against anyone who issues a false claim to withhold payment and delay it.<br>If Levi is required to take an oath, he may not delay and say: \"I will not take an oath until I have a ban of ostracism issued in the presence of Shimon against anyone who issues a false claim against me.\" For the issuance of this ban of ostracism is merely a minor ordinance that the later <i>Geonim</i> ordained so that the litigants will be forthright in their claims. And we do not delay having the defendant take an oath, because of this minor ordinance."

            "When partners desire to establish a partnership, how does each one acquire the assets invested by his colleague, so that they are considered partners? If they desire to establish a partnership with money, each one should bring his money and place it in a common pouch. Then each of them lifts up the pouch.<br>If, however, they composed a legal document detailing the partnership and had witnesses testify that they both performed a <i>kinyan chalifin</i> that each will bring 100 <i>zuz</i> for the partnership, the agreement is not binding and the partnership has not yet been established, for money is not acquired through <i>chalifin</i>.<br>Therefore, if they established their partnership with regard to other movable property, when they entered into a <i>kinyan</i> that one would bring his barrel of wine and the other his jug of honey and they would become partners, the partnership is established in this manner.

For a person cannot transfer ownership to a colleague of an article that does not yet exist. If, however, they purchase the cloth for the garments with their common funds, sew them and sell them, or purchase the woof and warp with their common funds, weave garments and sell them, and a partnership has been established through the use of the money, they are partners. Whatever they earn as payment for their work and their commercial activity is divided equally.",

Even if they purchase a bull for slaughter in which instance, if they slaughter it, each one of them would take a portion of its flesh according to the size of his investment. If they sell the bull while it is alive and profit or lose, the profit or loss is divided equally among the partners.<br>When does the above apply? When they bought and sold with the money of the partnership.

Why is each one given this right? Because one colleague can tell the other: \"Since each of us can be required to pay the entire promissory note, let us continue to do business with the money until the date of payment comes.\"<br>If his colleague tells him: \"Let us divide the assets, and you can receive all the money for the promissory note.

The administrator is responsible for this money even if it is destroyed by forces beyond his control. The second half is considered an entrusted object, and the investor is responsible for it. If the half that is considered an entrusted article is stolen or lost, the administrator is not liable to pay. Therefore, any profit that is earned by this half of the investment will belong to the investor.<br>According to this construct, the profit or the loss of the entire investment should not be equally divided between the investor and the administrator. For if this were the case, the investor would receive a profit for the half of his money that is an entrusted object without doing anything for it.

Thus, this brings the two to <i>avak ribit</i>, the shade of interest.<br>What should be done if they desire that the profit or the loss be equally shared? The investor should pay the administrator the wages to be paid to an unemployed laborer of the profession in which he was involved.

Instead, even if he paid him only one <i>dinar</i> for the entire time of the partnership, this is sufficient.

If there is a loss, the loss is divided equally.<br>If the administrator is a sharecropper working the fields of the investor, and he has another business, he is not required to pay him any other wage at all.

Thus, he receives two thirds of the profit.<br>If there is a loss, the administrator should bear a third of the loss. This figure is reached as follows: He is liable for half the loss because of the half [of the original investment that was a loan. He deserves a sixth of the loss as his wage for handling the half of the investment that was considered an entrusted article. Thus, his responsibility is one third of the loss. The investor must bear two thirds of the loss.",

This is not the rule unless they made an explicit stipulation to this effect.<br>Similarly, if they stipulated that if there be a loss the administrator should suffer half the loss, and if there be a profit he should be granted two thirds of the profit, this is permitted. Similarly, if they stipulated that if there be a profit, the administrator should receive one ninth and if there be a loss, he should lose one tenth, this stipulation is binding. The rationale is that they made a stipulation that the administrator should receive a greater share of the profit than his share of the loss, and he is granted this additional amount because of his work.<br>My teachers ruled that such a conditional agreement is not effective unless the administrator has another occupation. If he does not have another occupation, the profit that the administrator can receive must be at least a sixth more than the loss he could suffer, as we have explained. They maintain that a prohibition is involved, and the stipulation cannot supersede it. This ruling does not appear correct to me.",
            "My teachers ruled that if a stipulation was made that the administrator should receive three fourths of the profit and the investor only one portion, only one fourth of the money will be considered an entrusted article and three fourths will be considered a loan. Therefore, if there is a loss, the administrator should bear three fourths of the loss, minus a twelfth. The investor should suffer a fourth of the loss plus a twelfth - i.e., one third of the entire loss.<br>What is implied? The investor gave the administrator 100 <i>dinarim</i> according to this stipulation, and they lost 24 <i>dinarim</i>, the investor should lose eight, and the administrator sixteen.<br>These ratios should be followed at all times. Whenever there is a profit, the investor should receive the share of the profit that was stipulated. If there is a loss, he should bear that same proportion of the loss, but should be given one third of the investor's portion. Thus, according to this approach, if it was agreed that the administrator would receive a fourth of the profits, he does not lose anything if there is a loss. For in place of the fourth of the loss that he is required to bear, he is due one third of the portion of the owner - i.e., one fourth. And so, one cancels out the other.<br>These authorities maintain that similar principles apply if a stipulation was made regarding losses without mentioning profits. If a loss was incurred, the administrator must bear the loss as stipulated. If a profit was made, the administrator should receive the share of the loss that he was supposed to bear, plus one third of the portion to be received by the investor.<br>What is implied? If a stipulation was made that in the event of a loss, the administrator should bear one fourth of the loss. If there is a loss, he must pay the investor one fourth. If there is a profit, the administrator receives half the profit.<br>Although the rules that they issued are words of logic, if these principles are followed, it is possible for the administrator to cause a loss and yet receive profit.<br>What is implied? It was stipulated that the administrator should receive one seventh of the profit. A loss was incurred. Thus, the administrator should receive as a wage one seventh in addition to this loss.<br>How is this illustrated? They suffered a loss of seven <i>dinarim</i>. The administrator will tell the investor: \"I owe you one <i>dinar</i> according to our stipulation, but you owe me two <i>dinarim</i>, which is one third of the portion of the entrusted article.\" Thus, the investor is obligated to pay him a <i>dinar</i> as wages for losing seven <i>dinarim</i>. And if he had lost fourteen <i>dinarim</i>, the investor would have to pay him two <i>dinarim</i> as wages. This is an unfathomable matter, which cannot be accepted by logic. To me, it appears like a dream.<br>Instead, the proper approach and the true law appears to me as follows: If there is a loss, the administrator should bear as a loss two thirds of the percentage he would receive if there were a profit. Similarly, if they made a stipulation concerning a loss and they profited, the administrator should receive the portion he would lose in the event of a loss, plus a third of the share of his colleague. Thus, according to this approach, if a stipulation was made that the administrator should receive one fourth of the profit and he incurred a loss, he should pay one sixth of the loss. And if a stipulation was made that he should lose a fourth and he profited, he should receive a half. Following this approach will not lead to unthinkable results, and there will be expressed a law that is just."

Thus, we can derive from this that an investor never receives less than half.<br>Why do I not say that the extent of the loss the administrator must bear should be reduced in consideration of his wage for taking care of the portion of the investment considered as an entrusted article? Because the entire half considered as an entrusted article was lost, and no portion remained. Hence, it is not appropriate to say that if he does not receive a wage, his efforts will appear as interest.

            "The following - all types of partners, sharecroppers, guardians of orphans who were appointed by the court, a woman who does business in the family home or who was charged by her husband to serve as a storekeeper, and a member of the household - are all required by Rabbinic Law to take an oath, despite the fact that the claimant does not have a certain claim against them, lest they may have stolen something from their colleague while performing business on his behalf, or perhaps they were not exact when making a reckoning.<br>Why did the Sages ordain this oath? Because these people give themselves license, thinking that they are deserving of whatever they will take from the property of the owner, since they do business and work on his behalf. Therefore, the Sages ordained that they are required to take an oath despite the fact that the claimant does not have a certain claim against them, so that they will perform all their deeds justly and in good faith.",
            "None of the above are required to take an oath because of an indefinite claim until the plaintiff suspects them of taking two silver pieces - i.e., two silver <i>me'ah</i>, as will be explained. If, however, they are suspected of taking less than this amount, they are not required to take an oath.",
            "Based on this, my teachers ruled that if one partner died, the heirs cannot compel their father's partners to take an oath concerning an indefinite claim. For they are not knowledgeable about their father's affairs and do not know for certain that their father suspected the partner of wrongdoing so that it can be said that the heirs suspect the partner of taking two silver <i>me'ah</i>.<br>There are, however, others who rule that the heir may require him to take an oath despite the fact that his claim is indefinite. It is proper to rule in this manner. For we see that the heirs may require a widow who became a guardian during the lifetime of her husband to take an oath.",
            "Although there are no witnesses that a person was his colleague's sharecropper or partner, but rather he himself admits to this fact, saying: \"I am his partner, sharecropper or member of his household - but I did not steal anything from him,\" he must take an oath while holding a sacred article. The rationale is that we do not employ the principle of <i>migo</i> to free a person from the responsibility of taking an oath, but only to free him from a financial commitment.<br>Which member of the household can be required to take an oath because of an indefinite claim? One who brings workers in and leads workers out, who brings produce in and takes produce out. When, however, a member of the household is not involved in the business affairs of the household, but merely enters and leaves, he cannot be required to take an oath because of an indefinite claim.<br>Similarly, a guardian appointed by the father of orphans before his death cannot be required by the orphans to take an oath because of an indefinite claim. Similarly, a woman who did not serve as a guardian in her husband's lifetime, and did not do business with the property of the estate after her husband's burial cannot be required to take an oath because of an indefinite claim.<br>Similarly, if she did business with the property of the estate between her husband's death and burial, she is not required to take an oath regarding the transactions conducted during this period. For if she were required to take an oath, she would not sell any property in order to make the burial possible, and the deceased would become loathsome.",
            "When a person sends an article with a colleague to sell, or sends money with him to purchase produce or merchandise for him, even though the principal did not pay the agent a wage, and the agent does not own any portion of the merchandise nor derive any benefit from it, since he did business with his colleague's money, he is considered a member of his household. Even though the principal has merely an indefinite claim, the agent can be required to take an oath that he did not steal anything from him when he brought him the merchandise that he purchased or a portion of it, or the money from the sale he conducted for him.",
            "When both partners are involved in the business of the partnership or the one who is involved in the business entrusts the merchandise - or a portion of the merchandise - or the funds belonging to the partnership without weighing, measuring or counting them, there is a doubt concerning both of them, and either one can require the other to take the oath required of a partner. If, however, only one of the partners does business and the other is not involved in the business dealings at all, only the former can be required to take this oath.",
            "The above oath can be administered when the initial relationship is still current. If, however, the partners or the sharecroppers dissolved their relationship, the woman was divorced, the member of the household went elsewhere, or the agent brought the principal the merchandise he purchased for him or the money from the merchandise he sold for him, the principal remained silent without making a claim against the other party, and the other party departed, the principal is not able to require that other party to take an oath because of an indefinite claim afterwards. If, however, the principal has a definite claim against him, he can require him to take an oath, and then require him to take additional oaths concerning anything he desires.<br>Similarly, if at a later time, the other person is required to take an oath to the principal - whether required by Scriptural Law or by Rabbinic Law - e.g., he became a partner or a member of the person's household again - the principal can require him to take an oath that he did not steal anything during their present partnership or while he was his partner, sharecropper, member of his household or guardian previously. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.",
            "When partners have dissolved their partnership, but the partnership is still owed debts by others, the partners cannot require each other to take an oath because of an indefinite claim, for they have already divided the partnership's resources. The debts that remain are not significant in this context, for they are matters of public knowledge. When any portion of the debt is repaid, they will each take their appropriate portion of the debt.<br>Similar concepts apply if it has been made known that cash remains in the coffers of the partnership, but the partners have not taken their portion of that cash. Neither may require an oath of the other, because cash is considered as if it is already divided.<br>Similarly, if a reckoning was made of the assets of the partnership possessed by all the partners, and it was determined that one partner was holding a specific and known entity belonging to another, it is considered as if the assets were divided, even though he had not taken it as of that time.<br>If, however, any of the produce belonging to the partnership remained, and it had not been divided or weighed, or any dimension of the partnership remained concerning which an accounting had not been made and thus, neither of them knew the extent of the portion that is due him, the partnership is still considered viable, and either may require the other to take the oath mentioned above.",
            "When a person issues a claim against a colleague after the dissolution of a partnership, he cannot compel him to take an oath except through the convention of <i>gilgul sh'vuah</i>, as explained above. He may, however, have a ban of ostracism issued against anyone who stole from his colleague while he was his partner, sharecropper or member of his household, and does not admit that he stole."

            "The following law applies when a partner claims that the partnership relationship with his colleague involved a certain stipulation, and the colleague denies that such a stipulation ever existed or admits the existence of a stipulation, but claims it was for a lesser amount than the plaintiff claims. The plaintiff may determine the oath the defendant takes.<br>The same ruling applies if the plaintiff asks that property belonging to the partnership be returned to him, and the defendant claims to have given it to him, but the plaintiff claims that he never received it, or the defendant claims that merchandise was his, while the plaintiff claims that it belongs to the partnership, or with regard to any other claims of this type.<br>What is implied? If the plaintiff desires not to require the partner to take the oath required of partners, but instead to require him to take merely a <i>sh'vuat hesset</i> on the claim he denies and does not admit to have taken place, he may require him to take only the lesser oath. If he desires, he can include all the claims in the oath required of a partner. Although he has an indefinite claim, he will require the partner to take an oath that he did not steal anything throughout the duration of the partnership, that these and these stipulations existed between the partners, that the merchandise was his, or that he paid this and this amount. The same principles apply in all analogous situations.",
            "The following rule applies when a person lodges a claim against a partner with the intent of obligating him to take the oath required of partners, the defendant claims: \"We have already divided the assets of the partnership, and nothing that belongs to you remains in my possession,\" and the plaintiff differs, maintaining that the assets were not divided, nor was a reckoning made. The defendant cannot be required to take an oath because of an indefinite claim. [This ruling also applies when the plaintiff admits dividing the assets, but claims that the division was made with the stipulation that the defendant take the oath required of partners whenever the plaintiff demanded, and the defendant has constantly been procrastinating.<br>This ruling applies even when the defendant admits that after the division of the assets, he owed the plaintiff something, but claims that the plaintiff agreed to consider that as a debt, or considered it as an object entrusted to the defendant for safekeeping.<br>Even if there are witnesses that the two were once partners, the plaintiff cannot require an oath with an indefinite claim. Nor may the plaintiff require the defendant to take a <i>sh'vuat hesset</i> that they divided the assets or that they were never partners. The rationale is that a <i>sh'vuat hesset</i> is never required, nor even is a claim included in an oath using the convention of <i>gilgul sh'vuah</i>, unless the claim is such that if the defendant admitted it, he would be liable to pay money. If, however, the claim is one that if the defendant admitted it, he would be required only to take an oath, he may not be required to take an oath on the indefinite claim, even because of the convention of <i>gilgul sh'vuah</i>. <i>Geonim</i>, who are masters of instruction, ruled in this manner.",
            "The following rule applies if the plaintiff claims: \"You are still my partner, and property belonging to me worth such and such remains in your possession,\" and the defendant counters, by claiming: \"We already divided the assets of the partnership, and I no longer have anything belonging to you in my possession,\" or \"I was never your partner.\" The defendant must take a <i>sh'vuat hesset</i> that he does not possess anything belonging to the plaintiff, and because of the convention of <i>gilgul sh'vuah</i>, he must include in the oath that he did not steal anything from him. The defendant need not include in the oath that he was not his partner or that they already divided the assets of the partnership, for the reason explained above.",
            "The following rule applies when the plaintiff claims that he and the defendant are still partners, and that he therefore has the right to require him to take an oath because of an indefinite claim, while the defendant denies ever becoming the plaintiff's partner. If the plaintiff brings witnesses who testify that the defendant was his partner, and the defendant then claims: \"We divided the assets of the partnership,\" his claim is not accepted. The rationale is that he was proven to be a liar with regard to this oath. Therefore, he is required to take the oath required of a partner. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.",
            "The convention of <i>gilgul sh'vuah</i> is also relevant in the following situation. Reuven placed 400 <i>dinarim</i> in the coffers of the partnership, while Shimon invested 200 <i>dinarim</i>. They worked as partners and did business together, but all the money was held by Reuven. If Reuven claimed that there was a loss of 500 <i>dinarim</i>, Reuven may not take the oath required of partners that he suffered such a loss to require Shimon to pay 50 <i>dinarim</i> from his own funds. Instead, Reuven should take the oath required of partners that there was a loss. He should take the <i>maneh</i> that is in his possession, but Shimon is not required to pay anything.<br>If Reuven claims that Shimon has definite knowledge of the loss, he may require Shimon to take the oath required of partners, and based on the convention of <i>gilgul sh'vuah</i>, he may compel him to include that he does not have definite knowledge of this loss.<br>Different rules apply if Shimon was not at all involved in the work of the partnership. Shimon should take a <i>sh'vuat hesset</i> that he does not have definite knowledge of the loss, and he is then freed of liability. Moreover, if the <i>maneh</i> that remains was in Shimon's possession, it should be divided equally between them. The rationale is that a partner is not one of those who is required to take an oath and then collect money from the defendant. Instead, the oath he takes enables him merely to be freed of responsibility or to assume ownership of property in his possession. Be careful with regard to this law, for even masters of instruction have erred with regard to it.",
            "The following law also involves the division of the assets of a partnership. Shimon claims that he owes Levi a <i>maneh</i> because of this partnership. If he has resources of the partnership in his possession that are sufficient to pay the debt, and he can give them to Levi, his word is accepted. He should repay the debt, and afterwards he and Reuven should calculate how the assets should be divided.<br>If Shimon does not have funds from the partnership in his possession, we do not rely upon his word to expropriate money from Reuven or merchandise known to belong to the partnership, lest Shimon and Levi are perpetrating deception, seeking to obtain Reuven's property. Even if the loan is recorded in a promissory note, Reuven is not required to pay any portion of it.<br>If Shimon claims that Reuven has definite knowledge that the debt Shimon incurred came as a result of the partnership, and should be borne by both of them, Reuven is required to take a <i>sh'vuat hesset</i> that he does not know that the partnership has incurred this debt - or because of the convention of <i>gilgul sh'vuah</i>, he should include this statement in the oath he takes as required of partners. Afterwards, Shimon should pay the debt from his own funds.<br>Similarly, if there is a promissory note stating that, due to Shimon, Levi owes the partnership 100 <i>dinarim</i>, and Shimon claims: \"I received payment and returned the money to the coffers of the partnership,\" or \"I extended credit to him for a two- or three-year period,\" his word is not accepted, lest he be perpetrating deception, seeking to obtain Reuven's property.<br>How should this case be adjudicated? Levi was already freed from obligation through Shimon's admission. If Shimon does not bring proof of his claim, Shimon must pay Reuven's share from his own funds. He should then demand payment from Levi at the end of the time span he mentioned. Similar principles apply in all analogous situations."
