[If a seller says to an buyer for example] \"This house I sell to you\", \"This wine I sell to you\", \"This slave I sell to you\", then they decide a price. The buys wants [such a deal] and says, \"I purchased it\", and the seller wants [such a deal] and says, \"I sold it\". They say to witnesses, \"Be witnesses for us so that [you can testify] that one sold and one bought\". Indeed however, this [their testimony] is worthless, and it is as if they never talked. This is true for the giving and receiving of gifts. ",
