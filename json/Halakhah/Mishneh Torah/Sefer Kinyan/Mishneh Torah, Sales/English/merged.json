            "An article is not acquired merely through a verbal agreement. This applies even when witnesses testify that the principals have reached an agreement.<br>What is implied? A person says: \"I am selling you this house,\" \"I am selling you this wine,\" or \"I am selling you this servant,\" and a price is fixed. The purchaser agrees and says: \"I have purchased it,\" the seller says: \"I have sold it,\" and they tell witnesses: \"Serve as witnesses that so and so has sold and so and so has purchased\", their words are of no consequence. It is as if they had never spoken to each other at all. The same applies with regard to a person who gives a gift and its recipient.",
            "If, however, the purchase is completed through one of the media by which property is transferred, the purchaser acquires the object. There is no need for witnesses; neither the seller or the purchaser may retract.",
            "How is an acquisition made? Landed property can be acquired in one of three ways: a) through the transfer of money, b) through the transfer of a deed of sale, or c) through <i>chazakah</i> (manifesting one's ownership).",
            "How is property acquired through the transfer of money? If one person sold another person a house or a field, and the purchaser gave him the money agreed upon, he acquires it. When does the above apply? In a place where it is not customary to write a deed of sale. In a place where it is customary to write a deed of sale, however, the purchaser does not acquire the property until a deed is composed.<br>Landed property cannot be acquired for less than a <i>p'rutah's</i> worth.",
            "If the purchaser makes the following stipulation: \"If I desire, I will acquire it through the transfer of money, or if I desire I will acquire it through the transfer of a deed of sale,\" and gives money on the basis of this stipulation, it is established as a binding condition. Once the money has been paid, the seller cannot retract, because of the stipulation. The purchaser can, however, retract until the deed of sale is written.<br>Similar laws apply if the seller makes such a condition.",
            "When a person tells a colleague: \"Give so and so a <i>maneh</i> and you will acquire my house,\" once the colleague makes the payment, he acquires the house. This is an extension of the laws applying to a guarantor.",
            "How is property acquired through the transfer of a deed of sale? The seller writes for the purchaser on a piece of paper, on a shard or on a leaf. \"My field is given to you,\" or \"My field is sold to you.\" Once the deed reaches the purchaser's hand, he acquires the field, even though there are no witnesses at all, and despite the fact that the document itself is of no financial value. When does the above apply? When a person sells his field because it is undesirable. With regard to other landed property, by contrast, even though the deed of sale reaches the purchaser's hand and is signed by witnesses, the purchaser does not acquire the property until he pays its price.",
            "How is property acquired through the manifestation of ownership? If a person sold a colleague a house or a field or gave him such properties as a gift, the purchaser or the recipient acquires the property when he locks the entrance to the property, encloses the property with even the slightest portion of a fence or breaks through even the slightest portion of one of the walls surrounding the property, provided his deeds bring him benefit.<br>When does the above apply? When the person manifests his ownership in the presence of the seller or the one who gives the gift. If, however, he does so outside the presence of the seller or the one who gives the gift, the seller or the giver must tell him: \"Go, manifest possession over it and acquire it.\" If this statement is made, and afterwards the purchaser or the recipient manifests possession, he acquires the property even if he acts outside the presence of the previous owner.",
            "When a person sells a house to a colleague and gives him the key, it is as if he told him: \"Go, manifest possession over it and acquire it.\" Similarly, if a person sells a colleague a cistern, once he gives him its bucket it is as if he told him: \"Go, manifest possession over it and acquire it.\" When he manifests his possession, he acquires it.",
            "What is meant by saying that one who locks a property acquires it? For example, when a person sells a house or a courtyard whose entrance was open, and the purchaser locked the entrance and then opened it; the purchaser is considered to have acquired it, for he used it in a way that brings benefit.",
            "What is meant by saying that one who encloses the property with even the slightest portion of a fence acquires it? For example, there was a fence that people could climb over easily, and the purchaser added a small portion to its height, making it ten handbreadths high thus causing it to be difficult to climb over. His deeds are of benefit and he acquires the property.<br>Similarly, if there was an opening in the fence that allowed people to enter only with difficulty, and the purchaser widened it even slightly, allowing people to enter easily, his deeds are of benefit and he acquires the property.",
            "If the purchaser placed down a rock in a way that causes benefit - e.g., he completed an irrigation channel that brought water to the field - or he removed a rock in a way that causes benefit - e.g., he opened a dammed irrigation ditch and let water flow into the field - he acquires it. The same applies in all analogous situations.",
            "The following rules apply when a person sells a colleague a field that is located next to one of that colleague's fields, or gives him such a field as a gift. Once the colleague breaks down the partition that separates the two fields from each other and makes them one large field, he acquires it.<br>If, however, he merely walks the length and breadth of the new property, this walking serves no benefit and it therefore does not serve as a manifestation of his ownership. When he sells him a path for vineyards, however, the purchaser does acquire it by walking, for that is its purpose.",
            "How wide is the path that a person acquires by walking? If it is defined by barriers, he acquires an area at least large enough to enable him to lift one foot up and place the other next to it. If it is not defined by barriers, he acquires a width sufficient to allow him to walk carrying a package of twigs on his head and turn around with it.",
            "If the property being sold is a rocky patch that cannot be enclosed with a fence and an entrance, nor can it be sowed, the way in which a person manifests his ownership and acquires it is to spread produce upon it, to have an animal stand there, or to use it in another way.",
            "When a person sells a field to a colleague, and the colleague enters and sows it, plows it and leaves it fallow, collects its produce, prunes it or the like, he acquires it, for he has manifested his ownership. Neither of them may retract.<br>Similarly, if the seller collects a basket of produce and gives it to the purchaser, the purchaser acquires the field. This is considered manifestation of ownership, for the seller revealed his intent of transferring ownership of the field to the purchaser in an outright way, so that its produce would be his.",
            "A gentile cannot acquire property by manifesting his ownership over it. He can acquire a property only through the transfer of a legal document after money has been paid. A Jew who comes on account of a gentile is considered like a gentile and can acquire property only through the transfer of a legal document.<br>Any entity that is attached to landed property is considered like landed property and can be acquired through the transfer of money, the transfer of a deed of sale or through <i>chazakah.</i><br>If, however, the produce no longer needs the nurture of the land - e.g., grapes that are ready to be picked - it is considered movable property with regard to the laws of acquisition. And like movable property, the laws of deception apply with regard to their sale.",
            "Just as landed property itself is acquired through the transfer of money, the transfer of a deed of sale or <i>chazakah,</i> so too, the rental of land is finalized through the transfer of money alone, the transfer of a deed of sale alone, or <i>chazakah,</i> and neither party can retract.",
            "When a person sells a colleague ten fields in ten different countries, the purchaser acquires them all by manifesting his ownership over one of them. Even if one of the fields was located on a high mountain and another in a valley - and thus the manner in which one is tilled differs from the other -nevertheless, by manifesting his ownership over one of them, the purchaser acquires them all.",
            "When does the above apply? When he pays for all of them. If, however, he does not pay for all of them, he acquires only a measure of property equal to the money that he pays. Therefore, if all the fields were given as a gift, he acquires them all.<br>Similarly, with regard to the rental of landed property, if a person manifests ownership over one of the properties he is renting, he acquires them all for the entire duration of the rental period.<br>If a person is purchasing some properties and renting others, once he manifests his ownership over one property, whether that property be purchased or rented, he acquires them all."

            "A Canaanite servant is considered as landed property with regard to the laws of acquisition, and can be acquired through the transfer of money and a deed of sale, or through <i>chazakah.</i>",
            "What manifestation of ownership is effective in acquiring a servant? Making use of him as one makes use of a servant in the presence of his previous master.<br>What is implied? If the servant unties his new master's shoe, puts on his shoe, carries his articles to the bathhouse, undresses him, anoints him, combs his skin, dresses him or lifts him up, the master acquires the servant.<br>Similarly, if the master lifts up the servant, he acquires him.",
            "If the new owner pushes the servant and brings him close to him, he acquires him, for a Canaanite servant can be acquired through <i>meshichah</i> in this manner. If, however, he called the servant and he came to him, or the servant's previous owner told him to go to the purchaser, and he followed those instructions, the new owner does not acquire him until he pushes him or until he makes use of him in the manner described above.<br>If the new owner manifests his ownership over the servant outside the presence of the previous owner, the previous owner must tell him: \"Go, manifest your ownership and acquire him\" for the <i>kinyan</i> to be effective.",
            "A servant below the age of majority is considered like an animal and can be acquired through both the processes by which an animal is acquired and those by which servants are acquired. Therefore, he can be acquired by <i>meshichah</i> even though the new owner did not push him.",
            "Livestock, whether light or heavy, can be acquired through <i>meshichah.</i> When lifting an animal is possible, it need not be lifted, because it may receive a blow when placed back on the earth. If a person lifts it up, he acquires it.<br>Lifting up an object serves as a <i>kinyan</i> in all places, while <i>meshichah</i> is effective as a <i>kinyan</i> only in a corner off the public domain, or in a courtyard whose ownership the buyer and the seller both share. <i>Meshichah</i> is not effective as a <i>kinyan</i> in the public domain or in a courtyard whose ownership is not shared by both the seller and the purchaser.",
            "How is an animal acquired through <i>meshichah</i>? Needless to say, the transaction is completed if the purchaser pulls the animal and it walks after him, or he rides upon it and causes it to walk. The transaction is effective even if he calls it and it comes, or he swats it with a stick and causes it to run. When the animal lifts both a forefoot and a hind foot, the purchaser acquires it.<br>The above applies provided the purchaser performs <i>meshichah</i> in the presence of the previous owner. If he performs <i>meshichah</i> outside the presence of the previous owner, that person must tell the purchaser before he performs <i>meshichah,</i> \"Go, perform <i>meshichah</i> and acquire it.\"",
            "When a person sells a herd to a colleague or gives it to him as a gift, if he gives him the <i>mashkuchit -</i> i.e., the animal that leads the herd, that all the others follow - he does not have to tell him, \"Perform <i>meshichah</i> and acquire it.\" For giving him this animal is tantamount to saying: \"Go, perform <i>meshichah</i> and acquire it.\" Thus, once the purchaser or the recipient performs <i>meshichah</i> with the herd, he acquires it, even if he performs <i>meshichah</i> outside the presence of the previous owner.",
            "When a person tells a purchaser or a recipient of a gift: \"Perform <i>meshichah</i> over an animal and then you will acquire it,\" or \"Perform <i>chazakah</i> over property and then you will acquire it,\" he does not acquire it if he performs <i>meshichah</i> or <i>chazakah.</i> For the expression \"you will acquire it\" is in the future tense and implies that he has not transferred ownership to him yet.<br>Instead, the seller or the giver of the gift must say: \"Go, perform <i>chazakah</i> and acquire it,\" \"Go, perform <i>meshichah</i> and acquire it,\" or the like, using an expression that implies that he will acquire it at the time he performs <i>meshichah</i> or <i>chazakah.</i>",
            "When a person tells a colleague: \"Perform <i>meshichah</i> with an animal and you will acquire it after 30 days,\" and he performs <i>meshichah,</i> he does not acquire it.<br>If he told him \"...acquire it now and after 30 days,\" he acquires it, even if it is standing in a swamp on the thirtieth day. For this resembles a situation in which an acquisition was made in the present, conditional on a stipulation, in which instance, when the stipulation is met, the transaction becomes effective.<br>Whenever a person uses the expression \"with the intent that...,\" it is as if he said that the transaction would take effect from the present.",
            "The following rules apply when a person sells an animal to a purchaser or gives it as a gift and tells the purchaser or the recipient: \"Acquire it in the manner in which people normally acquire it.\" If he performs <i>meshichah</i> or <i>hagbahah,</i> he acquires it. If, however, he rides upon it a distinction is made: If this is done in the field, he acquires it. If it is done in the city, he does not acquire it, for it is not common for people to ride in a city.<br>For this reason, if the purchaser or recipient is an important person - who is accustomed to riding in a city, a very base person - who is not concerned about riding through the city, e.g., a person who raises animals or servants, or a woman, or if the animal is in the public domain where many walk, it can be acquired by riding, provided the rider causes the animal to proceed."

            "According to Scriptural Law, both livestock and other movable property are acquired by the payment of money. Once the purchaser pays money, neither he nor the seller can retract. Our Sages, however, ordained that movable property should be acquired only through lifting up the article <i>(hagbahah)</i> or pulling <i>(meshichah)</i> an article that is not commonly lifted up.",
            "What is implied? When a person gathers together a heavy load of wood, flax or the like that cannot be lifted up, this load cannot be acquired through <i>meshichah,</i> for it can be unbound, and each individual piece of wood can be lifted up. The same principle applies in other similar situations.<br>In contrast, a large load of nuts, peppers, almonds or the like that no one person could lift up, can be acquired through <i>meshichah.</i> For if one untied the load and separated it, lifting each individual item would involve great difficulty. The same principle applies in other similar situations.",
            "With regard to a ship: since it is impossible to lift it up, and it is very difficult to pull it - this is possible only when many are involved - our Sages did not require <i>meshichah.</i> Rather, they ruled that it can be acquired through being handed over <i>(mesirah).</i> The same principles apply in all similar situations.<br>If the seller tells the purchaser, \"Go, perform <i>meshichah</i> and acquire the ship,\" the ship cannot be acquired until one pulls it after oneself, shifting its position entirely, moving it from the place where it had been resting. For the seller had specified that it be acquired solely through <i>meshichah</i>.",
            "From the above, one may conclude that a person who purchases movable property may retract, even though he has paid for his purchase. Similarly, the seller can retract until the purchaser lifts up the object of sale or performs <i>meshichah</i> on an article that is not usually lifted up, or the seller gives the purchaser an article that is not usually pulled.<br>When, however, the purchaser lifts up the object of sale, performs <i>meshichah</i> on an article that is not usually lifted up, or is given an article that is that is not usually pulled, he acquires it. Neither party can retract, and the purchaser is compelled to pay if he has not done so already.",
            "Why did our Sages make such an ordinance with regard to movable property? This is a decree, enacted lest a purchaser pay for an article and before he takes possession of it, it be destroyed by factors beyond his control - e.g., a fire breaks out and burns it, or thieves come and take it. If the article is considered as in the possession of the purchaser, the seller may hesitate and not endeavor to save it.<br>For this reason, our Sages ordained that the article remain within the possession of the seller, so that he will attempt to save it. For if it is destroyed, he is obligated to pay.",
            "Thus, if a purchaser paid for an article and it was destroyed by forces beyond his control before he took it, the purchaser may tell the seller: \"Give me the article I purchased or return my money.\" Even though there are witnesses who saw that the article was destroyed by forces beyond control, the seller could not save it, and he was not lazy regarding the matter, the seller must return the money. For our Sages ordained that a <i>kinyan</i> is finalized through <i>meshichah.</i><br>For this reason, if the purchaser owned the house in which the article that was sold was held, and he was renting it to the seller, our Sages did not ordain that the article must be acquired through <i>meshichah.</i> For the article that was sold is in the domain of the purchaser. In this instance, once he pays the money, the sale is concluded, and neither can retract.",
            "Similarly, if a person rented the place where the movable property that was sold was stored, he acquires the movable property, and neither can retract, even though he did not lift up the object of sale, perform <i>meshichah</i> on it or have it given him. For the object has entered his domain. As we have already explained, the rental of landed property is finalized through the transfer of money, the transfer of a rental contract or through <i>chazakah.</i>",
            "When a person transfers ownership of landed property and movable property simultaneously, once the purchaser or the recipient acquires the landed property through the transfer of money, the transfer of a deed of sale or through a <i>chazakah,</i> he acquires the movable property together with it.<br>This applies whether he sold both types of property, gave them both as gifts, sold the movable property and gave the landed property as a gift or sold the landed property and gave the movable property as a gift. When the purchaser or the recipient acquires the landed property, he acquires the movable property.",
            "When does the above apply? When the movable property was collected within the landed property. If, however, it was in another place, it is necessary for the seller to tell the purchaser: \"Acquire the movable property by virtue of your acquisition of the immovable property.\"<br>Even when the movable property is in another country, and the seller tells the purchaser: \"Acquire the movable property by virtue of your acquisition of this landed property,\" once the purchaser acquires the landed property, he acquires the movable property together with it, even though the movable property was not collected within the landed property.<br>If the seller did not tell the purchaser: \"Acquire the movable property by virtue of your acquisition of this landed property,\" the purchaser does not acquire the movable property.<br>Even the smallest amount of landed property is sufficient to be used to acquire any movable property one desires by virtue of its acquisition.",
            "Different rules apply when a person transfers ownership of a field to one person and movable property to another person, even though he tells the latter: \"Acquire the movable property by virtue of your colleague's acquisition of this landed property.\"<br>Although the recipient manifests ownership over the landed property, the other does not acquire the movable property. If, however, this person seizes possession of it after the seller desires to retract, it should not be removed from his possession, for he took possession of it after his colleague acquired the landed property by virtue of whose acquisition this movable property was to be acquired.",
            "When a person desires to transfer ownership over servants and landed property at the same time, although he manifests ownership over the servants, he does not acquire the landed property. Similarly, although he manifests ownership over the landed property, he does not acquire the servants unless they are standing within the landed property. Even though the seller tells the purchaser: \"Acquire the servants by virtue of your acquisition of this landed property,\" the purchaser does not acquire the servants unless the servants are within the landed property. The rationale is that a servant goes from place to place on his own volition.",
            "When a person transfers ownership of servants and movable property at the same time, the purchaser does not acquire the servants by performing <i>meshichah</i> on the movable property. If he manifested his ownership over the servants, he did not acquire the movable property, unless the servant was carrying the movable property. Moreover, the servant must be bound, so that he cannot walk.",
            "The following laws apply when a person transfers ownership of both an animal and the articles it was bearing at the same time. Although he performs <i>meshichah</i> of the animal and acquires it - he does not acquire the articles it was bearing until he lifts up or performs <i>meshichah</i> on the articles themselves, if it is not customary to lift them up. The rationale is that an animal is like a walking courtyard, and thus, what it bears is not acquired by its owner. Therefore, if the animal was bound, by performing <i>meshichah</i> on it, one also acquires the articles it was bearing.",
            "When the seller tells the purchaser, \"Perform <i>meshichah</i> over this animal in order to acquire the articles on it,\" since he does not transfer ownership of the animal itself - even if the purchaser performs <i>meshichah</i> on the animal while it is bound - he does not acquire the articles on it, unless he performs <i>meshichah</i> on those articles themselves.",
            "The following rules apply when a flowerpot with a hole was owned by one person, and the plants growing in it by another person. If the ownership of the flowerpot was transferred to the owner of the plants, he acquires it when he performs <i>meshichah</i>. If the ownership of the plants was transferred to the owner of the flowerpot, he does not acquire it until he manifests his ownership over the plants themselves.",
            "The following rules apply when both a flowerpot with a hole and the plants growing in it were owned by one person, and he desired to transfer ownership of the entire entity to another person. If that person manifests his ownership over the flowerpot with the intent of acquiring the plants, he does not even acquire the flowerpot. If he manifests his ownership over the plants with the intent of acquiring both them and the flowerpot, he acquires the flowerpot.<br>This is implied by the teaching: Property that is not on lien to the seller's obligations can be acquired together with property that is on lien to the seller's obligations. For the plants in the flowerpot with a hole are considered as if they are planted in the earth. And whenever an entity is attached to the ground, it is considered to be landed property, as we have explained.",
            "As we have already explained, produce that is ready to be harvested is considered as though it has already been harvested, and can be acquired only through <i>hagbahah</i> or other procedures by which movable property is acquired.",
            "The following laws apply when flax is attached to the earth, but is dry and no longer needs the nurture of the earth. If the owner tells another person: \"Clean the smallest portion of this land for me, and acquire it as a rental property together with all the flax on the entire surrounding field, once he uproots even the slightest amount, the renter acquires the entire quantity, on the basis of this stipulation.<br>If, however, the original owner transferred ownership over the flax through a sale or a gift, the recipient acquires only what he uproots, for that is what he has lifted up. The same principles apply in other analogous situations."

            "Containers owned by a person can acquire articles on his behalf wherever he has permission to place them down. Once movable property enters this container, neither can retract; it is as if the article were lifted up or placed in his home.<br>Therefore, a person's containers cannot acquire articles on his behalf in the public domain or in a domain belonging to the seller unless the seller tells him, \"Go, acquire the article with this container.\"<br>Similarly, if the purchaser first acquired the container and lifted it up, and afterwards placed it down in the domain of the seller and bought produce from him, once the produce is placed in this container, he acquires it. Since the seller derives satisfaction from selling the container, he does not object to the container being placed in his domain.",
            "Just as containers belonging to the purchaser do not acquire articles for him when placed in the seller's domain, so too, containers belonging to the seller do not acquire articles for the purchaser even when they are within the purchaser's domain.",
            "<i>Mesirah</i> may be used to acquire an article only in the public domain, or in a courtyard that is not owned by either the seller or the purchaser.<br><i>Meshichah</i> may be used to acquire an article only in a corner off the public domain or in a courtyard that is owned jointly by the seller and the purchaser. <i>Hagbahah</i> may be used to acquire an article in any place.",
            "The following rule applies when an article that could be acquired through <i>meshichah</i> is located in the public domain, and is drawn by the purchaser into his own domain or into a corner of the public domain. As soon as he removes a portion of the article from the public domain, he acquires it.",
            "When there is a load of produce in the public domain and, after having established a price, the purchaser draws it into his own domain or into a corner of the public domain he acquires it, even if he has not measured it.<br>Similarly, if, while in the public domain, the purchaser measures produce that he purchases, he acquires it, item by item, for as he measures it, he is lifting it up.",
            "If, by contrast, the seller measures the produce into containers belonging to the purchaser, the purchaser does not acquire it. For a purchaser's containers cannot acquire on his behalf in the public domain.<br>If the produce is located in a domain belonging to the purchaser, once the seller agrees to sell the produce, the purchaser acquires it, even if he does not measure it.<br>If the produce is located in a domain belonging to the seller, or in a domain belonging to a person to whom the seller has entrusted it, the purchaser does not acquire the produce until he lifts it up, or until he removes it from the seller's domain by renting its place, or the like, as we have explained.",
            "The following rules apply when the produce is located in a corner of the public domain or in a domain belonging to both the seller and the purchaser -or even if it is in a domain belonging to the purchaser, but in containers belonging to the seller- and the seller agreed to sell the produce, and has begun to measure it into containers belong to the seller. If the seller tells the purchaser: \"I will sell you a <i>kor</i> of produce for 30 sela,\" he can retract even at the last <i>se'ah,</i> because the produce is in his containers, and he has not completed the measurement. For the containers belonging to a seller do not acquire for a purchaser, even in the purchaser's domain.<br>If he told him: \"I will sell you a <i>kor</i> of produce for 30 <i>sela,</i> i.e., each <i>se'ah</i> for a <i>sela</i>\" the purchaser acquires each <i>se'ah,</i> one by one as it is measured.For since the seller mentioned the price for each individual <i>se'ah,</i> each of those units is a distinct entity. Whenever the seller lifts up a <i>se'ah</i> and pours it into the measure, the sale of this unit is concluded.<br>The rationale for this law is that the produce is not located in a domain belonging to the seller, nor is it in the public domain. If the produce was not held in the containers of the seller, the purchaser would acquire it once a price was agreed upon, since it is located in his domain even though it had not been measured, as has been explained in the previous halachah.",
            "Similar rules apply when a person sells wine or oil to a colleague in a corner of the public domain or in a courtyard belonging to both the seller and the purchaser, or in a domain belonging to the purchaser, and the measure belongs to the broker. Before the measure is filled, the liquid remains the seller's. Once the measure is filled, the liquid becomes the purchaser's. Neither of them can retract.",
            "Similar rules apply if produce is held in a corner of the public domain or in a courtyard belonging to both the seller and the purchaser, the measuring container does not belong to either of them, and the seller was measuring. Before the measure is filled, it remains in the possession of the seller. Once the measure is filled, however, it becomes the purchaser's.",
            "The following rules apply when the measure belongs to either the purchaser or the seller, and it has marks indicating the halfway point, thirds, quarters and the like. Once the produce reaches one of those markings, that portion is acquired even though the entire measure has not been filled. For every marking is considered to be a measure in its own right. For the measure belongs to one of them, and he relies on its markings.",
            "Maintain awareness of this significant general principle: When a person acquires movable property, he acquires it, if he establishes the price and afterwards lifts up the article. If first he lifts it up and puts it down, and then a price is established afterwards, he does not acquire it because he lifted it up at the outset. Instead, it is only when he lifts it up after a price is established, or performs <i>meshichah</i> on an object that is not ordinarily lifted up.",
            "When an object that has a standard and known price is sold, and the purchaser lifts it up, he acquires it, even though he and the seller agree on the price only after he lifts it up. Similarly, with regard to other means through which movable property is acquired. The acquisition must be made after the price of the article is established, unless there is a standard price for the article, as has been explained.",
            "For this reason, the following rules apply if a person draws donkey-drivers and the produce their beasts are carrying and porters bearing containers filled with produce into his home. If the produce is measured before a price is established - even if the purchaser is the one who measures - or they established the price and then the seller measures the produce, both the seller and purchaser are entitled to retract. Different rules apply if the purchaser unloaded the produce and brought it into his home. If a price was established and then the seller measured, neither can retract.

Instead, she may expropriate it from him, as explained in <i>Hilchot Ishut.</i><br>When a court sells or purchases property on behalf of orphans - whether landed property or movable property - both the purchase and sale are binding. If, however, it gives the orphans' property away as a present, the gift is of no consequence. The rationale is that a person may not give away something that does not belong to him.<br>The same principles apply with regard to an orphan's guardian, whether a guardian appointed by the court or one appointed by the orphan's father before his death.",
            "When a person sells or gives away property on the Sabbath - and needless to say, on the holidays - although he is punished by stripes, his deeds are binding.<br>Similarly, when a person enters into a <i>kinyan chalifin</i> on the Sabbath, the <i>kinyan</i> is binding. After the Sabbath, a legal record may be composed and the property transferred."
