            "There are three whose purchase or sale is invalid according to biblical law: the deaf-mute, the imbecile, and the minor. The sages, however, have enacted that the deaf-mute or the minor may have valid business dealings for his livelihood.",
            "How does a deaf-mute make a transaction? If one neither hears nor speaks, or speaks but hears nothing, he can buy movable goods by signs, but not landed property. Even with movable goods, his transactions are valid only after he has passed many tests and the court has duly deliberated the case.",
            "A speechless person who hears though he cannot speak, or one who has been paralyzed and rendered speechless, both his purchase or sale is valid, and so are his gifts valid in every respect, both in movable goods and in landed property, provided he has been examined by the court in the manner that tests are given in divorce cases, or if he can write with his own hand.",
            "Neither the purchase nor the sale of an imbecile is valid, nor are his gifts valid. The court appoints an administrator for imbeciles as it does for minors.",
            "One who is alternately insane and sane, as in the case of epileptics, the rule is that when he is sane all his dealings are valid and he may acquire ownership for himself and for others like any sensible person. The witnesses should investigate the matter thoroughly to be sure that he did not perform the act toward the end or at the beginning of his lapse into insanity.",
            "",
            "",
            "The minor should be tested whether or not he is familiar with the nature of business. Sometimes a seven-year-old youngster is clever and intelligent, while another as old as thirteen knows nothing about the nature of a transaction. If a youngster, knowing the nature of business and having no guardian, has made a deal in movable goods and committed an error, his legal status is that of an adult : less than one-sixth is remitted ; one-sixth, the difference is refunded ; [an overcharge of] more than one-sixth, the transaction is invalid, as we have explained.",

            "The purchase or sale by a drunken man, and his gifts, are valid. If, however, he has reached the drunken condition of Lot, being too drunk to know what he is doing, his transactions mean nothing, since he has the legal status of a youngster less than six years old."
