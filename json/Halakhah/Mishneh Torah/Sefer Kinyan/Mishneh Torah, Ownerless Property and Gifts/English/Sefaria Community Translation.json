Because she was trying to hide her assets, and she only wrote the transfer to hide her assets from her husband, so that he would not inherit them from her, and when she needs the assets, they would return them to her. Therefore, if she predeceases her husband, the recipient of the gift acquires it. But if she retains any part of her assets even chattels, her gift stands and even if she later divorces, it does not return to her."
