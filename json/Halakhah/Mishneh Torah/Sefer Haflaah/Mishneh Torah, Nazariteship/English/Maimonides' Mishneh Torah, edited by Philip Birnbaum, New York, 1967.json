If he transgresses by drinking wine, cutting his hair, touching a corpse or the like, he is to be lashed."

If, however, one vows to God in a way of holiness, he does a good thing and deserves praise. Concerning such a man it is written: \"His consecration to God is upon his head … he is consecrated to the Lord\" (Numbers 6:7-8). Scripture considers him the equal of a prophet, as it is written: \"I raised up some of your sons as prophets, and some of your young men as nazirites\" (Amos 2:11)."
