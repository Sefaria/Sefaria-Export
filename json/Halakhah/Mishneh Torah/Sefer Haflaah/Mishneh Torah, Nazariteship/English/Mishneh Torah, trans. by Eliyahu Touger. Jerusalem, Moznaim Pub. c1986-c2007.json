            "A nazirite vow is one of the types of vows involving prohibitions,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus it is governed by the laws mentioned in the previous set of halachot. As mentioned in the beginning of <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i>, there are two types of vows: vows involving prohibitions and vows taking on an obligation to bring sacrifices. A nazirite vow also involves bringing sacrifices, as will be explained. Nevertheless, it is considered primarily a vow involving prohibitions (Radbaz).</i>as [Numbers 6:2] states: \"When one will take a nazirite vow....\" It is a positive commandment for [a nazirite] to let the hair of his head grow,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 92) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 374) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> as [<i>ibid.</i>:5] states: \"He shall let the mane of the hair of his head grow.\" If he cuts [his hair] in the midst of the days of his nazirite vow, he violates a negative commandment,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 209) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 373) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> as [<i>ibid.</i>] states: \"A razor shall not pass over his head.\" Similarly, he is forbidden to contract ritual impurity from a corpse<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandments 207-208) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvot 375-376) include two prohibitions involving this matter among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. See Chapter 5 which describes this prohibition.</i> or eat those products of a grape vine which the Torah forbids him from eating<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This includes prohibitions against drinking wine and eating fresh grapes, raisins, grape seeds, and grape peels. <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 202-206) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvot 368-372) include five prohibitions against partaking of these grape products among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> throughout the entire span of his nazirite vow.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Radbaz explains that the Rambam does not mention these prohibitions in the order that they are mentioned in the Torah, not in the order that they are mentioned in the Mishnah. The rationale is that the mitzvah of letting one's hair grow is mentioned first because it involves both a positive and a negative commandment.</i>",
            "When [a nazirite] transgressed and cut his hair, became impure [due to contact with a corpse], or partook of wine grapes, he receives two sets of lashes:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For with his deed, he has violated two of the Torah's prohibitions.</i>one because of the prohibition \"He shall not desecrate his word,\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Which applies with regard to the violation of all vows, as stated in <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 1:5.</i> and one because of the prohibition that he transgressed from the unique prohibitions that apply to a nazirite.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If he violates his nazirite vow in several ways, e.g., he eats grapes and becomes impure, he receives lashes according to the number of violations involved (Radbaz).</i>",
            "When a person takes a nazirite vow and fulfills his vow according to the mitzvah, he has performed three positive commandments: a) \"He shall act in accordance with all that he uttered with his mouth,\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the commandment to observe the vows one takes. See <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 1:4.</i> and he has acted [accordingly], b) \"He shall let the mane of the hair of his head grow,\" and he has let it grow, and c) shaving and bringing his sacrifices,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Which is done at the fulfillment of one's nazirite vow. <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 93) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 377) include this commandment among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. See Chapter 8 which describes this procedure.</i> as [<i>ibid.</i>:18] states: \"And the nazirite shall shave at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.\"",
            "When a person says: \"I will not depart from the world until I become a nazirite,\" he becomes a nazirite immediately, lest he die at that time. If he delays [implementing] his nazirite vow, he transgresses the prohibition:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 23:22. As the Rambam states in <i>Hilchot Arachin VaCharamim</i> 1:1, this prohibition applies to any person who delays keeping the vows and pledges he makes. He does not, however, list this prohibition as one of the 613 mitzvot in these halachot, but instead, in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> (in the introduction to those halachot and in Chapter 14, Halachah 13).<br>See also <i>Hilchot Arachin</i> 6:33 which uses this law as support for the principle that a pledge to perform a mitzvah is considered as a vow.</i> \"Do not delay in paying it.\" Lashes are not given for the violation of this prohibition.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For as stated in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 18:2, lashes are not given for the violation of a prohibition that does not involve a deed. Note, however, Chapter 5, Halachah 21.</i>",
            "With regard to a nazirite vow, we do not say: [The vow does not take effect] until he makes a statement that every person would be able to understand [that] in his heart [he desired to take a nazirite vow]. Instead, since he made a decision in his heart to take a nazirite vow and verbally expressed concepts that suggest this intent, he is a nazirite although these concepts are distant and [their simple meaning] does not communicate the concept of a nazirite vow.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This concept, which the Rambam illustrates in the following halachot, expresses the principle (see <i>Nedarim</i> 5b) that <i>yadot nedarim</i>, literally \"handles of vows,\" are considered equivalent to vows themselves.</i>",
            "What is implied? A nazirite was passing in front of a person and he said: \"I will be,\" he is a nazirite. Since in his heart, he intended to say that he will be like that person, [it is considered as if he made such a statement] even though he did not explicitly say: \"I will be like him.\" Similarly, if he took hold of his hair<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Rambam, when he makes such statements while holding his hair, it is not necessary that a nazirite pass in front of him for his statement to be binding.</i> and said: \"I will become attractive,\" \"I will grow my hair,\" \"I will cultivate my hair,\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew uses two expressions to communicate this and the previous concept. Our translations for these terms are taken from Rav Kappach's translation of the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Nazir</i> 1:1).</i> \"I will let my hair grow long,\" he is a nazirite, provided he made such a decision in his heart.",
            "If he says: \"I am obligated to bring doves [as offerings],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The offering a nazirite would bring if he became impure (see Numbers 6:10 .</i> he is not a nazirite even if a nazirite is passing in front of him and even if he had the intent of becoming a nazirite. It is as if he did not say anything.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., with regard to a nazirite vow. Since it is possible that his statement meant that he intended to offer the doves as a sacrifice, it is not considered as implying a nazirite vow. From the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), it appears that the person is liable to bring these doves as a voluntary offering. It is questionable if here the Rambam is negating that implication.</i>",
            "All nicknames for a nazirite vow are considered like a nazirite vow.<br>What is implied? In places where people mispronounce the words they use, if one says: \"I am a <i>nazik</i>, a <i>naziach</i>, a <i>paziach</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam writes that gentiles who lived among the Jewish people would mispronounce the word <i>nazir</i> in this manner. As such, there would be some Jews who would make similar mistakes. See parallel concepts in <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 2:5, <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 1:16.</i> he is a nazirite.\"",
            "If a person says: \"I am a nazirite only with regard to grape seeds\" or \"...with regard to grape peels,\" \"I am a nazirite with regard to shaving,\" or \"I am a nazirite only with regard to impurity,\" he is a nazir in the complete sense and he must keep all the particular laws incumbent on nazirites even though his intent was to forbid himself only with regard to the particular he mentioned. Since the matter concerning which he took the nazirite vow is forbidden to nazirites, he is a nazirite in the full sense of the term.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., since he used the term \"nazirite\" and the object which he mentioned is forbidden to nazirites, the nazirite restrictions all take effect. Note the contrast to the following halachah.</i>",
            "If, however, one says: \"I am a nazirite from dried figs,\" \"...from cakes of dried figs,\" or the like, he is forbidden [to partake of] the article specified, but he is not a nazirite.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because the term nazirite does not apply with regard to those objects.</i>",
            "When a cup of wine was mixed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., in the Talmudic era, the wine was very strong. Hence it was customary to mix water into wine before serving it.</i> for a person and given to him to drink and he said: \"I am a nazirite from it,\" he is a nazirite in the complete sense.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the situation is comparable to those described in Halachah 9.</i> If he was a morose person, angry, or in mourning and the others were trying to have him drink to release his burden and he said: \"I am a nazirite from this [cup],\" he is forbidden to drink only that cup, but he is not a nazirite. [The rationale is that] his intent was only that he would not drink that cup.",
            "Similarly, if a drunken man was given a cup to make him totally inebriated and he said: \"I am a nazirite from it,\" he is forbidden to drink only that cup, but he is not a nazirite. [The rationale is that his intent was] only that they should not have him become overly drunk. If he was as drunk as Lot<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Who became so drunk that he lost all consciousness of his actions. See Genesis, ch. 19.</i> his statements are of no consequence and he is not liable for any transgression that he performs. For when he reaches a state of inebriation equivalent to Lot's, he is not liable at all.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., he is considered like a mentally and emotionally incapable person (a <i>shoteh</i>). See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 4:18, <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 29:18.</i>",
            "When a person says: \"I am a nazirite on the condition that I can drink wine,\" \"...become impure because of contact with the dead,\" or \"...cut my hair,\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., he seeks to avoid keeping one or more of the obligations of the nazirite vow although he will keep the others.</i> he is a nazirite and is forbidden to perform all of the above. [The rationale is that] he made a stipulation against what is written in the Torah and whenever one makes a stipulation against what is written in the Torah, the stipulation is nullified.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a general principle applying in many aspects of Torah law, e.g., <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 16:9.</i>",
            "When a person takes a nazirite vow and [afterwards] says: \"I did not know that a nazirite was forbidden to partake of wine..., \"...to become impure,\" or \"...to cut hair. Had I known this, I would not have take the vow,\" he is a nazirite and is obligated in all these prohibitions. [The rationale is that] he knows that he is obligated in at least one of these [prohibitions] and as we explained,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the previous halachah.</i> even if one took a [nazirite] vow, forbidding only one of these acts, he is forbidden in all of them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad states that if a person would approach a sage and ask him to absolve his nazirite vow on these grounds, the sage would certainly consent. We are speaking about an instance when the person seeks to have the vow nullified without consulting a sage because it was taken in error. The Radbaz states that the Rambam would also accept this ruling. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, however, does not accept this explanation.</i>",
            "If the person says: \"I know that a nazirite is forbidden in all of the above, but I thought that it would be permitted for me to drink wine, because I cannot live without wine,\" or \"[I thought that I would be permitted to become impure,] because I bury the dead,\" he is not a nazirite,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He need not observe any of the nazirite prohibitions, even the ones he had intended to observe.</i> because his vow is included in the category of vows made in error<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad considers this as a vow which a person is prevented from keeping by forces beyond his control, citing <i>Nazir</i> 11b which appears to support this interpretation. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and the Radbaz state that while the actual wording of the Talmud fits the Ra'avad's interpretation, the Rambam's explanation can be justified. [Significantly, in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Nazir</i> 2:4), the Rambam uses the wording suggested by the Ra'avad.]</i> which need not be absolved by a sage, as we explained.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 3:6; <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 4:1.</i>",
            "When a person says: \"My hand is a nazirite\" or \"My foot is a nazirite,\" his words are of no consequence. If, however, he says: \"My head is a nazirite\" or \"My liver is a nazirite,\" he is a nazarite.\" This is the general principle: Whenever a person designates as a nazirite an organ upon whose removal<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Or Sameach</i> notes that the Rambam changes slightly the wording of his source, <i>Nazir</i> 21b, based on his ruling in <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 8:16. There the Rambam writes that if an animal is born without a liver it may live, but if it was born with a liver and then the liver was removed, it is <i>treifah</i>.</i> from a living person would cause him to die, he is a nazirite.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For it is considered as if he took the vow upon his entire person. Compare to <i>Hilchot Arachin</i> 2:1; <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 15:2; <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 27:8.</i>",
            "When a person says: \"I will be a nazirite when a <i>ben</i> is born to me,\" if a son is born to him, he is a nazirite.

The rationale is that, with regard to an oath, Leviticus 5:4 states: \"Whether he will do harm or do good.\" Implied is that he can take an oath - or a vow, because an association is established between vows and oaths - only when he has the choice of either doing good or doing harm to himself. This does not apply to these oaths. Since they harm his master, he has no right to take them.<br>c) Nazirite vows are not automatically nullified, because the association with vows does not apply with regard to them. Nevertheless, since the servant belongs to his master, the master has the right to nullify his vow.<br>d) Vows other than a nazirite vow that are neither aggravating nor prevent the servant from working must be fulfilled. The rationale is that in contrast to an oath in which the prohibition is incumbent on the servant (the <i>gavra</i>), for a vow, the prohibition falls upon the object (the <i>cheftza</i>).

Neither of these shavings can be considered as the same shaving as the one performed by a nazirite. The rationale is that the first shaving of the purification from <i>tzara'at</i> is for a different purpose than the shaving performed by a nazirite. For the intent of the shaving of a nazirite is to remove hair, while the intent of the first shaving performed by a person afflicted with <i>tzara'at</i> is to allow hair to grow (<i>Nazir</i> 60b, Radbaz). Similarly, the second shaving associated with <i>tzara'at</i> is not analogous to the shaving associated with the nazirite vow, for the shaving of a <i>metzora</i> is performed before the sprinkling of the blood and the shaving of a nazirite afterwards.</i><br>When it is questionable whether a person was afflicted with <i>tzara'at</i> [and thus became a <i>metzora</i>], the shaving [associated with emerging from] <i>tzara'at</i> does not supercede his nazirite vow. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Which involves a prohibition against shaving.

[And] when there is [a conflict between] a positive commandment and a negative commandment... the positive commandment supercedes the negative commandment.\" There is also a positive commandment for a nazirite to grow his hair long and a negative commandment does not override a negative commandment and a positive commandment. Nevertheless, when a nazirite contracts <i>tzara'at</i>, that there is no positive commandment involved in growing his hair. Since it is possible that this is not the situation prevailing in this instance, he should not shave (Radbaz).</i> Therefore [the following rules apply] if a person took a nazirite vow for a year and throughout this year, there was a question whether he had been afflicted with <i>tzara'at</i> and a question whether he had contracted ritual impurity through contact with a human corpse<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this instance, it is questionable whether he is required to shave to perform a shaving to emerge from ritual impurity (as explained at the beginning of Chapter 6) or not.</i> or there was a question whether he had been afflicted with <i>tzara'at</i> and at the end of the year, a question arose whether he had contracted ritual impurity.
