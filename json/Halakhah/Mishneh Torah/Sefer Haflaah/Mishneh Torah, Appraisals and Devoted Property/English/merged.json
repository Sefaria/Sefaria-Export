Since most people in their death throes will die, he is considered as if he is [already] dead.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note, however, <i>Hilchot Evel</i> 4:5.</i> Similarly, if a person was sentenced by a Jewish court to be executed because of a transgression that he committed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the Torah has condemned such a person to death, the matter is not dependent on the will of mortals. If, by contrast, one is condemned to death by a mortal king, these laws do not apply, because it is possible that the king will retract his decree (the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>loc. cit.</i>). Compare to <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 6:29.</i> and another person pledged his <i>airech</i>, he pledged his own <i>airech</i>, or he pledged his worth or another person pledged his worth, none of the above are liable for anything. For the person is considered as if he is already dead and a deceased person has no <i>airech</i>, nor any worth. With regard to this, [Leviticus 27:29] states: \"Any condemned person who is condemned from mankind shall not be redeemed,\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our translation follows the commentary of Rashi and others.</i> i.e., there is no redemption for him and he is considered as if he is dead.",

            "When one says: \"I pledge an <i>airech</i>\" without identifying the person whose <i>airech</i> he is pledging, but mentions an <i>airech</i> without any more particulars, he is liable to pay the lowest of all <i>arechim</i>, i.e., three <i>shekalim</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We assume that his obligation was for the smallest amount possible.</i>",
            "When a person says: \"I pledge my <i>airech</i>,\" but dies before standing before [a court for] appraisal,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 8, Halachah 2.</i> his heirs are not liable to pay, as [implied by Leviticus 27:8]: \"And he shall be made to stand before the priests and the priest will evaluate him.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the obligation takes effect only when he stands before the priest for appraisal (the Rambam' s Commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Arachin</i> 5:3). Since he did not do that, his heirs are under no obligation (Radbaz). The Ra'avad, however, differs with the Rambam and maintains that as soon as a person pledges an <i>airech</i>, he is liable for it and an obligation is created for his estate. Hence, he differs with the Rambam's ruling.<br>Apparently, the Rambam is saying that if a person pledges an <i>airech</i>, he must stand before a priest and state his age, so that the priest will establish his appraisal. The <i>Merkevat HaMishneh</i> notes that the literal meaning of the verse is that if a person is too poor to pay the <i>airech</i>, the priests will evaluate how much he can pay.</i> If he stood before [a court for] appraisal and then died, the heirs must pay.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For once an <i>airech</i> is established, a binding obligation is incurred and his estate is required to pay.</i>",
            "If, however, he says: \"I pledge my worth,\" even if he stands before [a court for] appraisal, but dies before they establish a fixed amount and the judges say how much he is worth, his heirs are not obligated to pay.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Until an appraisal is established by the courts, the obligation is not defined. Hence, when he dies, all liability is removed from the estate because a deceased person has no worth (<i>Arachin</i> 20a).</i> If, however, they affixed his worth and then he died, his heirs must pay.",
            "What is the difference between <i>arechim</i> and pledges of worth? [The amount required to be paid] for <i>arechim</i> is fixed by the Torah, while [the amount required to be paid] for a pledge of worth is not fixed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to early printings and authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.

[Similarly,] if one said: \"I pledge the worth of so-and-so\" and that person stood for an appraisal, but died before an evaluation of his worth was established,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As the Rambam emphasizes in his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Arachin</i> 5:2), there is a difference in this regard between the pledge of an <i>airech</i> and the pledge of a person's worth. When his <i>airech</i> is pledged, the person who made the pledge is liable as soon as he stands before the court for appraisal. Since the matter is dependent on his age alone, there is no need for an evaluation. When, by contrast, a person's worth is pledged, that worth must be evaluated and until the evaluation is completed, there is no obligation.</i> [the one who made the pledge] is not liable, for a deceased person has no worth."

There are, however, those who note that in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 15:2, the Rambam does not accept the principle that the sanctity spreads from a limb or organ throughout the entire animal unless the limb or organ is of vital importance.</i> Therefore it should be sacrificed and not redeemed.",

They explain that this is referring to an instance where the purchaser pledged to purchase a burnt offering of a certain value and the animal is worth that amount, even without the limb in question.

Hence, the Temple treasury should be the sole owner without leaving any portion for the person himself. Therefore the Ra'avad suggests that the intent of saying that they are partners is that the consecrated entity's value is divided in half.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that the Talmud clearly mentions evaluation in that passage and therefore, does not accept the Ra'avad's view. How is a head evaluated? The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that we consider the tasks the servant or the person performs.

As support, he cites <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 15:1 where the Rambam writes that after a person consecrates an animal, even if he seeks to retract his consecration immediately, he cannot. The Radbaz (see his gloss to the following halachah) supports this view.

If, however, the creditor does not have a promissory note whose authenticity has been verified, he cannot collect the debt, even though the debtor acknowledged it on his deathbed. The rationale is that (as stated in <i>Hilchot To'ain ViNitan</i> 6:7), a person is wont to state that he owes money even if he in fact does not so that his sons do not think of themselves as rich. His estate is not bound by these statements unless, as stated above, he explicitly instructed that the debt be paid or the creditor has a promissory note that has been verified. Even though in this instance, the money will be going to the Temple treasury and not to his sons, a similar rationale can still be applied. We say that he is admitting the debt so that people will not think of him as a person who hoarded money throughout his life (<i>Sefer Meirat Einayim</i> 255:12).</i> If he said to give [the money to the creditor] after he consecrated [his property],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's decision, stating that the word of a person on his deathbed is accepted even he makes his statements after consecrating the article.

The difference between a healthy person and one on his deathbed is that when a person is on his deathbed, his word is accepted as long as he is still speaking of the deposition of his property even though it is not directly after he consecrated it.</i> we do not heed his statements.

In response to that acute need, one may give more that a fifth. Here the Rambam is speaking about giving to charity when there is no acute need. Hence the limit should be adhered to.<br>In <i>Iggeret HaTeshuvah</i>, Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi states that one may give more than a fifth of his resources to charity to atone for his sins, for just as one is not concerned with the amount one gives when it comes to healing a physical wound or blemish, so too, one should not be worried about cost when healing a spiritual blemish.</i> and he should conduct himself as our Prophets advised [cf.
