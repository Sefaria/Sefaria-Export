            "Vows are divided into two classes. The first class relates to a person who forbids himself things that are permitted to him, as when he says: \"Let the fruit products of a certain country be forbidden to me for thirty days,\" or \"forever\"; or \"a certain kind of the world's fruit products\" or \"these fruit products shall be forbidden to me.\" No matter what language he uses in restricting himself, those things are forbidden to him even in the absence of an oath or the mention of the divine name or its substitute. In regard to this, it is written in the Torah: \"If a man makes a vow … imposing a prohibition on himself\" (Numbers 30:3); that is, he forbids himself things that are permitted. So too, if he said: \"These things shall constitute a vow of abstinence for me,\" they are forbidden. I refer to this class of vows as vows of prohibition.",
            "The second class relates to a person who obligates himself to offer a sacrifice that he does not owe, as when he says: \"I pledge myself to offer a burnt-offering,\" — — or \"let this animal be a burnt-offering\" or \"a peace offering.\" The expression <i>I pledge myself</i> is called a vow, while <i>this is to be</i> is called a donation. — — I refer to this class as vows of consecration.",
            "",
            "The Torah commands every person to fulfill his oath or his vow, whether it is a vow of prohibition or a vow of consecration, as it is written: \"You must fulfill what has passed your lips and perform what you have vowed\" (Deuteronomy 23:24); and it is written: \"He must carry out all that has passed his lips\" (Numbers 30:3)."

            "If anyone made a vow or took an oath, specifying at the same time the cause of his vow or oath, it is as if he had made his vow or oath dependent upon that cause. Hence, if the cause of his oath has not materialized, he is released.",
            "If, for example, he vowed or took an oath: \"I will not marry that woman, because her father is an evil man; I will not come into this house, because there is a surly dog in it,\" and they died, or the father repented, he is released. For he is like one who made a vow or took an oath, saying: \"I will not marry that woman; I will not enter this house, unless the injurious factor is removed.\" This applies to all similar cases.",
            "If, however, one takes a vow or swears: \"I will not marry that ugly woman,\" and she is found to be pretty, or \"that brunette\" and she is a blonde, or \"that short one\" and she is tall, or \"I vow that my wife shall derive no benefit from me because she stole my purse and struck my son,\" and it has become known that she neither stole nor struck, he is released, since it was an erroneous vow.— —",
            "Moreover, if a person saw men at a distance as they were eating his figs and he told them: \"They are prohibited to you as a sacred offering,\" but when he came closer he realized that they were his own father and brother, they are released from his vow. Even though he failed to specify the reason for which he prohibited them, it is as if he did specify, because it is obvious that he forbade them only because he thought that they were strangers. The same applies to all similar cases.",
            "",
            "If any vow has been remitted in part, it has been remitted in its entirety. The same is true of oaths. If, for example, one noticed men at a distance as they were eating his fruit products and he said: \"These products are forbidden to you as a sacred offering,\" but upon approaching them he realized that they were his father and some strangers, they all are released from his vow along with his father. Even if he said: \"If I had known this, I would have said: \"These men are prohibited, but my father is permitted,\" they are all permitted nevertheless.— —",
            "",
            "",
            "If a man was asked to marry his relative and he refused; when he was urged he vowed or took an oath that she was never to derive any benefit from him; or if a man divorced his wife and swore or vowed that she was never to derive any benefit from him; either of these women may nevertheless derive a benefit from him, since his intent was confined to matrimony.",
            "So too, if a man invited a person to dine with him, and the latter refused, swearing or vowing that he would not enter his house or drink a drop of cold water, he is nevertheless permitted to enter his house and drink his cooled beverage [on other occasions], since he merely had in mind not to eat and drink with him at this particular meal. This holds good in all similar cases.",
            "",
            "",
            "If a man swore or vowed to take a wife, to buy a house, to join a caravan, or to go on a sea voyage, he should not be compelled to marry, buy, or leave immediately, but only after he has found a suitable occasion. It once happened that a woman made a vow to marry anyone who would propose to her, and some men who were not suitable to her snatched the opportunity and proposed to her. The sages thereupon declared: \"This woman had in mind only a suitable party asking her in marriage (Bava Kamma 80a). This applies to all similar cases."

            "A Boy of twelve years and one day and a girl of eleven years and one day, who took oaths or made vows, whether vows of prohibition or of consecration, should be examined and interrogated. If they know in whose name they vowed, consecrated, and took oaths, their vows are valid and their consecration is effective; if they do not know, there is no value to their vows and verbal commitments. They should be examined concerning each vow made throughout the entire year; that is, the twelfth year in the case of a girl and the thirteenth year in the case of a boy.",

            "Until when may her father annul them? Until she reaches maturity. Once she has reached maturity, he may no longer annul them. All her vows and oaths have the same force as the vows of a widow or a divorced woman, concerning whom it is written: \"Whatever she has imposed on herself shall be binding upon her\" (10)."

            "If a person has made vows in order to adjust his characteristic traits and to improve his behavior, he is indeed alert and deserves praise. Examples: One who was a glutton forbade himself meat for a year or two; or one who was addicted to drinking forbade himself wine for a long time, or vowed never to become intoxicated. So too, one who ran after bribes, hastening to get rich, forbade to himself the gifts or the favors coming from the residents of a particular town. So too, one who became arrogant because of his good looks vowed to become a nazirite. Such vows are designed to serve God, and concerning them the sages declared: \"Vows are a fence around self-restraint\" (Avoth 3:17).",
            "Even though they are a form of divine service, one should not impose on himself many vows of prohibition nor make frequent use of them, but should rather abstain from things that are to be shunned, without making vows.",
            "The sages have asserted: \"Anyone who makes a vow is as if he built a high place for idolatry\" (Nedarim 60b). If he transgressed and made a vow, it is his duty to seek absolution from his vow, so that it might not become an obstacle on his way.— —"
