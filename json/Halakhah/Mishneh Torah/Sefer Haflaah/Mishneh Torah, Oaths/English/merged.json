            "There are four types of oaths: the futile oath, the false oath, the oath concerning a deposit, and the oath of testimony.— —",
            "The law concerning the futile oath applies only to things that are possible of performance whether in the future or in the past. Examples of the past: \"I ate; I threw a stone into the sea; A conversed with B; I did not eat; I did not throw a stone into the sea; A did not converse with B.\" Examples of the future: \"I will eat; I will not eat; I will throw; I will not throw a stone into the sea.\" Thus there are two kinds of a futile oath that include positive and negative assertions about things past, and two kinds that include positive and negative assertions about the future.",
            "If anyone took one of these four classes of oaths and did the reverse, if for example he swore not to eat and ate, or to eat and did not eat; or if he swore \"I ate\" when in fact he did not eat, or \"I did not eat\" when in fact he did eat, it is a false oath. Of this and similar oaths it is written: \"You shall not swear falsely by my name\" (Leviticus 19:12).— —",
            "The futile oath is [likewise] divisible into four classes. The first is a case where one has sworn that a known fact is not a fact. For example, one has sworn that a man is a woman, or that a woman is a man, or that a pillar of marble is made of gold, or anything of this sort.",
            "The second is a case where one has sworn about a known fact which is not doubted by anybody, as when he has sworn that heaven is heaven, or that a particular stone is a stone, or that the number two is two, or anything of this sort. Since this is not doubted by any normal person, there is no need to confirm it by oath.",
            "The third is a case where one has sworn to break a commandment, as when he has sworn not to enwrap himself in a fringed garment, or not to wear <i>tefillin</i>, or not to dwell in a <i>sukkah</i> during the festival of <i>Sukkoth</i>, or not to eat <i>matzah</i> on Passover nights, or to fast on Sabbaths and festivals, or something like this.",
            "The fourth is a case where one has sworn about something that is not within his power to do. He has, for example, sworn not to sleep for three days in succession, both night and day, or not to taste anything for seven consecutive days, or something like this. Anyone who swears a vain oath belonging to one of these four classes transgresses a prohibitive law, as it is written: \"You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain\" (Exodus 20:7). If he has committed the transgression deliberately he is to be lashed; if unintentionally, he is altogether exempt from liability.",
            "The oath concerning a deposit is as follows: Anyone who has in his possession money belonging to another person, whether it is a deposit or a loan, or he has robbed or exploited him, or found a lost article of his and failed to restore it, or anything of the sort, if he denies when the other demands it from him, he transgresses a prohibitive law, as it is written: \"You shall not deal deceitfully\" (Leviticus 19:11). This is a warning against the denial of money due. No lashing is inflicted for transgressing this prohibition; but if he has sworn falsely concerning the money which he has denied, he has transgressed another prohibition, concerning which it is written: \"You shall not deal falsely with one another\" (11). This is a warning directed against the person who swears to deny money due. Such an oath is referred to as the oath concerning a deposit.",

            "What is the oath of testimony? If witnesses in a case of property are summoned by the plaintiff to testify for him and they deny their knowledge of evidence and refuse to testify, swearing that they know no testimony concerning him, it is what is called the oath of testimony.— —"

            "It is immaterial whether one swears any of the four types of oaths with his own lips or is adjured by others and he answers <i>Amen;</i> even if a non-Jew or a minor adjured him and he answered <i>Amen</i>, he is liable, because anyone who responds with <i>Amen</i> to an oath is as if he uttered it with his own lips. It makes no difference whether he answers <i>Amen</i> or says something that has the same meaning as <i>Amen</i>, as when he says \"yes\" or \"I am required to take this oath\" or \"I accept this oath,\" or anything of this sort in any language, it is as if he had indeed taken an oath which makes him liable either to lashing or to bringing a sacrifice.",

            "So too, if others told him <i>retract</i> or <i>you are set free</i>, or a similar phrase, and he acquiesced within the time required for a single utterance, and said \"yes\" or \"I retract\" or the like, he is set free; but he cannot retract after a lapse of time required for a single utterance.",

So too, if others told him <i>retract</i> or <i>you are set free</i> or <i>you are pardoned</i>, and in his heart he instantly acquiesced to their words, it is of no avail, unless he expresses the retraction with his lips, as in the case of the oath [which he uttered with his lips]."

            "[When a person says: \"I am taking] an oath that I will not eat this loaf. [I am taking] an oath that I will eat it,\" the second oath is an oath taken in vain, for he is forbidden to eat it. He is liable for lashes for the second oath whether he partakes of [the loaf] or not. If he eats it, he is liable also for [not fulfilling] a sh'vuat bitui. Similarly, whenever one takes an oath to neglect a mitzvah and does not neglect it, he is exempt for [violating] a sh'vuat bitui. He is, however, liable for lashes for taking an oath in vain. He should perform the mitzvah that he took an oath to neglect.",
            "What is implied? For example, a person took an oath that he would not make a sukkah, he would not put on tefillin, he would not give charity, he is liable for lashes for taking an oath in vain. Similarly, [one is liable] if he takes an oath for a colleague that he will not give testimony that he knows or that he will not testify if he will know testimony, for he is commanded to testify. Similarly, if he tells a colleague: \"[I am taking] an oath that I will never know testimony concerning you,\" it is an oath taken in vain, for it is not within his capacity [to be certain] that he will never know of testimony concerning him. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.",
            "When a person takes an oath to fulfill a mitzvah and fails to fulfill it, he is not liable for not fulfilling a sh'vuat bitui. What is implied? A person took an oath to make a lulav or a sukkah, to give charity, or to testify on behalf [of a colleague] if he knew testimony [that could affect him]. If he did not make [these articles], give [the charity], or testify, he is exempt for [not fulfilling his] sh'vuat bitui. For a sh'vuat bitui takes effect only with regard to matters left to one's choice - [i.e., matters that] if he wants to, he may perform and if he does not want to, he need not perform, as implied by [Leviticus 5:4]: \"whether he will do harm or do good.\" Therefore whenever anyone takes an oath to harm another person, he is exempt from a sh'vuat bitui, e.g., he takes an oath to strike so-and-so, to curse him, steal his money, or deliver him to the control of a man of force. [The rationale is that] he is commanded not to do [these things]. It appears to me that he is liable for lashes for taking an oath in vain.",
            "If a person took an oath to harm himself, e.g., he took an oath to inflict injury upon himself, the oath takes effect even though he is not allowed to do so. If he does not harm himself, he is liable for [not fulfilling] a sh'vuat bitui. If he took an oath to help others with regard to a matter with which he could help them, e.g., to speak to the ruling authorities or to show him honor, the oath takes effect. If he transgresses and does not carry out [his promise], he is liable for [not fulfilling] a sh'vuat bitui."

            "If anyone took a rash oath and regretted it; he realized that he would suffer if he kept this oath, so he changed his mind; or something occurred to him of which he was unaware at the time of the oath, and is sorry on its account, he should apply to a sage, or to three laymen if no sage is available, and they will absolve him from his oath, and he will be permitted to do the thing he swore not to do, or not to do the thing he swore to do. This is called absolution from oaths.",

            "No one can absolve himself from his own oath. No one may absolve an oath or a vow in a locality where there is someone greater than he in wisdom. If his own teacher is in the same place, he must not absolve without his teacher's consent.",
            "",
            "How are oaths absolved? The person who took the oath should present himself to the distinguished scholar, or to three laymen if no expert is available, and say: \"I took an oath concerning this and that, and now I am sorry. Had I known that I might be distressed because of it to such a degree, or that such a thing might happen to me, I would not have taken the oath. Had I known at the time of the oath what I know now, I would not have sworn.\" Thereupon the scholar, or the eldest of the three laymen, should say to him: \"Have you regretted it indeed?\" And he should reply: \"Yes.\" Then he should say to him: \"You are set free, you are pardoned,\" or anything similar in meaning in any language. If, however, he said to him: \"Your oath is void,\" or \"Your oath is eradicated,\" or something similar in meaning, what he said is of no avail, because none except a husband or a father can revoke an oath. A scholar may use only terms of absolution and pardon."

            "There are three types of oaths that are biblically imposed, namely: 1) when a man claims movable goods from his neighbor, who admits one part but denies another; 2) when he denies owing any of the movable goods claimed, but one witness testifies against him and contradicts him. These two oaths result from a positive claim and a denial. 3) So too, when a custodian pleads that the article which was deposited with him is lost, stolen, dead, or something like that, he must take an oath due to the uncertainty of the claim, since the claimant of the deposit does not know whether the custodian's plea is true or false. He swears a biblical oath, as it is written: \"An oath before the Lord shall decide between the two of them\" (Exodus 22:10).",
            "Any oath administered by the judges, with the exception of these three types, is of rabbinic origin. This legal oath is referred to as the oath imposed by the judges.— —",

My teachers have taught that the judicial oath should only be administered in the holy tongue.",

It has become a general custom, however, that the <i>ḥazzan</i> of the synagogue or someone from among the people holds a <i>Sefer Torah</i> in his hand while the equitable oath is being administered, in order to impress the man with awe.",
            "Judges who administer the oath in any language the swearer knows are acting within the law. Such was the decision of the Geonim. My teachers, however, taught that the oath should be administered only in the holy tongue; but it is not right to rely on this decision. Even though all courts customarily administer oaths in the holy tongue, it is important to inform the person who is taking the oath so that he may know the terms of the oath.— —",
            "Anyone subject to a judicial oath resulting from a definite claim and a denial — — should be admonished, as will be explained. There is, however, no need to admonish anyone liable to an oath on grounds of a doubtful claim.— —",
            "How should the one who takes an oath be admonished? He should be told: \"Know that the entire world trembled at the moment God said to Moses: You shall not bear the name of the Lord your God in vain\" (Exodus 20:7). Concerning all biblical transgressions it is written: \"The man shall be clear of guilt\" (Numbers 5:31), but here it is written: \"The Lord will not clear one who swears falsely\" (Exodus 20:7). For all biblical transgressions the guilty person alone is punished, but here both he and his family who protect him from justice are punished. Furthermore, he causes all Israel to be punished, since all Israelites are responsible for one another, as it is written: \"Nothing but perjury, lying, and murder … therefore the land mourns, and all who dwell in it languish\" (Hosea 4:2-3).— —",
            "The full substance of this admonition should be expressed to them in the language they know, so that they may understand the words and that the sinner be determined to sin no more. If he then says: \"I will not swear,\" we should exempt him from the oath, and he must pay what his neighbor claims from him. So too, if the claimant says: \"I will not make him take an oath,\" thus releasing him from the claim, they leave the court."
