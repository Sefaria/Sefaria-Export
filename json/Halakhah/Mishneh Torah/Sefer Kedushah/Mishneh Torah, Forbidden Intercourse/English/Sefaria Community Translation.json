This custom is just an error in those responsa and [this practice] is [an act of] heresy in those places. They learned this practice from the <i>Tzadokim</i>.

But now, after you have converted, if you eat forbidden fat you will be punished with karet, if you break Shabbat, you will be punished by being stoned.

            "1. What is meant by the Torah's prohibition (Deut. 23:3) against relations with a mamzer? [The term refers to a person conceived from] a forbidden sexual relationship. A niddah is an exception. A son conceived from such relationships is blemished, but is not a mamzer. When, however, a man enters into any other forbidden sexual relationships, whether through rape, or willingly, whether conscious of the prohibition or not, the offspring produced is a mamzer. Both male and female [mamzerim] are forbidden forever, as [Deuteronomy 23:3] states: \"[A mamzer shall not enter Gd's congregation.] Also the tenth generation...,\" i.e., [the prohibition is] everlasting.",
            "2. When a mamzer marries a Jewish women or a Jewish man marries a female mamzer, once they enter into relations after consecration, they are punished by lashes. If the man consecrates the woman, but does not enter into relations, he does not receive lashes. If they enter into relations without consecration, they do not receive lashes because of relations with a mamzer. For the only instance where relations that involve a negative prohibition incur the punishment of lashes without the woman being consecrated is relations between a High Priest and a widow, as will be explained. When a man remarries his divorcee after she married another person, the offspring are acceptable. For she is not considered an ervah.",
            "3. When a gentile or a servant enter into relations with a Jewish woman, the child is acceptable. [This applies] whether the woman is unmarried or married, whether she was raped or engaged in relations willingly. When a gentile or a servant enter into relations with a female mamzer, the offspring is a mamzer. When a mamzer enters into relations with a female gentile, the offspring is a gentile. If [the child] converts, he is fit to marry within the Jewish people like other converts. If [a mamzer] enters into relations with a maid-servant, the offspring is a servant. If he is freed, the offspring is acceptable like other freed servants. He may marry a Jewish woman.",
            "4. This is the general principle: When a child is born from a servant, a gentile, a maid-servant, or a female gentile, he is like his mother. We are not concerned with the father. For this reason, [the Sages] permitted a mamzer to marry a maid-servant to purify the lineage of his descendants. For he can free them and they will be free men. [Our Sages] did not ordain a decree forbidding a maid-servant to a mamzer, so that he can legitimize his sons.",
            "5. When a person who is half a servant and half a freed man engages in relations with a married woman, a son born of that relationship has no way of legitimizing [his marriage relationships], because the dimension of him which is a mamzer and the dimension of him which is an acceptable Jew are intermingled. Therefore he is forbidden to engage in relations with a maid-servant and his offspring share his status forever.",
            "6. When a gentile engages in relations with a maid-servant who immersed herself, the offspring are servants. When a servant who immersed himself engages in relations with a female gentile, the offspring are gentile. He is given his mother's status. When, however, a gentile engages relations with a gentile maid-servant or a gentile servant engages relations with a gentile woman, the status of the offspring follows that of the father.",
            "7. A mamzer may marry a female convert and a female mamzer may marry a male convert, the offspring of both relationships are mamzerim. For the status of the offspring follows that of the blemished one. [The license for such a marriage is derived from] the verse: \"[A mamzer shall not enter] God's congregation.\" (Deut. 23:3) The congregation of converts is not considered as \"God's congregation.\" (ibid)",
            "8. When a female convert marries a male convert and gives birth to a son, he is permitted to marry a female mamzer even though he was both conceived and born in holiness. This also applies to the son of his grandson [- or any other descendant -] until his connection with conversion is forgotten and it is not known that he [descends from] converts. Afterwards, he will be forbidden to marry a female mamzer. Converts and freed servants are bound by the same laws.",
            "9. When a convert marries a native-born Jewess or a native-born Jew marries a convert, the son is a Jew in all contexts and is forbidden to marry a female mamzer.",
            "10. There are three categories of mamzerim: one that is definitely a mamzer, a mamzer whose status is a matter of doubt, and a mamzer by Rabbinic decree. What is meant by one who is definitely a mamzer? The offspring of a relationship that is definitely incestuous or adulterous, as we explained. A mamzer whose status is a matter of doubt is the offspring of a relationship that we are unsure whether it is adulterous or incestuous. For example, a man engaged in relations with a woman who was consecrated, but we are unsure if the consecration was effective, or who was divorced, but we are unsure whether the divorce was effective, or a similar situation. A mamzer by Rabbinic decree: for example, a woman who heard that her husband died and remarried and then discovered that her husband was alive. Afterwards, her [first] husband engaged in relations with her while she was still married with her second husband, the offspring is a mamzer by Rabbinic decree.",
            "11. When an unmarried woman becomes pregnant through a promiscuous relationship, we ask her: \"What is [the status of] this fetus\" or \"...this child\"? If she replies: \"It is the child of a man of acceptable lineage; I entered into relations with an Israelite,\" her word is accepted and the son is acceptable. [This applies] even if most of the inhabitants of the city in which she engaged in relations are of unacceptable lineage.",
            "12. If the child's mother was not questioned until she died, or she was a deaf-mute, mute, or intellectually or emotionally unstable, we consider the child as a mamzer whose status is questionable. [This ruling applies even] if she said: \"I engaged in relations with so-and-so, the mamzer\" or \"...with so-and-so, the netin.\" Even if that person agrees with her statement, [the child's status is only doubtful. The rationale is:] Just as she engaged in relations with the person who admitted to her statement; so, too, she engaged in relations with others. "
