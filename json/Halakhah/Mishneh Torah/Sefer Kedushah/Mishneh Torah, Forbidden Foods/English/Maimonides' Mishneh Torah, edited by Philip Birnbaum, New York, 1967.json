            "Anyone who eats an olive-size of the flesh of cattle, beasts, or birds that died a natural death should be lashed, as it is written: \"You must not eat anything that has died a natural death\" (Deuteronomy 14:21). Whatever has not been slaughtered properly is regarded as if it died a natural death.— —",
            "The term <i>prohibited nevelah</i> is applicable only to the clean species that are fit for ritual slaughter, and permitted as food if slaughtered properly. Unclean species, on the other hand, where <i>sheḥitah</i> has no advantage, if anyone eats of their flesh he is to be lashed not because of eating <i>nevelah</i> and <i>terefah</i> but for eating the flesh of an unclean animal; and it is immaterial whether it has been slaughtered properly or it has died a natural death, or whether he has cut a piece of flesh from it when alive and eaten it.",

            "Anyone who eats an olive-size of the flesh of clean cattle, beasts or birds that were declared ritually unfit for food is to be lashed, as it is written: \"You must not eat flesh torn by beasts in the field; you shall cast it to the dogs\" (Exodus 22:30). The biblical term <i>terefah</i> refers to an animal torn by a wild beast, such as a lion, a leopard, or the like. So too, <i>terefah</i> is applied to a bird torn by a bird of prey, a hawk, or the like. You cannot say that <i>terefah</i> signifies that the wild beast or bird of prey tore and killed it, since it would be <i>nevelah</i> if dead; what difference does it make whether it died of itself or was killed by someone who struck it with a sword, or whether a lion mauled and killed it? Hence, the biblical text must refer to a mauled animal that has not died.",
            "If a torn animal that has not died is forbidden, one might suppose that if a wolf came and dragged away a young goat by its foot, tail or ear, and a man chased the wolf and rescued the kid from its mouth, the kid should be forbidden because it was mauled, therefore the Torah plainly says: \"You must not eat flesh torn by beasts in the field; you shall cast it to the dogs,\" that is, it is forbidden only when it has become fit for the dogs. Hence, you may infer that <i>terefah</i> spoken of in the Torah refers to an animal torn and mauled by a wild beast to the point of death, though it has not died yet. Even if someone hastened to slaughter it prior to its death, it is forbidden as <i>terefah</i>, since it could not have survived the wound inflicted upon it.",
            "From this you may conclude that the Torah has forbidden an animal that has died, a <i>nevelah</i>. It has also forbidden an animal on the verge of death because of its wounds, even though it has not died yet, and that is <i>terefah</i>. Just as you can make no distinction between the causes of death, whether the animal died a natural death or it fell down and died — — so you can make no distinction in the case of an animal on the verge of death, whether a beast tore and mauled it — — or whether someone shot an arrow at it and pierced its heart or lungs.— — Once the animal is dying at any rate, it is <i>terefah</i>, whether the cause is a human act or an act of God. If this is the case, why is the term <i>terefah</i> (torn) mentioned in the Torah? Scripture speaks of what happens regularly. If you will not interpret it in this manner, you will have to assume that it refers only to an animal \"torn … in the field,\" and if it was torn in a courtyard it should not be forbidden! Hence, you must infer that Scripture speaks only of what is likely to happen.",

So too, anyone who eats of both the meat and the milk that have been cooked together, [even as little as] the size of an olive, is to be lashed, even if he has not done the cooking himself.",
            "The reason Scripture is silent, and does not explicitly prohibit the eating of meat with milk, is that it has already forbidden the cooking; that is to say, since the cooking of the meat-milk mixture is forbidden, it is needless to state that partaking of it is likewise forbidden. Similarly, Scripture is silent and does not explicitly prohibit taking one's own daughter to wife, having already prohibited the taking of one's granddaughter to wife.",

The phrase \"a kid in its mother's milk\" is used only because Scripture speaks of something that actually happens. But if one cooks the meat of a clean animal with the milk of an unclean animal, or the meat of an unclean animal with the milk of a clean animal, he is permitted to do so and derive a benefit from it as well; punishment is incurred for eating it, but not by reason of its being a meat-milk mixture.",

It is, however, prohibited from eating it on rabbinic grounds, so that the people may not reach out beyond what is permitted and transgress the biblical meat-milk prohibition by eating the meat of a clean animal with the milk of a clean animal, since the literal meaning of the verse is restricted to a kid in its mother's milk only. For this reason, the sages have prohibited all meat with milk.",
