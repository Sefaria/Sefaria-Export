            "It is a positive commandment to know the signs that distinguish between domesticated animals, beasts, fowl, fish, and locusts that are permitted to be eaten and those which are not permitted to be eaten,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam includes these four among the Torah's 613 mitzvot in his <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandments 149-152). The Ra'avad (in his <i>hasagot</i> to the listing of the mitzvot at the beginning of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>) and the Ramban (in his <i>hasagot</i> to general principle 6 in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>) differ and maintain that they should not be counted as mitzvot. According to their view, the mitzvot involve the observance of the prohibitions, but there is no positive act involved that could be considered as the observance of a commandment. [The <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvot 153, 470, 158, and 155) mentions these mitzvot, but explains that he personally subscribes to the opinion of the Ramban that they should be not included among the 613 mitzvot.]<br>In his <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam explains his position. Leviticus 11:2 states: \"This is the living creature that you may eat....\" The <i>Sifri</i> commenting on that verse describes it as a positive commandment. Now there is no positive commandment to eat kosher meat. The commandment is to know which species are kosher and to make a distinction between them and those which are not kosher meat as implied by the verse the Rambam cites here: \"And you shall distinguish....\" For it is only in this way, that one will be able to eat kosher meat. See also the gloss of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>. And see Chapter 2, Halachah 1, where the Rambam explains how he derives the idea that both a positve mitzvah and a negative mitzvah are involved.</i> as [Leviticus 20:25] states: \"And you shall distinguish between a kosher animal and a non-kosher one, between a non-kosher fowl and a kosher one.\" And [Leviticus 11:47] states: \"To distinguish between the kosher and the non-kosher, between a beast which may be eaten and one which may not be eaten.\"",
            "The signs of a [kosher] domesticated animal and beast are explicitly mentioned in the Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 11:3.</i> There are two signs: a split hoof and chewing the cud. Both are necessary.<br>Any domesticated animal and beast that chews the cud does not have teeth on its upper jaw-bone. Every animal that chews the cud has split hoofs except a camel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad questions why the Rambam does not mention a rabbit or a hare. The Torah specifically mentions that they chew their cud. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam does not mention them because they have teeth on their upper jaw.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 79:1) also mention that a camel has two teethlike growths on its upper jaw, but they do not in any way resemble teeth.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam's intent is that any kosher domesticated animal or wild beast that chews its cud will not have teeth on its upper jaw and every such animal will have a split hoof.</i> Every animal that has split hoofs chews the cud except a pig.",
            "Therefore if a person finds an animal whose hoofs are cut off in the desert and he cannot identify its species, he should check its mouth. If it does not have teeth on its upper jaw, it can be identified as kosher, provided one can recognize a camel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., if one sees that the domesticated animal is not a camel, one can assume that it is kosher, for a camel is the only non-kosher animal without teeth on its upper jaw.</i> If a person finds an animal whose mouth is cut off, he should check its hooves, if they are split, it is kosher, provided he can recognize a pig.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For a pig is the only non-kosher animal with split hooves.</i><br>When both its mouth and its hoofs are cut off, he should inspect the end of its tail after he slaughters it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For before slaughtering it, such an inspection would be painful for the animal.</i> If he discovers that [the strings of] its meat extend both lengthwise and widthwise,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our translation is based on the commentary of the Meiri to <i>Chullin</i> 59a. Rashi interprets that passage slightly differently and his opinion is cited by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i>79:1).</i> it is kosher, provided he can recognize a wild donkey. For [the strings of] its meat also extend both lengthwise and widthwise.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 79:1) mention another sign for a kosher animal: horns.</i>",
            "When a kosher animal gives birth to an offspring resembling a non-kosher animal, it is permitted to be eaten even though it does not have split hoofs or chew the cud, but instead, resembles a horse or a donkey in all matters.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As indicated by the Rambam's statements in the following halachah, the matter is dependent on the species and not the presence of distinguishing signs in and of themselves.</i><br>When does the above apply? When he sees it give birth. If, however, he left a pregnant cow in his herd and found an animal resembling a pig dependent on it, the matter is doubtful and [the young animal] is forbidden to be eaten. [This applies] even if it nurses from [the cow], for perhaps it was born from a non-kosher species, but became dependent on the kosher animal.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad qualifies the Rambam's ruling, stating that it applies only when the person possesses a non-kosher animal in his herd. If that is not the case, we do not suspect that a non-kosher newborn came from elsewhere. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 79:6 do not accept this addition.</i>",
            "When a non-kosher animal gives birth to an offspring resembling a kosher animal, it is forbidden to be eaten. [This applies] even if it has split hoofs and chews its cud and resembles an ox or a sheep in all matters. [The rationale is that offspring] produced by a non-kosher animal are not kosher<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See also the beginning of ch. 3.</i> and those produced by a kosher animal are kosher.<br>For this reason, a non-kosher fish found in the belly of a kosher fish is forbidden, and a kosher fish found in the belly of a non-kosher fish is permitted, for they did not produce the fish, but instead, swallowed it.",
            "When a kosher animal gives birth to an offspring that has two backs and two backbones<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., a calf born with a Siamese twin.</i> or such a creature is discovered within [an animal that was slaughtered], it is forbidden to be eaten. This is what is meant by the term <i>hashisuah</i> which is forbidden by the Torah, as [Deuteronomy 14:7] states: \"These may not be eaten from those which chew the cud and have split hoofs, the <i>shisuah</i>...\", i.e., an animal that was born divided into two animals.",
            "Similarly, when [a fetus] resembling a fowl is found within a [slaughtered] animal, it is forbidden to be eaten. [This applies] even if it resembles a kosher fowl. [For when a fetus] is discovered in an animal, only one which has a hoof is permitted.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The hoof, however, need not be split as indicated by Halachah 4. See also Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 13:5) and <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 13:20 who rule more leniently.</i>",
            "There are no other domesticated animals or wild beasts in the world that are permitted to be eaten except the ten species mentioned in the Torah. They are three types of domesticated animals: an ox, a sheep, and a goat, and seven types of wild beasts: a gazelle,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The translation of the names of these seven species is a matter of debate among both Torah commentaries and zoologists. Our translation is taken from Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan's Living Torah. Consult the notes there for a detailed discussion of the matter. See also <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 80:3; Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 28:4 who discuss these issues. In practice, we partake of the meat of an animal only when there is an established tradition that it is permitted (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 80:1).</i> a deer, an antelope, an ibex, a chamois, a bison, and a giraffe.

Therefore, a person who recognizes these species need not check neither their mouths,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To see whether or not they have teeth on their upper jaw, as stated in Halachah 3.</i> nor their feet.",
            "Although all these species are permitted to be eaten, we must make a distinction between a kosher domesticated animal and a kosher wild beast.

            "According to the Oral Tradition, these are the distinguishing signs of a [kosher] wild beast: Any species that has split hoofs, chews its cud, and has horns which branch off like those of a gazelle are certainly kosher wild beasts. [The following laws apply with regard to] all those whose horns do not branch off: If they are curved, like the horns of an ox, notched, like the horns of a goat, but the notch should be embedded within them, and spiraled, like the horns of a deer,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Chullin</i> 3:6) for a definition of these terms. The Ra'avad, the Rashba, and Rashi offer slightly different definitions for these terms.</i> it is a kosher wild beast. Its horns, however, must have these three signs: They must be curved, notched, and spiraled.",
            "When does the above apply? With regard to a species that he does not recognize. [Different rules apply with regard to] the seven species mentioned in the Torah. If he recognizes this species, he may partake of its fat and is obligated to cover its blood, even one does not find any horns on it at all.",
            "A wild ox is a species of domesticated animal.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although it is not domesticated and lives like a wild beast, it is still placed in this category.</i> A unicorn<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This was not a mythical beast, but a species of antelope known to exist during the Talmudic period (<i>Chullin</i> 59b).</i> is considered a wild beast even though it has only one horn.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And all other kosher wild beasts have two.</i><br>Whenever we have a doubt whether an animal is a domesticated animal or a wild beast, its fat is forbidden, but lashes are not given for partaking of it, and we must cover its blood.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., we accept the stringencies resulting from both positions. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 80:3 adds that since we are not certain that this is required, we do not cover its blood on a festival.

A negative commandment that comes as a result of a positive commandment is considered as a positive commandment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., it does not have the severity of a negative commandment. Hence its violation is not punishable by lashes.<br>The Rambam is explaining that the Torah is not commanding us to eat kosher species, for there is no obligation to partake of them. Instead, it is commanding us to take precautions - through checking distinguishing signs - against partaking of non-kosher ones. See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (General Principle 6) where the Rambam elaborates in the explanation of the concept of a prohibition derived from a positive commandment.

There is a general principle (<i>Pesachim</i> 24a, <i>et al</i>): \"We do not issue a warning on the basis of logical deduction.\" Implied is that a person is not given lashes when a prohibition is not explicitly mentioned in the Torah, but instead derived through logic. Why then, these commentaries ask, are lashes given for partaking of non-kosher species other than the four mentioned specifically by the Torah?<br>The Rambam offers a resolution to this question in his <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 172). There he explains that in this instance, we are not deriving the prohibition on the basis of logic, for it is already stated in the positive commandment.

Similarly, those in an animal's brain can be assumed to have entered its nose from the outside and are hence, forbidden. Those found in the body of a fish are considered to have been spontaneously generated are hence permitted. Those found in the meat of an animal are not permitted.

            "Accordingly, logic would dictate that any milk found in the possession of a gentile is forbidden, lest the gentile have mixed the milk of a non-kosher animal with it. And the cheese of the gentiles should be permitted, for the milk of a non-kosher animal will not form cheese. Nevertheless, during the age of the Sages of the Mishnah, they issued a decree against gentile cheese and forbade it, lest they use the skin of the stomach of an animal they slaughtered - which is forbidden as a<i> nevelah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This term refers to an animal from a kosher species which died without being ritually slaughtered.</i> - to cause it to solidify.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For milk to solidify as cheese, it needs a catalyst, rennin, to cause it to curdle.

The Rambam, however, does not mention them because the factors causing the prohibition could be nullified as explained in the following note. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> mentions that there are opinions that maintain that the motivating factor behind the prohibition against non-Jewish cheese is to prevent social interaction between Jews and non-Jews. Hence the prohibitions are never nullified even if there is a substantially larger quantity of the kosher substance.</i><br>If one would say: The stomach skin is a very small entity when compared to the milk that it is used to solidify.

According to Rabbinic Law, this is true when the quantity of the permitted substance is so great that the taste of the forbidden substance would not be detected. That would certainly be true in the instance at hand. Nevertheless, the forbidden substance is not nullified for the reason explained by the Rambam.</i> Because it is used as the catalyst to cause the cheese to curdle.

            "[The following laws apply when] cheese is left to solidify with herbs or fruit juice, e.g., fig syrup, and it is apparent [that these substances were used for] the cheese.

The Rama continues, stating that when a Jew observes a gentile milking the cows and making the cheese, it is permitted to partake of it even though the cheese belongs to the gentiles. He continues, stating that even if the Jew does not observe the gentile milking the cow, as long as he observes him making the cheese, the cheese is acceptable after the fact. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 115:11 and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 115:22 quote opinions that differ and maintain that the prohibition should be observed even if a Jew did not observe the milking.<br>This difference of opinion is relevant today, reflecting the difference between <i>chalav Yisrael</i> cheese and ordinary kosher cheese. In both instances, the cheesemaking process is supervised. <i>Chalav Yisrael</i> cheese uses milk that was supervised when milked, while ordinary kosher cheese does not.</i> This is a decree, [instituted] because they cause them to solidify using forbidden entities.",

Hence, according to the Rambam, this process is effective for ordinary meat. It is not, however, effective in this instance, for the internal bleeding that resulted from the breakage of the neck leaves blood that is not in its natural place (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, see also his gloss to Halachah 12).</i> What should be done?

One should wash the meat first<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Among the reasons given for this initial washing are:<br>a) it removes the blood on the external surface of the meat;<br>b) it softens the meat and enables the blood inside to flow out more easily;<br>c) it enables the salt to adhere well to the surface of the meat.</i> and afterwards, salt it thoroughly. One should leave it in the salt for the time it takes to walk a <i>mil</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A <i>mil</i> is a Talmudic measure equivalent to approximately a kilometer.

[This view is cited in the present context by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 69:6).] The Rambam, however, follows a more stringent view [see his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pesachim</i> 3:2)] and requires 24 minutes.<br>The Rama states that these measures are acceptable only after the fact or when there is an urgent need to prepare meat quickly. Otherwise, meat should be allowed to soak in water for at least half an hour.</i> and then wash it thoroughly, [continuing] until clean water emerges.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This washing removes the salt and blood from the meat. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 69:7) states that the meat should be washed twice and the Rama requires a third washing.</i> Immediately afterwards, one should cast it into boiling water - warm water is not [sufficient] - so that it will become white immediately and [no further] blood will be released.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This follows the Rambam's view that we are knowledgeable in the process of casting meat into hot water to seal it in its place. (As mentioned above, there are many who maintain that we lack that knowledge.) Moreover, in this instance, once the meat has been salted, there is no need for this measure, because all its blood has been released. For this reason, the Ra'avad and the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> object to the Rambam's ruling. It is, however, mentioned by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 69:19).</i>",
            "When we salt meat, we salt it only in a utensil that has holes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So that the blood will drain out and not be reabsorbed by the meat. If one salted meat in utensil that did not have holes, all the meat lying in the brine is forbidden.

There are other Rabbinic opinions that do not accept that approach. (They are favored by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 76:1).<br>The Rashba emphasizes that if one salts meat and does not roast it immediately, he should wash off the salt and the blood.

To explain: From Halachah 9, it would appear that it is forbidden to eat raw meat that is not salted only when there is internal bleeding while the animal is being slaughtered. For although the meat contains blood, that blood is forbidden only when it moves from one part of the meat to another while cooking. If one eats the meat raw, such a transfer will not take place.<br>Similarly, the latter clause of this halachah permits meat when it is cast into vinegar because the blood becomes sealed in its place. Implied is that the blood itself is permitted.<br>This clause, by contrast, states that one must salt the meat to remove the blood even when one eats the meat without cooking it. Implied is that the blood is forbidden even though it has not moved from place to place within the meat. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> resolves the contradiction, explaining that since the blood is fit to move from place to place, it is forbidden. Hence, the latter clause which speaks about blood that is sealed in its place does not represent a contradiction. Similarly, this interpretation allows Halachah 9 to be understood in a manner that does not produce a contradiction.<br>It must be emphasized that the Ra'avad and many other authorities object to the Rambam's ruling and maintain that as long as the blood has not actually moved from place to place, it is not forbidden. Therefore it is permitted to partake of raw meat without salting it. It must, however, be washed thoroughly to remove all blood on its surface. This view is cited by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 67:2).</i> and wash it thoroughly. If he causes the blood to be sealed [by casting the meat into] vinegar, it is permitted to eat the meat while raw.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned previously, in the Ashkenazic community (and also among many Sefardim), the custom of sealing blood by casting meat into vinegar is no longer practice.

Perhaps the reason the Rambam does not mention this means of derivation here is to avoid the following question being raised: Why are lashes not given for benefiting from milk and meat?<br>To explain: In Chapter 8, Halachah 16, the Rambam writes that one is not liable for lashes for deriving benefit from a forbidden substance. As explained in the notes to that halachah, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that one is liable for lashes only when he derives benefit from the food in an ordinary manner from food. This includes only eating and not other forms of deriving benefit. Nevertheless, seemingly this should not apply with regard to benefiting from a mixture of milk and meat. For, as stated in Chapter 14, Halachah 10, in that instance, one is liable even if one does not derive benefit in the ordinary manner. Hence, it would appear that one should be liable for lashes for partaking of such a mixture.<br>Among the explanations given why one is not liable is that the prohibition against deriving benefit from a mixture of milk and meat is derived from an inference from a more lenient instance to a more stringent one (a <i>kal vichomer</i>; see <i>Chullin</i> 115b). And we follow the principle that punishment is not meted out when a prohibition is derived in such a fashion, only when it is stated explicitly (<i>Sifri, Naso</i>). If, however, there was an explicit prohibition in the Torah teaching us that deriving benefit from a mixture of milk and meat was forbidden. Seemingly, one would be liable for lashes (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>).</i> [To cite a parallel:] The Torah did not mention the prohibition against relations with one's daughter, because it forbade those with the daughter of one's daughter.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 2:6.</i>",

In their glosses to <i>Hilchot Mamrim</i>, the Radbaz and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explain that there, the Rambam is speaking theoretically: Were the halachah to follow the opinion that the meat of a wild beast is forbidden according to Scriptural law, the ruling would be such and such.

When a person rips a limb from a living animal which causes the animal to become <i>trefe</i>, he is considered to have transgressed two prohibitions: the prohibition against eating flesh from a living animal and the prohibition against partaking of an animal that is <i>trefe</i>, for both prohibitions take effect at the same time.</i> the latter prohibition forbids additional entities,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This concept is exemplified in this and the following halachah.

First it was fired with forbidden fuel, then it was fired with permitted fuel, and then food was cooked in it with permitted fuel. Since it was originally fired with forbidden fuel, it becomes forbidden and any food cooked in it is likewise prohibited.

If the majority of the attendants of the party are Jewish, it is permitted.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> do not mention this restriction or the accompanying leniency. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 112) explains the Rambam's logic as follows: <i>Avodah Zarah </i>30a relates that one of the Sages, Shmuel was sitting with Abalat, a gentile. They were served boiled wine. Abalat withdrew, lest he touch the wine and cause it to become forbidden. Shmuel called him back, telling him there was no prohibition against boiled wine.<br>Rabbenu Asher asks: Since the prohibition against gentile wine was instituted as a protection against intermarriage, what difference does it make whether the wine is boiled or not? He answers that boiled wine is not common. Hence our Sages did not include it in their decree.<br>Rambam maintains that boiled wine is common and hence included in our Sages' decree. For this reason, it is forbidden to drink it together with gentiles. How then could Shmuel drink with Abalat? Because there were a majority of Jews at the gathering and such a situation is not included in our Sages' decree.</i> We may not drink the beer that they make from dates, figs, or the like. [This is forbidden] only in the place where they are sold.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus according to the Rambam [and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 114:1) who quotes his ruling, it is forbidden to drink at a bar frequented primarily by gentiles. The Rama mentions that it is customary in the Ashkenazic community to rule leniently with regard to alcoholic beverages made from honey and grain.</i> If, however, one brought the beer home and drank it there, it is permitted. For the fundamental point of the decree is that one should not feast with [a gentile].",
            "It is permitted to drink wine from apples, pomegranates, and the like in every place. [Our Sages] did not institute a decree in an uncommon situation. Raisen wine is like ordinary wine and is used for libations.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence a gentile's touch renders it forbidden.</i>",
            "Although [our Sages] forbade bread [baked] by gentiles, there are places where leniency is shown regarding this matter and bread baked by a gentile baker is purchased in a place where there is no Jewish baker and it is in a field, because this is a pressing situation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because bread is a staple of life and there is no Jewish bread available, our Sages allowed for leniency when purchasing bread from a commercial baker. For buying from him will not lead to close personal relationships. Nevertheless, according to the Rambam, this leniency is granted only: where there is no Jewish bakers and in the fields, not in the cities. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 112:2) rules more leniently and does not forbid this in a city. The Rama rules even more leniently and allows the purchase of bread from a gentile baker even in places where bread from a Jewish baker is available.</i> There is, by contrast, no one who will rule that leniency may be shown with regard to bread baked by a homeowner.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are opinions which maintain when there is no bread from a commercial baker available, one may even use bread baked by a gentile homeowner [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 112)]. The Rama states that one may accept this leniency.</i> For the primary reason for [our Sages'] decree was [to prevent] intermarriage. If one will eat the bread of a [gentile] homeowner, [it is likely that] he will feast with him.",
            "[The bread] is permitted [in the following situations]: A gentile lit the oven and a Jew baked within it, a Jew lit the oven and the gentile baked within it, the gentile both lit the oven and baked, but the Jew stirred the fire or reduced it, since he was involved in the baking tasks, [we rule leniently]. Even though he did not do more than throw one piece of wood into the oven, he caused all the bread in it to be permitted. [The rationale is that this requirement] is only to make a distinction that [a gentile's] bread is forbidden.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Radbaz states that this leniency applies only with regard to baking bread. With regard to cooking, a Jew must take a more active role in the cooking process. This ruling is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 113:7). The Rama, however, differs and maintains that kindling the oven is sufficient for cooking as well.</i>",

            "When does the above apply? To [food] that would be served on the table of kings<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Today, when monarchy is a point of history, the phrase \"fit to be served on the table of kings\" refers to food served at a dinner for the President or dignitaries of similar status.</i> to be eaten together with bread,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Avodah Zarah</i> 38a gives this and the leniency mentioned in the previous halachah as alternate explanations when food cooked by gentiles is permitted.

            "When small fish were salted by a Jew or a gentile,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Kessef Mishneh states that this is speaking about fish that are frequently served salted even without being cooked (e.g., sardines or herring served in brine). It is permitted to eat such fish for, as the Rambam states in the following halachah, in this context, salting is not considered as cooking. This leniency does not apply to large fish, for they are unfit to be eaten unless they are cooked or roasted. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 103:12) mentions this ruling, but also a dissenting view that allows leniency even with regard to large fish.</i> it is as if they have undergone part of their cooking process. [Therefore] if a gentile roasted them afterwards, they are permitted.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since they were fit to be eaten before they were roasted, the fact that they were roasted by a gentile afterwards does not cause them to be forbidden. This applies even when a gentile performed the salting. For that salting did not cause the fish to become forbidden and yet, it made it fit to be eaten (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> [Similarly,] whenever a Jew performs a small part of the cooking process, whether at the beginning or at the end, [the food] is permitted. Accordingly, if a gentile placed meat or a pot on the fire and the Jew turned over the meat or stirred the pot or, conversely, the Jew placed [the food on the fire] and the gentile completed [the cooking process], [the food] is permitted.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, R. Yosef Caro rules that this applies only when the cooking process would have been completed without the gentile's activity; the gentile merely hastened it. He does not, however, quote this ruling in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>. The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 113:6) rules that even if the food would not have cooked without the gentile's activity, it is permitted. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 113:6 and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 113:8, however, raise questions concerning that leniency.</i>",
