            "This mode of slaughtering, which is spoken of in the Torah indefinitely, must be explained, so as to know on what organ of the animal <i>sheḥitah</i> is performed; what is the extent of <i>sheḥitah;</i> with what instrument, when, where and how <i>sheḥitah</i> is executed; what things invalidate <i>sheḥitah;</i> and who may serve as a <i>shoḥet</i>. All these details are implied in the biblical command, which states: \"You shall slaughter any of your cattle or sheep … as I have instructed you, and you may eat to your heart's content in your settlements.\" All these details were commanded orally, like the rest of the Oral Torah which is referred to as <i>Mitzvah</i> (commandment), as we have explained in the introduction to this work.",

If, however, there was something like a ridge on the edge of the <i>sheḥitah</i> instrument, even the smallest perceptible ridge, the <i>sheḥitah</i> is defective.",

After that, he may use it for <i>sheḥitah</i>.",

Accordingly, the person who slaughters several animals or several birds must examine the knife after each of them.

If a man began the <i>sheḥitah</i> act and before finishing it he raised his hand and paused, whether unintentionally or intentionally, or under compulsion, and then he or another person completed it, his <i>sheḥitah</i> is defective if he delayed as much time as would be required to raise the animal and make it lie down and slaughter it; but if he delayed less than that, his <i>sheḥitah</i> act is valid.",
