            "It is a positive commandment<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 146) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 451) include this among the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. As mentioned at the beginning of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Ra'avad differs and does not consider this a mitzvah.</i> for one who desires to partake of the meat of a domesticated animal, wild beast, or fowl to slaughter [it] and then partake of it,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's wording echo his statements in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:2: \"There are other mitzvot that are not obligations, but resemble voluntary activities, for example, the mitzvah of <i>mezuzah</i>.... A person is not obligated to dwell in a house that requires a <i>mezuzah</i> in order to fulfill this mitzvah.\" Similarly, in the instance at hand, a person is not obligated to slaughter. If, however, he desires to eat meat, he must fulfill this mitzvah.</i> as [Deuteronomy 12:21] states: \"And you shall slaughter from your cattle and from your sheep.\" And with regard to a firstborn animal with a blemish,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> who elaborates, explaining that although Rashi does not interpret the verse in the same manner the Rambam does, there is support for the Rambam's interpretation.</i> [<i>ibid.</i>:22] states: \"As one would partake of a deer and a gazelle.\" From this, we learn that a wild beast is [governed by] the same [laws] as a domesticated animal with regard to ritual slaughter.<br>And with regard to a fowl, [Leviticus 17:13] states: \"that will snare a beast or a fowl as prey... and shed its blood.\" This teaches that shedding the blood of a fowl is analogous to shedding the blood of a wild beast.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., in both instances, ritual slaughter is required. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that <i>Chulin</i> 27b derives this equivalence from another source and explains why the Rambam cites this verse instead.</i>",
            "The laws governing ritual slaughter are the same in all instances.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the gloss of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> who explains that there are some differences between the laws governing the slaughter of each of these types of animals.</i> Therefore one who slaughters a domesticated animal, beast, or fowl should first<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For the blessings for all mitzvot must be recited before their observance (<i>Pesachim</i> 7b).</i> recite the blessing: \"[Blessed...] who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We do not, however, say \"to slaughter,\" for, as above, the mitzvah to slaughter is not obligatory. It is dependent on the person's desire (<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:15).</i> ritual slaughter.\" If he did not recite a blessing, either consciously or inadvertently, the meat is permitted.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For after the fact, the recitation of the blessings is not essential (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i><br>It is forbidden to partake of a slaughtered animal throughout the time it is in its death throes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Partaking of the meat at this time does not, however, represent a transgression of the prohibitions against eating a limb or flesh from a living animal (see <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i>, ch. 5). For once the animal has been slaughtered, these prohibitions no longer apply.</i> When a person partakes of it before it dies, he transgresses a negative commandment. [This act] is included in the prohibition [Leviticus 19:26]: \"Do not eat upon the blood.\" He does not, however, receive lashes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This prohibition is considered as a prohibition of a general nature (<i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 18:2-3), i.e., prohibitions that include several diverse and unrelated acts, and lashes are not given for the violation of such prohibitions.</i><br>It is permitted to cut meat from it after it has been ritually slaughtered, but before it dies. That meat should be salted thoroughly, washed thoroughly,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's words provoke a question: Of course, this meat must be salted thoroughly as must all meat so that its blood will be removed (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 6:10). Why would one think that this meat is different?<br>It would appear that the explanation is that other meat may be eaten if it is roasted or its blood sealed by being cast into vinegar (<i>ibid.</i>:12) and these options do not apply with regard to the meat in question.</i> and left until the animal dies. Afterwards, it may be eaten.",
            "Fish and locusts need not be slaughtered. Instead, gathering them causes them to be permitted to be eaten. [This is indicated by Numbers 11:22]: \"Can sheep and cattle be slaughtered for them that will suffice them? If all the fish of the sea would be gathered for them....\" This indicates that gathering fish is like slaughtering cattle and sheep. And with regard to locusts, [Isaiah 33:4] states: \"the gathering of the locusts,\" i.e., gathering alone [is sufficient]. Therefore if fish die naturally in the water, they are permitted.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One might think that man would have to gather them alive for them to be permitted. Hence the Rambam emphasizes that this is not so (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). The general principle is: Whenever the mitzvah of ritual slaughter does not apply, the prohibitions against eating flesh from a living animal and eating a dead animal do not apply.</i> And it is permitted to eat them while they are alive.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The commentaries note that <i>Shabbat</i> 90b states that one who eats a live locust violates the prohibition: \"Do not make your souls detestable.\" [See also Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 13:1) who issues a similar warning with regard to partaking of live fish.) How then can the Rambam say that it is permitted?<br>Among the resolutions of this question are:<br>a) The passage in <i>Shabbat</i> refers only to a non-kosher locust, not a kosher one.<br>b) The Rambam, here, is saying that one may cut off part of a living locust and eat it, but not that one may eat an entire locust alive.<br>c) Here the Rambam is speaking with regard to the laws regarding ritual slaughter. He is not focusing on those involving other prohibitions.</i>",
            "The slaughter which the Torah mentions without elaboration must be explained so that we know: a) which place in the animal is [appropriate] for ritual slaughter?, b) what is the measure of the slaughtering process?, c) with what do we slaughter?, d) when do we slaughter?, e) in which place [on the animal's neck] do we slaughter? f) how do we slaughter, g) what factors disqualify the slaughter? h) who can slaughter?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the following chapters, the Rambam proceeds to answer all of these questions.</i><br>We were commanded concerning all of these factors in the Torah with the verse [Deuteronomy 12:21]: \"And you shall slaughter from your cattle... as I commanded you.\" All of these factors were commanded to us orally as is true with regard to the remainder of the Oral Law which is called \"the mitzvah,\" as we explained in the beginning of this text.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., in the Introduction that precedes <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i>. There the Rambam explains that the Oral Law is called \"the mitzvah,\" because it gives us instruction concerning the observance of the mitzvot. Without it, we would not know how to fulfill them.</i>",
            "The place where an animal should be slaughtered is the neck. The entire neck is acceptable for slaughtering.<br>What is implied? With regard to the gullet,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As will be explained in Halachah 9, ritual slaughter involves cutting the gullet and the windpipe. In this halachah, the Rambam defines where the gullet may be cut.</i> from the beginning of the place where when it is cut, it contracts until the place where hair grows<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In contrast to the surface of the gullet which is smooth.</i> and it begins appearing fissured like the stomach, this is the place of slaughter with regard to the gullet.",
            "If one slaughters above this place - in the area called the entrance to the gullet<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the end of the throat, where it is attached to the jaw..</i> - or below this place - i.e., the beginning of the digestive system, the slaughter is unacceptable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The animal is considered a <i>nevelah</i> and it is forbidden to partake of it. See Chapter 3, Halachah 18 (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, note <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 20:5).</i><br>The measure of the entrance to the gullet above which is unfit for slaughter in an animal or a beast is so one can grab it with two fingers.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the Rambam's interpretation of <i>Chulin</i> 44a. Rashi interprets that passage as referring to a space the size of four fingers. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 20:2) follows the Rambam's understanding, while the Rama cites that of Rashi.</i> With regard to a fowl, it depends on its size. The lower limit extends until the crop.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The first of the fowl's stomachs. The crop is not considered part of the gullet and it is forbidden to slaughter there.</i>",
            "Where is the place of slaughter with regard to the windpipe? From the slant of its cap<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The windpipe is made up of a series of rings. Above the top ring, there is a slanted covering that is called the cap.</i> downward until the beginning of the flank of the lung when the animal extends its neck to pasture,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When the animal extends its neck, the flanks of its lungs rise upward.</i> this is the place of slaughter with regard to the windpipe. The area opposite this place on the outside is called the neck.",
            "When the animal strained itself and extended its neck exceedingly or the slaughterer applied exertion to the signs and extended them upward, but slaughtered in the neck at the place of slaughter, there is an unresolved doubt<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Chulin</i> 45a which discusses these questions but leaves them unresolved.</i> whether [the animal] is a <i>nevelah</i>. For the place where the gullet and windpipe were cut is not the place where [the animal] is [usually] slaughtered.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the place of slaughter on the neck should be aligned with the place of slaughter on the windpipe and the gullet in their natural position. In this instance, the external place of slaughter - the position on the neck - was correct, but the signs were not cut in the usual place.</i>",
            "The slaughterer must slaughter in the center of the neck. If he slaughters to the side, it is acceptable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This applies only after the fact. At the outset, one must slaughter in the center of the neck.</i><br>What is the measure of slaughter? That one [cut] the two identifying marks, the windpipe and the gullet.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the acceptability of the slaughter is dependent on them, they are referred to as the <i>simanim</i>, \"signs,\" i.e., indications that the slaughter is acceptable.</i> Superior slaughter involves cutting both of them, whether for an animal or a fowl and a slaughterer should have this intent. [After the fact,] if one cut the majority of one of them for a fowl and the majority of both of them for an animal or a beast, the slaughter is acceptable.",
            "When one cut one sign entirely and half<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">But not the majority.</i> of the other sign when slaughtering an animal, his slaughter is unacceptable. If he cut the majority of both signs, even though in each instance he cuts only a hair's breadth more than half, it is acceptable. Since he cut even the slightest amount more than half,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the <i>Turei Zahav</i> 21:2 who emphasizes that the difference in size need not be significant. As long as more than half is cut, the slaughter is acceptable.</i> he has cut the majority.",
            "If he cut half<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">But no more than half.</i> of one and half of the other - even in a fowl - the slaughter is unacceptable. When a windpipe is half slit<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is speaking about a situation where the animal is alive. The fact that an animal's windpipe is slit slightly does not cause it to be considered as a <i>trefe</i>. The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 21:5) adds that we must be careful that the gullet has not been punctured, for that would render the animal <i>trefe</i>. See the <i>Turei Zahav</i> 21:4 and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 21:5 who debate whether it is possible to rely on this leniency at present. See also Chapter 3, Halchot 6-7.</i> and one cut a little more on the place of the slit, making the cut a majority, the slaughter is acceptable. [This applies] whether one begins [on a portion of the windpipe] that is intact and reaches the slit or one inserts the knife into the slit and [increases its size until it] reaches the majority.",
            "Every slaughterer must check the signs after he slaughters.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To make sure that the minimal measure for slaughter was slit.</i> If he did not check and the animal's head was cut off before he could check,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Obviously, once the head is cut off, it is no longer possible to check.</i> [the animal] is [considered] a <i>nevelah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because of the doubt involved. See the following halachah.</i> [This applies even] if the slaughterer was adroit and expert.",
            "During its lifetime, every animal is considered to be forbidden until it is definitely known that it was slaughtered in an acceptable manner.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the rationale for the stringency stated in the previous halachah (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>",
            "With what can we slaughter? With any entity, with a metal knife, a flint, glass, the edge of a bulrush,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that many marsh plants splinter easily and they are unacceptable for they will perforate the gullet.</i> or the like among the entities that cut. [This applies] provided its edge is sharp and does not have a barb. If, however, there was a spike at the edge of the entity with which one slaughters, even if the spike is very small,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Generally, it is accepted that a spike that can be detected by a fingernail disqualifies an animal. Nevertheless, the Rambam appears to be referring to an even smaller measure. His approach is followed by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 18:2) which speaks of a spike that is even the size of a hairsbreadth being sufficient to disqualify a knife.<br>Alternatively, it can be understood that the two are synanomous. This understanding is reflected by <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 1:14 which speaks about \"a stone being blemished so that a fingernail would become caught in it like a knife used for ritual slaughter.\"</i> the slaughter is unacceptable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For the spike will perforate the gullet, rendering the animal <i>trefe</i> before the slaughter was completed (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i>",
            "If the spike was on only one side of the knife, one should not slaughter with it [at the outset]. [After the fact,] if one slaughtered with it using the side on which the blemish was not detectable, the slaughter is acceptable.",
            "What is implied? There was a knife that was checked by passing it [over one's finger] and no blemish was felt on it, but when one drew it back, one felt that it had a blemish. If one slaughtered with it by passing it forwards and did not draw it back, the slaughter is acceptable. If one drew it back, the slaughter is unacceptable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The commentaries offer two explanations for this ruling. The Rambam's position is that when the spike is felt only on one side of the knife, one may slaughter with that side. Others add that the blemish must be positioned to the very far end of the knife, either near its point or near its handle. In such an instance, it is possible that the blemish never actually touched the signs and thus did not disqualify the ritual slaughter. See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> [<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> and Rama (18:4)].</i>",

            "When a sharp knife has been whetted, but its [blade] is not smooth, instead, touching it is like touching the tip of an ear of grain which becomes snarled on one's finger, [nevertheless,] since it does not have a blemish, one may slaughter with it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rama (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i>18:6) writes that since it is difficult to understand what exactly is meant by such a knife, we do not permit this leniency.</i>",
            "When a person uproots a reed or a tooth or cuts off a flint or a nail, if they are sharp and do not have a blemish, one may slaughter with them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As apparent from Halachah 14.</i> If one stuck them into the ground, one should not slaughter with them while they are stuck into the ground.

When an entity is stuck into the ground, it is not connected to its source and hence, after the fact, the slaughter is acceptable. Nevertheless, because of the similarity to the forbidden situation, initially, one should not use such an entity for slaughter.</i>",
            "When one slaughtered with these entities when they were connected from the beginning of their existence, before they were uprooted, the slaughter is unacceptable<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Chulin</i> 16a states that it is a Scriptural decree that the cutting edge used for slaughter must be a separate entity, something that one could take in his hand.</i> even if they do not have a blemish.",
            "If one took the jawbone of an animal that had sharp teeth and slaughtered with it, it is unacceptable, for they are like a sickle.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., a blade with a jagged edge which is unacceptable as stated above.</i> When, however, only one tooth is fixed in a jaw, one may slaughter with it as an initial and preferred option, even though it is set in the jaw.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the jaw as a whole is moveable, we are not concerned with the fact that the tooth is in a fixed position (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>",
            "When one made a knife white-hot in fire and slaughtered with it, the slaughter is acceptable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We do not say that rather than cut the signs, the knife burnt them. The latter would disqualify the slaughter.<br>It must be noted that the <i>Tur</i> (see also the gloss of the Radbaz) quotes the Rambam as ruling that the slaughter is unacceptable for the above reason. This approach is also followed by many other <i>Rishonim</i>. In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Caro states that the Rambam rules that the slaughter is acceptable. In his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 9:1), however, he quotes both views without stating which should be followed. All authorities agree that such a knife should not be used as an initial and preferred option.</i> If one side of a knife is [jagged-edge like] a sickle and the other side is desirable, [i.e., smooth,] one should not slaughter with the desirable side as an initial and preferred measure. [This is] a decree lest one slaughter with the other side. If one slaughtered [with it], since one slaughtered with the desirable side, the slaughter is acceptable.",
            "A slaughterer must check the knife at its tip and at both of its sides [before slaughtering]. How must he check it? He must pass it over and draw it back over the flesh of his finger and pass it over and draw it back<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Using the same motions as he would use to slaughter an animal.</i> over his fingernail on three edges, i.e., its tip and both of its sides so that it will not have a blemish at all. [Only] afterwards, should he slaughter with it.",
            "It must [also] be inspected in this manner after slaughter.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam, maintaining that after ritual slaughter, no inspection is necessary unless the person desires to use the knife to slaughter another animal immeidately. In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Caro justifies the Rambam's ruling and he cites it in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 18:3).</i> For if a blemish is discovered on it afterwards, there is an unresolved doubt whether the animal is a <i>nevelah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This ruling also depends on the principle stated in Halachah 13, that during its lifetime, an animal is forbidden. Hence it is not permitted unless we are certain that it was slaughtered in a proper manner (Radbaz; <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 18:2).</i> For perhaps [the knife] became blemished [when cutting] the skin and when he cut the signs, he cut them with a blemished knife.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And this would cause the slaughter to be unacceptable as mentioned above.</i><br>For this reason, when a person slaughters many animals or many fowl,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that since the skin of a fowl is soft, it is not very probable that this caused the blemish on the knife. Nevertheless, our Sages adopted this stringency.</i> he must inspect [the knife] between each [slaughter]. For if he did not check, and then checked [after slaughtering] the last one and discovered [the knife] to be blemished, there is an unresolved doubt whether all of them - even the first - are <i>nevelot</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 3, Halachah 18, for the ramifications of this ruling.</i> or not.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., it is possible that the knife could have become blemished when cutting the skin of the first animal. Hence, that animal - and all the subsequent ones - were slaughtered with an unacceptable knife.</i>",
            "When one inspected a knife, slaughtered with it, but did not inspect it after slaughtering, and then used it to break a bone, a piece of wood, or the like, and afterwards, inspected it and discovered it to be unacceptable, his slaughter is acceptable. [The rationale is that] the prevailing assumption is that the knife became blemished on the hard entity which it was used to break.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since he checked the knife at the outset and it was acceptable, we rely on probability. As long as we have a way of explaining how the knife was blemished, we do not say it was blemished on the animal's skin, for the likelihood of that happening is very low.</i> Similarly, if one was negligent and did not check his knife [after slaughtering] or the knife was lost before it could be checked, the slaughter is acceptable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here also, since the knife was inspected initially, there is no reason to suspect that the slaughter was unacceptable, we do not disqualify it [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 18:12)] .</i>",
            "Whenever a slaughterer<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is referring to a slaughterer who slaughters on behalf of people at large, not only for his own private purposes.</i> does not have the knife with which he slaughters inspected by a wise man<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Radbaz notes that the Rambam's words appear to differ slightly from the simple meaning of <i>Chullin</i> 18a, his source. From <i>Chullin</i>, it appears that the necessity to show the knife to the wise man is a mere token of respect, while from the Rambam it appears that it is a necessary safeguard to check that the slaughter is kosher.<br>The difference between these approaches can lead to a variance in practice. If we say that this inspection is merely for the sake of respect, then the sages may forgo the respect due them and allow an expert to slaughter even though he does not present his knife. If, however, it is a necessary precaution to insure that the slaughter is performed correctly, an inspection is always necessary.<br>Both of these perspectives have continued to be given emphasis throughout the Rabbinic literature, although the halachah as prescribed by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 18:17) is that a sage may forgo the honor due him. The present custom in many slaughtering houses today is for the slaughterers to work in pairs and for one to check the knife of the other. At times, a visiting Rabbinic authority comes and he inspects the knives of all of the slaughterers.</i> and uses it to slaughter for himself, we inspect it. If it is discovered to be desirable [and passes] the examination, we, nevertheless, place him under a ban of ostracism [lest] he rely on himself on another occasion and then the knife will be blemished, but he will still slaughter with it. If [upon examination] the knife is discovered to be blemished, he is removed from his position and placed under a ban of ostracism.

In his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 24:8), he rules according to the other views, but states: \"One should show concern for his (the Rambam's) opinion at the outset.\"</i> and slaughtered under the cloth, since the knife is not openly revealed, there is an unresolved doubt whether [the animal is considered] a <i>nevelah</i>.

            "What is meant by <i>hagramah</i>?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> gives two interpretations of the term <i>hagramah</i>:<br>a) \"lift up,\" as in II Kings 9:13; i.e., he lifted the knife above its proper place; and<br>b) \"tip,\" as in <i>Bava Batra</i> 88b; i.e., he tipped the knife upward.</i> This refers to one who slaughters at a high point on the windpipe<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam speaks only with regard to the windpipe, because he defines <i>hagramah</i> as slaughtering the animal in an improper place. If one would slit the gullet above the proper place, the animal would become disqualified as a <i>trefe</i> immediately (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> where it is not fit to slaughter. There are two [nodes, like kernels of] wheat at the top of the windpipe, at the large ring.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that the windpipe is made up of many rings. Over the top ring, there is a flap (cap) of flesh which is slanted. (This is the area of the larynx. See also Chapter 1, Halachah 7, and notes.) At the top of this flap, there are two kernel-like buttons of flesh. As long as the slaughterer leaves some portion of these kernels intact, the slaughter is acceptable.</i> [The following rules apply if] one slaughtered in the midst of these kernels. If he left even the slightest portion of them intact above [the place of slaughter], it is acceptable, for he slaughtered from the slanting cap [of the windpipe] or lower. This is within the place that is fit for ritual slaughter.

The same concept applies if one slaughters more than half the signs appropriately and then completes the slaughter through <i>chaladah</i>. Indeed, it can be explained that the Rambam does not mention this law with regard to <i>chaladah</i>, because it is obvious. For in <i>chaladah</i>, the slaughter is essentially correct; it is only the manner in which one inserts the knife that is unacceptable (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>As mentioned in the notes to Halachah 5, there are opinions who differ and disqualify the slaughter.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 24:12) quotes both of the views without stating which should be followed.

The Rivosh (Responsum 187), the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 24:18 all offer lengthy - and somewhat forced - explanations to attempt to resolve the apparent contradiction.

Since - as mentioned in the previous halachah - it is necessary to inspect the entire body, seemingly (and indeed, the <i>Tur</i> rules accordingly), the same laws would apply if red marks were found on the flesh above any organ whose perforation can disqualify the animal. He explains that perhaps this is indeed the Rambam's intent and he mentions the intestines only because there are many disqualifying factors involved with them. Nevertheless, in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 57:16), he quotes the Rambam's wording without emendation. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 57:38) quotes the <i>Tur's</i> ruling.</i> If the flesh above the intestines decays to the extent it becomes like flesh which a doctor would scrape from a wound, we consider that flesh as if it were lacking and [rule that the animal is] <i>trefe</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here also we assume that the poison will ultimately cause the organ below the flesh to become perforated (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>",
            "If [the predator] attacked the \"signs\" [which must be cut for ritual slaughter, the animal is] <i>trefe</i> if they turn red.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here too the rationale is that once the poison has begun to have an effect, it will ultimately penetrate through and perforate the entire organ. There is, however, a difference between the signs and the other organs. With regard to the other organs, as soon as the flesh above the organ is affected, the animal is considered <i>trefe</i>. With regard to the signs, they themselves must be affected. It is possible to explain that the signs are tougher and more resilient than the other organs. Hence, the fact that the flesh above them is affected is no proof that they will also be affected (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> The slightest wound [is significant]. If even the smallest portion of them becomes red because of an attack, [the animal is] <i>trefe</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This applies even when a small portion of the windpipe becomes red. Although a perforation in the windpipe does not disqualify it unless it is the size of the majority of its cavity (Chapter 3, Halachah 23), we assume that the poison of the predator will ultimately cause such a perforation (<i>Siftei Cohen</i> 57:40).</i>",
            "When there is a question whether [an animal] has been attacked or not, we do not permit it unless it is checked as one would [an animal] that had definitely been attacked.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned in Halachah 8. As stated in the notes to that halachah, there are authorities - and this is the custom cited by the Rama - it is customary in the present era not to rely on this examination and to regard any animal that was attacked - or even if there is a doubt whether it was attacked - as <i>trefe</i>.</i><br>What is implied? When a lion enters among oxen and a claw was found in the back of one of them,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An animal does not release its poison until the claw is removed (Halachah 7), and is this instance, it is implanted in the animal. We, nevertheless, disqualify it, for in this instance, we say that the animal released its poison when it lost its claw (<i>Turei Zahav</i> 57:21). Alternatively, we fear that it was also attacked with another claw and that claw was removed (<i>Rambam LeAm</i>).</i> we suspect that the lion attacked it. We do not rationalize and say: \"Maybe it scratched itself on a wall.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And the claw which had been implanted in the wall became stuck in it. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 57:14) emphasizes that this ruling is followed even if the claw is dried out (and thus is unlikely to have come from an animal recently).</i><br>Similarly, if a fox or a marten enters among fowls, [the predator] is silent and they crowing, we fear that he attacked.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And that is why they are clamoring.</i> If, however, the predator is roaring and they are crowing, [we assume that] they are crowing out of fear of him and his roaring. Similarly, if he cuts off the head of one of them,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rama 57:9 states that this applies when we do not see that he attacked others. If, however, we see that he attacked others, we do not assume that his rage subsided.</i> we assume his fury has subsided. Similarly, if both [the predator] and [the fowl] are silent, we do not suspect [anything]. For if he had harmed them, they would crow.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 57:11) states that this applies only when we see that he did not attack any animals. If, however, we saw an attack, the fact that he and the victims were silent is not significant.</i>",
            "When there is a question of whether or not a predator entered [a place where animals are kept] or we saw [an animal] enter [such a place], but were unable to see if it is one of the predators or not, we do not harbor suspicions.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For there is a multiple doubt involved. Perhaps the predator entered and perhaps it did not. Even if it entered, perhaps it wounded the animal and perhaps it did not (see <i>Chullin</i> 53b).</i><br>Similarly, if a fowl entered a woods or reeds and came out with its head or neck dripping blood, we do not suspect that it was attacked. Instead, we say: \"Perhaps it was wounded among the trees.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., it scratched itself and caused itself a wound. We must, however, check to see that the gullet was not perforated (Radbaz).

This ruling is granted because this question is left unresolved by <i>Chullin</i> 45b.

Since the matter remains unresolved and we do not know which of these views should be followed, the Rambam rules that all of the different views must be respected and a portion of skin the size of a <i>sela</i> must remain in each place (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>(Significantly, in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Chullin</i> 3:2), the Rambam mentions only the view that requires skin on the backbone and not the other opinions.)</i><br>If [a portion] as wide as a <i>sela</i> was removed from the entire backbone, from the navel, or from the tips of the limbs, but the remainder of the skin remained intact, there is a doubt [concerning the ruling].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This question is left unresolved by <i>Chullin, loc. cit.</i> Hence there is a doubt concerning the ruling.</i> It appears to me that we permit [the animal].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Many authorities question the Rambam's ruling.

Perhaps the place from which the skin was removed was in fact not the vital area (for the halachah could follow one of the other views). Even if it was the vital area, perhaps the fact that the skin on the remainder of the body is intact is enough for the animal to be permitted.<br>In his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 59:1), Rav Yosef Caro quotes the Rambam's ruling.

He also cites this view in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 58:1).<br>Moreover, in both those sources, Rav Yosef Caro also quotes views that state that this law applies only when the animal fell on its own or knew that it was being pushed by others.

It must be smashed and become ailing because of the fall to the extent that its form and appearance have been destroyed.

Similarly, he quotes authorities who maintain that it must walk in an ordinary manner. If it limps as it proceeds, an inspection is required.

The only exceptions are the conditions that render an animal <i>trefe</i> in the kidneys, the spleen, and the lobes of the lung. For a fowl does not have a division of lobes like an animal does.

The other view, which as above is accepted as halachah by the Rambam, is that the person becomes liable for lashes when he violates the transgression.

            "With what should [the blood] be covered? With earth,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Though this term is not found in the standard printed texts. It is found in authoritative manuscripts and early printings. The version of the standard printed text can be interpreted to mean that in this halachah, the Rambam is clarifying which other substances can be considered as \"earth.\"<br>When quoting this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 28:23) gives the following introduction: \"Any substance in which seeds will grow is called סearth'.... If [seeds] will not grow in it, but it is called סearth,' we may cover [blood] with it.\"</i> lime, gypsum, fine fertilizer, fine sand that need not be crushed by a potter, crushed rocks and earthen-ware, fine flax chips, fine saw dust, bricks, burnt mud,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 5:1). In his commentary to 3:7, 10:2, he interprets the term as \"crushed earthenware.\" We, however, used the former translation to avoid redundancy. Others cite the interpretation of the <i>Aruch</i> who explains that the term refers to a type of lime.</i> and sealing clay that are crushed, for all of these are types of \"earth.\" If, however, one covered it with a utensil or with stones, it is not considered as \"covered,\" for the verse states \"with earth.\"",
            "For this reason, we do not cover [blood] with coarse fertilizer, coarse sand, flour, bran, grain fiber, or filings from metal utensils, for these are not types of \"earth.\" There is one exception: filings of gold alone may be used to cover [blood], for they are called \"dust,\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew term <i>afar</i> has both the meaning \"earth\" and \"dust.\"</i> as [Job 28:6] states: \"And it possesses the dust of gold\" and [Deuteronomy 9:21] speaks [of grinding the Gold Calf] \"until it was thin, into dust.\"",
            "We may cover [blood] with oven soot, stibium,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A blue-powder uses for makeup and medicinal purposes in Talmudic times.</i> powder from mills, and ashes. [This includes] ashes from trees and ashes from clothes, even ashes from meat that was burnt, for [Numbers 19:17] speaks of \"the ashes of the burnt sin-offering.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the red heifer.</i> It is permitted to cover [blood] with the ashes of a city that went astray [and was therefore destroyed].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Deuteronomy ch. 13 and <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i>, ch. , which explain that if an entire city is led astray and worships false deities, the city is condemned, the transgressors executed, and the city burnt. With the ruling in this halachah, the Rambam is explaining that although it is forbidden to benefit from the property - and even the ashes - of such a condemned city, its ashes may be used for this purpose. The rationale is that using the ashes for the mitzvah is not considered as benefiting from them, because the mitzvoth were not given for our benefit (<i>Chullin</i> 89a).</i>",
            "One who slaughters must place earth below<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Moreover, this earth must be loose. One should not slaughter over a place where the earth is hard [<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>; <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 28:5)].</i> and then slaughter, [pouring the blood] into [the earth]. Afterwards, he covers it with earth. He should not slaughter [and pour the blood] into a container<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even if the utensil contains murky water and thus the prohibition mentioned in Chapter 2, Halachah 5, does not apply.</i> and then cover it with earth.",
            "The person who slaughters [the animal] should cover its blood,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One may, however, give another person the privilege of fulfilling the mitzvah. For that reason, there are many who ask the ritual slaughterer for the privilege of fulfilling the mitzvah of covering the blood after fulfilling the custom of <i>kapporot</i>. Nevertheless, one must ask the slaughterer for the privilege, one who takes it without asking is liable to pay the slaughterer a fine for \"stealing\" his mitzvah. See <i>Turei Zahav</i> 28:8.</i> as [the above prooftext ] states: \"[You shall pour out its blood and] cover it with earth.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Chullin</i> 87a states: \"The one who סpours out its blood' should סcover it.'\"</i> If he did not cover the blood and another person sees it, he is obligated to cover it, for this is an independent mitzvah and is not dependent on the slaughterer alone.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Chullin, loc. cit.,</i> notes that the passage states: \"And you shall say to the children of Israel,\" implying that the mitzvah is the concern of the entire people.</i>",
            "When a person covers the blood, he should not cover it with his feet,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., by kicking the earth over the blood.</i> but instead with his hands, a knife, or a utensil, so that he will not treat it with disdain and regard the mitzvoth with scorn. For the mitzvot in and of themselves are not worthy of honor. Instead, [the honor is] due He, blessed be He, who commanded us to observe them and [thus] saved us from groping in darkness and thus granted us a lamp to straighten crooked paths and a light to illumine the upright ways.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As <i>Bereishis Rabbah</i> 44:1 states: \"The mitzvoth were given to the Jewish people solely to refine the created beings with them.\" See also <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i>, Vol. III, ch. 26.</i> And so [Psalms 119:105] states: \"Your words are a lamp to my feet and a light for my ways.\"<br>Blessed be G‑d who grants assistance."
