All these details are implied in the biblical command, which states: \"You shall slaughter any of your cattle or sheep … as I have instructed you, and you may eat to your heart's content in your settlements.\" All these details were commanded orally, like the rest of the Oral Torah which is referred to as <i>Mitzvah</i> (commandment), as we have explained in the introduction to this work.",
