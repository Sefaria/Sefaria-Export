            "It is a positive commandment from the Torah to cry out and to sound trumpets for all troubles that come upon the community; as it is stated (Numbers 10:9), \"upon an enemy who attacks you and you sound trumpets.\" That is to say, [with] every matter that troubles you — such as famine, a plague, locusts and that which is similar to them — cry out about them, and sound the trumpets. ",
            "And this thing is from the ways of repentance. For when a trouble comes and they yell out about it and sound [trumpets], everyone will know that it was because of their evil deeds that this bad was done to them. As it is stated (Jeremiah 5:25), \"It is your iniquities that have diverted, etc.\" And this is what will cause them to remove the trouble from upon them. ",
            "But if they do not cry out and sound [trumpets], but rather say, \"What has happened to us is the way of the world, and this trouble is merely happenstance\" — it is surely the way of cruelty, and it causes them to stick to their bad deeds. And the trouble will add other troubles. About this is it written in the Torah (Leviticus 26: 27-28), \"but walk arbitrarily with Me. Then I will (also) walk arbitrarily with you in fury.\" That is to say, \"When I will bring upon you troubles — if you will say that it is arbitrary, I will increase the fury of this arbitrariness.\"",
            "And it is (a rabbinic commandment) from the words of the Scribes to fast for each trouble that comes upon the community until they are granted mercy from the Heavens. And on these fast days, we yell out with prayers and supplicate and sound only the trumpets. And if they were in the Temple, they would sound trumpets and the shofar. The shofar blows short and the trumpets blow long, since the commandment of the day is with trumpets. And we only blow with the trumpets and the shofar at the same time in the Temple, as it is stated (Psalms 78:6), \"With trumpets and the blast of the horn raise a shout before the Lord, the King.\"",
            "These fasts that we decree upon the community on account of troubles are not one day after [another] — since most of the community cannot withstand this thing. And we may only decree a fast at the outset for the Second Day from Shabbat (Monday) and the Fifth after it and the Second after that and so on in this order — Second, Fifth and Second — until they are granted mercy.",
            "We do not decree a fast on the community on Shabbats, nor on holidays. And likewise do we not blow with the shofar or with trumpets on them, not do we cry out or supplicate in prayer on them — unless it was a city that was surrounded by idolaters or a river, or a ship shipwrecked in the waters. We even (fast on Shabbat and) cry out and supplicate in prayer for an individual pursued by idolaters or brigands or an evil spirit. But we only sound [the trumpets] to gather the people to help them and save them.",
            "And likewise do we not decree a fast at the outset on [a] Rosh Chodesh or on Chanukkah or Purim or the intermediate days of a festival. But if they started to fast about a trouble even one day, and one of these [days] ran into [the order of the fasts], we fast and complete the day in fasting.",
            "[Regarding] these fasts that we fast about troubles — pregnant women, nursing woman and infants do not fast. And we are permitted to eat at night, even though we fast on the morrow — except for a fast for rain, as will be explained. And [on] any fast upon which we eat at night — whether a community or an individual — this one may surely eat and drink until the rise of the dawn. And this is so long as he does not sleep. But if he slept, he may not eat again. ",
            "Just like the community fasts about their troubles, so [too] does the individual fast about his trouble. How is this? See that [if] he had a sick person or one lost in the wilderness or imprisoned in a prison, he should fast for him and request mercy in his prayer. And (on these fasts), he should say, \"Answer us, etc.,\" in every prayer that he prays. But he should not fast on Shabbat, nor on festivals nor on Rosh Chodesh, nor on Chanukkah or Purim.",
            "Any fast that an individual does not accept upon himself from when it is still (the previous) day is not [considered] a fast. How does he accept it? From when he prays the afternoon prayer, he says after the prayer, \"Tomorrow I will be fasting,\" and he concludes in his heart to fast on the morrow. And even though he eats at night, he does not lose anything. And likewise if he concluded in his heart to fast three or four days — one after the other — even though he eats each and every night, he did not lose his fast; and he did not need intention for each and every day while it was still [the day before it].",
            "[If] he accepted to fast only on the morrow from when it was still day and he fasted; and he reconsidered to fast a second day — even though he laid down in his fasting (did not eat in between) — it is not a fast, since he did not accept it upon himself from when it was still day. And it is not necessary to say that [if] he ate and drank at night and got up in the morning and reconsidered to fast, that it is not a fast at all.",
            "One who sees a bad dream needs to fast on the morrow, so as to return, become cognizant of his actions, examine them and repent. And he should fast even on Shabbat; and he should recite the prayer, \"Answer us,\" in every prayer — even though he did not accept it from when it was still day. One who fasts on Shabbat must fast another day on account of his nullifying the [commandment] of delighting in the Shabbat (<i>oneg Shabbat</i>).",
            "One may fast [for] hours — and that is that he not eat anything the rest of the day. How is this? See that [if] he was preoccupied with his affairs and involved with his needs and did not eat until midday or until nine hours, and reconsidered to fast during the hours that remained in the day — this one surely fasts [for] those hours and recites the prayer, \"Answer us,\" during them. For he surely accepted the fast upon himself before the hours of the fast. And likewise if he ate and drank, and afterwards began to fast the rest of the day — it is surely a fast of hours.",
            "Anyone involved in a fast — whether he was fasting about his trouble or about his dream, or he was fasting with the community about their trouble — this one should surely not indulge himself or be lightheaded or be happy and of good heart. Rather he should be worried and mournful, as the matter that is stated (Lamentations 3:39), \"Of what shall a living man complain; of his own sins!\" But it is permissible to taste a dish — and even up to a <i>reviit</i>. And that is so long as he does not swallow, but rather tastes [it] and spits out. [If] he forgot and ate, he should [still] complete his fast.",
            "[In a case of] an individual who was fasting for a sick person and he became healed; about a trouble and it passed: This one should surely complete his fast. [In a case of] one who walks from a place where they are fasting to a place where they are not fasting: This one should surely fast and complete his fast. [If] he went from a place where they are not fasting to a place where they are fasting — this one should surely fast with them. [If] he forgot and ate and drank — he should not let himself be seen, nor should he indulge himself.",
            "[In a case of] a community which was fasting about rain, and it rained for them: If it was before midday, they do not complete [the fast], but rather eat, drink and gather to recite the Great Hallel (Psalms 136) — since we only recite the Great Hallel from a sated spirit and a full stomach. But if it was after midday — since most of the day passed in purity, they should complete their fast. And likewise if they were fasting about a trouble and it passed or a [bad] decree and it was nullified: If it was before midday, they do not complete [it]; but if after midday, they should complete [it].",
            "On every fast day that we decree on the community on account of troubles, the court and the elders sit in the synagogue and examine the actions of the people of the city from after the morning prayers until midday. And they remove stumbling blocks [that lead to] sin; they warn, pursue and investigate men of violence and sin, and separate them [from their ways]; and [do the same with] extortionists and humble them; and that which is similar to these things. And from midday to the evening: A fourth of the day, they read the blessings and curses that are in the Torah, as it is stated (Proverbs 3:11), \"Do not reject the discipline of the Lord, and do not despise His rebuke.\" And we read a haftara that is from the topic of the trouble. And [in] the last quarter of the day, they pray the afternoon service, supplicate, cry out and confess [their sins] according to their ability."

            "These are the troubles of the community about which we fast and sound [trumpets]: About haters of Israelites making troubles for Israelites; about the sword (foreign troops); about a plague; about evil (dangerous) animals; about [the two main types of] locusts; about blight; about chlorosis; about collapse; about sicknesses; about [the lack of] provisions; and about the rain.",
            "Any city that has one of these troubles should fast and sound [trumpets] until the trouble passes. And all surrounding it should fast, but not sound [trumpets]. However they should request mercy [of God] (pray) for them. And in every place, we do not cry out nor sound [trumpets] on Shabbat — as we have said. [This is] except for the trouble of [the lack of] provisions — for we cry out about it even on Shabbat. But we do not sound trumpets about it on Shabbat.",
            "About haters of Israelites making troubles for Israelites — how is this? Idolaters that came to [fight] a war with Israelites, or to take a tax (tribute) from them, or to take land from them, or to a decree a decree upon them — even about a light commandment — those [effected] surely fast and sound [trumpets] until they are shown mercy. And all of the cities around them fast, but they do not sound [trumpets] unless the [people of the first city] sounded to gather [others] to their assistance.",
            "About the sword (foreign troops) — how is this? Even a sword of peace. For example, idolaters making war with idolaters and they passed through a place of Israelites: Even though there is no war between them and the Israelites, this is surely a trouble, and we fast about it. As it is stated (Leviticus 26:6), \"and the sword shall not pass through your land\" — implying that [merely] seeing a war is a trouble. ",
            "About a plague — how is this? What is a plague? A city that has five hundred footmen and three of them are eliminated and died in three days — one after [the other] — this is surely a plague. If they were eliminated in one day or in four days, it is not a plague. If there were a thousand and six of them were eliminated in three days — one after [the other — this is] a plague. If they were eliminated in one day or in four days, it is not a plague. And so forth, according to this calculation. And women, minors and old men that have stopped from working are not in the count of the people of the province regarding this matter. ",
            "[If] there was a plague in the Land of Israel, the rest of the exiles of Israel should fast about them. If there was a plague in a province and there are caravans coming from it to another province — both of them should fast, even though they are far from one [another].",
            "We only fast about an evil (dangerous) animal at a time when it is driven. How is this? [If] it was seen in the city during the day, it is surely driven. [If] it was seen in the field — if it saw two people and did not flee from them, it is surely driven. But if the field was next to a marsh and it saw two people and chased after them, it is surely driven. But if it was in the marsh — even if it chased after them — it is not driven unless it attacked both of them and ate one of them. However, if it ate both of them in the marsh, it is not driven. It attacked because this is its place and because of hunger — not because it is driven.",
            "[In a case of] houses built in wildernesses or in desolate lands: Since they are in a place of packs of animals — if it climbed onto the roof and took a baby out of its cradle, it is surely driven; but if it did not reach this level, it is not driven. As it these people that endangered themselves by having come to the place of the animals.",
            "[In a case of] other crawling creatures and crawling flying creatures that were driven and injured [people], such as driven snakes and scorpions — and it is not necessary to say wasps and mosquitoes and that which is similar to them: We do not fast about them and we do not sound [trumpets], but we do cry out without a [trumpet] blow.",
            "About [the two main types of] locusts, we fast and blow [trumpets] — even if only see one wing in all of the Land of Israel — and [likewise] about the <i>govai</i>, with the smallest amount. However we do not fast or blow [trumpets] about the <i>chagav</i>, but rather only cry out.",
            "About blight and about chlorosis, from when it begins in the produce. And we decree a fast about it and sound [trumpets] even if it only began in a small place, like the fill of the opening of an oven.",
            "About collapse — how is this? See that [if] there was an increase in the city of sturdy walls that fell, that were not standing next to the river — this is surely a trouble and we fast and blow [trumpets] about it. And likewise do we fast and blow [trumpets] about an earthquake and [powerful] winds that bring down a building and kill.",
            "About sicknesses — how is this? See that [if] a sickness came down upon many people in one city — such as diphtheria or violent fever and that which is similar to them — and they were dying from this sickness, it is surely a communal trouble. So we decree a fast for it and sound [trumpets]. And likewise do we fast and sound [trumpets] for damp scabs (<i>chikhukh</i>). But we only cry out for dry scabs.",
            "About [the lack of] provisions — how is this? See that [if] commercial products that most of the livelihoods of the people of that city are from — such as linen [garments] in Babylonia and wine and oil in the Land of Israel — become cheapened; and buying and selling declines, such that a retailer is required to sell what is worth ten [units] for six [units], and [only] then find a buyer: This is surely a communal trouble — so we sound trumpets, and we cry out about it [even] on Shabbat.",
            "About rain — how is this? See that [if] the rain increased upon them to the point that it troubled them — they should surely pray about it. For you do not have a greater trouble than this — since houses fall, and their houses become their graves. But in the Land of Israel, we do not pray about [too] much rain. For it is a land of hills, and their houses are built of stone — hence much rain is good for them. And we do not pray to remove [that which is] good.",
            "[In a case of] produce that grew, but the rain was withheld and the plants started to dry up: Those [effected] surely fast and cry out until rain falls or until the plants dry up [completely]. And likewise if the time of Passover, or close to it, arrives in the Land of Israel — which is the time of the flowering of trees there — and no rain has fallen: Those [effected] surely fast and cry out until rain fit for the trees falls, or until its time passes. ",
            "And likewise if the time of the festival of Sukkot has arrived, but not much rain has fallen in order to fill the cisterns, the ditches and the [water storage] tunnels: Those [effected] fast until rain falls that is fit to fill the cisterns. And if they do not have water to drink, they fast for rain at any time that they do not have water to drink — even in the dry season.",
            "If the rain ceased forty days between one rainfall and [another] in the rainy season: This is a plague of drought, and we fast and cry out until rain falls, or until its time passes. "

            "See that [if] no rain fell for them at all from the beginning of the rainy season: If the seventeenth of Marcheshvan arrived and rain had not fallen — Torah scholars alone begin to fast Monday, Thursday and Monday. And all [Torah] scholars are fit for this.",
            "[If] Rosh Chodesh of Kislev arrived and rain has [still] not fallen, the court decrees three fasts on the community — Monday, Thursday and Monday. But they may eat and drink at night. However the men of the [priestly] shift do not fast with them, since they are involved in the [Temple] service. And all of the people enter the synagogues and pray, cry out and supplicate in the way that they do during all the fasts.",
            "[If] these passed and they have not been answered, the court decrees three other fasts upon the community — Monday, Thursday and Monday. And on these three [fasts], we may eat and drink [only] from when it is still day, like on the fast of [Yom] Kippur. And the men of the [priestly] shift fast part of the day, but they do not complete [it]. And the men of the [assigned priestly] family — and they are the ones busy with the service that day — would not fast at all. And [regarding] any fast upon which we eat from when it is still day: If one ate and stopped and decided not to eat [any more before the fast] — he may not eat again, even though there is [still enough] time in the day.",
            "And on these three fasts, all of the people are forbidden to engage in work during the day; but they are permitted at night. They are forbidden to bathe the whole body with hot water; but it is permitted [to bathe] one's face, his hands and his feet. Hence we lock up the bathhouses. They are forbidden to smear [with oil]; but it is permissible if it is to remove filth. They are forbidden to have marital relations, and to wear (leather) shoes in the city; but it is permissible to wear leather shoes on the road. And they pray in the synagogues, cry out and supplicate — like the other fasts.",
            "[If] these have passed and they [still] have not been answered, the court decrees seven other fasts on the community — Monday, Thursday, Monday, Thursday, Monday, Thursday and Monday. And only on these fasts do pregnant and nursing women fast. But on other fasts, pregnant and nursing women do not fast. However even though they do not fast, they may not indulge themselves with delicacies. Rather they eat and drink enough for the [needs] of the child. ",
            "And on these seven fasts, the men of the shift fast and complete [it]. And the men of the [assigned priestly] family fast part of the day, but they do not complete [it]. And everything that is forbidden on the three middle ones is forbidden on these seven last ones. ",
            "And these exceeded [the others] in that only on them would they sound [trumpets] and pray in the town square. And they would bring down an elder to rebuke the people, so that they would repent from their [evil] ways. And they add six blessings in the morning prayers and in the afternoon prayers. So it would come out that they would recite twenty-four blessings in prayer (at each prayer service). And we lock up the stores. On Monday, we push the door ajar at evening time and [then] open the stores. But on Thursday, we open [them] the whole day on account of the honor of Shabbat. However if the store has two entrances, one should open one and lock one. And if the store has a platform (in front of it), he may open it in its usual way and he need not be concerned [that he is violating the law].",
            "If these have passed and they have not been answered, they should minimize buying and selling; joyful building like etching and decorating [walls]; and joyful planting like types of myrtles and types of tents. And they should minimize betrothals and marriages unless one had not [yet] fulfilled the commandment of being fruitful and multiplying. And it is forbidden for anyone who has fulfilled the commandment of being fruitful and multiplying to engage in marital relations in years of famine. And they should minimize greetings between a person and his fellow. However Torah scholars should not greet (at all), but rather [act] like people who have been rebuked by the Omnipresent. And [in a case of] an ignorant person who has greeted them, they may return his greeting with a soft voice and a serious demeanor.",
            "Torah scholars resume fasting by themselves [every] Monday, Thursday and Monday until Nissan of the season concludes — but not the community. For we do not decree more than these thirteen fasts on the community because of rains that have not fallen. And when the [select] individuals fast until Nissan concludes, they are permitted to eat at night; and they are permitted to do work, to bathe, to smear [with oil], to have marital relations and to wear shoes — like all the other [conventional] fasts. And they break for [the days of] Rosh Chodesh and Purim. When Nissan of the season concludes — and that is when the sun reaches the beginning of the constellation of Taurus — they do not fast. For rain at that time is only a sign of curse — since they had not fallen at all from the beginning of the year. ",
            "To what are these words applicable? To the Land of Israel and all that is similar to it. But in places in which their rainy period is before the seventeenth of Marchesvan or after this time: If its time arrived and rain did not fall, the [select] individuals fast on Monday, Thursday and Monday; but they break for [the days of] Rosh Chodesh, Chanukkah and Purim. And they wait about seven days afterwards. If rain has not fallen, the court decrees thirteen fasts upon the community in the order that we mentioned.",

And they place burnt ashes upon the ark and on top of the Torah scroll in order to increase the crying and to humble their hearts. And one of the people takes from the ashes and places it on the head of the <i>nassi</i> (leader) and on the head of the head of the court in the place of where the tefillin lay, so that they will be embarrassed and repent. And each and every [member of the community] takes [ashes] and puts [it] on his head. ",

[If] there was neither a sage nor an elder there, they stand up a man of stature.

As so did we find with Nineveh -d it is not stated about the people of Nineveh, \"And God saw their sackcloth and their fasting\"; but rather, \"And God saw their deeds\" (Jonah 3:10). And in the received tradition, it states (Joel 2:13), \"Rend your hearts and not your garments.\" And he adds to these topics according to his ability, until they humble their hearts and repent with a complete repentance.",

And there should not be a [habitual] sinner among his children or his household or all of his relatives who are attached to him. Rather his house should be empty of sin. And a bad reputation should not have gone out about him in his youth. He should be humble, accepted by the people, musical and have a pleasant voice.

And we only do this order on the Temple Mount exclusively. And when they blow tekiah and teruah blows there, they blow with trumpets and with the shofar together — as we have mentioned.",
            "In every place where we decree these seven fasts: After they pray, all of the people go out to the cemeteries, and cry and supplicate there. [This is] to say, \"You will surely die like these, if you do not repent from your ways.\" And on any fast from the fasts about troubles that we decree upon the community, we pray the <i>neilah</i> (closing late afternoon) prayer [service] in every place.",
            "[If] rain fell for them, until when must it fall for the community to stop the fast? From when it sinks the depth of a handbreadth into dry land, two handbreadths into average [soil]; and until it sinks the depth of three handbreadths into worked (soft) [soil]."

            "All the Jewish people are accustomed nowadays to fast on the thirteenth day of <i>Adar</i> in remembrance of the fast observed in the days of Haman, as it is written: \"Regarding their fasting and wailing\" (Esther 9:31). If the thirteenth of <i>Adar</i> happens to coincide with the Sabbath, we observe the fast earlier, on Thursday, the eleventh. If one of the other four fast days coincides with the Sabbath, it is postponed until after the Sabbath. If it falls on Friday, it is observed on Friday. And in all of these fasts, we do not sound [trumpets] and we do not pray the <i>neilah</i> prayer [service]. But we do read [the section beginning with] \"And Moses implored\" in the Torah (Exodus 32:11) in the morning service and the afternoon service. And we eat and drink at night on all of them, except for the Ninth of Av.",
            "We minimize joy from when Av begins. And it is forbidden to take a haircut, to wash clothes and to wear ironed clothing — even a linen garment — in the week in which the Ninth of Av falls out to be, until the fast passes. And it is even forbidden to wash clothes and leave them over for after the fast. And [the Jewish people] have already been accustomed not to eat meat on this week and not to enter the bathhouse until the fast passes. And there are some places that are accustomed to annul slaughtering from Rosh Chodesh (the first day) of Av until the fast.",
            "The night of the Ninth of Av is like the day in every matter. And we may only eat from when it is still day (on the previous day). And its twilight [time] is forbidden like on Yom Kippur. And one should not eat meat or drink wine on the meal that pauses [our eating before the fast]. But he may drink wine from the winepress that is three days old or less. And he may eat salted meat that is three days old or more. And he should not eat eat two [cooked] dishes.",
            "To what are these words applicable? When one ate on the eve of the Ninth of Av after midday. But if he ate before midday, even though he pauses [eating] with it, he may eat everything that he wants. And [when] the eve of the Ninth of Av falls out to be on Shabbat, he may eat and drink all of his needs and even place [a meal] on his table like the meal of Solomon. And likewise on the Ninth of Av itself that falls out to be on Shabbat, he should not lack anything.",
            "This is the measure of all the people that are not able to tolerate more than what is enough. But the measure of the early pious ones was like this: On the eve of the Ninth of Av they would bring dry bread soaked in water, with salt, to a person sitting by himself between the oven and the stove. And he would eat it and drink a jug of water with it in worrying, desolation and crying like one whose dead [relative] is laid out in front of him. It is fit for sages to do this or that which is close to it. And from all of our days, we have never eaten a cooked food — even of lentils — on the eve of the Ninth of Av, unless it was Shabbat.",
            "Pregnant and nursing woman fast and complete [it] on the Ninth of Av. And it is forbidden to bathe — whether with hot water or cold water — and even to dip one's finger into the water. And it is forbidden to smear [with oil] for pleasure and wear [leather] shoes and to engage in marital relations, like on Yom Kippur. And in a place where they are accustomed to do work on it, they may do [so]. But in a place where they are accustomed not to do work on it, they may not do [so]. However Torah scholars are idle (do not work) in any place. And the Sages said that one who does work on it never sees a sign of blessing [from it] forever.",
            "Torah scholars should not greet each other on the Ninth of Av. Rather they sit sadly and sigh like mourners. And if an ignorant person greeted them, they may return his greeting with a soft voice and a serious demeanor. And it is forbidden on the Ninth of Av to read the Torah, the Prophets, the Writings, the Mishnah, the laws, the Gemara and the <i>aggadah</i>. One may only read from Job, Lamentations and from bad things in Jeremiah. And we make the infants of the house of their teacher idle (we do not have them study). And some sages are accustomed to not laying the head tefillin. ",
            "From when the Temple was destroyed, the Sages that were in that generation ordained that we never build a building that is whitewashed and ornamented like the building of kings. Rather one plasters his house with plaster and whitewashes it with lime and leaves over without lime a space an ell by an ell, across from the entrance. And [in a case of] one who buys a whitewashed and ornamented courtyard: It is surely in its presumed state (of not having been built for a Jew); so we do not obligate him to peel the walls.",
            "And they also ordained that one who sets a table to make a meal for guests lack a little from it and leave an empty place without one of the bowls that it is fit to place there; and that when a women makes [herself up with] silver and gold jewelry, she leaves off one of the types of jewelry to which she is accustomed, such that the jewelry not be complete; and that when a groom marries a woman, he takes burnt ashes and puts it on his head in the place of where the tefillin lay. And all of these things are so as to remember Jerusalem, as it is stated (Psalms 137:5-6), \"If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand wither. Let my tongue stick to my palate if I cease to think of you, if I do not raise up Jerusalem above my highest joy.\" ",
            "And they likewise ordained not to play musical instruments. And it is forbidden to rejoice with all types of music and any instruments that make musical sounds, and it is forbidden to listen to them, on account of the destruction. And even vocal music over wine if forbidden, as it is stated (Isaiah 24:9), \"They drink their wine without song.\" And all of [the Jewish people] has already become accustomed to saying songs of praise and song of thanks to God, and that which is similar to them, over wine. ",
            "And afterwards they decreed about grooms' crowns — not to put them on at all — and that the groom not place any coronet on his head, as it is stated (Ezekiel 21:310), \"Remove the turban and lift off the crown!\" And likewise did they decree about brides' crowns if it was of silver or gold; but if it is of strands (from plants), it is permissible for a bride. ",
            "One who saw the cities of Judah in their destruction says, \"Your holy cities have become a desert\" (Isaiah 64:9), and tears. [If] he saw Jerusalem in its destruction, he says, \"[Zion] has become a desert, etc.\" (Isaiah 64:9); the Temple in its destruction, says \"Our holy Temple, our pride, etc.\" (Isaiah 64:10), and tears. And from where is one obligated to tear? From [Mount] Scopus. And when he reaches the [place of the] Temple, he tears another tear. But if he encountered the Temple first when he came from the way of the wilderness, he tears for the Temple and adds [to the tear] for Jerusalem.",
            "[Regarding] every one of all of these tears, one tears with his hand, standing up. And he tears all of his clothing upon him until he reveals his heart. And he may never mend these tears ever. But he is allowed to tack them together, and hem them, and gather them and fix them with ladder-like stitches. ",
            "[In a case of] one who [repeatedly] comes and goes to Jerusalem: If [his visit] is within thirty days [from the last visit], he does not tear again. But if it is after thirty days, he tears again."
