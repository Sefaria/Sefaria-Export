            "Any act that is culpable on the Sabbath is punishable with lashing if it is committed on a holyday and not for the purpose of food. This does not include the prohibition against conveying objects from one domain to another, and the prohibition against starting a fire on the Sabbath. Since the transfer of objects from one domain to another has been made permissible for the purpose of preparing food, it has been made permissible even for purposes other than food preparation.— — So too, it is permissible to start a fire on a holyday even when it is not needed for the preparation of food. Other acts, however, are permissible on a holyday only when they are needed for the preparation of food; for example: slaughtering, baking, kneading, and the like. — —",
            "The sages have prohibited any work on a festival, even for the purpose of food, if it can be done on the day preceding the festival without loss or depreciation. Why have they enacted this prohibition? It has been enacted in order to prevent one from postponing the performance of tasks until the day of the festival, with the result that the whole day would be spent in performing these tasks, without having time to enjoy the festival or to eat.",
            "For this very reason they have not prohibited the transfer of objects from one domain into another on a festival, even though each transfer is work that can be done on the day preceding the festival. Why then have they not prohibited it? In order to increase the festive rejoicing. One may therefore carry to and fro whatever he pleases, performing all that he has to do, without being like one whose hands are tied.— —",

Those who reside in Eretz Yisrael, however, observe only <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> for two days. In the section of this book concerning the rules of the Hebrew calendar, we shall explain the principle of this custom as well as the reason why <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> is celebrated for two days everywhere.",
            "Even though the second day of a festival is only by rabbinic enactment, it equals the first day regarding anything that is forbidden.— — On the second day, just like the first day of a festival, funeral eulogies and fasting are forbidden, since one is required to rejoice. The only difference between the two days is that a dead person may be buried on the second day.",
            "Thus, non-Jews should attend to the burial of one who died on the first day of the festival; but on the second day, Jewish people may attend to it,— — because the second day is regarded as an ordinary weekday as far as the burial of the dead is concerned. This applies even to the second day of <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>."

            "On a holyday occurring on a Friday, one must not bake or cook food for the next day, the Sabbath. This prohibition is on rabbinic grounds, to prevent one from cooking on a holyday for a plain weekday. It stands to reason: if one must not cook food for the Sabbath, he certainly must not cook for a plain weekday. Accordingly, it is permissible to cook and bake on a holyday for the Sabbath if on the day preceding the festival one prepared a dish upon which to depend. The dish upon which he depends is called <i>eruv tavshilin</i> [a mingling of dishes designed for the Sabbath as well as for the immediately preceding holyday].",

Hence, it is called the <i>eruv</i> of dishes.",

While eating and drinking, one must feed the stranger, the orphan, the widow, and other poor unfortunates. Anyone, however, who locks the doors of his courtyard and eats and drinks along with his wife and children, without giving anything to eat and drink to the poor and the desperate, does not observe a religious celebration but indulges in the celebration of his stomach.— —",

Drunkenness, jesting and levity are not rejoicing but madness and folly, and we are not charged to indulge in madness and folly but in the kind of rejoicing that finds expression in the worship of the Creator of all things, as it is written: \"Because you have not served the Lord your God with joy and with a glad heart for all your abundance…\" (Deuteronomy 28:47). This proves that one should worship with joy, while it is impossible to serve God by jesting, frivolity, or drunkenness."

If anyone performs prohibited work on <i>Hol ha-Mo'ed</i>, he is punished for disobeying a rabbinic enactment.
