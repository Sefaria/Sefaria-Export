            "These six days on which Scripture prohibited labor—being the first and seventh days of Passover, the first and eighth days of Sukkot, the day of Shavuot and the first day of the seventh month (Rosh Hashanah)—are called holidays (<i>yamim tovim</i>). The [degree of] cessation of work is equal in all of them, in that all work is prohibited except for labor that is for the sake of eating—as it is stated (Exodus 12:16), \"only anything that is eaten by any person.\"",
            "Anyone who rests from work of labor on one of them has surely fulfilled a positive commandment; as it is surely stated about them (Leviticus 23:24), \"a day of rest (<i>shabbaton</i>)\" -meaning to say, \"Rest!\" And anyone who does work on one of them which is not for the sake of eating—such as [if] he built or demolished or wove or that which is similar to these—has surely negated a positive commandment and violated a negative commandment, as it is stated (Exodus 12:17), \"no work shall be done on them.\" And if one did it [in front of] witnesses and with a warning, he is lashed from Torah writ.",
            "One who does many primary categories of forbidden work on a holiday with one warning—such as [if] he planted and built and demolished and wove with one warning—is only lashed one [set of lashes]. There is separation of forbidden types of work on Shabbat (to be liable for each one separately), but there is no separation of forbidden types of work on a holiday.",
            "Any act that is culpable on the Sabbath is punishable with lashing if it is committed on a holyday and not for the purpose of food. This does not include the prohibition against conveying objects from one domain to another, and the prohibition against starting a fire on the Sabbath. Since the transfer of objects from one domain to another has been made permissible for the purpose of preparing food, it has been made permissible even for purposes other than food preparation.— — So too, it is permissible to start a fire on a holyday even when it is not needed for the preparation of food. Other acts, however, are permissible on a holyday only when they are needed for the preparation of food; for example: slaughtering, baking, kneading, and the like. Therefore it is permitted on a holiday to bring out a child or a Torah scroll or a key, and that which is similar to these from domain to domain. ---  And all things [the purpose] of which are not the sake of eating are forbidden, such as writing, and weaving, and building and that which is similar to them.",
            "The Sages prohibited any work on a holiday —even though it is for the sake of eating—if it can be done on the day preceding the holiday without a loss or a lack to it. And why did they forbid this thing? [As a] decree, lest one postpone the performance of work that it is possible to do from the eve of the holiday until the holiday; and it would [then] come out that the whole holiday would be spent in performing this work—so he would be prevented from enjoyment of the holiday, and he would have no free time to eat.",
            "For this very reason they have not prohibited the transfer of objects from one domain into another on a festival, even though each transfer is work that can be done on the day preceding the festival. Why then have they not prohibited it? In order to increase the festive rejoicing. One may therefore carry to and fro whatever he pleases, performing all that he has to do, without being like one whose hands are tied.— —",
            "How is this? We do not reap, nor thresh, nor winnow, nor sort nor grind wheat kernels on a holiday. As all of these, and that which is similar to them, are possible to do from the eve of the holiday, and there would be no loss or lack in [doing] this.",
            "But we may knead, bake, slaughter and cook on a holiday. For if one did these from the eve of the holiday, there is a loss or a lack [in the] taste with it. As bread that was baked yesterday or food that was cooked yesterday is not the same as hot bread or as a food that he cooked today. And likewise anything that is similar to these. And likewise may we do [work] on a holiday [upon] things that prepare the food of [any] person, about which there will be a lack if they are done from the eve—such as pounding spices, and that which is similar to them.",
            "We do not bake or cook on a holiday that which will be eaten on [weekdays]. And work was not rendered permissible for the sake of eating except in order to benefit from it on the holiday. If one did it in order to eat on the holiday and he left [some] over, it is permissible to eat the remainder on [weekdays].",
            "A woman may fill a pot with meat even though she only needs one piece. A baker may fill a barrel of water even though he only needs [it] for one  jug. And a woman may fill a tub with bread even though she only needs one loaf—for when there is much bread in the oven, it bakes nicely. And one may salt several pieces of meat at one time even though he only needs one piece. And likewise anything that is similar to this.",
            "[In a case of] one who bakes or cooks on a holiday in order to eat from it on that day, or invited guests and they did not come, and the cooked food and the bread was left over: It is surely permissible to eat [it] on the morrow —whether on a [weekday] or on Shabbat. And that is so long as he does not act craftily. But if he acted craftily, it is forbidden even on a Shabbat that is after the holiday—since [the Sages] were more stringent with one acting craftily than with one who was volitional.",
            "[In a case of] one who had an animal in danger (of dying): He should not slaughter it on the holiday unless he knows that he can eat a roasted <i>kazayit</i> of meat from it while it is still [that] day—so that he not slaughter on a holiday, that which he will eat on [weekdays]. And likewise anything that is similar to this.",
            "We do not bake or cook on a holiday in order to feed Kuthites (gentiles) or dogs. As it is stated (Exodus 12:16), \"it alone shall be made for yourselves\"—\"for yourselves,\" and not for Kuthites; \"for yourselves,\" and not for dogs. Hence we invite a gentile on Shabbat, but we do not invite him on a holiday, [as a] decree lest one increase [food preparation] on his account. But [if] the Kuthite comes on his own, he may eat what they are eating with them, as [the Israelite] has already prepared it.",
            "[In a case of] an animal, half or which is a Kuthite's and half of which is an Israelite's: It is permissible to slaughter it on a holiday—since it is impossible to eat a <i>kazayit</i> of meat [from it] without slaughter. But  it is forbidden to bake a dough, half of which is Kuthite's and half of which is an Israelite's—since one may divide the dough. [In a case of a foreign] army garrison that gave flour to an Israelite to make bread for them on a holiday: It is permissible to bake it for them, if they are not exacting when we give a bread to an infant—as each and every bread [that is baked] is fit for the infant. A 'dog's dough' may be baked on a holiday at a time when the shepherds [also] eat from it.",
            "One who cooks on a holiday for Kuthites or for an animal or leaves it over for [weekdays] is not lashed. For if guests came to him, that food would be fit for them. [If] he made [food] for himself and he left [part of it] over, it is permitted to feed Kuthites or an animal from it.",
            "Bathing and anointing are surely included in eating and drinking; so we may do them on a holiday, as it is stated (Exodus 12:16), \"only anything that is eaten by any person\"—for anything that the body needs. Hence we heat up water on a holiday; and one may wash his face, his hands and his feet with it. But all of his body is forbidden, [as a] decree [to prevent the use] of a bathhouse. But it is permissible to bathe all of his body in hot water that was heated up on the eve of the holiday. For they only decreed about that thing regarding Shabbat alone.",
            "Anything that is forbidden on Shabbat—whether because it is similar to work or it [may] bring one to [do] work or it is because of a Shabbat decree—is certainly forbidden on a holiday, unless there was something about it for the sake of eating and that which is similar to it. And anything that is permissible on Shabbat is permissible on a holiday. But there is the prohibition on a holiday of <i>muktseh</i> (that which is designated) which is not found on Shabbat—as <i>muktseh</i> is forbidden on a holiday, but permissible on Shabbat. Because a holiday is less weighty than Shabbat, [the Sages] forbade  <i>muktseh</i> upon it, lest one would come to make light of it.",
            "How is this? A chicken that is earmarked to produce eggs or an ox that is earmarked for plowing or doves of a dovecote or fruits earmarked for trade—all of these, and that which are similar to them—are  <i>muktseh</i>. So it is forbidden to eat from them on a holiday until one prepares them from on the eve and decides about them to eat [them]. But everything is [automatically] prepared on Shabbat for Shabbat [use] and does not require preparation. And the same way that  <i>muktseh</i> is forbidden on a holiday, so too is [that which is ] born (<i>nolad</i>) [on the holiday] forbidden.",
            "[Weekdays may] prepare for Shabbat and weekdays my prepare for a holiday. But a holiday may not prepare for Shabbat, nor may Shabbat prepare for a holiday. Hence an egg born on a holiday [that came out the day] after Shabbat is forbidden—even though the chicken is earmarked for eating. Since the egg was finished yesterday, it comes out that Shabbat prepared for that holiday. And it is [likewise] forbidden on any holiday [on which it is born, as a] decree on account of a holiday [that comes out] after Shabbat. And likewise an egg born on any Shabbat is forbidden, [as a] decree on account of a Shabbat [that comes out] after a holiday.",
            "And the same way that it is forbidden to eat it, so too is it forbidden to move it. And even if it was mixed up in a thousand [permissible eggs], they are all forbidden. For tomorrow, they will surely all be permissible; and anything [forbidden] that has properties that will render it permissible is not nullified even in a thousand thousands. [In a case of] one who slaughters a chicken on a holiday and found finished eggs [inside it]—these are surely permissible. For this is not something found all the time; and [the Sages] did not decree about something that is only found just occasionally.",
            "We celebrate each of the festivals for two days outside Eretz Yisrael owing to custom, the second day being observed by rabbinical enactment as one of the things newly innovated in the Diaspora. Those who reside in Eretz Yisrael, however, observe only <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> for two days. In the section of this book concerning the rules of the Hebrew calendar, we shall explain the principle of this custom as well as the reason why <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> is celebrated for two days everywhere.",
            "Even though the second day of a festival is only by rabbinic enactment, it equals the first day regarding anything that is forbidden. On the second day, just like the first day of a festival, funeral eulogies and fasting are forbidden, since one is required to rejoice. The only difference between the two days is that a dead person may be buried on the second day. [In a case of] anyone who profanes the second day holiday—even that of Rosh Hashanah: We strike him with lashes for rebellion, or excommunicate him—if he is not from the [Torah] students. [This punishment is meted out] whether [the violation] is with something [forbidden] on account of a Shabbat decree or with forbidden types of work or whether he went outside of the perimeter. On the second day, just like the first day of a festival, funeral eulogies and fasting are forbidden, since one is required to rejoice. The only difference between the two days is that a dead person may be buried on the second day.",
            "Thus, non-Jews should attend to the burial of one who died on the first day of the festival; but on the second day, Jewish people may attend to it, and we do all of his needs for him, such as making the bier, sewing the shrouds, cutting the [fragrant plants] and anything that is similar to this because the second day is regarded as an ordinary weekday as far as the burial of the dead is concerned. This applies even to the second day of <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>.",
            "These two days of the holidays in the Diaspora are two [separate periods of] holiness and are not [considered to be] one day. Hence [in the case of] something that was <i>muktseh</i> on the first day or was born on the first day: If he prepared it for the second, it is surely permissible. How is that? An egg born on the first may be eaten on the second. An animal or bird that were trapped on the first may be eaten on the second. Something attached to the ground that became detached on the first may be eaten on the second. And likewise is it permissible to color the eye with a blue ointment on the second day holiday, even though there is no illness present. To what are these words applicable? To the two day holidays of the Diaspora. But the two days of Rosh Hashanah are one [period of] holiness and are considered to be one day for all of these things, except regarding the matter of the dead body alone. But an egg born on the first day of Rosh Hashanah is forbidden on the second. And likewise anything that is similar to this. [In a case of] a Shabbat that is adjacent to a holiday and an egg was born on one of them—it is forbidden on the second. And likewise anything that is similar to this. And even if it was born on the second day [of the holiday], it may not be eaten on the Shabbat adjacent to (after) it."
        ],
        [
            "A chick that was born on a holiday is prohibited [to eat on that day] because it is <i>muktseh</i>. But a calf that was born on a holiday—if it's mother was earmarked for eating—is permitted, since it is prepared by way of its mother. [For] if one were to have slaughtered it's mother [while it was still inside], this [fetus] that was inside would have been permissible on the holiday—even though it was not [yet] born.",
            "Animals that go out and graze outside of the perimeter and come to sleep within the perimeter are surely prepared [for the holiday]; so we may take from them and slaughter them on the holiday. But we may not slaughter on a holiday those [animals] that graze and sleep outside of the perimeter—if they come [within the perimeter] on a holiday—because they are <i>muktseh</i> and the minds of the people of the city are not on them (to eat them on the holiday).",
            "And likewise a consecrated animal that acquired a blemish on a holiday: Since [the owner] did not have his mind on it (to eat it on the holiday) from the eve of the holiday—it is prohibited to slaughter it on the holiday. Therefore it is prohibited for one to examine blemishes on consecrated animals on a holiday, [as a] decree lest the sage permit them  (to be slaughtered for personal use) due to their blemishes and [the owner] will come to slaughter it on that [holiday]. But [the sage] may look at the blemish on the eve of a holiday and permit or forbid it on the morrow.",
            "A firstborn that was born [on a holiday] together with a blemish is considered to be prepared, but it should not be examined on the holiday. However if one were to transgress and see its blemish, examine it and permit it—it can surely be slaughtered and eaten. [In a case of] a firstborn that falls into a pit: One should provide its sustenance for it in its place (so that it will not die). For one is surely not able to bring it up, since it it not fit for slaughter on the holiday. [In a case of] 'it and it's child' that fell into a pit: He should bring up the first in order to slaughter it, but not slaughter it. And [then] he should act craftily and bring up the second in order to slaughter it. And he [then] slaughters either one of them that he wants. Because of [the commandment to prevent] the pain of animals, [the Sages] permitted acting craftily [here]. An unconsecrated animal that fell from a roof and survived for [twenty-four hours] and surely [still] requires examination (to determine if the animal is permissible to eat) may be slaughtered on the holiday and [then] examined—[for] it is possible that it will be found fit and may be eaten.",
            "Geese, chicken, and doves in the home are surely prepared; so they do not require setting aside (for use on the holiday). But doves of a dovecote, doves of a loft and birds nesting in pitchers, in a building or in an orchard are surely <i>muktseh</i>. So it is necessary to set them aside from the eve and say, \"I am taking these and those.\" But he need not shake [them].",
            "[If] one set aside black [birds] and white [birds] and [then] found the black ones in place of the white ones and the white ones in the place of the black ones—they are forbidden [on the holiday]. For I would say, lest those that he set aside flew away and these are others—and anything [about which there is a] doubt [with regards to its being] prepared is forbidden. [If] one set aside two [birds] and found three—all [the birds] are forbidden. [If one set aside] three and found two—they are permissible. [If] he set them aside within the nest and found them in front of the nest: If there are no other ones besides them there in the nest and [they] are unable to fly—even though there is another nest there around the corner within fifty ells—these [birds] are surely permissible. For [a bird that hops] only hops directly in front of its nest.",
            " [Regarding] fish that are in large ponds, and likewise animals and fowl that are in large corrals: All that lack trapping—to the point that [people] say, \"Bring a trap and we will trap it\"—are surely <i>muktseh</i>; so we may not trap them on a holiday. And if one did trap [it]—he may not eat it. But anything that does not require trapping is surely [considered to be] prepared; so we may trap them on a holiday and eat them. And likewise [in a case of] a wild animal that holed up in an orchard near a city: Its young—while they are [still] little, such that they do not require trapping [to slaughter them]—do not require setting aside, since he had his mind on them (to eat them on the holiday).",
            "One should not take [the trappings] on a holiday from traps for wild animals, birds or fish that were spread from the eve of a holiday unless he knows that they were trapped from before the holiday. [In a case of] one who dams a water canal from the eve of a holiday and  wakes up early on the morrow to find fish in it: They are surely permissible—since they were already trapped from the eve of the holiday, they are surely [considered] prepared.",
            "[In a case of] a [store]house—that is filled with fruits that are prepared [for a holiday]—that opened: One may take [the fruits inside] from the the place of the opening. One who stands over <i>muktseh</i> (fruit set aside to dry) from the eve of a holiday on a sabbatical year—such that all fruits are ownerless—must mark [them] and say \"From here until here will I take.\" But if he did not mark [them], he cannot take [them].",
            "[In a case of] a Kuthite (gentile) who brought a present to an Israelite on a holiday: If there is from this species [some which are still] attached to the ground (it is still in season); or he brought a wild animal or fowl or fish that it is possible to trap on that day—these are surely forbidden until the evening; and he must wait [the time needed] in order to make it (to detach the produce or trap the animal). And one may not even smell a myrtle [branch], and that which is similar to it, in the evening, until he waits [the time needed] in order to make it. But if there is none from this species [which is still] attached to the ground; or its [appearance] demonstrated about it that it was uprooted or trapped from yesterday: If he brought it from within the perimeter, it is permissible. However if he brought it from outside the perimeter, it is surely forbidden. But [that which is brought] from outside of the perimeter [by] one who comes for one Israelite is permissible to another Israelite.",
            "It is forbidden to use wood that has shed from a palm tree on a holiday to feed a fire—because it is 'born' (<i>nolad</i>) [on the holiday]. But if they shed into the oven, one increases prepared wood over them (so that the new wood is the majority) and feeds the fire with them. We do not start using a pile of straw or a storehouse of wood on a holiday, unless one prepared [them] from the eve—as they are <i>muktseh</i>. But if the straw was mixed with thorns—such that it is surely only fit for feeding a fire—it is surely prepared.",
            "We do not chop wood from a stack of beams, because they are <i>muktseh</i>; nor from a beam that broke on the holiday, because it is <i>nolad</i>. And likewise may we not feed a fire with vessels that broke on the holiday, because they are <i>nolad</i>. But we may feed a fire with unbroken vessels or vessels that broke on the eve of the holiday, as they were surely prepared for a different type of work [than was first intended, already] from the eve [of the holiday]. Similarly to this, we may feed the fire with shells of nuts and almonds that one ate on the eve of the holiday. But if he ate them on the holiday, we may not feed the fire with their shells. However there are textual variants [of the Talmud] that have written in them that if he ate them from the eve, we do not feed the fire with their shells—as they surely became <i>muktseh</i>. But if he ate them on the holiday, we feed the fire with them, since they are prepared by way of the food.",
            "A wet thorn is <i>muktseh</i> because it is not fit for feeding to the fire. Hence it is forbidden for one to make it into [something] like a spit to roast meat on it. And likewise anything that is similar to this.",
            "We may take wood that is leaning on the sides of a hut and feed a fire with it. But we may not bring it from the field, even it it was gathered there from the eve [of the holiday]. But one may gather [wood] in the field in front of him and kindle [it] there. And we may bring from [wood] that was gathered in a private domain—and even if it was encircled not for the purpose of residence. And that is so long as it has a boundary and it be within the Shabbat perimeter. But if it lacks one of all these [things], it is surely <i>muktseh</i>.",
            "Even though reed leaves and grape leaves were gathered in an enclosure—since the wind scatters them—they are as if [already] scattered, and forbidden. But if he placed a heavy vessel on top of them from the eve of the holiday, they are surely prepared.",
            "[In a case of] an animal that died on a holiday: If it was in danger [of death] from the eve of the holiday, one may surely cut it up for the dogs. But if not—since his mind was not on it—this is surely <i>muktseh</i>, and he may not move it from its place. One may not move a consecrated animal that has died or priestly tithe that has become impure from its place.",
            "It is forbidden to give water or place food in front of fish, fowl or wild animals on a holiday, lest one come to take from them. And anything that is forbidden to eat or use on a holiday because it is <i>muktseh</i> is forbidden to move [as well].",
            "[In a case of] one who gathers dirt from the eve of a holiday: If he specified a corner in his courtyard for it, it is prepared; and it is permissible to move it and to do all of his needs with it. And likewise, ash that has been burnt from the eve of the holiday is [considered] prepared. And it is [also] permissible to move it if it was burnt on the holiday, so long as it is hot [enough] in order to roast an egg with it—as it is still [then considered] fire. But if not, it is forbidden to move it, because it is [considered] <i>nolad</i>. [If] one had stuck a spade from the eve of the holiday [into the ground] and [then] removed it on the holiday—and [in doing so,] brought up dirt: If that dirt was loose, he may surely cover with it and move it. But if he brought up a clod of dirt, this one may surely not pound it [to break it up] on the holiday."

            "One who had prepared dirt or prepared ash—such that it is permissible to move it—such a one may surely slaughter a wild animal or a fowl and cover their blood. But if he does not have prepared dirt or ash that is fit to move—such a one may certainly not slaughter [them]. However, if he transgressed and slaughtered [them], he may not cover their blood until the evening. And likewise [regarding] a creature [about which there is a] doubt whether it is [classified as] a wild animal or a domesticated animal—we do not slaughter it on the holiday. But if one slaughtered it, we do not cover its blood until the evening—even if he had dirt prepared or ash—lest the onlooker say, \"It is a definitely a wild animal, and that is why he covered its blood on a holiday\"; so the onlooker will come to permit [that species'] forbidden fat (carried by domesticated animals).",
            "And likewise may one who slaughtered a wild animal or fowl from the eve of a holiday not cover their blood on the holiday. [If] he slaughtered a domesticated animal, a wild animal and a fowl on a holiday and their blood mixed together, he should not cover it until the evening. However if he has dirt prepared or ash and can cover all of it with one shovelful, such a one should surely cover it.",
            "It is permissible for one who slaughters an animal on a holiday to pull out wool with his hand from the place of the slaughter [on the neck]. And [this is] so long as he does not move it from its place but leaves it there entangled with the rest of the wool of the neck. But one should not pluck [the feathers of] a fowl, because that is its customary way; and it would come out that he is detaching on a holiday (according to its legal definition—as opposed to pulling out sheep's wool which does not meet that definition's condition that it be in its customary way).",
            "One who flays the hide of an animal on a holiday may not salt it—as it comes out that he is doing a forbidden type of work, not for the sake of eating. But he may place it in front of a place of trampling, in order that [people] will trample it and it will not go bad. And [the Sages] only permitted this because of the joy of the holiday—such that one will not prevent himself from slaughtering (out of concern for what will happen to the hide). But it is permissible to salt roast meat on top of its hide; and we act craftily about this thing. How is that? One may salt a little meat from here and a little meat from there until he salts all of the hide.",
            "To what are these words applicable? To roast meat that does not require much salt. But it is forbidden to salt the meat on the hide for a stew (since it requires much salt). And likewise do we not salt the forbidden fats, nor flip them over, nor spread them in the wind on top of poles—because they are not fit [for Israelites] to eat.",
            "One who flays an animal may not 'foot' it on a holiday. How does [one] 'foot?' This is one who extracts all of the meat through one foot, so that he may remove the whole hide intact, and not torn. [The prohibition is] because the toil in this [type of] flaying is a great toil, and there is no need for it for the festival. And it is likewise forbidden to make a handle in the meat—and that is when he does it with a knife, such that he not do it in the way that he does it on [weekdays]. But it is permissible to make a sign in the meat.",

            "It is permissible to knead a large dough on a holiday. But one who kneads from the eve of a holiday may not separate the <i>challah</i>-tithe on a holiday. However if he kneaded it on the holiday, he separates the <i>challah</i>-tithe from it and gives it to a priest (kohen). And if the dough is impure or the <i>challah</i>-tithe became impure, he may not cook the <i>challah</i>-tithe—since we may only cook on a holiday in order to eat, and this is earmarked for burning. And we may likewise not burn it on a holiday—since on a holiday we may not burn consecrated foods that became impure. [This is] because the burning of consecrated foods that became impure is a positive commandment, as it is stated (Leviticus 7:19), \"it shall be burnt in fire\"; whereas [not] doing forbidden work that is not for the sake of eating and that which is similar to [it] is a positive commandment and a negative commandment—and a positive commandment does not override [one that is both] a negative and a positive [commandment].",

He puts down his  <i>eruv tavshilin</i> from Thursday and says, \"If today is the holiday and tomorrow is [a weekday], then I will cook and bake tomorrow for Shabbat and I have no need for [an <i>eruv tavshilin</i>]; but if today is [a weekday] and tomorrow is the holiday—with this <i>eruv</i> is it permitted for me to bake and to cook on the morrow from the holiday for Shabbat.\"",

And on the second day, he goes back and says, \"If today is a holiday, my words today lack substance; but if today is a [weekday], let this be priestly tithe for that,\" and he reads a name over  it and leaves it—in the way he did on the first [day].

But today, when the residents of the Land of Israel rely upon the calculation and sanctify [the month, based] upon it—the second day holiday is not to avoid doubt, but rather only a custom.",

As it is stated (Deuteronomy 16:14), \"And you shall rejoice in your holiday, etc.\" Even though the joy that is mentioned here is [referring to] peace offerings—as we explain in the Laws of the Festival Offering—included in that joy is for him, his children and the members of his household to rejoice—everyone according to what is fit for him.",

While eating and drinking, one must feed the stranger, the orphan, the widow, and other poor unfortunates. Anyone, however, who locks the doors of his courtyard and eats and drinks along with his wife and children, without giving anything to eat and drink to the poor and the desperate, does not observe a religious celebration but indulges in the celebration of his stomach. And about such is it stated (Hosea 9:4), \"their sacrifices are like the bread of mourners, all who eat it will be contaminated; for their bread is for their own appetites.\" Such joy is a disgrace for them, as it is stated (Malakhi 2:3), \"I will spread dung on your faces, the dung of your festivals.\"",

For drunkenness, much joking and ligh-headedness are not joy, but rather wildness and foolishness. And we were not commanded about wildness and foolishness, but rather about joy that has service to the Maker of everything. As it is stated (Deuteronomy 28:47), \"because you did not serve the Lord your God with joy and with a good heart, from abundance of all.\" Thus you have learned that the service is to be with joy.

If a [gentile shepherd] was hired by the week, was hired by the month, was hired by the year, or was hired by the septennial period, we may assist them; and we may [likewise] hire a guardian to move the sheep around from [one] place to [another], so that they will fertilize all of the field. We may remove manure in the courtyard to the sides. But if the courtyard becomes like a barn, we may [even] move it out to the dumping ground.",
            "[In a case of] one who evens out the ground: If he intended to fix the place so that he could put a threshing floor of grain there or to thresh on it, it is permissible; but if he intended [it] for working the ground, it is forbidden. And likewise one who gathers wood from his field: If it is for need of the wood, it is permissible; but if it is to improve the ground, it is forbidden. And likewise one who opens [a channel of] water into the garden: If he intended that the fish should enter (and be caught), it is permissible; but if he intended to water the land, it is forbidden. And likewise one who cuts fronds from the palm tree: If he intended to feed [his] animal, it is permissible; but if he intended [it] for working the tree, it is forbidden. And to which he [actually] intended  is noticeable from his actions it .",
            "We may make an oven or a stove that it is possible will dry, so that one can bake with it on the festival; but if not, we may not make them. And in either case, we may build the extra plaster on top of the earthenware oven and on the stove. And we may make a bed frame. And we may cut grooves into millstones, open an eyehole in a mill, and stand the mill up and build a channel of water for it.",
            "We may seal barrels with tar so that the wine will not go bad. And we may seal a bottle with tar because there is no toil involved with it. And we may seal a barrel of beer so that it will not go bad. And we may cover drying fruits with straw, so that they will not be ruined. And we may soften clothes with the hands, since it is the work of an amateur. But we may not tie sleeves because it is the work of a craftsman. And likewise anything that is similar to this.",
            "We may trim the nails of a mill horse; and we may build a trough for an animal. And it is permissible to cut the nails of the horse one rides upon; and to comb it to beautify it. But we may not mate animals on a festival. However we may let blood from an animal; and we do not withhold any medical treatment from it. It is permissible for a person to eat foods or drink drinks on a festival that are not the food of healthy people, but rather for healing.",
            "We may not move [items] from [one] courtyard to [another] on a festival—neither from an ugly one to a nice one, nor from a nice one to an ugly one. But we may move [them] from [one] house to [another] in the same courtyard. And we may bring vessels [home] from the house of a craftsman that are for the needs of the festival—such as pillows, bedspreads and cups. But we may not bring vessels [home] that are not for the needs of the festival—like a plow from the smith or wool from the dye workshop. However if the craftsman does not have what to eat, he may give him his wage and leave [the items] with him. But if he does not trust [the craftsman], he may leave them in a house adjacent to him. However if he is concerned about them lest they be stolen, he may move them to another courtyard. But he may not bring [them] to his home, except in private.",
            "It is forbidden to do work on the eve of holidays from the time of the afternoon prayers and onward, like on the eve of Shabbat. And anyone who does work on it will never see a sign of blessing [from it]. And we scold him and we stop him against his will. But we do not strike him with (rabbinic) lashes for rebellion; and it is not necessary to say that we do not excommunicate him. [That is] except for the eve of Passover after midday. For we excommunicate one who does work on it after midday. And it is not necessary to say that we that we strike him with lashes for rebellion, if they did not excommunicate him. For the fourteenth of Nissan is not like other holiday eves, as the holiday offering and the slaughter of the [Passover] sacrifice [happens] on it.",
            "Hence the fourteenth of Nissan is forbidden regarding the doing of work by the words of the Scribes (rabbinically), like the intermediate days of a festival. However it is less stringent than the intermediate days of a festival. And it is only forbidden regarding work from half of the day and onward—which is the time of the slaughter. But from sunrise until midday is dependent on [local] custom: In a place where they are accustomed to do [work], we may do [it]; in a place where they are not accustomed to do [work], we may not do [it].",
            "But even in a place where they are accustomed to do [work], one should not begin to do new work on the fourteenth, even though he is able to finish it before midday. [This is] except for three jobs only that may be begun in a place where they are accustomed to do [work]. And they may be done until midday. And these are them: Tailors; barbers; and launderers. But [with] other jobs, it is [only] if one began them before the fourteenth that that he may finish them until midday. For people do not have a great need for other jobs.",
            "One who goes from a place where they do [work] to a place where they do not do [it] should not do [work] in the town [so as not to cause] disagreement. But the may do [it] in a wilderness [adjacent to it]. However one who goes from a place where they not do [work] to a place where they do [it] should not do [work at all]. We place upon one [both] the stringincies of the place from which one came and the stringincies of the place to which one went. And nevertheless he should not appear as if he is idle on account of the prohibition. [That is because] one should never deviate [from local custom, so as not to cause] disagreement. And likewise one who has in mind to return to his place should act like the people of his place—whether to be lenient or to be stringent. And this is so long as he does not appear as one who [is acting differently than the custom of place he is in] in front of the people of the place [so as not to cause] disagreement.",
            "We may take and bring vessels from the house of a craftsman on the fourteenth after midday, even though they are not for the needs of the festival. And we may rake manure from under the feet of animals and remove it to the dumping ground. And we may set up coops for chickens. [In a case of] a chicken that sat on eggs three days or more and [then] died: We may place another [chicken] in its place on the fourteenth so that the eggs will not go bad. But we do not place [it there] on the festival. However if it fled on the festival from on top of the eggs, we may put it back in its place.",
