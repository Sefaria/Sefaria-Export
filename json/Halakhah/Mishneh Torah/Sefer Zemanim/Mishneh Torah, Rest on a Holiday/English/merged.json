            "The six days on which the Torah forbade work are the first and seventh days of Pesach, the first and eighth days of the festival of Sukkot, the festival of Shavuot, and the first day of the seventh month.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., Rosh HaShanah, the first of Tishrei, which is the seventh month when counting from Nisan. Significantly, the name Rosh HaShanah is not mentioned in the Torah at all.</i> They are referred to as holidays.<br>The [obligation to] rest is the same on all these days; it is forbidden to perform all types of servile labor,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our interpretation of the words מלאכת עבודה as \"servile labor\" is based on the gloss of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> on Halachah 5. There he interprets it as referring to tasks that a person would hire a servant to do rather than perform himself.<br>In his commentary on the Torah (Leviticus 23:7 , the Ramban explains that with the expression \"servile labor,\" the Torah intends to distinguish between work performed to prepare food (which he terms \"gratifying labor\") and the other forms of labor. According to the Ramban, the Torah never forbade the performance of the activities included in the labors necessary for the preparation of food. Any restrictions placed on them are Rabbinic in nature.<br>The Ramban's conception is also reflected in the statements of Rashi (<i>Beitzah</i> 12a), who interprets the Talmud's ruling (see Halachah 4), \"Since [these labors] were permitted for the sake [of preparing food], they are permitted even when [they are performed] without such an intent,\" as meaning that, according to the Torah, there is no prohibition against performing these labors at all.<br><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Beitzah, loc. cit.</i>) differs and explains that for the performance of a labor to be allowed by the Torah, it must in some way contribute to the pleasure of the holiday. Otherwise, it is forbidden. According to this conception, all the thirty-nine labors forbidden on the Sabbath are prohibited on the holidays as well. There is, however, special dispensation to perform these labors when doing so will increase our holiday pleasure.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> interprets the Rambam's citation of the expression \"servile labor\" as an indication that he follows the perspective shared by Rashi and the Ramban. Other authorities (e.g., the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> and the <i>Pri Chadash</i>) do not agree with the <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> interpretation and explain that the Rambam favors the other position. [See also the <i>Chemdat Yisrael</i>, who explains that the Rambam's statements in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 328) do not concur with the <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> conception of the Rambam's position.] Note the treatment of this subject in the <i>Or Sameach</i> and in <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XI. (See also the notes on Halachah 4.)</i> with the exception of those labors necessary for [the preparation of] food, as [implied by Exodus 12:16]: \"Only that [labor] from which all souls will eat [may you perform].\"",
            "Anyone who rests from \"servile labor\" on one of these days fulfills a positive commandment,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandments 159-160, 162-163, 166-167) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvot 297, 300, 308, 310, 318, 321) include these six in the reckoning of the Torah's 613 mitzvot.</i> for [the Torah] describes them as Sabbaths - i.e., days of rest.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 159), which in addition to the term <i>shabbaton</i>, \"day of rest,\" also mentions the phrase <i>mikra kodesh</i>, \"holy convocation,\" as indicating that one is commanded to sanctify the day by ceasing to perform labor.</i><br>Whoever performs a labor that is not for the sake of [the preparation of] food on one of these days - e.g., he builds, destroys, weaves, or the like<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., any of the 28 of the 39 labors forbidden on the Sabbath that do not involve the preparation of food. (See <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 7:1.)</i> - negates [the performance of] a positive commandment and violates a negative commandment<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandments 323-326, 328-329) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvot 298, 301, 309, 311, 319 and 323) include these six in the reckoning of the Torah's 613 mitzvot.</i>, as [Leviticus 23:7] states: \"You shall not perform any servile labor,\" and [Exodus 12:6] states: \"You shall not perform any work on them.\"<br>If a person performs [a forbidden labor when observed] by witnesses and [after] receiving a warning, the Torah prescribes that he receive lashes [as punishment].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the minimum punishment given for the violation of a negative commandment that involves a deed.</i>",
            "When a person performs several forbidden labors on a holiday after being warned once - e.g., he sows, builds, destroys, and weaves - after receiving a single warning,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Pesachim</i> 48a, moreover, states that even if a person is given separate warnings for each forbidden labor, each activity is not considered to be a separate violation.</i> he receives only a single [set of] lashes. There is a distinction between the categories of forbidden labor on the Sabbath, but there is no such distinction on the holidays.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam is referring to the ruling (<i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 7:7-8) that requires a person who performs activities that fall into two different categories of forbidden labor on the Sabbath to bring two different sin offerings. The performance of an activity from each category of forbidden labor is considered to be a separate violation. Such a distinction does not apply with regard to the performance of forbidden labors on the holidays.</i>",
            "A person may be [punished by] lashes for performing on a holiday any labor for which he is liable on the Sabbath, if it is not necessary for the preparation of food, with the exception of the transfer of articles from one domain to another and the kindling of a fire.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains the Rambam's position as follows: All the labors forbidden on the Sabbath that involve preparation of food are not prohibited on the holidays. In addition, there are two forbidden labors, kindling a flame and transferring articles, which do not necessarily involve the preparation of food. Nevertheless, since they are sometimes necessary for the preparation of food, they are permitted without any restriction.<br>Other authorities (e.g., <i>Pri Chadash, Pri Megadim</i>) interpret the Rambam's statements as meaning that even the forbidden labors involved with the preparation of food are permitted only for that purpose. If, however, one performs one of these labors for other reasons - e.g., one cooks food solely to give to animals - one is liable. Moreover, if one performs a forbidden labor that is not usually involved in the preparation of food for the purpose of preparing food, one is liable.<br>There is a third interpretation, that of the <i>Mabit</i>. (In his Responsum 124, however, he follows the second view.) According to the view he expresses in <i>Kiryat Sefer</i>, even if one performs a forbidden labor (that is not usually involved in the preparation of food) for the purpose of preparing food, one is not liable. As proof, he cites the example of making cheese, an act that the Rambam (<i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 10:13) considers a derivative of the forbidden labor of building. Nevertheless, making cheese on a holiday is not considered a violation of a forbidden labor and is forbidden only as a <i>sh'vut</i>.</i><br>[With regard to these two forbidden labors, an exception is made.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reason for these two exceptions is as follows: Both are often involved in the preparation of food. Alternatively, the transfer of articles is considered \"an inferior labor\" (<i>Tosafot, Beitzah</i> 12a), and Exodus 35:3: \"Do not kindle fire... on the Sabbath day,\" is interpreted also as an exclusion, indicating that kindling fire is forbidden on the Sabbath, but not on holidays.</i>] Since it is permitted to transfer articles for the sake of [the preparation of] food [on holidays], [this activity] was permitted even when it is not necessary for [the preparation of] food. Therefore, it is permitted to transfer an infant, a Torah scroll, a key, or the like from one domain to another. Similarly, it is permitted to kindle a fire, even though it is not for the purpose of [the preparation of] food.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned in the notes on Halachah 1, <i>Tosafot</i> requires that the activity bring a person some pleasure. This view is also reflected in the Ra'avad's gloss.</i><br>With regard to the other forbidden labors, [the following principles apply:] Whenever the activity is necessary for [the preparation of] food - e.g., slaughter, baking, kneading, or the like - it is permitted. If it is not necessary for [the preparation of] food - e.g., writing, weaving, building, and the like - it is forbidden.",
            "Whenever it is possible to perform a labor on the day prior to the holiday without causing any loss or inadequacy, our Sages forbade<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> quotes the Ra'avad as stating that this prohibition has its source in the Torah itself. Indeed, the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Beitzah</i> 1:10) and certain passages in the Babylonian Talmud (<i>Shabbat</i> 95a; <i>Chaggigah</i> 18a) support this view. Nevertheless, most later authorities accept the Rambam's view that the prohibition is Rabbinic in origin.</i> performing such a labor on the holiday itself, even if it is performed for the sake of [the preparation of] food.<br>Why was this forbidden? This was a decree [instituted], lest a person leave for the holiday all the labors that he could have performed before the holiday, and thus spend the entire holiday performing those labors. Thus, he will be prevented from rejoicing on the holidays and will not have the opportunity to [take pleasure in] eating and drinking.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad gives a different rationale: that the extra effort involved in the performance of these activities is out of place on a holiday.</i>",
            "For this very reason, [our Sages] did not forbid transferring articles on a holiday, although the transfer of all [articles] is a task that could be performed before the holiday.<br>Why was this not forbidden? To increase our festive joy, so that a person can send and bring anything he desires, and thus fulfill his wants, and not feel like someone whose hands are tied.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad differs with the extent of the leniency granted by the Rambam, restricting it to sending containers and food. He also differs regarding the rationale, explaining that sending the articles on the holiday is a greater expression of honor and respect. The Rambam's ruling is quoted by the later authorities.</i> With regard to other labors that are possible to be performed on the day before the holiday, since they involve [prolonged] activity, they should not be performed on a holiday.",
            "What is implied? On a holiday, we do not harvest, thresh, winnow, separate, or grind grain, nor do we sift [flour].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">All these labors, although necessary for the preparation of food, are not intended for the preparation of a particular cooked dish or loaf of bread. Rather, one performs these activities for several days in advance. Therefore, our Sages desired that these activities should not be performed on the festival itself.<br>It must be noted that these forbidden labors are specifically mentioned in the passage from the Jerusalem Talmud cited above, which states that the prohibition against performing such activities stems from the Torah itself.</i> For all these and any similar activities can be performed on the day prior to the holiday without causing any loss or inadequacy.",
            "We may, however, knead, bake, slaughter, and cook on a holiday, since if these activities had been performed on the previous day, the taste would be adversely affected. For warm bread or food that is cooked today does not [taste] the same as bread or food that was cooked the day before. Similarly, meat that is slaughtered today does not [taste] the same as meat slaughtered on the previous day. The same rules apply in all analogous situations.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's rationale depends on the concept of freshness. Food that is not fresh loses a certain amount of its flavor. The Ra'avad questions this principle, noting that produce harvested today is also fresher and tastier than produce harvested on the day before. Several authorities offer different observations to counter the Ra'avad's thesis.</i><br>Similarly, when it would be detrimental for subsidiary activities [involved in the preparation] of food to be performed on the day [before the holiday] - e.g., grinding spices and the like - they may be performed on the holiday.",
            "It is forbidden to bake or cook food on a holiday [that one intends] to eat during the week,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Tz'ror HaChayim</i>, which mentions various opinions concerning whether this prohibition has its origin in the Torah itself or in Rabbinic decree. In conclusion, he favors the opinion that the prohibition is Scriptural in origin. (See also Halachah 15.) The doubt exists only with regard to the Rambam's position. <i>Tosafot</i> and others maintain that the prohibition is Scriptural in origin (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 503:1).</i> because work necessary for [the preparation of] food was permitted solely so that pleasure could be derived from it on a holiday. If, however, one [cooks food] to be eaten on the holiday, and there is food left over, the remainder may be eaten during the week.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If, however, one cooked food on a holiday with the intent of eating it on the following day, many authorities (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 503:13) allow the food to be eaten after the holiday. (See also Halachah 11 and notes.)</i>",
            "A woman may fill a pot with meat although she needs only one piece.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reason is that the meat is tastier when cooked with many pieces together (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i> A baker may fill an entire drum with water [to boil] although he needs only one jug.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This gives us a second rationale for the leniency of preparing a larger quantity of food than one needs immediately: when, as in the instance mentioned, there is no extra work involved in preparing a large quantity as compared to a small quantity. If either of these two rationales applies, leniency may be taken and the extra amount prepared.<br>Once, however, the water is left to boil, an additional amount may not be added (Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 103:2).</i> And a woman may bake an entire oven full of bread although she needs only a single loaf, for when there is a large quantity of bread in an an oven, it bakes better.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbenu Yonah explains that this applied in Talmudic times, when the ovens were small. In such an instance, a large number of loaves were placed in the oven at the same time, and it took longer for them to bake, producing a better flavor. If, as was the case with regard to the larger ovens used in the medieval period, adding to the number of loaves does not increase the flavor, it is forbidden to do so. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 507:6.)</i><br>[Similarly,] a person may salt several pieces of meat<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The salting is intended to drain off the blood so that it is permitted to cook the meat, as stated in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i>, Chapter 6.</i> although he only needs one piece.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here, also, the leniency is granted because there is no additional difficulty in salting the other pieces. Alternatively, the leniency is allowed so that the remainder of the meat will not spoil. Compare to Chapter 3, Halachah 4.</i> The same applies in all similar situations.",
            "When a person cooks or bakes on a holiday with the intent of eating the food on that day, or he has invited guests and they did not come, and cooked food or bread remains, [the food] is permitted to be eaten on the following day, whether it is a weekday or the Sabbath,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As explained in Chapter 6, just as it is forbidden to prepare food on a holiday for a weekday that follows, our Sages forbade preparing food on a holiday for a Sabbath that follows directly after the holiday, or for the second day of the holiday itself. Nevertheless, as explained in that chapter, our Sages did provide the leniency of establishing an <i>eruv tavshilin</i>.</i> provided one does not act with guile.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., invite guests although he knows that they will not come, or prepare a large quantity of food when one knows that one will be unable to eat it all, and then use the remainder for the following day.<br><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 503:7 notes that it has become common practice to cook a meal for the night of the second day of a holiday on the afternoon of the first day, relying on the leniency that one will taste some of the food. He criticizes this practice and explains that women should be taught to discontinue it and prepare the food before the commencement of the holiday.</i><br>If, however, one acts with guile, he<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He and the members of his family may not partake of it; other Jews, however, are not restricted (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 527:79).</i> is forbidden [to partake of the food], even on a Sabbath that follows the holiday. For greater stringency is shown with one who acts with guile than with one who violates the prohibition [against preparing food for the following day on a holiday] intentionally.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The rationale for this stringency is that the example shown by a person with guile might be copied by others, while few will emulate brazen transgression. Moreover, even with regard to the person himself, if he were not punished, a person who acts with guile would never really appreciate the seriousness of his transgression, and would repeat it. When, however, a person willfully violates the Sages' decree, he will not be able to rationalize his conduct. Hence, there is the possibility he will recognize his error (Rashi, <i>Beitzah</i> 17b; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 527:78).</i>",
            "A person who has an animal that is dangerously ill<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We are speaking about an instance where the person has already eaten, and hence would not ordinarily consider slaughtering the animal. Nevertheless, because it is dangerously ill, he fears that it will die before the conclusion of the holiday. Our Sages were fearful that he would slaughter the animal regardless, rather than suffer the loss of having it die without ritual slaughter. They therefore established directives that would allow slaughter in most instances (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>; Rashi, <i>Beitzah</i> 25a). (See also Chapter 6, Halachah 10.)</i> should not slaughter it on a holiday unless he knows that he will be able to eat<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although the Rambam's wording might be interpreted as indicating that it is necessary to eat at least this amount of meat, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and the later halachic authorities (<i>Shulchan Aruch Harav</i> 498:11; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 498:34) explain that it is not necessary to partake of the meat on the holiday.</i> [at least] an olive-sized [portion] of roasted meat before the holiday is completed. [In this way,] he will not be slaughtering [an animal] on a holiday to partake of its meat on an ordinary day. The same principles apply in other similar situations.",
            "We may not bake and cook on a holiday in order to feed gentiles<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 512:2, which states that a Jew who worships false gods or desecrates the Sabbath is considered like a gentile in this regard.</i> or dogs, as [indicated by Exodus 12:16]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's citation of a verse from the Torah as a proof-text for this prohibition is interpreted as an indication that he follows the position (see the notes on Halachot 1 and 4) that the labors necessary to prepare food are forbidden by the Torah on the holiday unless one is preparing food for a Jew. As mentioned, others consider the prohibitions to be Rabbinic in origin.</i> \"This alone is permitted for you\" - i.e., [the leniency is] \"for you\" and not for gentiles, \"for you\" and not for dogs.<br>For this reason, it is permitted to invite a gentile [to share one's meal] on the Sabbath, but not on a holiday, lest one add [more food] for him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This rationale is not applicable on the Sabbath, for then it is not permitted to cook at all.</i> If, however, a gentile comes [to a Jewish household on a holiday] on his own initiative, he may eat [the food] they eat together with them, for it has already been prepared.",
            "On a holiday, it is permissible to slaughter an animal that is owned partially by a Jew and partially by a gentile. [This is permitted although the gentile benefits,] because it is impossible [for the Jew] to partake of an olive-sized portion [of the meat belonging to him] without slaughtering the animal.<br>When, by contrast, dough is owned partially by a Jew and partially by a gentile, it is forbidden to bake it [on a holiday], because the dough can be divided.<br>[The following rule applies when] the soldiers [of a gentile army] give flour to a Jew and request that he bake them bread on a holiday: If they do not object to giving some of the bread to a baby, it is permitted for him to bake on the holiday. For every loaf of bread is fit to be given to the baby.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., as long as a portion of the loaf can be given to a baby, one is not cooking solely for the gentiles.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> notes that many (e.g., <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 512) have objected to the Rambam's ruling, based on <i>Beitzah</i> 21a, which appears to establish a correlation between the permission to bake bread for these soldiers and the laws mentioned in the previous halachah regarding inviting gentiles as guests. It appears from that passage that the Sages who forbid inviting guests also forbid baking bread for the soldiers, for the same principle is involved: one is cooking additional food for a gentile.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, however, explains that there is no contradiction and that the two views can be reconciled. The Jew can be considered to be baking for the sake of the child. For if he did not bake for the soldiers, they would not allow him to bake for the child.<br>The <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> amplifies the difference between the two situations, explaining that because the person is not baking solely for the gentiles, the prohibition against doing so is merely Rabbinic in origin and can be waived with regard to baking for a gentile army, since the person could suffer substantial financial loss if he refused. In contrast, when inviting guests, one does so on one's own volition, with no loss involved.<br>As emphasized by <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 512:6, this leniency was granted only in this situation, because of the risk of confrontation with the military authorities. One should not apply it to other circumstances. (See also <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 512:15.)</i><br>When the shepherds also eat from the loaves they give to the dogs, these loaves may be baked on a holiday.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here also, since one is not baking solely for the dogs, one may bake the bread on a holiday. Although one is adding to the loaf one is baking for the dogs, since it would be possible to satisfy them by giving them meat, it appears that the shepherds are baking the loaf because they want to partake of it themselves (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).<br>As emphasized by the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 512:22, this leniency applies even when one has no other food immediately available for the dogs.</i>",
            "A person who cooks on a holiday for gentiles, for an animal or to keep for a weekday should not be given lashes, because if guests came, the cooked food would be fit to serve them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's wording appears to indicate that although the activity is forbidden by the Torah, punishment is not given, because it is possible that his activity might ultimately serve a permitted purpose.</i> If a person prepares [food] for himself and [food] remains, he is permitted to give it to a gentile or to an animal.",
            "Bathing and anointing<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that anointing oneself is mentioned because it is often necessary to heat oil used to anoint oneself. Anointing oneself with cold oil for pleasure is permitted even on the Sabbath (<i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 21:23).</i> oneself are considered in the general category of eating and drinking.

On holidays, although the rules are more lenient, certain restrictions remain. For a discussion concerning the laws of ritual immersion on a holiday, see the notes on <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 23:8.</i><br>When water was heated before the commencement of a holiday, one may wash one's entire body with it on the holiday.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Based on the position of <i>Tosafot</i> mentioned previously, the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 511:2) forbids washing one's entire body on a holiday as a safeguard, even when the water was heated before the commencement of the holiday. The subsequent Ashkenazic authorities accepted the Ramah's ruling, but were slightly more lenient and allowed washing one's entire body, portion by portion.

Rather, he \"set them aside\" to be used in the future.<br>As the Rambam explains in the following halachah, on the Sabbath it is not necessary to have a specific intention to use an object on the Sabbath. As long as there is no reason that prevents one from using it on that day - e.g., the prohibitions mentioned in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i>, Chapters 25 and 26 - one may carry it on the Sabbath.</i><br><i>Muktzeh</i> is forbidden on a holiday, but permitted on the Sabbath. [The rationale is] since the [restrictions pertaining to] the holidays are more lenient than those of the Sabbath, [our Sages] forbade <i>muktzeh</i>, lest one come to treat the holidays with disrespect.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad differs and states that there are authorities who maintain that articles that are <i>muktzeh</i> are permitted to be carried on holidays.

Nevertheless, our Sages decreed that foods and utensils that come in contact with this impure liquid should be considered impure.<br>The Rambam explains that since the impurity is Rabbinic in origin, our Sages did not forbid immersing this utensil on a holiday so that it could be used in a state of purity. Rabbi Mordechai HaCohen and the Rashba note that <i>Beitzah, loc. cit.</i>, offers a different rationale, and they question why the Rambam deviates from the source.

In such a situation, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 539:4) rules that one may sell the goods during Chol HaMo'ed, provided that he uses a portion of the profit he makes to enhance his celebration of the festival. Moreover, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> restricts this license to a person of moderate means.

In places where it is not customary to perform labor, one may not.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 468:3) states that the Ashkenazic custom is not to perform labor before noon on this day.

            "Even in a place where it is customary to perform labor, one should not begin the performance of a task on the fourteenth [of Nisan], even though one could complete it before noon.<br>There are, however, three exceptions to this principle: tailors, barbers, and launderers. With regard to other craftsmen, if they began before the fourteenth, they may finish before noon.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's ruling is based on his interpretation of the Mishnah (<i>Pesachim</i> 4:7) as applying in a place where it is customary to perform labor on the fourteenth. Others (the Ra'avad and Rabbenu Asher) interpret the Mishnah as applying in a place where it is customary not to perform labor on the fourteenth.<br>This interpretation leads to a more lenient ruling: In a place where it is customary to perform labor, all labor may be performed on the fourteenth of Nisan. In a place where it is not customary to perform labor, any labor that was begun before the fourteenth and is intended for the sake of the holiday may be completed before dawn. The three labors mentioned may be begun on the fourteenth of Nisan if they are performed for the sake of the holiday, provided they can be completed before noon. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 468:5) quotes the Rambam's ruling, while the Ramah follows the more lenient approach.</i> [The rationale for this distinction is that] the people at large do not have a great need for other labors [for the sake of the holiday].",

If he does not intend to return, he is not bound by the stringencies observed there (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 468:9).</i> To a person [who journeys], we apply the stringencies observed in the place that he left and those observed in the place where he arrives.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a general principle applying not only on the fourteenth of Nisan, but to the entire year, provided the person intends to settle permanently in the city.<br>This principle does not, however, apply in most contemporary Jewish communities, because they were settled by people with different customs, and a fixed practice was never adopted for the city at large. Accordingly, in such an instance, a person should follow the customs of his ancestral home (<i>Orach Mishpat</i>, Responsum 17).</i><br>Even though [he is prohibited to perform work], he should not make it appear to [the local people] that he is idle because of a prohibition.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are many idle people in the public thoroughfare who do not perform labor.

He should not, however, be seen [conducting himself contrary to the local custom] by the inhabitants of the place where he is located, lest strife arise.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These are also principles whose scope extends beyond the particular laws of the fourteenth of Nisan (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 468:14; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 468:22). <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> goes further and explains that if it is impossible for the person not to perform work without calling attention to his actions, he should perform the work, because maintaining peaceful social relations overrides the importance of preserving the customs of one's native land.</i>",
