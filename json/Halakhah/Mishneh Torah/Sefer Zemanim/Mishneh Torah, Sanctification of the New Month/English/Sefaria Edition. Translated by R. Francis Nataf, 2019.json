            "The months of the year are lunar months, as it is stated (Numbers 28:14), \"the monthly burnt-offering for each new moon\"; and it is [also] stated (Exodus 12:2), \"This month shall be for you the beginning of the months.\" Thus did the Sages say: The Holy One, blessed be He, showed Moshe a likeness of the moon in a prophetic vision and said to him, \"See [when] it is like this, and sanctify it (as the beginning of the month).\" But the years that we calculate are solar years, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 16:1), \"Guard the month of the Spring.\"",

            "If the moon appears on the night of the thirtieth day, the past month has twenty-nine days and is called defective month. If the moon does not appear on the night of the thirtieth day, the past month has thirty days and is called intercalated month or full month. And a moon that is seen on the night of the thirtieth is what is called a moon that is seen in its time. And if it is seen on the night of the thirty-first and it is not seen on the night of the thirtieth, it is what is called a moon that is seen on the night of its intercalation.",

            "It is a positive commandment from the Torah upon the court to calculate and know if the [new] moon was seen or was not seen; and they should question the witnesses [to ascertain this] until they sanctify the [new] month. And they must send and inform the rest of the people which day is Rosh Chodesh (the first day of month), so that they would know which days are the holidays – as it is stated (Leviticus 23:2), \"which you shall proclaim as holy occasions\"; and it [also] states (Exodus 13:10), \"And you shall keep this statute at its appointed time.\" ",
            "The new moon days and the leap years are computed and proclaimed only in Eretz Yisrael, as it is written: \"Out of Zion shall go forth instruction, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem\" (Isaiah 2:3). If, however, a great scholar was ordained in Eretz Yisrael and then emigrated to another country without leaving in Eretz Yisrael anyone equal to him in learning, he is permitted to compute and proclaim the new moon days and leap years outside the Land of Israel. And if he knows that in the Land of Israel [another] man became great like him – and it is not necessary to say, greater than him – it is surely forbidden for him to set and intercalate the month outside the Land. And if he did transgress and set it and intercalate it, he did not do anything (it is not effective)."

            "Two trustworthy men only are qualified to testify concerning the new moon, men that are fit to bear witness in any legal case. Women and slaves, however, are not eligible to bear witness, and their testimony is not accepted. A father and son that saw the moon go to court to testify. Not because testimony of the month is valid with relatives; but rather so that if one of them is found to be disqualified for being a thief or that which is similar to it from the other disqualifications, the second can join with another and they will [then] testify. And anyone who is disqualified from testimony by the words of the Scribes – even though he is fit according to the Torah – is disqualified from testimony of the month. ",

[If] one said \"I saw it with my eyes at a height of about two floors\" and the second said \"at about a height of three floors\" – they join up [to form valid testimony. If] one says, \"about three floors\" and the second says \"about five floors\" – they do not join up. But one of them joins up with a second that testifies like him or with a single floor between them. ",
            "If the witnesses said: \"We noticed the moon unintentionally, but failed to see it again when we looked and wanted to see it in order to bear witness,\" their testimony is not sufficient, and the court does not sanctify the new moon on the strength of it, owing to the suspicion that combined clouds produced the illusion of a moon and then disappeared. [If] the witnesses said, \"We saw it on the twenty-ninth day of the month in the morning in the East before the sun arose and we saw it in the evening in the West on the night of the thirtieth\" – they are believed and we sanctify [it] based on this sighting. For they surely saw it in its time. But we have no concern about the sighting that they said they saw in the morning. For we are not responsible for the morning sighting; and it is known that it was the clouds that gathered and appeared to them like the moon. And likewise if they saw it in its time, but it was not seen on the night of its intercalation (the following night) – they are believed. For we are only responsible for the sighting of the thirtieth night alone. ",

            "Thereupon, when the evidence has been sustained, the chief justice of the court proclaims <i>Mekuddash!</i> [the new moon is sanctified], and after him all the people present respond: <i>Mekuddash! Mekuddash!</i> Only a court of three may carry out the calculation and the sanctification of the new moon. The formal sanctification of the new moon is proclaimed only when the new moon has been observed in its proper time; and this must be done at daytime. If it was done at night, the sanctification is not valid. And even if the court and all of Israel saw it, but the court didn't say, \"[It is] sanctified,\" until it became dark on the night of the thirty-first; or they investigated the witnesses and the court didn't manage to say, \"[It is] sanctified,\" until it became dark on the night of the thirty-first – they don't sanctify it; and the month will be intercalated, and Rosh Chodesh (the first of the month) will only be on the thirty-first – even though it was seen on the night of the thirtieth. For it is not the sighting that sets [it], but rather it is the court saying, \"[It is] sanctified,\" that sets [it]. ",
            "[In a case in which] the court itself saw it at the end of the twenty-ninth day: If a star of the night of the thirtieth still hasn't emerged – the court says, \"[It is] sanctified, [it is] sanctified,\" as it is still day (and it can only be set by day). But if they saw it on the night of the thirtieth, after two stars emerged – we sit two judges on the morrow with one of the (three judges from the original court); and the two (others) testify before the three, and the three sanctify it.

            "[Regarding] witnesses that see the new moon: If there is a distance of a night and a day's journey or less between them and the location of the court – they go and testify. But if there is more than this between them – they do not go. For their testimony after the thirtieth day doesn't help, since the month has already been made intercalated. ",
            "",
            "Just as the witnesses that saw the new moon desecrate the Shabbat, so too do the witnesses who justify them to the court desecrate [it] with them, if the court does not recognize the ones who saw [the new moon]. And even if the one who informs the court of them is a single witness, he goes with them and desecrates [the Shabbat] in case he will find another and join up with him. ",
            "[If one of] the witness that saw the new moon on the night of Shabbat was ill, we ride him on a donkey and even on a bed. And if there is an ambush on the way, the witnesses take weapons in their hands. And if it was a distant journey, they take food in their hands. And even if they saw it large and visible to all, they should not say \"Just as we saw it, others saw it; so we don't need to desecrate the Shabbat.\" Rather anyone who would see the new moon, would be fitting to testify and for whom there will be a night and a day's [journey] or less between him and the location where the court is fixed – there is a commandment upon him to desecrate the Shabbat and to go and testify. ",
            "At first, they would accept testimony of the new moon the entire thirtieth day. One time, the witnesses delayed in coming until the late afternoon and they compromised [the service] in the Temple, and [its officers] did not know what to do – whether they should do the burnt-offering of the afternoon: Perhaps the witnesses would come, and it is impossible to bring up the additional [offering] of the day [of Rosh Chodesh] after the daily offering of the afternoon. [Hence] the court arose and ordained that they would only accept testimony about the new moon until [the time of] <i>minchah</i> (the afternoon prayer), in order that there would be sufficient time in the day to bring up the additional offerings, the daily offering of the afternoon and their libations. ",
            "But if <i>minchah</i>arrived and witnesses did not come, they would do the daily offering of the afternoon. And if witnesses came from <i>minchah</i>and onward, they treat that day as holy and the morrow as holy. But they bring the additional offering on the morrow, since they did not sanctify it after <i>minchah</i>. From when the Temple was destroyed, Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai and his court ordained that they would accept testimony about the new moon the entire day. So even if witnesses came on the thirtieth day at the end of the day, close to sunset – we accept their testimony and sanctify only the thirtieth day. ",
            "When the court intercalates the month because witnesses did not come the entire thirtieth day, they would go up to a prepared place and make a feast on the thirty-first day – which is the first of the month. And they would not go up to there at night; rather at first light before sunrise. And they do not go up to this feast with less than ten [people]. And they only go up with bread of grains, and legumes; and they eat these at the time of the feast. And this is the meal of the commandment of inercalating the month that is mentioned in every place. ",
            "Originally, when the court sanctified the new moon, they used to light flares on the tops of the mountains, so that those who lived far away might know of it. But when the Samaritans began to cause trouble, by kindling misleading flares, it was enacted that messengers should go forth to inform the public. And these messengers do not desecrate the holidays nor Yom Kippur – and it is not necessary to say Shabbat. For we do not desecrate Shabbat to observe it (the month), but rather only to sanctify it. ",
            "Messengers were sent out to proclaim the beginning of six months: <i>Nisan</i>, on account of <i>Pesaḥ; Av</i>, on account of the fast of <i>Tish'ah b'Av; Elul</i>, because of <i>Rosh Hashanah;</i> So that they would sit in anticipation on the thirtieth day of Elul: If they would be informed that the court had sanctified the thirtieth day, they would treat that day alone as holy; but if they were not informed, they would keep the thirtieth day holy and the thirty-first day holy, until the messengers of Tishrei would come to them. <i>Tishri</i>, because of <i>Yom Kippur</i> and <i>Sukkoth; Kislev</i>, because of <i>Hanukkah; Adar</i>, because of <i>Purim</i>. When the Temple was still in existence, messengers would go forth to inform about the beginning of <i>Iyyar</i>, because of <i>Pesaḥ Sheni</i> [observed on the fourteenth of <i>Iyyar</i>].",
            "The messengers of Nissan and the messengers of Tishrei only go out on the day of the first of the month after the sun would rise, [and not] until after they would hear from the mouth of the court \"[It is] sanctified.\" And if the court sanctifies [it] at the end of the twenty-ninth day – as we have said – and they heard from the court, \"[It is] sanctified,\" they go out in the evening. And the messengers of the other six months may go out in the evening after the moon has been seen, even though the court has not yet sanctified the month. Since the new moon has been seen, they go out – for tomorrow the court will certainly sanctify it. ",
            "[In] every place that the messengers would reach, they would make the festivals, one day holidays – as is written in the Torah. But [in] the distant places that the messengers would not reach, they would make two days because of the doubt: For they would not know which day was the day that the court set as the first of the month. ",
            "There are places to which the messengers of Nissan would reach but to which the messengers of Tishrei would not reach. And it would have been appropriate that [these places] make Passover one day, for the messengers reached them and they knew on which day the first of the month was fixed; and make the holiday of the festival of Sukkot two days, for the messengers surely did not reach them. But in order not to differentiate between the festivals, the Sages ordained that any place that the messengers of Tishrei do not reach would make two days [of holidays], even [on] the holiday of [Shavuot].",
            "And how much is between the messengers of Tishrei and the messengers of Nissan? Two days. For the messengers of Tishrei did not travel on the first of Tishrei because it is a holiday, nor on the tenth of it because it is Yom Kippur. ",
            "The messengers do not need to be two, but rather even one is trusted. And not just a messenger alone, but even a merchant from the rest of the people that comes on his way and says, \"I heard from the mouth of the court that they sanctified the month on day x,\" is believed and they set the festivals by his word. For this matter is something which is prone to be revealed, so a single fit witness is trusted for it. ",
            "[If] the court sat all of the thirtieth day and witnesses did not come, and they awoke at first light and intercalated the month – as we have explained in this chapter – and after four or five days, distant witnesses came and testified that they saw the month in its time, which is the night of the thirtieth; and even [if] they come at the end of the month: They intimidate them very threateningly and confound them with questions, burden them with examinations and are meticulous about their testimony; and the court makes efforts not to sanctify this month, since its name has gone out as intercalated. ",
            "But if the witnesses stuck with their testimony and it is found consistent, and the witnesses are surely known and intelligent men and the testimony has been appropriately investigated – they sanctify it and retract, and count from the thirtieth day for that month, since the moon was seen on its night. ",
            "However if the court needs to leave this month intercalated as it was before these witnesses came, they leave it. And this is [the meaning of] what [the Sages] said, \"We intercalate the month for necessity.\" But there is someone among the great Sages who disagrees on this matter and says we never intercalate the month for necessity: Since witnesses came, we sanctify [it] and don't intimidate them. ",
            "It appears to me that there is only a disagreement of the Sages about the months other than Nissan and Tishrei, or with witnesses of Nissan and Tishrei that came after the festivals had passed. For what has been done has already been done and the time of the offerings and the time of the festivals has passed. But if the witnesses came in Nissan and Tishrei before half of the month, we accept their testimony and we don't intimidate them at all. For we don't intimidate witnesses that testify about the new moon that was seen at its time, to intercalate it. ",
            "But we do intimidate witnesses whose testimony has become compromised and the matter is leaning towards the testimony not standing, such that the month will become interclated. We intimidate them in order that the testimony will stand and the month will be sanctified in its time. And likewise, if witnesses came to undermine the witnesses that saw it in its time before the court has sanctified it – [the judges] intimidate the undermining witnesses until their undermining does not stand; and the month is sanctified in its time.

            "For three indicators do we make the year a leap year. For the season, for the Spring [state of the barley] and for the fruit of the trees. How is that? The court calculates and determines – if the season of Nissan (when the sun enters Aries) will be on the sixteenth of Nissan or after that time, they make that year into a leap year. And they make that Nissan [into] Second Adar, so that Passover will be during the time of Spring. And we may rely on this indicator and make leap years, and [then] not be concerned about another indicator. ",
            "And likewise if the court saw that the Spring [state of the barley] has yet to arrive, but it is rather still late; and the fruit of the trees that tend to sprout around Passover have not sprouted – we rely on these two indicators and make the year a leap year. And even though the season [arrived] before the sixteenth of Nissan – they surely make it a leap year, so that the Spring [barley] will be present to offer up the waved omer from it on the sixteenth of Nissan; and so that the fruit will sprout like is the way of every Spring [season]. ",
            "And we rely on three lands with respect to the Spring [state of the barley]: On the Land of Yehudah, on Transjordan and on the Galilee. And if the Spring arrived in two of these [lands], but not in one – we do not make a leap year. However, if it arrived in one of them, but it did not arrive in two – we make a leap year, if the fruit of the trees has yet to sprout. And these are the main things for which we make leap years, in order that the years will be solar years. ",
            "And there exist other things for which the court makes leap years due to necessity. And these are them: Because of the roads that are not mended and the people are unable to go up [to Jerusalem], we make the year a leap year until the rain stops and the roads are mended. And because of the bridges which were destroyed and the rivers are found blocking and preventing the people and [so the people] are endangering themselves and dying, we make the year a leap year until they mend the bridges. And because of the ovens [for the] Pesach sacrifice that were destroyed in the rain and [the people] do not have a place to roast their Pesach sacrifices, we make the year a leap year until they will have built the ovens and [the ovens] will have dried. And because of the Israelite exiles that have left from their place and have not yet arrived in Jerusalem, we make the year a leap year in order that they will have enough time to arrive.",
            "But we don't make the year a leap [year] – not for the snow, not for the cold and not for the Israelite exiles that have not yet left from their place. And not for impurity: For example, were the majority of the congregation or the majority of the priests impure, we don't make the year a leap year in order that they will have avaialable time to purify themselves and do [the offerings] in purity. Rather they do [them] in impurity. And if they made the year a leap year because of impurity, it is surely a leap year. ",
            "There are things for which we don't make a leap year at all; but we do make them a support for a year that needs to become a leap [year] because of the season or because of the Spring [state of the barley] and the fruits of the trees. And these are them: Because of the goats and sheep that are yet to be born or which are few. And because of the chicks that have not [yet grown enough to have] flown. We do not make a leap year because of these – in order that the goats and sheep should be accessible for the Pesach sacrifices; and [that] the chicks be accessible for the offering of being seen (<i>reiah</i>) or for those who are obligated in a sacrifice of fowl. But we do make them a support for the year.",
            "How do we make them a support for the year? We say, \"This year needs intercalation because of the season that has dragged\"; or \"because of the Spring and the fruit of the trees that are yet to arrive\" – \"and further since the goats are small and the chicks are delicate.\" ",
            "A year should be intercalated only by those who were invited to participate in the act of intercalation. How is this done? The chief justice of the Supreme Court should say to certain members of the Sanhedrin: \"You are invited to come to such and such a place, that we may together calculate and find out whether this year should be intercalated or not.\" Only those invited may decide about the intercalation of the year. And with how many [judges] do we make it a leap year? We start with three judges from the great Sanhedrin, from those that were ordained. [If] two said \"We should not sit and not see whether making a leap [year] is necessary or if not,\" and one says, \"We should sit and check\" – the individual is nullified from his [being a] minority. [If] two said \"We should sit and check,\" and one says, \"We should not sit\" – we add two more from those invited and debate the matter back and forth. ",
            "If two of the five members of the council say that the year should be intercalated, and three say that it should not, the minority of two does not count. If three say that it should be intercalated, and two say that it should not, two members are added to the council from among those who have been invited, and they discuss the matter and decide with a panel of seven. If all seven of them unanimously decide to intercalate or not to intercalate, their decision is adhered to; but if they disagree, the opinion of the majority is followed. And there is a need to have head of the High Court – who is the head of the yeshiva of seventy-one – among the seven. And if they concluded with three to make a leap year, it is a leap year so long as the [head of the court] is with them or agrees. And with regards to making the year a leap year, we start [the discussion] from the side (from the lesser judges). But to sanctify the month, we start with the greatest. ",

If he arrived and gave his consent, the intercalation remains valid; if he did not consent, the intercalation is invalid. And we only make the year a leap year in the Land of Yehudah. For the Divine Presence is there, as it stated (Deuteronomy 12:5), \"to dwell It there; you shall seek.\" But if they made it a leap year in the Galilee, it is a leap year. And we only make it a leap year during the day. But if they made it a leap year at night, it is not a leap year. ",

But they may not say, \"Year x is a leap year.\" Rather it is after Rosh Hashanah that they may say, \"This year is a leap year.\" And this matter is [only] because of a pressing situation. But at a time when there is no pressing situation, we may not make [it] known that it is a leap year [right after Rosh Hashanah]. Rather it is in Adar that they may say \"This year is a leap year; and the coming month is not Nissan but rather Second Adar.\" [If] they said before Rosh Hashanah, \"This year that is beginning is a leap year,\" it is not [turned into] a leap year with this statement.

And if they made it a leap year on the thirtieth day of Adar, it is surely a leap year. [If] witnesses came after they made it a leap year and testified about the moon, they sanctify the month on the thirtieth day and it will be the first of the month of Second Adar. But if they sanctified it before they made the year a leap year, they could no longer have made [it] a leap year. For we do not make leap years in Nissan. ",

For everyone runs to the threshing floors to eat and to live; so it is impossible to add time to them, to forbid the new [grain] (which will only become permissible on the sixteenth of Nissan). And we may [also] not make a leap year on a sabbatical year. For everyone's hand is controlling the undergrowth; so they will not find [grain] for the omer offering and the two breads. And they were used to making a leap year on the eve of a sabbatical year. ",
            "It seems to me that that which the Sages said, \"We may not make a leap year in a year of famine and on the sabbatical year,\" is that we may not make a leap [year] because of the necessity of the roads and the bridges and that which is similar to them. But if the year was fitting to be made a leap year because of the season or because of the Spring [status of the barley] and the fruit of the trees, we always make a leap year at any time. ",

For [regarding] the leap year month, the court has the authority to add a full [month] or a lacking [month] for the people far away whom they are informing.

Rather, sometimes the day we set with this calculation will be the day of sighting; [and sometimes it will be] a day before it, or a day after it.

As who will tell us that the messengers went out to this place? possibly no messengers were ever sent out to this place because there were no Jews there, and when the calendar began to be determined by computation the place was settled by Jews who were required to observe two days by their previous custom.

For example, Usha and Shaphram and Lod and Yavneh and Nov and Tiberius and that which is similar to them. [In that case,] they make only one day alone. But if the place was of Syria – such as Tyre and Damascus, and Ashkelon and that which is similar to them; or from outside of the Land [of Israel] – like Egypt and Ammon and Moab and that which is similar to them – they do like the custom of their fathers which is in their hands: If one day, one day; and if two days, two days.

The beginning of this calculation that we calculate by approximation – to know the time of their conjunction without precision, but rather according to their average trajectories – is what is called the <i>molad</i>.

            "[Regarding] all of the calculations, when you take the sum of one remainder with [another] remainder; or when you add one amount to [another] amount – take the sum of each type [of unit] with its type: The seconds with the seconds; the parts with the parts; and the degrees with the degrees. And anytime there is a sum of sixty degrees, make one part and add it to the parts. And whenever there is a sum of sixty parts, make it a degree and add it to the degrees. And when you take the sum of the degrees, remove three hundred and sixty. And the remainder [of that] – from three hundred and sixty and down – is what we take for the calculation. ",
            "In all of the calculations altogether, when you want to subtract an amount from an amount: If that which you are subtracting is more than the one from which you are subtracting – even by one part – add three hundred and sixty degrees to that from which you are subtracting, so that it will be possible to subtract that amount from it.",
            "How is this? See that [if] the calculation required you to subtract two hundred degrees, fifty parts and forty seconds – its symbol being 200.50.40 – from one hundred degrees, twenty parts and thirty seconds – its symbol being 100.20.30: Add three hundred and sixty to the hundred – it will be four hundred and sixty degrees. [When] you begin to subtract the seconds from the seconds, for you to come to subtract forty from thirty is impossible. [So] bring over one part from the twenty parts and make it into sixty seconds. [Then] add it to the thirty, and it comes out to ninety seconds. Subtract the forty from them, and the remainder is fifty seconds. And go back to subtract fifty parts from nineteen parts – as you have already carried over one part and made it into seconds. But it is impossible to subtract fifty from nineteen. Hence bring over one of the degrees and make it into sixty parts. [Then] add it to the nineteen parts, and it comes out to seventy-nine parts. Subtract fifty from them. Twenty-nine parts remain. Go back and subtract two hundred degrees from four hundred and fifty-nine degrees – as you have already carried over one degree and made it into parts. And the remainder is two hundred and fifty-nine degrees. And it comes out that the symbol of the remainder is 259.29.50. And in this way [you can calculate] about each and every subtraction. ",
            "The  movement of the sun and the moon, and likewise the rest of the seven stars – each and every one in its orbit – is an even movement. There is no quickness or heaviness to it. Rather its motion today is like its motion yesterday which is like its motion tomorrow which is like its motion on each and every day. And even though the orbit of each one of them goes around the world, the Earth is not at its center.",
            "Hence if you measure the movement of each one of them by the [space] that surrounds the world for which the Earth is at its center – which is the [space] of the constellations – its movement would change. And it comes out that its movement on this day in the [space] of the constellations would be less or more than its movement yesterday or its movement tomorrow.",

And the true place of the sun or place of the moon is with it.",
            "We have already said that these procedures that we are explaining in these laws are only for the sighting of the moon exclusively. Hence we have made the base [time] from which we are always starting for this calculation – from the beginning of the Fifth Night (Wednesday night), the date of which is the Third of the month of Nissan from this year, which is the seventeenth of the two hundred and sixtieth cycle. That is the year 4938 from the creation, which is the year 1489 for contracts, which is the year 1109 [from] the destruction of the second Temple.

And this place (Jerusalem and its surroundings) is off about thirty-three degrees – from thirty-five up to twenty-nine – to the north of the equator that encircles the world.

            "The average movement of the sun in one day – which is twenty-four hours – is fifty-nine parts (minutes) and nine seconds. Its symbol is 24:59.9. It comes out that its movement in ten days is nine degrees, fifty-one parts and twenty-three seconds. Its symbol is 9.51.23. And it comes out that its movement in a hundred days is ninety-eight degrees, thirty-three parts and fifty-three seconds. Its symbol is 98.33.53. And it comes out that the remainder of its movement in a thousand days – after you remove each [set of] three hundred and sixty degrees, as we explained – is two hundred sixty-five degrees, thirty-eight parts and fifty seconds. Its symbol is 265.38.50. And it comes out that the remainder of its movement in ten thousand days is one hundred and thirty-six degrees, twenty-eight parts and twenty seconds. Its symbol is 136..28.20. And in this way you can multiply and come out with [the sun's] movement for any amount [of time] that you want. And so if you want to make familiar indicators for yourself for its movement in two days, three and four up until ten, you should do [so]. And likewise if you want to make familiar indicators ready for yourself for its movement in twenty days, thirty and forty up until a hundred, you should do [so]. And this is something revealed and known, once you have known the movement of one day. And it is fitting that the average movement of the sun in twenty-nine days and in three hundred and fifty-four days – which is a lunar year at the time when its months are in order, which is called an ordered year – be ready and familiar to you. For when these average movements will be known, this calculation for the sighting of the moon will be easy for you – since there are twenty-nine complete days from the night of one sighting to the night of the next new moon. And likewise for each and every month – there is no less than twenty-nine days and no more. For our desire in all of these calculations is only to know the sighting of the moon exclusively. And likewise from the night of the sighting of this month to the night of the sighting in the same month in the next year is an ordered year or a year and a day. And likewise for each and every year. And the average movement of the sun for twenty-nine days is twenty eight degrees, thirty-five parts and one second. Its symbol is 28.35.1. And its movement in an ordered year is two hundred and forty-eight degrees, fifty-five parts and fifteen seconds. Its symbol is 248.55.15.",
            "And there is one point in the orbit of the sun – and likewise in the orbits of the other seven stars – at which time the star is all of its light away from the Earth. And this point of the orbit of the sun and of the other seven stars rotates evenly. And its movement every seventy years is approximately one degree. And this point is called the apogee of the sun. Its movement every ten days is one and a half seconds – which is ninety thirds. It comes out that its movement in a hundred days is fifteen seconds, its movement in a thousand days is two parts and thirty seconds and its movement in ten thousand days is twenty-five parts. And it comes out that its movement in twenty-nine days is four seconds and a bit and its movement in an ordered year is fifty-three seconds. We have already said that the base time from which the calculation begins is from the beginning of the Fifth Night, the date of which is the Third of the month of Nissan of the year 4938 from the creation. And the place of the sun in its average movement [from] this base time was at seven degrees, three parts and thirty-two seconds from the [beginning of the] constellation of Aries. Its symbol is 7.3.32. And the place of the sun's apogee [from] this base time was at twenty-six degrees, forty-five parts and eight seconds from the constellation of Gemini. Its symbol is 26.45.8. When you want to know the place of the sun in its average movement at any time you want – take the amount of days from the beginning of the base time until the day you want. And you can arrive at its average movement for those days from the indicators that we have made known. [Then] add everything to the base time and take the sum of each type [of units] with its type. And what comes out is the place of the sun in its average movement for that day. How is this? See that [if] we wanted to know the place of the sun in its average movement from the beginning of Shabbat night, the date of which was the Fourteenth of the month of Tammuz from this year – which is the year of the base time: We found that the amount of days from the day of the base time until the beginning of this day for which we want to know the place of the sun is a hundred days. We took the average movement for one hundred days – which is 98.33.53 – and we added it to the base time – which is 7.3.32. From the calculation, it came out to one hundred and five degrees, thirty-seven parts and twenty-five seconds. Its symbol is 105.37.25. It comes out that its place according to its average movement at the beginning of this night is in the constellation of Cancer at fifteen degrees in it and thirty-seven parts of the sixteenth degree. The average movement that comes out from this calculation will sometimes be precisely at the beginning of the night [and sometimes] an hour before the sunset or an hour after the sunset. And you should not be concerned about this thing regarding the sun in the calculation of the sighting, as we will compensate for this approximation when we calculate the average [movement] of the moon. And you can do like this anytime you want, even after a thousand years: To take the sum of all of the remainders and add it to the base time – and it will come out for you [to] the place of the average [movement]. And likewise can you do this for the average [movement] of the moon and for the average [movement] of each and every star: Once you know how much its movement is for one day and know the base time from which you start – take the sum of its movement for all of the years and days that you want, and add it to base time. And what comes out is its place in its average movement. And likewise can you do this for the apogee of the sun: Add its movement for those days or years to the base time. What comes out is the place of the sun's apogee for that day that you want. And likewise if you want to make another base time from which to start, besides the base time from which we have started in this year – in order that [such a] base time be at the beginning of the [first] year of a specific cycle or at the beginning of one of the centuries – you have permission in your hand [to do so]. And if you want to make the base time from which you start to be in years that have passed before this base date or after several years from this base date, the procedure is known. How is the procedure? You already know the movement of the sun in an ordered year, its movement for twenty-nine days and its movement for one day. And it is well-known that a year the months of which are complete is one day more than an ordered year; and that a year the months of which are lacking is one day less than an ordered [one]. And [regarding] a leap year: If its months would be in their order, it will be thirty days more than a [simple] ordered year. And if its months would be complete, it will be thirty-one days more than an ordered [year]. And if its months would be lacking, it will be twenty-nine days more than an ordered [year]. And once all of these things are known, you may come out with the average movement of the sun for all of the years and days that you want. So you can add to the [original] base time that we made – and you will have the average [place of the movement] for the day that you want from the years to come. [Then] you can make that the base time. Or you can subtract the movement that you have come up with from the base time that we have made – and you will have the base time that you want from years that have passed. [Then] you can make that average [place of the movement] the base time. And you can do like this for the average [movement] of the moon and the other stars if they be known to you. And it has already been explained that in the same way that you can know the average [movement] of the sun from the days to come, so can you know its average [movement] for every day that you want from the days that have passed."

But we are not concerned with the parts regarding the path – in the [same] way that we explained with the sun.",
            "And we have come [now] to deduce the divergence of this correct path which is one hundred and eight: It comes out that its divergence is five degrees and one part. And since the correct path was less than one hundred and eighty degrees, subtract the divergence – which is five degrees and one part – from the average of the moon. The remainder will be forty-eight degrees, thirty-three parts, and thirty-nine seconds. Make the seconds into a part and add [it] to the [other] parts. And it comes out that the true place of the moon at this time is eighteen degrees and thirty-six parts in the constellation of Taurus. Its symbol is 18.36.

            "The orbit in which the moon always veers from the orbit in which the sun always moves. Half of [the moon's] orbit veers to the north and half of it veers to the south. And there are two points in it – one across from the other – in which the two orbits intersect one another. Hence when the moon is in one of those two points, it comes out that it is moving [along] the orbit of the sun exactly opposite to the sun. But if the moon moves out of one of these two points, it comes out that it moves north of the sun or south of it. The point from which the moon starts to veer to the north of the sun is called the head. And the point from which the moon begins to veer to the south of the sun is called the tail. And there is an even movement to this head that has no addition or subtraction; and it moves backwards through the constellations, from Aries to Pisces, and Pisces to Aquarius. And likewise does it always move [regarding the other constellations].",
            "The average movement of the head in one day is three parts and eleven seconds. It comes out that its movement in ten days is thirty-one parts and forty-seven seconds. And it comes out that its movement in a hundred days is five degrees, seventeen parts and forty-three seconds. Its symbol is 5.17.43. And it comes out that its movement in a thousand days is fifty-two degrees, fifty-seven parts and ten seconds. Its symbol is 52.57.10. And it comes out that its movement in ten thousand days is one hundred and sixty-nine degrees, thirty-one parts and forty seconds. Its symbol is 169.31.40. And it comes out that its movement in twenty-nine days is one degree, thirty-two parts and nine seconds. Its symbol is 1.32.9. And it comes out that its movement in an ordered year is eighteen degrees, forty-four parts and forty-two seconds. And the average [place] of the head at the beginning of the Night of the Fifth (Wednesday night) which was the base time is one hundred and eighty degrees, fifty-seven parts and twenty-eight seconds. Its symbol is 180. 57. 28.",
            "If you want to know the place of the head at any time that you want, produce their average [place] for that time in the way that you produce the average [place] of the sun and the average [place] of the moon. [Then] subtract the average from three hundred and sixty degrees; and the remainder is the place of the head at that time. And the place of the tail will always be across from it.",
            "How is this? See that [if] we wanted to know the place of the head of the beginning of the night [following] the eve of Shabbat (Friday night), the day of which was the Second of Iyar from this year, which is the base year. And the completed days from the beginning of the night of the base time until the beginning of this night upon which we want to know the place of the head is twenty-nine days.",
            "Produce the mean [place] of the moon at that time in the way that you know. And that is that you add its movement for twenty days upon [its place] at the base time. It comes out for you that the mean [place] of the head is one hundred and eighty-two degrees, twenty-nine parts and thirty-seven seconds. Its symbol is 182.29.37. Subtract this mean from three hundred and sixty. Your remainder is one hundred and seventy five degrees, thirty parts and twenty-three seconds. Its symbol is 177.30.23. And do not pay attention to the seconds. It comes out that the place of the head is twenty-seven degrees and thirty parts into the constellation of Virgo. And [so] the place of the tail is across from it at twenty-seven degrees and thirty parts into the constellation of Pisces.",

Hence [for] any constellation in which you find the place of the head, you will find the tail in the constellation that is seventh from it, exactly in the same amount of degrees and parts [as the head]. If the head would be at ten degrees in constellation x, the tail would be at ten degrees in the seventh constellation from it.",
            "And once you know the place of the head, the place of the tail and the true place of the moon, consider the three of them: If you found that the moon is with the head or with the tail, on the same degree and the same part – know that the moon is not inclining to the north of the sun, nor to its south. But if you saw that the place of the moon is past the place of the head and it is moving towards the tail, know that the moon is inclining to the north of the sun. And if the moon is past the place of the tail and it is surely moving towards the head, know that the moon is inclining to the south of the sun. ",
            "The incline that the moon inclines to the north of the sun or to its south is that which is called the width of the moon. If it was inclining to the north, it is called a northern width; and if the moon was inclining to the south, it is called a southern width. But if the the moon was in one of the two points, it would not have a width, as we explained.",
            "The width of the moon will never be more than five degrees – whether to the north or to the south. Rather this is its way: It will begin at the head and diverge from it little by little. And the distance continues to grow until it gets to five degrees; and then it again approaches little by little until there be no width when it reaches the tail. And it again diverges little by little, and the divergence grows until it reaches five degrees. And it again approaches until it will not have a width.",
            "If you want to know how much the width of the moon is at any time that you want, and whether it is northern or southern: Produce the place of the head and the true place of the moon for that time. Then subtract the place of the head from the true place of the moon. And the remainder is what is called the path of the width. And if the path of the width would be from one degree to one hundred and eighty, know that the width of the moon is northern. And if the path was more than one hundred and eighty, know that the width of the moon is southern. And if it was exactly one hundred and eighty or exactly three hundred and sixty, the moon has no width at all. Then go back and see how much is the divergence of the path of the width. And that is the amount of its incline to the north or to the south; and that is what is called the northern or southern width of the moon, as we explained.",
            "And how much is the divergence of the path of the width? If the path of the width would be ten degrees, its divergence would be fifty-two parts (minutes). And if this path would be twenty degrees, its divergence would be one degree and forty-three parts. And if the path would be thirty, its divergence would be two degrees and thirty parts. And if the path would be forty, its divergence would be three degrees and thirteen parts. And if the path would be fifty, its divergence would be three degrees and fifty parts. And if the path would be sixty, its divergence would be four degrees and twenty parts. And if the path would be seventy, its divergence would be four degrees and forty-two parts. And if the path would be eighty, its divergence would be four degrees and fifty-five parts. And if the path would be ninety, its divergence would be five degrees.",

How is that? See that [if] the path of the width was fifty-three degrees; and you already know that if the path was fifty, its divergence would be three degrees and fifty parts, and if the path was sixty degrees, the divergence would be four degrees and twenty parts. It comes out that the remainder between the two tens (after subtracting one from the other) is thirty parts – three parts for every degree. And it comes out according to the calculation of this path which is fifty-three, [that] it is three degrees and fifty-nine parts. And in this way you [can calculate] each and every amount.",
            "Once you know the divergence of the path of the width up to ninety – as we have informed you – you will know the divergence of all the amounts of the path. For if the path is more than ninety, up to one hundred and eighty; subtract the width from one hundred and eighty. And you will know that the remainder is the divergence.",

            "See that [if] the path was two hundred, subtract one hundred and sixty from it. The remainder is twenty. And you already know that the divergence of twenty is one degree and forty-three parts. Hence the divergence of one hundred and fifty is one degree and forty-three parts. ",
            "See that [if] the path was three hundred, subtract it from three hundred and sixty. The remainder is sixty.

Subtract the place of the head from the place of the moon. Your result will be a path of the width of two hundred thirty-one degrees and six parts. Its symbol is 236.6. Since we do not concern ourselves with the parts in any of the paths, it comes out that the divergence of this path according to the procedures that we have explained in this chapter is three hundred degrees and fifty-three parts.

For the [trajectory of the] moon is crooked. And therefore the Sages said (Rosh Hashanah 25a), \"'The sun knows its way' (Psalms 104:19); the moon does not know its way.\" And the Sages [also] said, \"Sometimes it comes long, sometimes it comes short.\" As you can see from these calculations that sometimes you add and sometimes you subtract until there is the arc of the sighting; and sometimes the arc of the sighting is long and sometimes short, as we have explained.

And they are now found in the hands of the sages. But the books that were composed by the Sages of Israel that were in the times of the prophets from the Children of Yissachar did not reach us. But since all of these things are with clear proofs that have no doubt and it is impossible for a person to question them, we are not concerned about the author – whether the prophets composed them or the nations composed them. As [regarding] anything the explanation of which is revealed and its truth is known from proofs that have no doubt, we relay on the man that said it or taught it with the proof that is revealed and the reason that is known.

But it is [also] possible that it will not be seen because of the clouds covering it or because of the place which is a valley or that there is a tall mountain blocking the western direction from the people of that place, such that it is as if they are residing in a valley. For the moon is not visible to someone in a low place even if it is big, but it is seen to someone standing on the top of a tall and steep mountain even when the moon is very small. And likewise is it visible to one dwelling by the seashore or to one traveling on a boat in the Great (Mediterranean) Sea, even though it is very small. ",
            "And likewise if it is a clear day in the winter, the moon will be more visible than it would be in the summer. [This is] because if it would be a clear day in the winter, the air would very pure and the sky would be seen with greater transparency; as there is no dust there to mix into the sky. But in the summer the air is as if it is smoky because of the dust, so the moon looks small.",
            "And anytime you find the arc of the sighting and the first length that you measure with it [to establish] the two edges to be narrow, the moon will be very small and it will only be visible in a very high place. But if you find the arc of the sighting and the first length to be very large and they have more degrees to the end of their edges, the moon will look large. So the size and visibility will be according to the largeness of the arc and the first length. ",
            "Hence it is fitting for the court to [pay attention] to these two things, which are the time of the sighting and its place. And they ask the witnesses, \"In which place did you see [it]?\" As if the arc of sighting was small and the calculation [demonstrates] that it will be seen narrowly – such as if the arc of the sighting was thirteen degrees and five parts, and the first length was exactly thirteen degrees – and witnesses came that saw it: If it was in the summer or they were in a low place, we suspect them and examine them much. But if it was in the winter or in a very high place, it was certainly seen unless there were clouds there intervening. ",
            "Witnesses that saw the [new] moon in its time and came and testified, and the court accepted them and sanctified this first month; and [then the court] counted twenty-nine days from the sanctified day and the moon was not visible on the thirtieth day, because it was impossible to see it, or it was covered with clouds – and surely the court anticipates it the whole thirtieth day, as we have explained – and witnesses do not come that the moon be ratified, it comes out that the second Rosh Chodesh (first day of the month) is the thirty-first day, as we have explained. ",
            "And they began to count twenty-nine days from the second Rosh Chodesh and the moon is not seen on the Night of the Thirtieth: If you say that we ratify it this way and make [that month] thirty and set the third Rosh Chodesh [on] the thirty-first day, it is thus possible that the moon will not be seen on the thirtieth night of this month as well, and they will come out continuing to ratify the months after the Thirtieth the whole entire year! And it comes out that in the last month, it is possible that the moon be seen on the Night of the Twenty-fifth or the the Night of the Twenty-sixth. And there is no more laughable and injurious matter than this.",
            "And do not say that this thing is not common, that the moon not be visible the whole year. Rather it is something very likely. As many times this, or that which is similar to it, happens in the provinces in which their winters are long and the clouds many. For we are not saying that the moon is not seen the whole year, but rather that it is not seen at the beginning of the month, but it is seen afterwards. And sometimes it is not seen because it is impossible to see it on [those times], and on the months that it is possible for one to see them, he does not see [it] because of the clouds or because it was very small and he did not focus on it.",
            "Rather the tradition that was in the hand of the Sages – one man from the mouth of another, from the mouth of Moshe, our teacher – is thus: That at a time when the moon is not seen at the beginning of [several] months – one month after the other – the court sets a [full] month of thirty days and a lacking month of twenty-nine day. And so they calculate and set the [full] month and the lacking month by setting – not by sanctification. For we only sanctify based on sighting. And sometimes they make a full [month] after a full [month], and sometimes a lacking [month] after a lacking [month], as it appears to them from the calculation. ",
            "And they always intend in their calculations that if the moon be sighted in the next month, it would be sighted in its time or on the night of the intercalation; not that it be seen before its time, which is the night of the twenty-eighth. And in these calculations of the sighting that we have explained it will be become elucidated to you and you will know when it is possible that it will be seen and when it is possible that it will not be seen. And upon this do we rely and intercalate one month after [another] or make one lacking month after [another]. But we never have less than four intercalated months in a year nor more than eight intercalated months. And also when we intercalate these months according to the calculation, we make the meal of intercalating the month, [that] we mentioned in the third chapter.",
            "And all that you find in the Gemara of the things that show that the court relies on the calculation, or from the mouth of Moshe from Sinai that the thing is given over to them and authority is in their hand to make a lacking [month] or to intercalate – and likewise that which one made nine lacking months in a year, or anything that is similar to it – it is all built on this principle, at a time when the new moon is not seen at its time. ",
            "And likewise that which the Sages said that we intercalate the month for a purpose is with these months that we intercalate according to the calculation and make one full and one lacking. And they may [thus] intercalate one month after another or make [two consecutive months] lacking. It is in this that we intercalate for a purpose, as the moon was not seen in its time. But when the moon is seen in its time, which is the beginning of its being seen after it intersects the [orbit of the] sun, we always sanctify it.",
            "And all of these things are at a time when there is a court and we rely upon the sighting. But in these times, we only rely upon the fixing with this intermediate calculation which has spread among all of Israel, as we have explained in these laws.",
            "It is explained in the books of the seasons and geometry that if the moon is seen in the Land of Israel, it will be seen in all of the provinces of the world that are to the west of the Land of Israel across from it. But if the calculation comes out that it will not be seen in the Land of Israel, it is possible that it will be seen in [other] provinces that are to the west of the Land of Israel across from it. Hence if the moon would be seen in a province that is to the west of the Land of Israel, there is no proof in this that it will not be seen in the Land of Israel. Rather it is possible that the moon will be seen in the Land of Israel. ",
            "But if the moon would not be seen at the top of the hills in the western province across from the Land of Israel, it is known that it was not visible in the Land of Israel. ",
            "And likewise, if the moon will not be seen in the Land of Israel, it is known that it not visible in all of the provinces of the world that are to the east of the Land of Israel across from it. But if it will be seen in the Land of Israel, it is possible that it will be seen in the eastern provinces, but it is [also] possible that it will not be seen. Hence if it will be seen in a province that is east of the Land of Israel and across from it, it is known that it is visible in the Land of Israel. But if it is not visible in the eastern provinces, there is no proof in this. Rather it is possible that it will be seen in the Land of Israel. ",
            "And all of these things are when the province in the west or in the east were across [from it], such that they extended to the north of the world (from its midpoint, meaning the equator) from thirty degrees to thirty-five degrees. But if they extended further or less than this to the north, they have different properties. For they are surely not across from the Land of Israel. And these things that we have explained about the cities of the East and the West are only to tell you the properties of sighting, 'to enlarge the Torah and to magnify it.' It is not that the residents of the East or the residents of the West rely upon the [local] sighting of the moon, or that it helps them at all. Rather we always only rely upon the sanctification of the court in the Land of Israel, as we have mentioned several times."
        ],
        [
            "Since the Sages said that among the things with which they would examine the witnesses was that they would say to them, \"Towards where was the moon inclining\" – it is proper in my eyes to make known the way of the calculation of this thing. But I will not be precise about it, since it is not useful in the sighting at all. And the beginning of this calculation is to know the incline of the constellations first.",
            "The orbit that the sun passes through half of the constellations is not one in which it passes through the middle of the [universe] from the eastern side to the western side. Rather it diverts from the even [circle] that circles in the middle of the [universe], towards the north or the south. Half of [its orbit] inclines towards the north and half of it inclines towards the south.",
            "And there are two points in it in which it meets the orbit of the even circle that circles in the middle of the [universe]. One point is at the [beginning] of the constellation of Aries. The second point across from it is at the [beginning] of the constellation of Libra. And it comes out that six constellation incline to the north, from the beginning of Aries to the end of Libra. And six incline to the south, from the beginning of the constellation of Libra to the end of the constellation of Pisces.",
            "And from the beginning of the constellation of Aries, the constellations begin to inline, little by little, and to move away from the even [circle] towards the north, to the [beginning] of Cancer. And the beginning of Cancer is approximately twenty-three and a half degrees away to the north of the even [circle]. And the constellations return to approach, little by little, the even [circle], until the [beginning] of Libra, which is on the even [circle]. And from the beginning of Libra, they begins to inline and to move away towards the south, to the [beginning] of Capricorn. And the [the beginning] of Capricorn is approximately twenty-three and a half degrees away to the south of the even [circle]. And the constellations return to approach, little by little, the even [circle], until the [beginning] of Aries. ",
            "It comes out that the [beginning] of Aries and the [beginning] of Libra orbit on the even [circle]. And hence when the sun will be in these two [beginnings], it will not incline – not to the north and not to the south. And it will rise at the midpoint of the east and it will set at the midpoint of the west. And day and night will be the same [amount of time] in all of civilization. ",
            "See that it is elucidated for you that each and every degree of the degrees of the constellations inclines to the north or to the south, and there is a [standard] measurement to its incline. And (the largeness) [the width] of the incline will not be more than approximately twenty-three and a half degrees.",
            "And these are the standard measures of the inclines according to the amount of degrees of the constellations: The incline of ten degrees is four degrees. The incline of twenty degrees is eight degrees. The incline of thirty degrees is eleven degrees. The incline of forty degrees is fifteen degrees. The incline of fifty degrees is eighteen degrees. The incline of sixty degrees is twenty degrees. The incline of seventy degrees is twenty-two degrees. The incline of eighty degrees is twenty-three degrees. The incline of ninety degrees is twenty-three and a half degrees.",
            "And if there be single digits, take their divergence for them from between the two [proximate] inclines [of tens], like we explained with the sun and with the moon. How is this? The incline of five degrees is two degrees. And if the amount of degrees was twenty-three, their incline is nine degrees. And in this way [should you calculate] with all the single digits that are with the tens. ",
            "And once you know the incline of the degrees up to ninety, you will know the incline of all of [the degrees], in the way that we informed you about the width of the moon: That if the amount was more than ninety up to one hundred and eighty, subtract it from one hundred and eighty. And if the amount was more than one hundred and eighty to two hundred and seventy, subtract one hundred and eighty from it. And if it was more than two hundred and seventy to three hundred and sixty, subtract it from three hundred and sixty. And you will know the incline of the remainder, and it is the incline of that amount that is in your hand (from 19:7-8 above) – without subtraction and without addition.",
            "If you want to know how many degrees the moon inclines from the the even [circle] towards the north of the universe or towards the south of the universe: First know how much is the incline of the degree which is the true place of the moon, and to which direction it inclines – to the north or to the south. Then go back and calculate and produce the first width of the moon and see if it is northern or southern. If the width of the moon and the incline of its degree are in one direction – such as if both of them were northern or southern – gather the sum of both of them. But if it comes out about the two directions that one is northern and one is southern, subtract the smaller of the two of them from the larger. And the remainder is the distance of the moon from the even [circle] in that direction which was the larger of the two of them.",
            "How is this? [If] we came to know how much the moon is inclining from the even [circle] on the night of the sighting, which is the Second of the month of Iyar of this year: And you have already known that the degree of the moon was nineteen degrees into the constellation of Taurus – its incline is about eighteen degrees to the north – and [that] the width of the moon was about four degrees to the south. Subtract the smaller from the larger. The remainder will be fourteen degrees. And it comes out that the moon is fourteen degrees from the even [circle] in the northern direction. As the larger amount – which is eighteen – was surely northern. And all of this calculation is approximate, as it is not useful in the sighting.",
            "If you want to know to which direction of the directions of the [universe] the moon inclines, calculate and know its distance from the even [circle]: If it is exactly on the even [circle] or within two or three degrees close to it to the north or to the south, it will appear even in the middle of the west and its [shady side] will appear exactly towards the east of the universe.",
            "But if it would be further to the north of the universe from the even [circle], it will be seen between the west of the universe and its north. And its [shady side] will be appear inclining across from the east of the universe towards the north of the universe. ",
            "And if it was further to the south of the universe from the even [circle], it will be seen between the west of the universe and its south. And its [shady side] will appear inclining across from the east of the universe towards the north of the universe. And according to the greatness of the distance [is] the greatness of the incline. ",
            "And among the investigations of the witnesses is that we say to them, \"How high was [it]?\" And this thing is known by the arc of the sighting: At the time that the arc of the sighting is small, the moon will appear as if it it close to the earth. And at a time when it is long, it will appear high from upon the earth. So its height from upon the earth as seen by the eyes [is] according to the size of the arc of the sighting. ",
            "See that we have elucidated the calculations of all of the ways that we require about the knowledge of the sighting and the investigating of the witnesses; so that all will be known to those who understand and that no path of the paths of the Torah be missing and that they [need] to stray to seek after it in other books. \"Search and read it in the book of the Lord; not one of these shall be absent\" (Isaiah 34:16).",
