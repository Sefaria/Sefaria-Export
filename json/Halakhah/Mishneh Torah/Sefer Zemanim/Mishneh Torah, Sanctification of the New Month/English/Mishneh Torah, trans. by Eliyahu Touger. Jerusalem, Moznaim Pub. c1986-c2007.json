            "The months of the year are lunar months, as [implied by Numbers 28:14]: \"... the burnt offering of the month when it is renewed,\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The concept of a renewal each month is relevant regarding lunar months, but not with regard to solar months. For the moon is not seen for a day or two each month, while the sun shines continually every day throughout the year.</i> and [Exodus 12:2]: \"This month shall be for you the first of months.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although the implication to a lunar month in this verse is not as obvious as in the former verse, there is an explicit teaching from our Sages indicating a connection, as the Rambam proceeds to explain.</i> [Concerning this verse,] our Sages commented:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Mechilta D'Rashbi</i> on the above verse; see also <i>Midrash Tanchumah, Shemini</i>, sec. 8; <i>Menachot</i> 29a.</i> The Holy One, blessed be He, showed Moses in the vision of prophecy an image of the moon and told him, \"When you see the moon like this, sanctify it.\"<br>The years we follow are solar years, as [implied by Deuteronomy 16:1]: \"Keep the month of spring.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 13b (cited by the Rambam, Chapter 4, Halachah 1) explains that this verse is a charge to arrange the calendar so that the vernal (spring) equinox always falls in the month of Nisan.</i>",
            "How much longer is a solar year than a lunar year? Approximately eleven days.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam speaks in more precise figures in Chapter 6. At present, he is speaking in general terms to give an outline of the how the Jewish calendar is structured.</i> Therefore, [to correct the discrepancy between the lunar and the solar calendars,] when these additional days reach a sum of 30 - or slightly more, or slightly less - an additional month is added, causing the year to include thirteen months. This is called a full year.<br>[This is necessary,] because it is impossible to have a year with twelve months and an odd number of days, as [implied by Numbers 28:14]: \"... of the months of the year.\" [On this verse, our Sages<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Megillah</i> 5a.</i> commented:] \"You count the months of a year, but not the days of a year.\"",
            "The moon becomes hidden and cannot be seen for approximately two days - or [slightly] less or slightly more - every month: approximately one day before its conjunction with the sun at the end of the month, and one day after its conjunction with the sun, [before] it is sighted in the west in the evening.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As explained in the notes to Chapter 11, when the sun, the moon, and the earth are aligned in a straight line in that order, the moon reflects the sun's rays directly back to it, and no light can be seen from the earth. This is called the conjunction of the sun and the moon. Afterwards, the moon proceeds in its orbit away from the sun, and within approximately one day's time it will have moved a sufficient distance for it to reflect a small crescent of light to the earth. This crescent will always be sighted first in the western portion of the sky, close to the horizon.<br>The commentaries note that <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 20b states that the moon cannot be seen for twenty-four hours every month. <i>Aruch HaShulchan</i> (<i>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh</i>, sec. 88) explains that there is no contradiction to the Rambam's statements here. There are twenty-four hours every month in which it is impossible to see the moon. There is in addition, however, approximately one day every month when the probability of seeing the moon is very low.</i><br>The first night when the moon is sighted in the west after being hidden is the beginning of the month. Afterwards, 29 days are counted from that day. If the moon is sighted on the night of the thirtieth [day], the thirtieth day will be Rosh Chodesh [of the following month].<br>If it is not sighted, Rosh Chodesh will be on the thirty-first day, and the thirtieth day will be included in the previous month. There is no need [to sight] the moon on the thirty-first night; whether or not [the moon] is sighted [the new month begins that night]. For there are no lunar months longer than thirty days.",
            "When there are twenty-nine days in a month, [because] the moon was sighted on the thirtieth night, the month is called <i>chaseir</i>, [\"lacking\"]. If the moon is not sighted and the previous month has thirty days, the month is called <i>me'ubar</i> [\"pregnant\"] or <i>malei</i> [\"full\"].<br>When the moon is sighted on the thirtieth night, the moon is said to have been sighted at the appropriate time. When the moon is sighted on the thirty-first night, but not on the thirtieth night, the moon is described as having been seen on the night of its fullness.",
            "The [establishment of Rosh Chodesh] based on the sighting of the moon is not the province of every individual,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., in contrast to the Sabbath, a person who thinks that he has sighted the moon may not begin counting the days of the new month on his own initiative. Rather, he must go to the <i>Sanhedrin</i> and present his testimony to them, and it is they who decide whether or not to begin the new month. (Note the Rambam's comments in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> , Positive Commandment 153, where he elaborates on this theme.)</i> as is the Sabbath [of the weekly cycle]. [In the latter instance,] everyone counts six days and rests on the seventh day.<br>[The sanctification of the new month,] by contrast, has been entrusted to the court.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the <i>Sanhedrin</i>, the High Court that held sessions in Jerusalem until the Temple's destruction, and afterwards was located in various cities throughout <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</i> [The new month does not begin] until it has been sanctified by the court, and it is the day that they establish as Rosh Chodesh that is Rosh Chodesh. [This is implied by the verse,] \"This month will be <b>for you</b>...,\" - i.e., the testimony [concerning the new month] will be entrusted to you.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As explained in <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 22a, this command was addressed to Moses and Aaron. The words \"to you\" are seemingly unnecessary. Thus, they are interpreted to mean that just as this command is being given to you, so too, the fulfillment of it in subsequent times will be the responsibility of men like you - i.e., the judges of Israel's High Court. (See Chapter 2, Halachah 8, which mentions an application of this principle. See also Chapter 5, Halachah 1.)</i>",
            "The [High] Court would make calculations in a manner resembling<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Kapach explains that the Rambam chose his wording exactly. The calculations of the High Court merely \"resembled the calculations of the astronomers.\" In truth, however, they operated under a different system. As the Rambam explains in Chapter 17, Halachah 24, the prophets and the descendants of the tribe of Issachar had a method of calculating the movement of the sun, the moon, and the stars, which had been transmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai. Although this method resembled the method of calculations employed by gentile scholars, it was unique and different. (See also the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 2:8.)<br>This method of calculation was lost to our people shortly after the composition of the Mishnah. Subsequent texts, including the Rambam's own system of calculation, as explained from Chapter 11 onward, were based on Greek sources.</i> the calculations of the astronomers, who know the location of the stars and their paths [in their orbits]. They would perform careful research to determine whether or not they would be able to sight the moon at the appropriate time - i.e., the thirtieth night.<br>If [the judges] determined that it was possible to sight [the moon], they would sit waiting for witnesses [to come and testify] throughout the entire thirtieth day. If witnesses came, and [the court] examined their testimony according to law, and verified the truth [of their statements], the court would sanctify [the new month]. If [the moon] was not sighted, and witnesses did not come,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because the moon was covered with clouds or for other similar reasons. (See Chapter 18, Halachah 1.)</i> they would complete the thirtieth day, thus making the month full.<br>If, according to their calculations, [the judges] knew that it was impossible for the moon to be sighted, they would not sit [in session] on the thirtieth day, nor would they await [the arrival] of witnesses. If witnesses came, they would know that they are false witnesses, or that clouds appeared to them in a form resembling the moon, but it was not the real moon.",
            "It is a positive commandment of the Torah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 153) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 4), which consider this to be one of the Torah's 613 mitzvot.</i> for the court to calculate and determine whether or not the moon will be sighted, to examine witnesses until the moon can be sanctified, and to send forth [messengers] to inform the remainder of the people on which day Rosh Chodesh was observed,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam mentions three activities imperative on the court in fulfillment of this mitzvah: the calculation of the time for the sighting of the moon, the examination of the witnesses, and the notification of the Jewish people.<br>It is interesting to note that the structure of <i>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh</i> represents somewhat of a departure from the Rambam's usual style of presentation in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. He generally begins by citing a mitzvah and the proof-text from which it is derived, and afterwards he describes it. In this instance, the Rambam begins by describing the basic ground rules for the sighting of the moon, and afterwards he explains the mitzvah that is associated with this sighting.<br>Rav Kapach suggests that this approach could have been taken in reaction to the position of Rav Sa'adiah Gaon, who maintains that the fundamental aspect of determining the calendar was not the sighting of the moon, but rather the calculations of the Sages. See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 2:6).</i> so that they will know the day [on which to celebrate] the festivals [as implied by Leviticus 23:2]: \"that you will pronounce as days of holy convocation,\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As stated in the conclusion of Chapter 2, this verse is an indication that the determination of the days on which the festivals are to be celebrated - and thus the establishment of the monthly calendar on which the former depends - was entrusted to the Jewish High Court.</i> and [as implied by Exodus 13:10]: \"And you shall observe this statute in its appointed season.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This verse refers to the Paschal sacrifice and teaches us that there is an obligation to \"observe this statute,\" bring the Paschal sacrifice, \"at its appointed time\" - i.e., in the spring. This alludes to the second dimension of this mitzvah, the establishment of leap years so that the holiday of Pesach will always fall in the spring.<br>Note the Ramban (<i>Hasagot</i> to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot, Shoresh</i> 1), who cites opinions that consider these two dimensions - the establishment of Rosh Chodesh and the decision whether to observe leap years - as two separate mitzvot.<br>The Rambam's citation of this proof-text has attracted the attention of commentaries because of another difficulty. In <i>Menachot</i> 36b, the meaning of this verse is the subject of a difference of opinion between Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yosse HaG'lili. While the simple meaning of the phrase \"this statute\" is the Paschal sacrifice - and this is the interpretation of Rabbi Akiva - Rabbi Yosse HaG'lili interprets the phrase as referring to the mitzvah of wearing tefillin.<br>What is significant is that in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Rambam cites both the interpretations of Rabbi Akiva (in this halachah) and that of Rabbi Yosse HaG'lili (<i>Hilchot Tefillin</i> 4:10) as Torah law. The commentaries (see Radbaz, Vol. V, Responsum 1693) explain that this is indicative of a general pattern within the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. The Rambam's intent in composing the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> was to provide us with a text of Torah practice, not a source book explaining the derivation of Torah law. He refers to verses only when they are necessary as supports. Therefore, in each instance he cites the proof-text that has the most obvious connection to the law or principle he is referring to, although it is possible that there is another verse from which this law was actually derived.</i>",
            "The calculations and the establishment of the months and the leap years is carried out only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> [as implied by Isaiah 2:3]: \"For out of Zion will emerge the law, and the word of God [will emerge] from Jerusalem.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot, loc. cit.</i>, where the Rambam explains the connection of this mitzvah - and the Jewish people as a whole - to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> in stirring terms.</i><br>If a great sage who received <i>semichah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The ordination conveyed upon the Sages from Sage to Sage, in a chain that began with Moses himself.

They found that they could not convince the majority of the people to reject the Torah entirely, so they adopted a different tactic. They claimed that they were true to Torah, but the only Torah that was Godly was the written law. The oral law, they maintained, was merely a human invention.<br>This thesis was only a ruse to sway the people from the performance of the mitzvot. Accordingly, the Sages would refer to all those who deny the Torah and its tradition as Sadducees (from Tzadok) or Baithosees (from Baithos) [the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Avot</i> 1:3]. Not only did these individuals scorn Torah observance themselves, but they tried, as indicated by this halachah, to undermine the observance of the Jewish nation as a whole.<br>Our translation follows the standard printed text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. Many original printings and manuscripts state <i>minnim</i>, \"non-believers,\" rather than \"the followers of Baithos.\" Similarly, the Rambam's source, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 2:1, uses this term.

            "If witnesses say, \"We saw [the moon] without concentrating our attention, and, afterwards, when we concentrated our attention with the intent of sighting it so that we could testify, we did not see it,\" this is not considered [valid] testimony, and it cannot serve as the basis for sanctifying [the new moon]. Perhaps clouds came together, and appeared like the moon, and afterwards became dispersed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 24a and 25a mentions instances where the conjunction of the clouds appeared to resemble the moon.</i><br>If witnesses say, \"We saw [the moon] on the twenty-ninth [day] in the morning in the east before sunrise, and [afterwards,] in the evening, we saw it in the west on the thirtieth night,\" their testimony is believed, and the moon can be sanctified on this basis. [The rationale is] that they saw [the moon] at its appropriate time. [Their testimony] about [what they thought] they saw in the morning is disregarded. We need not pay any attention to what they saw in the morning, for it is obvious that it was the conjunction of clouds that appeared to them as the moon.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's statements are based on his interpretation of the difference of opinion between Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri mentioned in <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 2:9. (See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah for a detailed analysis of this matter.)<br>Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri maintains that the witnesses' testimony should be disregarded, because it cannot possibly be true. Everyone knows that, at the beginning of the month, the moon always appears on the western horizon for a brief period after the setting of the sun. At this time of the month, seeing it in the morning, before sunrise, is impossible. (See Chapters 15 and 17 for an explanation of this phenomenon.) Since the testimony of these witnesses contains an obvious error, the testimony should be disregarded entirely.<br>Rabban Gamliel, as his opinion is explained by the Rambam, was aware of this astronomical concept as well. Nevertheless, in the instance mentioned in the Mishnah, he knew that according to the calculations, it would have been possible for the moon to have been sighted on the night mentioned by the witnesses. Why then, he argued, should their testimony be discounted entirely because of the error they made regarding the morning. The fact that then, they mistook the condensation of clouds for the moon should not cause their testimony to be disregarded entirely.</i><br>Similarly, if [witnesses claim] to have seen the moon at its appropriate time, but it was not seen on the thirty-first night, their [testimony] is believed. For what is significant for us is only the sighting [of the moon] on the thirtieth night.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This represents a parallel difference of opinion mentioned in <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> (<i>op. cit.</i>). Rabbi Dosa ben Hyrkanos maintains that it is impossible for the moon to be sighted on one night, and then for it not to be sighted on the following night.<br>Rabban Gamliel (as his position is explained by the Rambam in his Commentary on the Mishnah) accepted the witnesses' testimony in this instance, because he knew that, according to the calculations, it was possible for the moon to be sighted on the thirtieth night. The fact that it was not sighted again on the thirty-first night was merely a matter of circumstance: no one was trying to see it, their view was obstructed by clouds, or the like.</i>",

One might think that the year should be made full to enable the priests enough time to offer a new red heifer and prepare ashes.

[For it is they] alone, or a court of judges possessing <i>semichah</i> that holds sessions in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and that was granted authority by the <i>Sanhedrin</i>, [who may authorize these decisions].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ramban [in his gloss on <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 153)] differs and explains that although it was necessary for the judges who established the calendar to have <i>semichah</i>, there was no necessity that this function be carried out by the <i>Sanhedrin</i> or a court deputized by it.</i><br>[This concept is derived] from the command given Moses and Aaron [Exodus 12:2]: \"This month shall be for you the first of months\" The Oral Tradition as passed down, teacher to student, from Moses our teacher [throughout the generations, explains that] the verse is interpreted as follows:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This explanation was recorded for posterity in <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 21b.</i> This testimony is entrusted to you and those [sages] who arise after you and who function in your position.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., to the Sages of the <i>Sanhedrin</i>, who preserve the tradition of the Jewish court as initiated by Moses and Aaron.</i><br>When, however, there is no <i>Sanhedrin</i> in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, we establish the monthly calendar and institute leap years solely according to the fixed calendar that is followed now.",
            "This concept is a halachah communicated to Moses on [Mount] Sinai:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Introduction to his Commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam defines a halachah communicated to Moses on [Mount] Sinai as a law that is neither explicitly stated nor alluded to in the Written Law, but communicated through the Oral Tradition.<br>See also the statements of the Ramban (<i>loc. cit.</i>), who objects to the Rambam's statements, and asks which source states that this is a halachah communicated to Moses on Mount Sinai.</i> When there is a <i>Sanhedrin</i>, the monthly calendar is established according to the sighting of the moon. When there is no <i>Sanhedrin</i>, the monthly calendar is established according to the fixed calendar that we follow now, and the sighting of the moon is of no consequence.<br>When the fixed calendar is followed, there are times when the day established [as Rosh Chodesh] will be the day on which the moon is sighted, and there are times when the sighting will either precede or follow it by a day.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As explained in Chapter 6, the fixed calendar is based on the mean motion of the sun and the moon - i.e., their average rate of progress in the heavens. As explained in Chapter 11 onwards, the progress of the sun, and to an even greater extent that of the moon, deviates from this mean from time to time. Although ultimately these deviations will balance out, at any given time the day established as Rosh Chodesh may be before or after the day on which the moon can be sighted.</i> It is, however, an extremely extraordinary phenomenon for [the day established as Rosh Chodesh] to be a day after the sighting [of the moon], [and this is possible only] in the lands that are west of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As explained in Chapter 18, Halachah 13, in the lands west of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> the moon is sighted earlier than in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</i>",
            "When did the entire Jewish people begin using this calendar? At the conclusion of the Talmudic period, when <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> was in ruin, and an established court no longer remained there.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Based on the Rambam's statements in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the <i>Chatam Sofer</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i>, Responsum 234) explains that the Rambam's intent is that, from that time onward, a formal court no longer held sessions in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>; the land, however, remained populated by Jews. (See the notes on Halachah 5.)</i> In the era of the Sages of the Mishnah, and in the era of the Sages of the Gemara until the time of Abbaye and Ravvah,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This concept is derived from <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 21a, which states that Ravvah fasted two days on Yom Kippur, because he did not know which day was established by the court in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</i> [the people] would rely on the establishment [of the calendar] in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to the establishment of the fixed calendar by Rabbi Hillel (Hillel II), approximately two generations after the composition of the Jerusalem Talmud.<br>Most commentaries assume that the Rambam's intent is that until the time of Rabbi Hillel (not Hillel the Great, but a descendant of his, who lived several hundred years afterwards), the court sanctified the moon based on the testimony of witnesses. Rav Kapach objects to this interpretation, noting that the sanctification of the moon required judges with <i>semichah</i>, and it appears that the practice of <i>semichah</i> had been nullified prior to this time.<br>Noting the precise words used by the Rambam, \"[The people] would rely on the establishment [of the calendar] in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>,\" Rav Kapach explains that the sanctification of the moon based on the testimony of witnesses had ended several generations previously, with the cessation of the practice of <i>semichah</i>. Nevertheless, the international Jewish community would look to the court in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> for the establishment of the calendar. For the family of the <i>Nesi'im</i> had a private tradition regarding the calculation of the calendar. Nevertheless, at the time of Rabbi Hillel, this practice was also discontinued, and a fixed calendar was established that did not require the authority of any particular court.</i>",
            "When the <i>Sanhedrin</i> functioned and the calendar was established based on the sighting [of the moon], the inhabitants of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and, [similarly, the inhabitants of] all the places where the messengers of Tishrei<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 3, Halachot 11-13.</i> would arrive, would celebrate the holidays for one day only.<br>The inhabitants of the distant places that were not reached by the messengers of Tishrei would celebrate two days because of the doubt involved. For they did not know the day that the inhabitants of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> established as [the beginning of] the new month.",
            "In the present era, when the <i>Sanhedrin</i> no longer exists, and the court of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> establishes [the months] according to the [fixed] calendar,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Implicit in the Rambam's words is a concept explained in greater detail in Halachah 13: The determination of the calendar depends on the establishment of the calendar by the court in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</i> according to law, it would be appropriate for [Jews] throughout the world to celebrate the holidays for one day alone.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As prescribed by the Torah. Once the date on which the festivals should be celebrated could be universally known because of the fixed calendar, the safeguard of celebrating the holidays for two days was no longer necessary.</i> For [the inhabitants of] the distant regions of the diaspora and the inhabitants of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> rely on the same [fixed] calendar and establish [the festivals] accordingly. Nevertheless, the Sages ordained [that the inhabitants of the diaspora] retain the custom of their ancestors.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Beitzah</i> 4b explains that this rule was ordained lest the gentile authorities oppress the Jewish people and prevent the inhabitants of the diaspora from communicating the tradition of the calendar to their descendants. They would then have to rely on information conveyed from <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> again.</i>",
            "Therefore, [the inhabitants of] all the places that the messengers of Tishrei would not reach in the era when the messengers were sent out should celebrate two days even in the present era, just as they did when the inhabitants of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> established [the calendar] according to the sighting of the moon.<br>In the present era, the inhabitants of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> continue their custom and celebrate one day;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See, however, Halachot 11 and 12.</i> for they never celebrated two days. Thus, our celebration of the second day of the holidays in the diaspora at present is a Rabbinic institution.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., originally, the second day of the holidays was observed because of the doubt of the day on which to observe the Torah's commandment. In the present era there is no longer any doubt, and the observance of the second day of a holiday has the status of a Rabbinic ordinance.</i>",
            "[Even] when the calendar was established based on the sighting of the moon, the majority of the inhabitants of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> would celebrate Rosh HaShanah for two days, because of the doubt involved.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To explain: Generally, the court would endeavor to structure the calendar so that the moon would be sighted on the thirtieth night of Elul. In expectation of the probability that the following day would be declared Rosh HaShanah, the people would observe all the holiday prohibitions and sound the shofar on the thirtieth day. Nevertheless, since it was possible that the moon had not been sighted, the people outside the immediate surroundings of Jerusalem would observe the following day as well.<br>See the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Eruvin</i> 3:9) which states that the observance of Rosh HaShanah for two days was ordained by \"the prophets of the earlier generations.\" <i>Sotah</i> 48b states that this term refers to the prophets of the First Temple era.</i> They would not know the day on which the court established the new month, because the messengers would not depart on the holiday.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 3, Halachah 8.</i>",
            "Moreover, even in Jerusalem, where the court would hold session, there were many times when the holiday of Rosh HaShanah was celebrated for two days. For if witnesses did not arrive on the thirtieth day [following Rosh Chodesh Elul], the day on which they had awaited [the arrival of] witnesses would be regarded as holy,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned above, except for the offering of the Rosh HaShanah sacrifices, the thirtieth day following Rosh Chodesh Elul was always observed as Rosh HaShanah in expectation of the arrival of witnesses.</i> and the following day would be regarded as holy.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For it would actually be observed as Rosh HaShanah.</i><br>Since [there were times when] they would observe [Rosh HaShanah for] two days even when they sanctified the months according to the sighting [of the moon], [our Sages] ordained that even the inhabitants of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Including even the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</i> should always celebrate [Rosh HaShanah] for two days in the present era, when [the holidays] are established based on the fixed calendar. Thus, even [the observance of] the second day of Rosh HaShanah in the present era is a Rabbinic ordinance.",
            "The celebration of the holidays for one or two days is not dependent on geographic distance [alone]. What is implied?<br>If a place is located within a five-day - or less - journey from Jerusalem, and thus it was surely possible for the messengers to reach them, we do not postulate that the inhabitants celebrate only one day. For we have no way of knowing whether or not the messengers [of the High Court] would journey to this place.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As the Rambam continues to explain, the determining factor is not the geographic distance of a place from Jerusalem, but rather the custom followed in this place at the time when the High Court sent out messengers.</i> Perhaps the messengers did not journey to this place because it was not populated by Jews at that time. [And if] it became populated by Jews after it [had become customary] to establish [the festivals] according to the fixed calendar, they [would be] obligated to celebrate two days.<br>Alternatively, [perhaps the messengers did not reach there,] because there was a blockade on the way, as existed between Jerusalem and the Galilee during the time of the Mishnah,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Bava Batra</i> 38a and <i>Ketubot</i> 17b, which tell of a time when a blockade prevented communication between Jerusalem and the Galilee.</i> or perhaps the Samaritans would prevent the messengers from passing through their [territory].",
            "If the matter were dependent on geographic distance alone, all the inhabitants of Egypt would observe the holidays for only one day, for it is possible for the messengers of Tishrei to reach them. The distance between Jerusalem and Egypt via Ashkelon is a journey of eight days or less. Similar concepts apply regarding the majority of Syria. One thus can conclude that the matter is not dependent solely on geographic distance.",
            "Thus, the principles governing this matter can be summarized as follows: Whenever the distance between Jerusalem and a particular place exceeds a ten-day journey, the inhabitants should observe [the holidays] for two days, as was their previous custom. For the messengers sent out for Tishrei [cannot be guaranteed] to reach places other than those within a ten-day journey from Jerusalem.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For the messengers were forbidden to travel on Rosh HaShanah, Yom Kippur, and the two Sabbaths between Rosh HaShanah and Sukkot. In the years when Rosh HaShanah is observed on the Sabbath, the messengers could proceed a further day. Nevertheless, since this is not so in the majority of the years, a ten-day journey is accepted as the standard measure.</i><br>[The following rules apply when, by contrast,] places are a ten-day journey or less from Jerusalem, and thus it is possible that the messengers could have reached them: We see whether that place is [located in the portions of] <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> that were inhabited by Jews during the time the calendar was established on the basis of the sighting [of the moon] during the second conquest [of the land] - e.g., Usha, Shefaram, Luz, Yavneh, Nov, Tiberias, and the like. [The inhabitants of these places] should celebrate only one day.<br>If the place is part of Syria<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 1:3, which defines Syria as referring to lands conquered by King David before the entire territory of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> proper had been conquered. Therefore, it was not considered part of the Holy Land with regard to most ritual questions according to the Torah itself. Nevertheless, the Rabbis extended many of the laws applying to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> to this territory as well.</i> - e.g., Tyre, Damascus, Ashkelon,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The inclusion of Ashkelon, which is located to the southwest of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, in Syria clearly indicates that the Rambam is referring to the halachic conception of the latter term, and not the geographic one, since Syria is to the northeast of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<br>There is, however, a slight difficulty with the Rambam's statements: In <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 1:9, he describes Ashkelon as being part of the diaspora.</i>and the like - they should follow the custom of their ancestors. If [the custom was to celebrate] one day, [they should celebrate] one day. [If the custom was] two days, [they should celebrate] two days.",
            "When a place is located within a journey of ten days or less from Jerusalem, and it is part of Syria or the diaspora, and [its inhabitants] have no [established] custom conveyed [from previous generations], they should celebrate two days, as is customary in the world at large. [The same rules apply to] a city that was created in the desert of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, or a city first populated by Jews in the present era.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Based on this halachah, according to the Rambam, most Jews living in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> today should celebrate the holidays for two days. Indeed, the <i>Eretz Tzvi</i>, a text that documents the prevailing customs in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> before the waves of European immigration, states that in cities like Ramlah, that did not have an existing custom dating back to the Talmudic period, the holidays would be celebrated for two days, as the Rambam states.<br>It was not until the resettlement of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> in the present era that such cities began observing the holidays for only one day. The source for this practice is the commentary of the Ritba (<i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 16b), who states that, in the present era, it is the geographic definitions of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and the diaspora that determine whether or not one should celebrate one day.<br>[It must be emphasized that even according to the Ritba, it is questionable whether the inhabitants of areas of the Negev below Beersheba should celebrate the holidays for only one day. For these places are also beyond the geographic limits of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> of the Talmudic period.]</i><br>[At present,] the celebration of the second day of a holiday is always a Rabbinic institution. This applies even to the celebration of the second day of Rosh HaShanah, which is observed by all Jews in the present era.",
            "The calculations that we follow in the present era, every individual in his community, to ascertain which day is Rosh Chodesh and which day is Rosh HaShanah, do not determine [the calendar], nor do we rely on these calculations. For we do not institute leap years or establish the monthly calendar in the diaspora. We rely on the calculations of the inhabitants of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and their establishment of the calendar.<br>The reason we make calculations is merely for the sake of information. For we know that the inhabitants of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> rely on the same calendar. Thus, our calculations are intended to determine the day that the inhabitants of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> establish as Rosh Chodesh or a festival. For it is the establishment of the calendar by the inhabitants of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> that establishes a day as Rosh Chodesh or a festival, not our calculations of the calendar.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's statements in this halachah are a reiteration of the principles he expresses in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot, loc. cit.</i> Citing Isaiah 2:3, \"Out of Zion shall come forth the Torah,\" the Rambam emphasizes that the determination of the calendar is solely the province of the inhabitants of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<br>Until the time of Rabbi Hillel, the court of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> determined the calendar through their independent calculations. Even after the court ceased to function and the fixed calendar was adopted, the determination of the calendar still depends on the establishment of the calendar in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. The only difference is that from the time of Rabbi Hillel onward, instead of determining the calendar independently, the inhabitants of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> would rely on the fixed calendar.<br>For this reason, the Rambam points to a Divine covenant insuring that there will always be Jews living in our Holy Land. For were there not to be any Jews living in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, heaven forbid, we would not be able to determine the calendar. (See <i>Chatam Sofer</i>, <i>Yoreh De'ah</i>, Responsum 234).</i>"

            "When [the new moon] was sanctified [based on the testimony of witnesses regarding] the sighting of the moon, the court would calculate the time of the conjunction of the sun and the moon in an exact manner, as the astronomers do.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The term conjunction refers to the point when the sun, the moon and the earth are positioned in that order in a direct line. Therefore, as seen from the earth, the moon does not reflect the light of the sun. [When the sun and the moon have the same latitude (see Chapter 16) - i.e., when they are in the same plane - a conjunction is the cause of a solar eclipse. Ordinarily, however, there is a difference in latitude, and an alignment of this nature does not cause an eclipse.]</i> [This enabled them] to know whether or not the moon would be sighted.<br>The first level of these calculations represent approximations of the time of the conjunction, and their accuracy is not great. This approximation of the time of the conjunction is calculated according to the mean rates of movements.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our translation differs from the standard published text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, and is based on the version found in authoritative manuscripts and early printings.<br>The term mean rate of movement refers to the average movement of the sun or the moon in angular degrees over a particular period. To explain: It was easy to calculate the number of conjunctions between one solar eclipse and another. Afterwards, this number would be multiplied by 360 (the number of degrees in a circle) and then divided by the number of years, months, days, or hours (depending on the mean one wanted to reach) that had passed between the two eclipses.<br>In fact, however, the sun - and to a much greater extent, the moon - would deviate from this mean rate of movement - i.e., the position in which they are located in the heavens differs from the position that would be reached by calculating the mean rate of progress. As is explained in the succeeding chapters, there are various ways of correcting and adjusting these mean calculations so that the actual position of these celestial bodies can be determined.</i> The time of the conjunction as calculated in this manner is referred to as the <i>molad</i>.<br>The essentials of the calculations that are used when a court to sanctify [the new moon based on the testimony of witnesses of] the sighting [of the moon] does not exist - i.e., the calculations we use today - are referred to as <i>ibbur</i>. To explain:",
            "Day and night are constantly considered a twenty-four hour composite, [on the average:] twelve [hours] of daylight and twelve [hours] of night. An hour can be divided into 1080 units. This number was chosen because it can be divided in half, into fourths, eighths, thirds, sixths, ninths, and tenths.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The only integer that cannot be divided into this sum is seven. The commentaries have noted that the number 360 also can be divided into all the fractions mentioned by the Rambam and question why he did not use this smaller figure.</i> Each of these fractions contains many of these units.",
            "According to this calculation, [the interval] between one conjunction of the moon and the sun and the subsequent conjunction according to their mean movement is twenty-nine full days, twelve hours of the thirtieth day, and 793 units of the thirteenth hour. This is the interval between one conjunction and the next, [and thus,] the length of a lunar month.",
            "[Accordingly,] an [ordinary] lunar year, which includes twelve of these months, would include three hundred fifty-four days, eight hours, and eight hundred seventy-six units.<br>A leap year, which would include thirteen of these months, would include three hundred eighty-three days, twenty-one hours, and five hundred eighty-nine units.<br>A solar year is three hundred sixty-five days and six hours.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 9, Halachah 1, which explains that there are two views concerning whether this is an approximation or an exact figure.

            "When the days of a lunar month are counted in groups of seven, according to the weekly cycle, there is a remainder of one day, twelve hours, and 793 units (in numerical terms, 1 - 12 - 793).

One may follow this same method [of calculation] month after month for eternity.",
            "Similarly, if you know the time of the conjunction for a particular year and you add its remainder - either the remainder of an ordinary year or the remainder of a leap year - to the time of the conjunction, you will determine the time of the conjunction of the following year.

According to this conception, the conjunction for Rosh HaShanah, the day of Adam's creation, was the fourteenth hour of Friday (the second hour after sunrise). Since the first day of creation was the twenty-fifth of Elul, the year prior to that of Adam's creation is also significant. To calculate the conjunction of that year, we subtract the remainder of an ordinary year - 4 days, 8 hours, and 876 units - from six days and fourteen hours. This produces the figure cited by the Rambam.</i> (in numerical terms, 2 - 5 - 204). This is the starting point for these calculations.",

When a sum of twenty-four hours is reached, it should be counted as a day, and added to the number of days. When the number of days is greater than seven, [all multiples of] seven should be subtracted from the sum, and the remainder be focused on.<br>For the purpose of our calculations is not to know the number of days, but rather to know on which day of the week, and at what hour and after how many units will the conjunction take place.",
            "[The fixed calendar is structured in] a nineteen-year cycle, including seven leap years and twelve ordinary years. This is called a <i>machzor</i>.<br>Why was this [structure] chosen? Because when you total the number of days in twelve ordinary years and seven leap years together with their hours and their units, counting all [sums of] 1080 units as an hour, [all sums of] twenty-four hours as a day, and adding them to the number of days, the total will equal nineteen solar years, each of these years being 365 days and six hours.<br>The difference between the days of the solar calendar [and the lunar calendar] will be only one hour and 485 units (in numerical terms, 1 - 485).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned in Halachah 4, each ordinary lunar year is 10 days, 21 hours, and 204 units shorter than a solar year.

Thus, the difference between the seven leap years of a nineteen-year cycle and the corresponding solar years is 130 days, 12 hours, and 883 units. When this sum is subtracted from the figure mentioned in the previous paragraph, the remainder mentioned by the Rambam is reached.<br>As explained in Chapter 10, Halachah 1, there is another reckoning, which maintains that the nineteen-year cycle produces a more exact interrelation between the two calendars.</i>",
            "Thus, in such a [nineteen-year] cycle, the months are lunar months, and the years are solar years.

As is explained in the subsequent chapters of the text, the new moon does not become visible until several hours after the conjunction between the moon and the sun. Thus, if the conjunction takes place after noon, it is impossible for the moon to be sighted on that day. Therefore, Rosh HaShanah is celebrated on the following day. (See <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 20b and commentaries.)<br>There is a slight difficulty in the Rambam's statements, for based on Chapter 15, Halachah 2, it would appear that at certain times it is possible to sight the moon only five hours after conjunction.</i><br>What is implied?

As mentioned previously, 4 days, 8 hours, and 876 units is the remainder of a normal year. To calculate the conjunction of Tishrei in the following year, this figure should be added to 3 - 9 - 204 (the day and the time mentioned by the Rambam above). The result is 12:00 noon on the Sabbath.<br>As explained above, when the conjunction takes place at 12:00 noon or later, the celebration of Rosh HaShanah is postponed to the following day. In this instance, however, the following day is Sunday, and Rosh HaShanah never begins on that day. Thus, the holiday would have to be celebrated on Monday. If Rosh HaShanah had been celebrated on Tuesday of the previous year, there would have been a six-day difference between the days on which the holiday was celebrated in these two successive years, producing a year of 356 days, one day longer than the maximum length of an ordinary year. To avoid this, Rosh HaShanah is not celebrated on Tuesday. Since it also is never celebrated on Wednesday, it is postponed until Thursday, producing a lunar year of 354 days (<i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 428).</i>",

When, in an effort to calculate the time of the conjunction of the leap year, this figure is subtracted from 2 - 15 - 589 (the day and the time mentioned by the Rambam), the result is Tuesday at noon.<br>As mentioned, when the conjunction takes place at 12:00 noon or later, the celebration of Rosh HaShanah is postponed to the following day. In this instance, however, the following day is Wednesday, and Rosh HaShanah never begins on that day. Thus, in the leap year, Rosh HaShanah began on Thursday. If Rosh HaShanah were celebrated on Monday in the year after the leap year, this would produce only a four-day difference between the days on which the holiday was celebrated in these two successive years, causing the length of the year to be only 382 days. To avoid this, in the year following the leap year Rosh HaShanah is celebrated on Tuesday, rather than on Monday, causing the leap year to be 383 days long (<i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 428).</i>",

The Talmud states that if Rosh HaShanah falls on either Wednesday or Friday, Yom Kippur will fall on either Friday or Sunday, and thus there would be two consecutive days, Yom Kippur and the Sabbath, when it would be forbidden to bury the dead. In the Talmudic era, this could have caused a corpse to deteriorate, detracting from its honor and respect.<br>Alternatively, the Sages state that if Rosh HaShanah fell on any of these three days, there would be two successive days when it would be forbidden to pick fresh vegetables, and the people would be unable to celebrate the festivals or the Sabbath properly.<br><i>Sukkah</i> 43a gives another reason why Rosh HaShanah is not held on Sunday: were this to be the case, <i>Hoshana Rabbah,</i> the seventh day of Sukkot, would fall on the Sabbath. In such an instance, restrictions were placed on the willow ritual in the Temple. (See <i>Hilchot Shofar, Sukkah V'Lulav</i> 7:21-22.) To avoid such an instance, the Sages structured the calendar so that Rosh HaShanah never falls on Sunday.<br>In defense of the Rambam's position, it must be noted that both earlier (Rabbenu Chanan'el) and subsequent (the <i>P'nei Yehoshua</i>) Talmudic commentaries understood the reasons given by the Talmud as being merely the external dimension of the rationale for the calendar's adjustment, while the inner meaning is associated with the actual position of the sun and the moon in the heavenly sphere.<br>Even according to this perspective, there is, however, a difficulty with the Rambam's statements. Although it is correct that the true positions of the sun and the moon often differ from the position determined by calculating their mean movement, the concept of postponing the celebration of Rosh HaShanah on these three days appears arbitrary and without any obvious connection to the movement of these bodies in the celestial sphere. The commentaries note that explanations why Rosh HaShanah is not celebrated on these days are found in the Kabbalah.</i><br>What is implied?

Thirty-five days are five full weeks.<br>Based on this calculation, it is each twenty-eight years that the sun returns to its original position at the time of creation.

Similarly, if one desires to make pre-calculated figures for the mean distance for twenty days, for thirty days, for forty days, until one hundred days, one may do so.

Therefore, there is one point in their orbits where they are furthest removed from the Earth. The knowledge of the location of this point is significant in calculating the true position of the sun, as will be explained in the following chapter.</i> With the exception of the moon, that point in the orbit of the sun and, similarly, in the orbit of the other planets rotates in a uniform pattern, traveling about one degree in seventy years.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As the Rambam mentions in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 3:3, not only do the sun and the stars move in their orbits, the orbits themselves move in the heavens. This movement can be seen most clearly by charting the movement of the apogee, the point in the orbit furthest from the Earth. The movement of the sun's orbit and similarly, that of the other stars, is relatively slow. The moon's orbit, by contrast, is moving at a much faster pace, as mentioned in the notes on Chapter 14, Halachah 1.</i> This point is referred to as the apogee.<br>Accordingly, in ten days, the apogee of the sun travels one and a half seconds - i.e., [a second and] thirty thirds. Thus, in one hundred days, [the apogee] travels fifteen seconds. In one thousand days, it travels two minutes and thirty seconds, and in ten thousand days, 25 minutes. In twenty-nine days, it travels four seconds and a fraction. In a regular year, it travels 53 seconds.<br>As mentioned, the starting point for all our calculations is the eve of Thursday, the third of Nisan, 4938 years after creation. The position of the sun in terms of its mean distance on this date was 7 degrees, 3 minutes and 32 seconds in the constellation of Aries, in symbols 7° 3' 32\".

The result is the mean position of the sun on that particular day. For example, if we desired to determine the mean position of the sun at the beginning of the eve of the Sabbath on the fourteenth of the month of Tammuz of the present year, the starting point [for these calculations, we should do the following]: Calculate the number of days from the starting point until the date on which you desire to know the position of the sun. [In this instance,] it is one hundred days. The mean distance the sun travels in one hundred days is 98° 33' 53\". We then add that to the starting point, which is 7° 3' 32\", and arrive at a total of 105 degrees, 37 minutes and 25 seconds, in symbols 105° 37' 25\". Thus, the sun's mean position at the beginning of this night will be 15 degrees and 37 minutes of the sixteenth degree in the constellation of Cancer.<br>At times, the sun will be located in the mean [position] that can be determined using the above methods of calculation at the beginning of the night, and at times an hour before the setting of the sun, or an hour afterwards.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since, as explained in the previous chapter, the mean distance does not represent the place where the sun can actually be seen in the sky, there will be a slight discrepancy.

Add to the starting point the distance it travels over the course of days or years, and you will know the position of the apogee of the sun for the day you desire.<br>Similarly, if you desire to establish another date as the starting point instead of the date which [we have chosen] to begin in this year, [choosing] a year that will be the beginning of a particular nineteen-year cycle, or that will be the beginning of a new century, you may.

If its months are full, it will be thirty-one days longer than a regular year. If its months are lacking, it will be twenty-nine days longer than a regular year.<br>Since these principles are already established, it is possible to calculate the mean distance traveled by the sun for as many years or as many days as you desire, and add it to [the mean position of the sun on the date established previously as] the starting point, and you will be able to determine the mean [position of the sun] for any future date. Afterwards, you can use that date as a starting point.<br>[Conversely,] you may subtract the mean [distance traveled by the sun over the course of a particular period] from [the mean position of the sun on the date established previously as] the starting point, and you will be able to determine the mean [position of the sun] for any past date. Afterwards, you can use that date as a starting point.<br>The same principles also apply with regard to the mean position of the moon or any of the other planets, if [their mean positions on any particular date] are known to you.

The deviations of the moon from its mean rate of advance, however, are larger than that of the sun, and more irregular.

Subtract the sun's mean from the moon's mean and double the remainder.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam is following the notion that the Earth does not lie at the center of the moon's orbit. Hence, like the sun, the moon has an apogee and a perigee.<br>Also of significance here is the fact that, as mentioned in the notes on the previous chapter, the orbit of the moon is moving from east to west at a relatively fast pace, 11 degrees, 12 minutes and 19 seconds per day.<br>A conjunction refers to the time the sun, the moon, and the Earth are aligned in a straight line. Accordingly, the sun's rays are reflected back without being observed from the Earth, and the moon is therefore not seen in the heavens. At the time of the conjunction, the moon is always at its apogee.<br>(This can be explained as follows: When the moon is aligned directly between the sun and the Earth, it is at the point in its orbit that is closest to the sun. Therefore, the gravitational pull of the sun draws the moon away from the Earth.)<br>As the moon continues in its orbit, after the conjunction, it and its apogee move away from the sun in opposite directions. Significantly, the angular distance traveled by the moon and its apogee from the sun is the same.<br>To explain: The moon's mean is moving at rate of 13 degrees, 10 minutes and 35 seconds per day from west to east. Since the sun is also moving from west to east at the rate of 59 minutes and eight seconds per day, every day the moon will have traveled 12 degrees, 11 minutes and 27 seconds from the sun. Its apogee is moving from east to west at a speed of 11 degrees, 12 minutes and 19 seconds per day. When the sun's mean motion is added to that figure, the same total, 12 degrees, 11 minutes and 27 seconds, is reached. Thus, the double elongation, which is calculated by doubling the angular distance between the moon's mean and the sun's mean, represents the angular distance between the moon's mean and the apogee of its orbit.<br>(The moon also reaches its apogee when it is full. At this point, the sun, the Earth, and the moon are aligned in a straight line, and the gravitational pull of the sun draws the Earth away from the moon. According to contemporary science, however, these two figures are not alike, and the apogee reached at conjunction is greater than the apogee reached at a full moon.)</i> The resulting figure is referred to as the double elongation.",

Unless it moves that distance, its crescent will be too small to be noticed in the sky. This distance will be covered by the moon in slightly less than five hours. Thus, within five hours of the conjunction of the sun and the moon, it will be possible to sight the new moon.<br>The commentaries have noted a slight incongruity between the Rambam's statements here and his statements at the beginning of Chapter 17, where he states that the longitude at the night of the sighting of the moon will not be less than nine degrees nor more than twenty-four degrees. There is a difference of approximately seven degrees between these two figures. They attempt to resolve this discrepancy by stating that in this chapter the Rambam is speaking in terms of mean distance, while in Chapter 17 he is speaking in terms of true distance. At times, there can be as great as a seven-degree fluctuation between the two figures (<i>Perush,</i> Ralbach).</i> or more than 62 degrees<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">At this time, 61 hours will have passed since the time of the conjunction, and the moon will have moved 31 degrees from the sun.

The Rambam is stating that a further adjustment is necessary, depending on the distance between the moon and the sun.<br>During the first days of the month, as the distance between the sun and the moon increases, the moon's progress in its epicycle will vary from its standard rate of progress. According to the medieval science, this variation depends on the movement of the <i>nekudah hanochachit</i>, the point opposite the center of the moon's orbit.

If [the length of] the double elongation is between 60 and 63 degrees, one should add nine degrees to the mean of [the moon] within its path.<br>The mean of [the moon] within its path that results after these additions have been made is referred to as the correct course.",

At the time of conjunction, the sun and the moon are at the same longitudinal point. Therefore, they set at the same time. As the difference in longitude between them increases, the crescent of the moon grows and the time of its setting becomes later, increasing the chances of its visibility.<br>Nevertheless, the moon's latitude also affects its visibility. The greater the latitude of the moon [i.e., its inclination from the orbit of the sun] the larger its crescent will appear. Also, a northerly latitude causes the moon to set later and thus makes it easier to be sighted.

Only when a conjunction or a full moon takes place at (or near) the point where the orbits of the moon and the sun intersect does an eclipse take place.</i><br>When the moon is at one of these points, it is revolving in the same plane as the sun.

            "Afterwards, go back and see the constellation in which the third longitude - i.e., [the amended figure representing] the distance between the sun and the moon - is located:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's intent in these sets of calculations is to reach a point on the equator that will set at the same time the third longitude sets in Jerusalem. For although the third longitude was able to relate the moon's position to the equator, it did not take into consideration the difference between the horizon of the equator and the horizon of Jerusalem. This is accomplished by drawing a line from the third longitude to the equator, which is parallel to the horizon of Jerusalem.</i> If it is located in the constellation of Pisces or Aries, add one sixth [of its length] to the third longitude.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Two factors are significant in determining the fourth longitude: a) The angle of the constellation's inclination to the horizon of the equator. The greater the inclination of the constellation, the closer the fourth longitude will be located to the equator.<br>b) whether the constellation is inclined to the north or to the south.<br>If the constellation is inclined to the north, the third longitude, and hence the place on the equator parallel to it, will be located further away from the horizon, resulting in a later setting and thus an extended fourth longitude. Conversely, if the inclination is southerly, the third longitude will be located closer to the horizon, resulting in a shortened fourth longitude.<br>Of these two factors, the latter is more significant, and causes a larger correction. To explain these factors with regard to the constellations of Pisces and Aries: These constellations are inclined to a great degree, a factor that would reduce the fourth longitude. Since, however, they are northerly inclined, and this is the stronger factor, a modest increase is required.</i> If the [third] longitude is located in the constellation of Aquarius or the constellation of Taurus, add one fifth [of its length] to the third longitude.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These constellations are inclined to the north, and the degree of their inclination is less than that of Pisces and Aries. Hence, a greater increase is required.</i> If the [third] longitude is located in the constellation of Capricorn or the constellation of Gemini, add one sixth [of its length] to the third longitude.<br>If the [third] longitude is located in the constellation of Sagittarius or the constellation of Cancer, leave the third longitude as it is, without making any addition or subtraction.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here, the constellations begin a southerly inclination. Hence, although they are more parallel to the horizon of the equator, no addition is made.</i> If the [third] longitude is located in the constellation of Scorpio or the constellation of Leo, subtract one fifth [of its length] from the third longitude. If the [third] longitude is located in the constellation of Libra or the constellation of Virgo, subtract one third [of its length] from the third longitude.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this instance, the degree of inclination of these constellations is great and their inclination is southerly. Both of these factors lead to a reduction in the fourth longitude. Hence, the greatest subtraction is required.</i><br>The figure resulting from these subtractions or additions to the third longitude, or from leaving it without adjustment, is referred to as the fourth longitude.<br>[Afterwards, a further correction is necessary:] Return to the first latitude,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ralbach questions why the Rambam refers to the first latitude. Seemingly, it would be appropriate to make this correction based on the second latitude, for there is a significant difference between it and the first latitude. According to trigonometry, it also would appear that the calculations should be based on the second latitude.</i> and set aside two thirds [of its length]. This is called the correction [resulting from geographic] latitude.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although the fourth longitude established a relationship between the equator and Jerusalem, it is still dependent on the third longitude, which relates to the moon and the celestial sphere as they set on the horizon of the equator. Through the correction mentioned here, we find a place on the extension of the equator that will set at the same as the moon sets in Jerusalem. Having reached this point, we can calculate the difference in time (15 degrees to the hour) between the setting of the sun and this point (which will set at the same time as the setting of the moon). Accordingly, we will be able to determine whether or not this interval will allow for the sighting of the moon.<br>The correction for geographic longitude is reached by drawing a line from the position of the moon parallel to the horizon of Jerusalem. One might ask: If this was the Rambam's intent, why were so many intermediate steps - the definition of the second, third, and fourth latitudes - necessary? Why didn't he suggest drawing the above- mentioned line at the very beginning of his calculations?<br>The explanation is that the Rambam allowed an individual to follow his own steps in arriving at this final figure. I.e., these lines and distances are all artificial and can be determined only by calculations. Through trigonometry, if one knows the length of one side of a triangle and two angles, or the length of two sides and one angle, it is possible to calculate the size of all three angles and all three sides. To find the line extending from the moon to the equator parallel to the horizon of Jerusalem, the Rambam had to build sets of triangles, and calculate angles based on the relationship of one triangle to another. The process he followed is reflected in the series of corrections he offers.</i><br>Consider whether the latitude of the moon is northerly. If so, add the correction [resulting from geographic] latitude to the fourth longitude.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A northerly latitude means that the actual position of the moon is further removed from the horizon than the third longitude. This will result in a later setting of the moon. Accordingly, the correction based on geographic latitude will require addition to the fourth longitude. This applies regardless of whether the inclination of the constellation in which the moon is located is northerly or southerly.</i> If the latitude of the moon is southerly, subtract the correction [resulting from geographic] latitude from the fourth longitude.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A southerly latitude means that the actual position of the moon is closer to the horizon than the third longitude. This will result in an earlier setting of the moon. Accordingly, the correction based on geographic latitude will require subtraction from the fourth longitude. This applies regardless of whether the inclination of the constellation in which the moon is located is northerly or southerly.</i> The figure resulting from these subtractions or additions to the fourth longitude is referred to as the arc of sighting.",
            "What is implied? For example, let us attempt to determine whether or not it will be possible to sight the moon on Friday night, the second of Iyar of this year: First, it is necessary to determine the true position of the sun, the true position of the moon, and the moon's latitude for this time<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our translation represents a correction of the standard printed text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.</i> according to the methods that were disclosed [in the previous chapters].<br>The result is that the true position of the sun is seven degrees and nine minutes in the constellation of Taurus, in symbols 7° 9'. The true position of the moon is eighteen degrees and thirty-six minutes in the constellation of Taurus, in symbols 18° 36'. The moon's latitude is three degrees and fifty-three minutes, in symbols 3° 53', and it is southerly.

This should be subtracted from the first longitude, producing a second longitude of 10 degrees and twenty-seven minutes, in symbols 10° 27'. The sighting adjustment for the latitude is ten minutes. Since the moon's latitude is southerly, this sighting adjustment of ten minutes should be added to the moon's latitude, producing a second latitude of four degrees and three minutes, in symbols 4° 3'.<br>Since the moon is located in the eighteenth minute of the constellation of Taurus, it is proper to set aside one fourth of the second latitude as the circuit of the moon. Thus, at this time, the circuit of the moon will be one degree and one minute. We pay no attention to the seconds.",
            "Since the latitude of the moon is southerly and the true position of the moon is located between the beginning [of the constellation] of Capricorn and the beginning [of the constellation] of Cancer, it is correct to add the circuit of the moon to the second longitude. Thus, the third longitude will be eleven degrees and twenty-eight minutes, in symbols 11° 28'.<br>Since this longitude is located in the constellation of Taurus, it is fitting to add one fifth to the third longitude - i.e., two degrees and eighteen minutes. Thus, the fourth longitude will be thirteen degrees and forty-six minutes, in symbols 13° 46'.<br>We then go back to the first latitude and separate two thirds of it. Thus, the correction [resulting from geographic] latitude is two degrees and thirty-five minutes.

            "Similarly, in the rainy season, on a clear day, the visibility of the moon will be greater than it is in the summer. For on a clear day in the rainy season, the air is clear and the heavens appear more brilliant, because there is no dust clouding the air. In the summer, by contrast, the air is like smoke, because of the dust. Therefore, the moon will appear small.",
            "When the two limits [mentioned] with regard to the arc of sighting and the first longitude are short, [the crescent of] the moon will be small, and sighting the moon will be possible only from a very high altitude.

Instead, we rely only on the sanctification of the moon [performed] by the court in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, as we have explained several times previously.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 1, Halachah 8; Chapter 5, Halachah 1.</i>"

            "Since our Sages<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 23b, cited in Chapter 2, Halachah 4.</i> said that among the questions posed to the witnesses [in order to verify their testimony] was \"In which direction was [the crescent of] the moon inclined,\" I feel that it is appropriate to explain how this factor can be calculated. My statements will not be exact, because [this knowledge] is of no consequence regarding the actual sighting of the moon.<br>The starting point of these calculations is to know the degree of inclination of the constellations' [position].",
            "The orbit of the sun that passes through the center [of the sphere] of the constellations does not pass directly through the center of the earth from east to west. Instead, it is inclined above the equator which passes through the center of the earth, [slightly] to the north and to the south. Half of it is northerly in inclination and half is southerly in inclination.",
            "There are two points at which the orbit of the sun intersects the equator, which passes through the center of the earth: The first point is the beginning of the constellation of Aries, and the second point, opposite to [the first], is the beginning of the constellation of Libra. Thus, there are six constellations [whose positions] are inclined to the north, those between the beginning of the constellation of Aries and the end of the constellation of Virgo. And there are six [whose positions] are inclined to the south, those between the beginning of the constellation of Libra and the end of the constellation of Pisces.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In our previous notes, we explained that the constellations from Capricorn to Gemini were northerly inclined. There is no contradiction between those statements and the statements above; the difference is in the definition of the word \"inclined.\" In the present context, the Rambam is using the word \"inclined\" to refer to the position of the ecliptic as it passes through these constellations: Is it located above or below the equator, and what is the extent of its variance from the equator?<br>Previously, we had used the word \"inclined\" to refer to the direction of the path of movement of the stars in the sky. In the constellations from Capricorn to Gemini, as the constellations move in their orbit, they will be moving northward. Conversely, in the constellations from Cancer to Sagittarius, as the constellations move in their orbit, they will be moving southward.<br>The inclination of the constellations can be observed by a careful observer with a field compass. In the spring and in the fall, the sun rises due east and sets due west. In the summer (i.e., when the sun is located in the constellations from Taurus to Virgo), it rises in the northeast and sets in the northwest. In the winter (i.e., when the sun is located in the constellations from Scorpio to Pisces), it rises in the southeast and sets in the southwest. Throughout the year, these constellations rise and set in the place where the sun rises and sets when it is in these constellations.</i>",
            "From the beginning of the constellation of Aries, the constellations' [positions] begin to be inclined slightly and diverge from the equator in a northerly direction until the beginning [of the constellation] of Cancer.<br>The beginning [of the constellation] of Cancer is approximately twenty-three and one half degrees north of the equator. [Afterwards,] the constellations begin to proceed toward the equator slowly until the beginning [of the constellation] of Libra, which is positioned on the equator.<br>From the beginning of the constellation of Libra, the constellations' [positions] begin to be inclined slightly and diverge from the equator in a southerly direction until the beginning [of the constellation] of Sagittarius.<br>The beginning [of the constellation] of Sagittarius is approximately twenty-three and one half degrees south of the equator. [Afterwards,] the constellations begin to proceed toward the equator slowly until the beginning [of the constellation] of Aries.",
            "Thus, [in their daily orbits,] the beginning [of the constellation] of Aries and the beginning [of the constellation] of Libra revolve on the equator. Therefore, when the sun is positioned in the beginning [of these constellations],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., at the vernal [spring] and autumnal equinoxes.</i> it will not be inclined either to the north or to the south. It will rise due east and set due west, and the daytime and the nighttime [hours] will be equal throughout the world.",
            "Thus, it should be clear to you that each of the degrees [in the sphere] of the constellations is inclined to the north or to the south, and that there is a specific measure to their inclination. The greatest inclination will be no more than approximately twenty-three and half degrees.",
            "The following represent the extent of inclination from the equator <i>vis-a-vis</i> the number of degrees [in the sphere of the constellations]. Beginning with the constellation of Aries: [A point located at] 10 degrees [in the celestial sphere] will be inclined 4 degrees [from the equator]. [A point located at] 20 degrees will be inclined 8 degrees. [A point located at] 30 degrees will be inclined 11 1/2 degrees.<br>[A point located at] 40 degrees will be inclined 15 degrees. [A point located at] 50 degrees will be inclined 18 degrees. [A point located at] 60 degrees will be inclined 20 degrees. [A point located at] 70 degrees will be inclined 22 degrees. [A point located at] 80 degrees will be inclined 23 degrees. [A point located at] 90 degrees<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the beginning of the constellation of Cancer. In these ninety degrees, we will have passed through three constellations, Aries, Taurus, and Gemini.</i> will be inclined 23 1/2 degrees.",
            "If the number [of degrees] also includes units, you should calculate [their degree of inclination] by taking an average between the two figures, as was explained with regard to [the determination of the position of] the sun and the moon.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 13, Halachah 7, and Chapter 15, Halachah 7.</i><br>What is implied? Five degrees will be inclined 2 degrees. If the number of degrees [in the celestial sphere] is twenty-three, the inclination [from the equator] will be nine degrees. This same pattern should be followed whenever calculating a number that has both units and tens.",
            "Since you know the extent of the inclination of all the degrees from one until ninety, you will be able to calculate the degree of inclination [of the entire celestial sphere] according to the method of calculation explained with regard to the moon's latitude.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 16, Halachah 13.</i> For if the number is between 90 and 180, the number should be subtracted from 180.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., 110° has the same degree of inclination as 70°. For the angle of inclination proceeds in an even-balanced arc with 90 degrees as its center.</i><br>If the number is between 180 and 270, 180 should be subtracted from the number.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the southerly inclination beginning from the constellation of Libra parallels exactly the northerly inclination beginning from Aries.</i> If the number is between 270 and 360, the number should be subtracted from 360.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Producing the inverse of the figures mentioned in the previous quadrant.</i> [After these subtractions have been made], you will know the degree of inclination of the remainder, for it is the degree of inclination of the numbers mentioned previously without any addition or subtraction.",
            "If you desire to know the number of degrees by which the moon's position deviates from the equator to the north or to the south, [you should follow this procedure]: Calculate the inclination of the degree [in the celestial sphere] that will be the true position, and see if its inclination is northerly or southerly. Afterwards, calculate the moon's first latitude and see whether it is northerly or southerly.<br>If the moon's latitude and the inclination of the degree [in the celestial sphere where it is located] have the same direction, then they should be added together.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">E.g., if they are both northerly, the moon's latitude will cause it to appear further north than the constellation in which its true position is located.</i> If they are in different directions - i.e., one is southerly and one is northerly - the smaller figure should be subtracted from the larger one.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., if the moon's true position is located in a northerly position and its latitude is southerly, the latitude should be subtracted from the angular distance of its true position.</i> The remainder is the [angular] distance of the moon from the equator to the direction in which the larger figure was inclined.",
            "What is implied? Let us say that we are trying to calculate the degree of inclination of the moon from the equator on the night of sighting, the second day of the month of Iyar of this year. You have already established that the angle [in the celestial sphere] at which the moon was located is the nineteenth degree of the constellation of Taurus. Thus, its inclination to the north will be approximately 18 degrees.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Actually, the true figure is a few minutes larger.</i><br>The latitude of the moon is approximately four degrees to the south.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Actually, the true figure is a few minutes less.</i> After you subtract the lesser figure from the larger one, the position of the moon will be fourteen degrees to the north of the equator, for the largest figure is the eighteen degrees north [at which the moon's true position was located]. All [of the phases] of this calculation are approximations and are not exact, because they are of no consequence regarding the sighting.",
            "If you desire to know the direction to which the moon will appear to be inclined [when sighted, it is governed by the following principles]: Calculate [the moon's angular] distance from the equator. If it is located on the equator or within two or three degrees to the north or to the south,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The variance of two or three degrees will not produce a difference that is of consequence.</i> it will appear due west and its crescent will appear to be pointed due east.",
            "If [the moon] is inclined to the north of the equator, it will appear in the northwest, and its crescent will appear to be pointed southeast.",
            "If [the moon] is inclined to the south of the equator, it will appear in the southwest, and its crescent will appear to be pointed northeast. To the extent of [the moon's] distance [from the equator], its inclination will increase.",
            "Among the other dimensions of the examination of the witnesses is the question: \"How high [in the sky did the moon] appear?\" This factor can be determined by the arc of sighting. If the arc is short, the moon will appear close to the earth, and when it is long, it will appear high above the earth. The length of the arc of sighting [will determine] the height at which [the moon] will appear above the earth to the witnesses.",
            "Thus, we have explained all the calculations necessary for the sighting [of the moon] and the examination of the witnesses, so that everything will be comprehensible to men of understanding, and they will not lack awareness of any of the Torah's paths. [Therefore,] they will not venture forth in search of it in other texts. \"Seek out of the book of God, read it. None of these will be lacking\" [Isaiah 34:16].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With this halachah, the Rambam explains one of his motives for the inclusion of this section in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>: so that a serious student would not have to resort to other texts, particularly those of the gentile scientific community, to obtain this knowledge. In this manner, he affirms one of the purposes for the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> stated in its introduction, to provide a text that includes every dimension of Jewish law.</i>"
