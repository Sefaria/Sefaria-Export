            "The months of the year are lunar months, as it is stated (Numbers 28:14), \"the monthly burnt-offering for each new moon\"; and it is [also] stated (Exodus 12:2), \"This month shall be for you the beginning of the months.\" Thus did the Sages say: The Holy One, blessed be He, showed Moshe a likeness of the moon in a prophetic vision and said to him, \"See [when] it is like this, and sanctify it (as the beginning of the month).\" But the years that we calculate are solar years, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 16:1), \"Guard the month of the Spring.\"",
            "The solar year exceeds the lunar year by eleven days, approximately. Hence, whenever this excess accumulates to about thirty days, somewhat more or less, one month is added and the year is made up of thirteen months and is called leap year. The year cannot consist of twelve months plus several days, because it is written: \"Months of the year\" (Exodus 12:2), implying that the year should be reckoned by months and not by days.",
            "The moon is invisible for about two days each month, or somewhat more or less: about one day at the end of the old month before it is close to the sun and about one day after its conjunction with the sun, when it reappears in the evening in the west. The night on which it becomes visible in the west after having disappeared is the beginning of the month. Twenty-nine days are counted from that day on. If the new moon appears on the night of the thirtieth day, then the thirtieth day is the first day of the new month. If it does not appear on that night, the thirtieth day belongs to the past month and the thirty-first day is the first day of the new month. We pay no attention as to whether or not the moon appeared on the night of the thirty-first day, because the lunar month never exceeds thirty days.",
            "If the moon appears on the night of the thirtieth day, the past month has twenty-nine days and is called defective month. If the moon does not appear on the night of the thirtieth day, the past month has thirty days and is called intercalated month or full month. And a moon that is seen on the night of the thirtieth is what is called a moon that is seen in its time. And if it is seen on the night of the thirty-first and it is not seen on the night of the thirtieth, it is what is called a moon that is seen on the night of its intercalation.",
            "The observation of the new moon is not entrusted to every individual, as in the case of the regular weekly Sabbath where anyone may count six days and rest on the seventh, but the authority is given to the court only, to sanctify and proclaim the day as the first of the month. The day proclaimed by the court is <i>Rosh Hodesh</i>, as it is written: \"This month shall be to you\" (Exodus 12:2), implying that the evidence in this matter is surrendered to <i>you</i> [members of the court].",
            "Like astronomers who engage in calculation and know the positions and motions of the stars, the Jewish court calculates and investigates minutely so as to know if it is or is not possible for the new moon to be visible in its time, which is the night of the thirtieth day. If the members of the court found that it would be possible, they had to wait in the court house for the arrival of witnesses throughout the thirtieth day. If witnesses arrived and were duly examined and tested and found trustworthy, the thirtieth day was sanctified as the first day of the new month. If the new moon did not appear and no witnesses arrived, that day was counted as the thirtieth of the past month which became an intercalated month. If, however, the members of the court knew by calculation that the new moon could not possibly be seen, they were not required to sit and wait for the arrival of witnesses the thirtieth day. If witnesses did come to testify that they had seen the new moon, it was certain that they were false witnesses, or that a semblance of the new moon appeared to them through the clouds, and was not the real moon.",
            "It is a positive commandment from the Torah upon the court to calculate and know if the [new] moon was seen or was not seen; and they should question the witnesses [to ascertain this] until they sanctify the [new] month. And they must send and inform the rest of the people which day is Rosh Chodesh (the first day of month), so that they would know which days are the holidays – as it is stated (Leviticus 23:2), \"which you shall proclaim as holy occasions\"; and it [also] states (Exodus 13:10), \"And you shall keep this statute at its appointed time.\" ",
            "The new moon days and the leap years are computed and proclaimed only in Eretz Yisrael, as it is written: \"Out of Zion shall go forth instruction, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem\" (Isaiah 2:3). If, however, a great scholar was ordained in Eretz Yisrael and then emigrated to another country without leaving in Eretz Yisrael anyone equal to him in learning, he is permitted to compute and proclaim the new moon days and leap years outside the Land of Israel. And if he knows that in the Land of Israel [another] man became great like him – and it is not necessary to say, greater than him – it is surely forbidden for him to set and intercalate the month outside the Land. And if he did transgress and set it and intercalate it, he did not do anything (it is not effective)."

            "Two trustworthy men only are qualified to testify concerning the new moon, men that are fit to bear witness in any legal case. Women and slaves, however, are not eligible to bear witness, and their testimony is not accepted. A father and son that saw the moon go to court to testify. Not because testimony of the month is valid with relatives; but rather so that if one of them is found to be disqualified for being a thief or that which is similar to it from the other disqualifications, the second can join with another and they will [then] testify. And anyone who is disqualified from testimony by the words of the Scribes – even though he is fit according to the Torah – is disqualified from testimony of the month. ",
            "According to the biblical law, the court is not required to be too strict in accepting evidence concerning the new moon. If the court sanctified the new moon on the evidence of two witnesses, who were found to have given false testimony, it remains sanctified. Originally, therefore, the court used to accept evidence concerning the new moon from any Jewish man, proceeding upon the assumption that each Israelite is qualified as a witness unless he is known to be disqualified. However, after the evil doings of the heretics, who tried to confuse the sages by hiring false witnesses to bear evidence that they had observed the new moon, though they had not seen it, the sages enacted that evidence concerning the new moon should not be admitted unless the witnesses were known to the court as trustworthy men, and that the witnesses should be thoroughly tested and examined.",
            "For this reason, if the court does not know the men who saw the new moon, the people of the town should send along with the witnesses who saw the new moon other witnesses to certify them before the court, vouching for their being trustworthy men; only then is their evidence accepted.",
            "The court employs methods of calculation similar to those used by astronomers, ascertaining whether the new moon of the forthcoming month will be seen to the north or to the south of the sun, whether it will be wide or narrow, and in which direction the tips of the horns will point. When the witnesses arrive to testify, the court examines them: Where did you see the new moon, to the north or to the south? In which direction did its horns point? How high was its altitude, in the estimate of your eyes, and how wide its latitude? If their evidence has been found to conform with the results of astronomical calculation, it is accepted; but if it has been found not to conform, it is rejected.",
            "If the witnesses said, \"We saw it [reflected] in the water\" or \"through the clouds\" or \"through glass\"; or they saw part of it in the sky and part of it through the clouds or in the water or through glass – this is not [considered] a sighting, and we don't sanctify [it based] on this sighting. [If] one said \"I saw it with my eyes at a height of about two floors\" and the second said \"at about a height of three floors\" – they join up [to form valid testimony. If] one says, \"about three floors\" and the second says \"about five floors\" – they do not join up. But one of them joins up with a second that testifies like him or with a single floor between them. ",
            "If the witnesses said: \"We noticed the moon unintentionally, but failed to see it again when we looked and wanted to see it in order to bear witness,\" their testimony is not sufficient, and the court does not sanctify the new moon on the strength of it, owing to the suspicion that combined clouds produced the illusion of a moon and then disappeared. [If] the witnesses said, \"We saw it on the twenty-ninth day of the month in the morning in the East before the sun arose and we saw it in the evening in the West on the night of the thirtieth\" – they are believed and we sanctify [it] based on this sighting. For they surely saw it in its time. But we have no concern about the sighting that they said they saw in the morning. For we are not responsible for the morning sighting; and it is known that it was the clouds that gathered and appeared to them like the moon. And likewise if they saw it in its time, but it was not seen on the night of its intercalation (the following night) – they are believed. For we are only responsible for the sighting of the thirtieth night alone. ",
            "The evidence concerning the new moon is accepted in this fashion: Anyone who is qualified to bear witness comes to the courthouse sfter seeing the new moon. Then the court assembles them all to one place; they are entertained generously with large meals, so that people may make it their habit to come. The first pair of witnesses to arrive are examined first, as we have described. The elder of the two witnesses is brought in and questioned. If his testimony is found to correspond to the data of calculation, the other one is called in. If both testimonies are found to be in agreement, their evidence is declared valid. The other pairs of witnesses are asked only a few main questions, not because their testimony is needed, but that they should not go away disappointed at not being asked, and that they may make it their habit to come.",
            "Thereupon, when the evidence has been sustained, the chief justice of the court proclaims <i>Mekuddash!</i> [the new moon is sanctified], and after him all the people present respond: <i>Mekuddash! Mekuddash!</i> Only a court of three may carry out the calculation and the sanctification of the new moon. The formal sanctification of the new moon is proclaimed only when the new moon has been observed in its proper time; and this must be done at daytime. If it was done at night, the sanctification is not valid. And even if the court and all of Israel saw it, but the court didn't say, \"[It is] sanctified,\" until it became dark on the night of the thirty-first; or they investigated the witnesses and the court didn't manage to say, \"[It is] sanctified,\" until it became dark on the night of the thirty-first – they don't sanctify it; and the month will be intercalated, and Rosh Chodesh (the first of the month) will only be on the thirty-first – even though it was seen on the night of the thirtieth. For it is not the sighting that sets [it], but rather it is the court saying, \"[It is] sanctified,\" that sets [it]. ",
            "[In a case in which] the court itself saw it at the end of the twenty-ninth day: If a star of the night of the thirtieth still hasn't emerged – the court says, \"[It is] sanctified, [it is] sanctified,\" as it is still day (and it can only be set by day). But if they saw it on the night of the thirtieth, after two stars emerged – we sit two judges on the morrow with one of the (three judges from the original court); and the two (others) testify before the three, and the three sanctify it. ",
            "If the court sanctified the new moon erroneously, incorrectly or forcibly, the sanctification remains valid and everyone must fix the dates of the festivals in accordance with the day in which the members of the court sanctified the new moon. Even if someone knows that they have made a mistake, he must rely on their decision, because the authority in this matter rests only with them. He who has commanded us to observe the festivals has also commanded us to depend on them, as it is written: \"The festivals … which you shall proclaim\" (Leviticus 23:2)."
        ],
        [
            "[Regarding] witnesses that see the new moon: If there is a distance of a night and a day's journey or less between them and the location of the court – they go and testify. But if there is more than this between them – they do not go. For their testimony after the thirtieth day doesn't help, since the month has already been made intercalated. ",
            "Witnesses who saw the new moon must go to the court to bear witness even if it happens to be a Sabbath, as it is written: \"Which you shall proclaim, each in its proper season\" (Leviticus 23:4); and wherever <i>proper season</i> is used in a biblical command, it supersedes the Sabbath. For this reason, they are allowed to break the Sabbath only when the new moon of <i>Nisan</i> and that of <i>Tishri</i> are concerned, to determine the time of the festivals. When the Temple was still in existence, the additional offering presented on <i>Rosh Hodesh</i> superseded the Sabbath, which was profaned on account of any <i>Rosh Hodesh</i> coinciding with it.",
            "Just as the witnesses that saw the new moon desecrate the Shabbat, so too do the witnesses who justify them to the court desecrate [it] with them, if the court does not recognize the ones who saw [the new moon]. And even if the one who informs the court of them is a single witness, he goes with them and desecrates [the Shabbat] in case he will find another and join up with him. ",
            "[If one of] the witness that saw the new moon on the night of Shabbat was ill, we ride him on a donkey and even on a bed. And if there is an ambush on the way, the witnesses take weapons in their hands. And if it was a distant journey, they take food in their hands. And even if they saw it large and visible to all, they should not say \"Just as we saw it, others saw it; so we don't need to desecrate the Shabbat.\" Rather anyone who would see the new moon, would be fitting to testify and for whom there will be a night and a day's [journey] or less between him and the location where the court is fixed – there is a commandment upon him to desecrate the Shabbat and to go and testify. ",
            "At first, they would accept testimony of the new moon the entire thirtieth day. One time, the witnesses delayed in coming until the late afternoon and they compromised [the service] in the Temple, and [its officers] did not know what to do – whether they should do the burnt-offering of the afternoon: Perhaps the witnesses would come, and it is impossible to bring up the additional [offering] of the day [of Rosh Chodesh] after the daily offering of the afternoon. [Hence] the court arose and ordained that they would only accept testimony about the new moon until [the time of] <i>minchah</i> (the afternoon prayer), in order that there would be sufficient time in the day to bring up the additional offerings, the daily offering of the afternoon and their libations. ",
            "But if <i>minchah</i>arrived and witnesses did not come, they would do the daily offering of the afternoon. And if witnesses came from <i>minchah</i>and onward, they treat that day as holy and the morrow as holy. But they bring the additional offering on the morrow, since they did not sanctify it after <i>minchah</i>. From when the Temple was destroyed, Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai and his court ordained that they would accept testimony about the new moon the entire day. So even if witnesses came on the thirtieth day at the end of the day, close to sunset – we accept their testimony and sanctify only the thirtieth day. ",
            "When the court intercalates the month because witnesses did not come the entire thirtieth day, they would go up to a prepared place and make a feast on the thirty-first day – which is the first of the month. And they would not go up to there at night; rather at first light before sunrise. And they do not go up to this feast with less than ten [people]. And they only go up with bread of grains, and legumes; and they eat these at the time of the feast. And this is the meal of the commandment of inercalating the month that is mentioned in every place. ",
            "Originally, when the court sanctified the new moon, they used to light flares on the tops of the mountains, so that those who lived far away might know of it. But when the Samaritans began to cause trouble, by kindling misleading flares, it was enacted that messengers should go forth to inform the public. And these messengers do not desecrate the holidays nor Yom Kippur – and it is not necessary to say Shabbat. For we do not desecrate Shabbat to observe it (the month), but rather only to sanctify it. ",
            "Messengers were sent out to proclaim the beginning of six months: <i>Nisan</i>, on account of <i>Pesaḥ; Av</i>, on account of the fast of <i>Tish'ah b'Av; Elul</i>, because of <i>Rosh Hashanah;</i> So that they would sit in anticipation on the thirtieth day of Elul: If they would be informed that the court had sanctified the thirtieth day, they would treat that day alone as holy; but if they were not informed, they would keep the thirtieth day holy and the thirty-first day holy, until the messengers of Tishrei would come to them. <i>Tishri</i>, because of <i>Yom Kippur</i> and <i>Sukkoth; Kislev</i>, because of <i>Hanukkah; Adar</i>, because of <i>Purim</i>. When the Temple was still in existence, messengers would go forth to inform about the beginning of <i>Iyyar</i>, because of <i>Pesaḥ Sheni</i> [observed on the fourteenth of <i>Iyyar</i>].",
            "The messengers of Nissan and the messengers of Tishrei only go out on the day of the first of the month after the sun would rise, [and not] until after they would hear from the mouth of the court \"[It is] sanctified.\" And if the court sanctifies [it] at the end of the twenty-ninth day – as we have said – and they heard from the court, \"[It is] sanctified,\" they go out in the evening. And the messengers of the other six months may go out in the evening after the moon has been seen, even though the court has not yet sanctified the month. Since the new moon has been seen, they go out – for tomorrow the court will certainly sanctify it. ",
            "[In] every place that the messengers would reach, they would make the festivals, one day holidays – as is written in the Torah. But [in] the distant places that the messengers would not reach, they would make two days because of the doubt: For they would not know which day was the day that the court set as the first of the month. ",
            "There are places to which the messengers of Nissan would reach but to which the messengers of Tishrei would not reach. And it would have been appropriate that [these places] make Passover one day, for the messengers reached them and they knew on which day the first of the month was fixed; and make the holiday of the festival of Sukkot two days, for the messengers surely did not reach them. But in order not to differentiate between the festivals, the Sages ordained that any place that the messengers of Tishrei do not reach would make two days [of holidays], even [on] the holiday of [Shavuot].",
            "And how much is between the messengers of Tishrei and the messengers of Nissan? Two days. For the messengers of Tishrei did not travel on the first of Tishrei because it is a holiday, nor on the tenth of it because it is Yom Kippur. ",
            "The messengers do not need to be two, but rather even one is trusted. And not just a messenger alone, but even a merchant from the rest of the people that comes on his way and says, \"I heard from the mouth of the court that they sanctified the month on day x,\" is believed and they set the festivals by his word. For this matter is something which is prone to be revealed, so a single fit witness is trusted for it. ",
            "[If] the court sat all of the thirtieth day and witnesses did not come, and they awoke at first light and intercalated the month – as we have explained in this chapter – and after four or five days, distant witnesses came and testified that they saw the month in its time, which is the night of the thirtieth; and even [if] they come at the end of the month: They intimidate them very threateningly and confound them with questions, burden them with examinations and are meticulous about their testimony; and the court makes efforts not to sanctify this month, since its name has gone out as intercalated. ",
            "But if the witnesses stuck with their testimony and it is found consistent, and the witnesses are surely known and intelligent men and the testimony has been appropriately investigated – they sanctify it and retract, and count from the thirtieth day for that month, since the moon was seen on its night. ",
            "However if the court needs to leave this month intercalated as it was before these witnesses came, they leave it. And this is [the meaning of] what [the Sages] said, \"We intercalate the month for necessity.\" But there is someone among the great Sages who disagrees on this matter and says we never intercalate the month for necessity: Since witnesses came, we sanctify [it] and don't intimidate them. ",
            "It appears to me that there is only a disagreement of the Sages about the months other than Nissan and Tishrei, or with witnesses of Nissan and Tishrei that came after the festivals had passed. For what has been done has already been done and the time of the offerings and the time of the festivals has passed. But if the witnesses came in Nissan and Tishrei before half of the month, we accept their testimony and we don't intimidate them at all. For we don't intimidate witnesses that testify about the new moon that was seen at its time, to intercalate it. ",
            "But we do intimidate witnesses whose testimony has become compromised and the matter is leaning towards the testimony not standing, such that the month will become interclated. We intimidate them in order that the testimony will stand and the month will be sanctified in its time. And likewise, if witnesses came to undermine the witnesses that saw it in its time before the court has sanctified it – [the judges] intimidate the undermining witnesses until their undermining does not stand; and the month is sanctified in its time.

            "A leap year is a year to which an extra month is added. Only <i>Adar</i> is the month that is ever added, so that a leap year has two months of <i>Adar:</i> a first <i>Adar</i> and a second <i>Adar</i>. Why is just this month added? Because of the spring season, so that <i>Pesaḥ</i> should be observed during the barley season, as it is written: \"Observe the month of <i>Aviv</i>, and keep the Passover…\" (Deuteronomy 16:1), implying that this month of <i>Nisan</i> should occur during the spring. Without the addition of this month of <i>Adar</i>, Passover would occur sometimes in the summer and sometimes in the rainy season [of winter].",
            "For three indicators do we make the year a leap year. For the season, for the Spring [state of the barley] and for the fruit of the trees. How is that? The court calculates and determines – if the season of Nissan (when the sun enters Aries) will be on the sixteenth of Nissan or after that time, they make that year into a leap year. And they make that Nissan [into] Second Adar, so that Passover will be during the time of Spring. And we may rely on this indicator and make leap years, and [then] not be concerned about another indicator. ",
            "And likewise if the court saw that the Spring [state of the barley] has yet to arrive, but it is rather still late; and the fruit of the trees that tend to sprout around Passover have not sprouted – we rely on these two indicators and make the year a leap year. And even though the season [arrived] before the sixteenth of Nissan – they surely make it a leap year, so that the Spring [barley] will be present to offer up the waved omer from it on the sixteenth of Nissan; and so that the fruit will sprout like is the way of every Spring [season]. ",
            "And we rely on three lands with respect to the Spring [state of the barley]: On the Land of Yehudah, on Transjordan and on the Galilee. And if the Spring arrived in two of these [lands], but not in one – we do not make a leap year. However, if it arrived in one of them, but it did not arrive in two – we make a leap year, if the fruit of the trees has yet to sprout. And these are the main things for which we make leap years, in order that the years will be solar years. ",
            "And there exist other things for which the court makes leap years due to necessity. And these are them: Because of the roads that are not mended and the people are unable to go up [to Jerusalem], we make the year a leap year until the rain stops and the roads are mended. And because of the bridges which were destroyed and the rivers are found blocking and preventing the people and [so the people] are endangering themselves and dying, we make the year a leap year until they mend the bridges. And because of the ovens [for the] Pesach sacrifice that were destroyed in the rain and [the people] do not have a place to roast their Pesach sacrifices, we make the year a leap year until they will have built the ovens and [the ovens] will have dried. And because of the Israelite exiles that have left from their place and have not yet arrived in Jerusalem, we make the year a leap year in order that they will have enough time to arrive.",
            "But we don't make the year a leap [year] – not for the snow, not for the cold and not for the Israelite exiles that have not yet left from their place. And not for impurity: For example, were the majority of the congregation or the majority of the priests impure, we don't make the year a leap year in order that they will have avaialable time to purify themselves and do [the offerings] in purity. Rather they do [them] in impurity. And if they made the year a leap year because of impurity, it is surely a leap year. ",
            "There are things for which we don't make a leap year at all; but we do make them a support for a year that needs to become a leap [year] because of the season or because of the Spring [state of the barley] and the fruits of the trees. And these are them: Because of the goats and sheep that are yet to be born or which are few. And because of the chicks that have not [yet grown enough to have] flown. We do not make a leap year because of these – in order that the goats and sheep should be accessible for the Pesach sacrifices; and [that] the chicks be accessible for the offering of being seen (<i>reiah</i>) or for those who are obligated in a sacrifice of fowl. But we do make them a support for the year.",
            "How do we make them a support for the year? We say, \"This year needs intercalation because of the season that has dragged\"; or \"because of the Spring and the fruit of the trees that are yet to arrive\" – \"and further since the goats are small and the chicks are delicate.\" ",
            "A year should be intercalated only by those who were invited to participate in the act of intercalation. How is this done? The chief justice of the Supreme Court should say to certain members of the Sanhedrin: \"You are invited to come to such and such a place, that we may together calculate and find out whether this year should be intercalated or not.\" Only those invited may decide about the intercalation of the year. And with how many [judges] do we make it a leap year? We start with three judges from the great Sanhedrin, from those that were ordained. [If] two said \"We should not sit and not see whether making a leap [year] is necessary or if not,\" and one says, \"We should sit and check\" – the individual is nullified from his [being a] minority. [If] two said \"We should sit and check,\" and one says, \"We should not sit\" – we add two more from those invited and debate the matter back and forth. ",
            "If two of the five members of the council say that the year should be intercalated, and three say that it should not, the minority of two does not count. If three say that it should be intercalated, and two say that it should not, two members are added to the council from among those who have been invited, and they discuss the matter and decide with a panel of seven. If all seven of them unanimously decide to intercalate or not to intercalate, their decision is adhered to; but if they disagree, the opinion of the majority is followed. And there is a need to have head of the High Court – who is the head of the yeshiva of seventy-one – among the seven. And if they concluded with three to make a leap year, it is a leap year so long as the [head of the court] is with them or agrees. And with regards to making the year a leap year, we start [the discussion] from the side (from the lesser judges). But to sanctify the month, we start with the greatest. ",
            "A king or a high priest must not be placed as a member of the council on the intercalation of the year. A king is not eligible on account of his armies and far-flung campaigns, lest he may be inclined to intercalate or not to intercalate in their interests. A high priest is not eligible because he may be concerned about the cold weather; he may not be inclined to intercalate, so that the month of <i>Tishri</i> should not occur in the cold season, when he must take five baths of purification on <i>Yom Kippur</i>.",
            "If the chief justice of the Supreme Court, who bears the title of <i>Nasi</i>, happens to be away on a distant trip, the year can be intercalated only on condition that the <i>Nasi</i> will consent. If he arrived and gave his consent, the intercalation remains valid; if he did not consent, the intercalation is invalid. And we only make the year a leap year in the Land of Yehudah. For the Divine Presence is there, as it stated (Deuteronomy 12:5), \"to dwell It there; you shall seek.\" But if they made it a leap year in the Galilee, it is a leap year. And we only make it a leap year during the day. But if they made it a leap year at night, it is not a leap year. ",
            "The court is able to calculate, set and determine which year will be a leap year at any time they want, even for several years. But they may not say, \"Year x is a leap year.\" Rather it is after Rosh Hashanah that they may say, \"This year is a leap year.\" And this matter is [only] because of a pressing situation. But at a time when there is no pressing situation, we may not make [it] known that it is a leap year [right after Rosh Hashanah]. Rather it is in Adar that they may say \"This year is a leap year; and the coming month is not Nissan but rather Second Adar.\" [If] they said before Rosh Hashanah, \"This year that is beginning is a leap year,\" it is not [turned into] a leap year with this statement. ",
            "[If] the thirtieth day of Adar arrived and they were yet to make the year a leap year, they may not make it a leap year at all. For that day is fitting to be the first of the month of Nissan; and once Nissan has entered and they have not made it a leap year, they are not able to make a leap year. And if they made it a leap year on the thirtieth day of Adar, it is surely a leap year. [If] witnesses came after they made it a leap year and testified about the moon, they sanctify the month on the thirtieth day and it will be the first of the month of Second Adar. But if they sanctified it before they made the year a leap year, they could no longer have made [it] a leap year. For we do not make leap years in Nissan. ",
            "We may not make the year a leap year in a year of famine. For everyone runs to the threshing floors to eat and to live; so it is impossible to add time to them, to forbid the new [grain] (which will only become permissible on the sixteenth of Nissan). And we may [also] not make a leap year on a sabbatical year. For everyone's hand is controlling the undergrowth; so they will not find [grain] for the omer offering and the two breads. And they were used to making a leap year on the eve of a sabbatical year. ",
            "It seems to me that that which the Sages said, \"We may not make a leap year in a year of famine and on the sabbatical year,\" is that we may not make a leap [year] because of the necessity of the roads and the bridges and that which is similar to them. But if the year was fitting to be made a leap year because of the season or because of the Spring [status of the barley] and the fruit of the trees, we always make a leap year at any time. ",
            "When the court makes the year a leap year, they write letters to all the distant places and inform them that it has been made a leap year, and for what reason it was made a leap year. And they are written in the wording of the [head of the court]: And he says to them, \"Let it be known to you that I and my colleagues have agreed and we have added to this year such and such [days]\" – [if] they want, twenty-nine days, [if] they want, thirty days. For [regarding] the leap year month, the court has the authority to add a full [month] or a lacking [month] for the people far away whom they are informing. But they themselves (in the Land of Israel) go according to the sighting – whether it is full or it is lacking. "

            "All that we have said concerning the fixation of <i>Rosh Hodesh</i> on the basis of observing the new moon, and concerning intercalation of the year because of the season or because of some other necessity, is applicable only to the Sanhedrin in Eretz Yisrael or to the members of the court who were ordained in Eretz Yisrael, to whom the Sanhedrin gave permission to act. Moses and Aaron were told: \"This month shall be to you the beginning of months\" (Exodus 12:2), and the sages have derived from an oral tradition going back to our teacher Moses that the meaning of this verse is: This evidence shall rest with you and your successors. When, however, no Sanhedrin exists in Eretz Yisrael, the new-moon days and the leap years are determined only by such methods of calculation as we are employing today.",
            "And this matter is a law of Moses from Sinai: That at a time that there is a Sanhedrin, we set [the new month] by sighting; and when the Sanhedrin does not exist, we set [it] according to this calculation that we [use] to calculate today, and we are not concerned about the sighting. Rather, sometimes the day we set with this calculation will be the day of sighting; [and sometimes it will be] a day before it, or a day after it. And that it will be after the sighting by a day is a wonder (i.e. very rare), and [only] in lands that are to the west of the Land of Israel. ",
            "When did all Israel begin to use this method of calculation? During the last generation of the talmudic sages, when Eretz Yisrael was in ruins and no established court had survived there. In the times of [the Tannaim] the sages of the Mishnah, and also in the period of the talmudic sages prior to Abbayyé and Rava, the people relied on the courts of Eretz Yisrael for setting the calendar.",
            "When the Sanhedrin still existed and the calendar was set by observation, the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael, and the places that could be reached by the messengers of <i>Tishri</i> on time, observed each festival one day only; whereas those who lived in more distant places that could not be reached by the messengers of <i>Tishri</i> in time observed two days, because of doubt, since they failed to know which day had been proclaimed as <i>Rosh Hodesh</i> by the men of Eretz Yisrael.",
            "At the present time, when no Sanhedrin and court of Eretz Yisrael are in existence, we set the calendar by calculation. It might be logical that the Jewish people everywhere, even those living in remote places of the Diaspora, should observe one day only [as holyday] just as the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael do, in view of the same calculation followed by all in determining the calendar. The sages, however, have made it a rule that the people must carefully follow the custom of their forefathers.",
            "Accordingly, the localities which could not be reached on time by the messengers sent to announce <i>Rosh Hodesh Tishri</i> must observe two days even at present, just as they used to when the men of Eretz Yisrael determined the calendar on the basis of observation. But the residents of Eretz Yisrael at our time should continue to keep only one day, according to their [ancient] custom, for they never observed two days. Hence, it becomes evident that the second day of the festival that we observe in the Diaspora nowadays is something enacted by the sages.",
            "When the fixing of the month was accomplished by the observation method, the majority of the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael observed <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> for two days, because they were in doubt as to which day had been declared as new-moon day, since the messengers could not go forth on a holyday [and <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> coincides with the first day of the month].",
            "Moreover, even in Jerusalem itself, which was the seat of the court, it frequently happened that <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> was observed for two days. If witnesses failed to arrive on the thirtieth day of <i>Elul</i>, the people were accustomed to celebrate it as <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, while waiting for witnesses to appear, observing the following day likewise as a holyday. Since they used to keep two days <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> even when the method of observation was in use, the sages ordained that even the citizens of Eretz Yisrael should keep it for two days always, at the present time when the calendar is determined by computation. You may thus infer that even the second day of <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> is based on the authority of the sages.",
            "The observance of one day of the other festivals does not depend upon the proximity of a location to Jerusalem. For example, a locality at a distance of five days' journey or less from Jerusalem could certainly have been reached by the messengers in time; yet it cannot be said that the residents of this place should observe only one day. As who will tell us that the messengers went out to this place? possibly no messengers were ever sent out to this place because there were no Jews there, and when the calendar began to be determined by computation the place was settled by Jews who were required to observe two days by their previous custom. Or else, no messengers ever came to this place because of insecurity in travel, as was the case between Judea and Galilee during the period of [the Tannaim] the sages of the Mishnah, or, because non-Jews, living along the road, would prevent the messengers from passing through the area.",
            "If this matter of observing one day were to depend upon the proximity to Jerusalem, all the Jews of Egypt would observe only one day, since the messengers of <i>Tishri</i> could have reached them in time. The distance between Jerusalem and Egypt, by way of Ashkelon, is indeed only a matter of eight days' journey or less. The same applies to most places in Syria. Hence you may infer that the thing does not depend upon the proximity of a place.",
            "It is found that the principle of this matter in this way is such: Any place that has a journey more than ten complete days between it and Jerusalem always makes two days, like their custom from before. For the messengers of each and every Tishrei would only reach a place that has a journey of ten days or less between it and Jerusalem. And any place that has a journey exactly ten days or less between it and Jerusalem – such that it is possible that the messengers of Tishrei would reach it – we see if that place was from [a part of] the land of Israel that had Israelites in it at the time of the sighting in the second conquest [of the Land]. For example, Usha and Shaphram and Lod and Yavneh and Nov and Tiberius and that which is similar to them. [In that case,] they make only one day alone. But if the place was of Syria – such as Tyre and Damascus, and Ashkelon and that which is similar to them; or from outside of the Land [of Israel] – like Egypt and Ammon and Moab and that which is similar to them – they do like the custom of their fathers which is in their hands: If one day, one day; and if two days, two days. ",
            "[In the case of] a place that has ten days or less than ten between it and Jerusalem, and it is [in] Syria or outside of the Land, and they don't have a custom; or it is a newly formed city in the wilderness of the Land of Israel; or a place that Israelites inhabited now: They make two days like the custom of the majority of the world. And every second day holiday is from the words of the Scribes (rabbinic); and even the second day of the holiday of Rosh Hashanah which everyone makes at this time. ",
            "When we nowadays compute, everyone in his own town, declaring such and such a date to be <i>Rosh Hodesh</i> or a festival, we do not rely upon our own calculation and determination, for it is not permissible to intercalate the years or to determine new-moon days outside of Eretz Yisrael; we may rely only on the computation and fixation performed by the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael. Our own computation is only for the purpose of making it known to the public; since we are aware that in Eretz Yisrael they use the same method of computation, we calculate in order to find out what day it is that has been determined by the residents of Eretz Yisrael. And it is [the date] that the residents of the Land of Israel set, that will be Rosh Chodesh or the holiday. [It is] not on account of the calculation that we calculate. "

            "When the fixing of the new month used to be based upon the observation process, the sages calculated with great precision to ascertain the moment at which the conjunction of the moon with the sun occurred, according to the practice of the astronomers, so as to know whether the moon could appear on the night of the thirtieth day or not. The beginning of this calculation that we calculate by approximation – to know the time of their conjunction without precision, but rather according to their average trajectories – is what is called the <i>molad</i>. But the main principles of the calculation that we calculate at a time when there is not a court to set it according to a sighting – and that is the calculation that we calculate today – are what are called, <i>eebur</i>.",
            "The day and the night consist of twenty-four hours: twelve for the day and twelve for the night. The hour is divided into one thousand and eighty parts. Why is the hour divided into this number of parts? Because this number may be divided by two, four, eight, three, six, nine, five, and ten, without a remainder; these denominators may again be divided into many other parts.",
            "According to these figures, the interval between two conjunctions of moon and sun at their average motion is twenty-nine days and twelve hours of the thirtieth day, beginning with the night of that day, and seven hundred ninety-three parts of the thirteenth hour. That is the time between one <i>molad</i> [conjunction] and the other, and that is the duration of the lunar month.",
            "The lunar year consists of twelve months of the length just defined, totaling three hundred fifty-four days, eight hours, and eight hundred seventy-six parts; but leap year, consisting of thirteen months, totals three hundred eighty-three days, twenty-one hours, and five hundred eighty-nine parts. The solar year consists of three hundred sixty-five days and six hours. Hence, the excess of the solar year over the lunar year totals ten days, twenty-one hours, two hundred and four parts.",
            "If you subtract twenty-eight days from the lunar month, or four weeks consisting of seven days each, there will remain one day, twelve hours, and seven hundred ninety-three parts, symbolized by 1d 12h 793p. This is the remainder of the lunar month. Similarly, if you subtract the multiples of seven from the number of days of the lunar year, there will remain, in the case of an ordinary year, four days, eight hours, and eight hundred seventy-six parts, symbolized by 4d 8h 876p. This is the remainder of an ordinary lunar year. In the case of a leap year, the remainder is five days, twenty-one hours, and five hundred twenty-nine parts,, symbolized by 5d 21h 589p.",

For example: Suppose the <i>molad</i> of <i>Nisan</i> occurred in the daytime of a Sunday the fifth hour and one hundred seven parts of an hour, symbolized by 1d 5h 107p.",

And likewise year after year until the end of the world. And the first <i>molad</i> from which you should begin is the <i>molad</i> that was in the first year of creation.

But when there is a sum of more than seven days, you remove seven from the number – for we are not calculating to know the number of days, but rather to know which day of the days of the week and at which hour and which part the <i>molad</i> will be.

And the season of Tammuz is with the sun being at the beginning of the constellation of Cancer. And the season of Tishrei is with the sun being at the beginning of the constellation of Libra. And the season of Tevet is with the sun being at the beginning of the constellation of Capricorn. And according to this calculation, the season of Nissan in the first year of creation was seven days, nine hours and six hundred and forty-two parts before the <i>molad</i>. Its symbol is 7.9.642.",
            "The way of the calculation of the seasons is like this: First know how many full cycles [there have been] from the year of creation until the cycle that you want. [Then] take an hour and four hundred and eighty-five parts for each cycle. Make the sum of all the parts into hours, and of all the hours into days; and subtract seven days, nine hours and six hundred and forty-two parts from all of it. And add the remainder to the <i>molad</i> of Nissan of the first year of the cycle. [It] comes out for you to which hour and which [day] in the month will be the season of Nissan of that (first) year of the cycle. And from it, you begin to count ninety-one days and seven and a half hours for each and every season. And if you want to know the season of Nissan in this year – which is year such and such of the cycle in which you are standing: Take an hour and four hundred and eighty-five parts for each cycle; and ten days, twenty one hours and two hundred and four parts for each year of the cycle that has concluded. Take the sum of it all, and subtract seven days, nine hours and six hundred and forty-two parts from it. And with the remainder, remove the [complete] lunar months [of] twenty nine days, twelve hours and seven hundred parts. And add what remains less than a lunar month to the <i>molad</i> of Nissan of that year. And you will know which time – the day and the hour – will be the season of Nissan of that year. According to this calculation, the season of Nissan is always only at the beginning of the night, at midnight, at the beginning of the day or at midday. And the season of Tammuz is always only at seven and half or one and a half hours – whether in the day or the night. And the season of Tishrei is always only at nine hours or three hours – whether in the day or the night. And the season of Tevet is always only at ten and a half hours or four and a half hours – whether in the day or the night. If you want to know in which day of the days of the week and at which hour the season will be: Take the completed years that have passed from the year of the creation until the year that you want and remove [the years], twenty-eight by twenty-eight. And take one year, one day and six hours from each of the years left over from the [groupings of] twenty-eight. And take the sum of it all and add three [days] to it. [Now] remove all [of the days], seven by seven. And [with] the remainder of the days and of the hours, begin to count from the beginning of the First Night from Shabbat. And the season of Nissan will be that to which the calculation reaches. And why do we add three days? Since the beginning of the first season of the first year of creation was the Fourth Night.",
            "How is this? See that [if] we wanted to know the season of Nissan of the year 4930 from creation: When you remove all [the years] – twenty-eight by twenty-eight – one year remains. Take one day and six hours for it and add three [days]. It comes out that the season of Nissan is on the Fifth Night, six hours into the night. And when you add seven and a half hours to it, the season of Tammuz will surely be an hour and a half from the Fifth Day. And when you add seven and a half hours to that, the season of Tishrei will be nine hours from the Fifth Day. And when you add seven and a half hours upon that, the season of Tevet will be four and a half hours from the [Sixth] Night. And when you add seven and a half hours to that, the next season of Nissan will be at the beginning of the Sixth Day. And in this way [can one continue], one season after [another], to the end of the world.",
            "If you want to know on which day of the month the season of Nissan of this year will be: First ascertain on which day of the days of the week it will be and on which day they will establish [the month of] Nissan of this year and how many complete years of the cycle have passed. And take eleven days for each year and add a sum of seven days in these times (at the time of the original writing). [Then] remove it all – thirty by thirty. And [with] the remainder that is less than thirty, begin to count from Rosh Chodesh of Nissan. If it reaches the day of the season, all the better. But if not, add a day or two days or three days to the number until it reaches the day of the season. But if it is a leap year, begin to count from Rosh Chodesh of Second Adar. And the day of the month that the calculation reaches is the [beginning of] the season.",
            "How is this? See that [if] we wanted to know on which [day] in the month will be the season of Nissan of the year 4930 – which is the the ninth year of the two hundred and sixtieth cycle: We found that Rosh Chodesh of Nissan is set for the Fifth [Day of the week]. And since this year is the ninth of the cycle, the full years would be eight. When you take eleven days for each year of them, all of the days will be eighty-eight. Add seven. See that the total is ninety five. Remove it all – thirty by thirty. Five days remain. When you begin to count five days from Rosh Chodesh of Nissan, the calculation reaches the Second Day. But we already know that the season [does not begin] on the Second Day but rather on the Fifth. Hence increase one day after another until your reach the Fifth which is the day of the season. It comes out that the season of Nissan [begins] on this year on the Eighth day of the month of Nissan. And you [calculate] in this fashion for each and every year.",
            "[Regarding] that which we said, \"Increase one day after another until you reach the day of the season\": You will only ever need to add two or three days – and it is a great wonder if you will need to add four days. But if you find that you need to add to this, know that you have erred in your calculation. [So] go back and calculate [again] with precision."

And an instant is one seventy-sixth of a part. And according to this calculation, the surplus of a solar year over a lunar year is ten days, twenty-one hours and one hundred and twenty-one parts and forty-eight instants. Its symbol is 10.21.121.48. And you will not find a surplus in the cycle of nineteen years at all. Rather in each cycle, the solar years will end [together] with the simple and leap lunar years. ",

            "Since we said in these laws that the court would calculate with precision and know whether the moon was seen or it was not seen – we have known that anyone whose spirit is correct and whose heart desires matters of wisdom and to understand the secrets will want to know the ways with which they calculated to the point that one would know if the moon would be seen on this night or not be seen.",
            "And there are great disagreements among the early sages of the nations who researched the calculation of the seasons and [mathematics]. And very wise people got confounded with them and missed things and questions arose for them. And there was one who was very exacting and [yet] did not encounter the correct way in the calculation of the sighting of the moon, but rather floated on great waters but [only] brought up clay in his hand.",
            "And due to the length of the years and the multitude of experiments and research, the ways of this calculation became known to some sages. Moreover we have traditions and proofs from the Sages about their main principles written in books that are not known to all. And because of all these things, it is fitting in my eyes to explain the ways of this calculation – in order that it be prepared for the one whose heart fills him to approach this discipline to do it. ",
            "And these procedures should not be light in your eyes [just] because we do not need them at this time. For these procedures are unintuitive and profound procedures. And it is the secret of the intercalation (<i>sod heeebur</i>) that [only] the greats of the Sages would know; and they would only pass it on to ordained understanding ones. Whereas [with] the calculation at this time that we calculate with today – when there is no court to set [the month] according to sighting – even infants of their teacher's school arrive [at understanding it completely] in three or four days.",
            "Lest a sage from the nations of the world or from the sages of Israel that studied the wisdom of Greece about these procedures with which I am calculating observe and see close approximations in some of these procedures and it enter his mind that something escaped us and that we did not know that there is an approximation in the procedure – let this not enter his mind. Rather every matter about which we were not exact is because we knew through the principles of [mathematics] with clear proofs that this thing does not harm the knowledge of the sighting [of the moon]. So we do not concern ourselves with it. Hence we were not exact abpout it.",
            "And likewise when he sees a small deficiency in one of the procedures towards the calculation that is fit for that procedure – [know that] we have done this intentionally since there is a counterbalancing advantage in the different procedure: That the thing come out to what is correct by approximate procedures without a long calculation. [This is] in order that one not accustomed to the procedures not get confounded by the multitude of calculations that do not [add anything] about the sighting of the moon.",
            "The main principles that one must know first for all of the astronomical calculations – whether for the procedures for the calculation of the sighting or for other procedures – are these: [Space] is divided into three hundred and sixty degrees. Each and every constellation is thirty degrees. And one begins from the beginning of the constellation of Aries. And each and every degree is sixty parts (minutes). And each and every part is sixty seconds. And each and every second is sixty thirds. And thus can you be precise in the calculation and divide [further] anytime you want.",
            "Hence if a calculation came out for you that the place of star x in [space] is seventy degrees, thirty parts and forty seconds – know that this star is in the constellation of Gemini in half of the eleventh degree of this constellation: Since the constellation of Aries is thirty degrees and the constellation of Taurus is thirty degrees, there remains eleven and a half degrees from the constellation of Gemini and forty seconds from the second half of a degree.",
            "And likewise if it came out that its place in [space] is three hundred and twenty degrees – know that this star is in the constellation of Aquarius in its twentieth degree. And in this way is it for all of the amounts. The order of the constellations is like this: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius [and] Pisces. ",
            "[Regarding] all of the calculations, when you take the sum of one remainder with [another] remainder; or when you add one amount to [another] amount – take the sum of each type [of unit] with its type: The seconds with the seconds; the parts with the parts; and the degrees with the degrees. And anytime there is a sum of sixty degrees, make one part and add it to the parts. And whenever there is a sum of sixty parts, make it a degree and add it to the degrees. And when you take the sum of the degrees, remove three hundred and sixty. And the remainder [of that] – from three hundred and sixty and down – is what we take for the calculation. ",
            "In all of the calculations altogether, when you want to subtract an amount from an amount: If that which you are subtracting is more than the one from which you are subtracting – even by one part – add three hundred and sixty degrees to that from which you are subtracting, so that it will be possible to subtract that amount from it.",
            "How is this? See that [if] the calculation required you to subtract two hundred degrees, fifty parts and forty seconds – its symbol being 200.50.40 – from one hundred degrees, twenty parts and thirty seconds – its symbol being 100.20.30: Add three hundred and sixty to the hundred – it will be four hundred and sixty degrees. [When] you begin to subtract the seconds from the seconds, for you to come to subtract forty from thirty is impossible. [So] bring over one part from the twenty parts and make it into sixty seconds. [Then] add it to the thirty, and it comes out to ninety seconds. Subtract the forty from them, and the remainder is fifty seconds. And go back to subtract fifty parts from nineteen parts – as you have already carried over one part and made it into seconds. But it is impossible to subtract fifty from nineteen. Hence bring over one of the degrees and make it into sixty parts. [Then] add it to the nineteen parts, and it comes out to seventy-nine parts. Subtract fifty from them. Twenty-nine parts remain. Go back and subtract two hundred degrees from four hundred and fifty-nine degrees – as you have already carried over one degree and made it into parts. And the remainder is two hundred and fifty-nine degrees. And it comes out that the symbol of the remainder is 259.29.50. And in this way [you can calculate] about each and every subtraction of the sun and the moon. ",
            "And likewise the movement of the rest of the seven stars – each and every one in its orbit – is an even movement. There is no quickness or heaviness to it. Rather its motion today is like its motion yesterday which is like its motion tomorrow which is like its motion on each and every day. And even though the orbit of each one of them goes around the world, the Earth is not at its center.",
            "Hence if you measure the movement of each one of them by the [space] that surrounds the world for which the Earth is at its center – which is the [space] of the constellations – its movement would change. And it comes out that its movement on this day in the [space] of the constellations would be less or more than its movement yesterday or its movement tomorrow.",
            "The even movement that the star or the sun or the moon moves in its orbit is what is called the average movement. And the movement that would be [seen] in the [space] of the constellations – which is sometimes more and sometimes less – that is the true movement. And the true place of the sun or place of the moon is with it.",
            "We have already said that these procedures that we are explaining in these laws are only for the sighting of the moon exclusively. Hence we have made the base [time] from which we are always starting for this calculation – from the beginning of the Fifth Night (Wednesday night), the date of which is the Third of the month of Nissan from this year, which is the seventeenth of the two hundred and sixtieth cycle. That is the year 4938 from the creation, which is the year 1489 for contracts, which is the year 1109 [from] the destruction of the second Temple. And that is what we are calling the base year in this calculation.",
            "And since the sighting will only be in the Land of Israel – as we have explained – we have made all the procedures of this calculation built on the city of Jerusalem and the other places that surround it, during the six or seven days in which we always see the moon and come and testify in court. And this place (Jerusalem and its surroundings) is off about thirty-three degrees – from thirty-five up to twenty-nine – to the north of the equator that encircles the world. And it is also off about twenty-four degrees – from twenty-seven up to twenty-one – to the west of the median line of civilization. "

            "The average movement of the sun in one day – which is twenty-four hours – is fifty-nine parts (minutes) and nine seconds. Its symbol is 24:59.9. It comes out that its movement in ten days is nine degrees, fifty-one parts and twenty-three seconds. Its symbol is 9.51.23. And it comes out that its movement in a hundred days is ninety-eight degrees, thirty-three parts and fifty-three seconds. Its symbol is 98.33.53. And it comes out that the remainder of its movement in a thousand days – after you remove each [set of] three hundred and sixty degrees, as we explained – is two hundred sixty-five degrees, thirty-eight parts and fifty seconds. Its symbol is 265.38.50. And it comes out that the remainder of its movement in ten thousand days is one hundred and thirty-six degrees, twenty-eight parts and twenty seconds. Its symbol is 136..28.20. And in this way you can multiply and come out with [the sun's] movement for any amount [of time] that you want. And so if you want to make familiar indicators for yourself for its movement in two days, three and four up until ten, you should do [so]. And likewise if you want to make familiar indicators ready for yourself for its movement in twenty days, thirty and forty up until a hundred, you should do [so]. And this is something revealed and known, once you have known the movement of one day. And it is fitting that the average movement of the sun in twenty-nine days and in three hundred and fifty-four days – which is a lunar year at the time when its months are in order, which is called an ordered year – be ready and familiar to you. For when these average movements will be known, this calculation for the sighting of the moon will be easy for you – since there are twenty-nine complete days from the night of one sighting to the night of the next new moon. And likewise for each and every month – there is no less than twenty-nine days and no more. For our desire in all of these calculations is only to know the sighting of the moon exclusively. And likewise from the night of the sighting of this month to the night of the sighting in the same month in the next year is an ordered year or a year and a day. And likewise for each and every year. And the average movement of the sun for twenty-nine days is twenty eight degrees, thirty-five parts and one second. Its symbol is 28.35.1. And its movement in an ordered year is two hundred and forty-eight degrees, fifty-five parts and fifteen seconds. Its symbol is 248.55.15.",
            "And there is one point in the orbit of the sun – and likewise in the orbits of the other seven stars – at which time the star is all of its light away from the Earth. And this point of the orbit of the sun and of the other seven stars rotates evenly. And its movement every seventy years is approximately one degree. And this point is called the apogee of the sun. Its movement every ten days is one and a half seconds – which is ninety thirds. It comes out that its movement in a hundred days is fifteen seconds, its movement in a thousand days is two parts and thirty seconds and its movement in ten thousand days is twenty-five parts. And it comes out that its movement in twenty-nine days is four seconds and a bit and its movement in an ordered year is fifty-three seconds. We have already said that the base time from which the calculation begins is from the beginning of the Fifth Night, the date of which is the Third of the month of Nissan of the year 4938 from the creation. And the place of the sun in its average movement [from] this base time was at seven degrees, three parts and thirty-two seconds from the [beginning of the] constellation of Aries. Its symbol is 7.3.32. And the place of the sun's apogee [from] this base time was at twenty-six degrees, forty-five parts and eight seconds from the constellation of Gemini. Its symbol is 26.45.8. When you want to know the place of the sun in its average movement at any time you want – take the amount of days from the beginning of the base time until the day you want. And you can arrive at its average movement for those days from the indicators that we have made known. [Then] add everything to the base time and take the sum of each type [of units] with its type. And what comes out is the place of the sun in its average movement for that day. How is this? See that [if] we wanted to know the place of the sun in its average movement from the beginning of Shabbat night, the date of which was the Fourteenth of the month of Tammuz from this year – which is the year of the base time: We found that the amount of days from the day of the base time until the beginning of this day for which we want to know the place of the sun is a hundred days. We took the average movement for one hundred days – which is 98.33.53 – and we added it to the base time – which is 7.3.32. From the calculation, it came out to one hundred and five degrees, thirty-seven parts and twenty-five seconds. Its symbol is 105.37.25. It comes out that its place according to its average movement at the beginning of this night is in the constellation of Cancer at fifteen degrees in it and thirty-seven parts of the sixteenth degree. The average movement that comes out from this calculation will sometimes be precisely at the beginning of the night [and sometimes] an hour before the sunset or an hour after the sunset. And you should not be concerned about this thing regarding the sun in the calculation of the sighting, as we will compensate for this approximation when we calculate the average [movement] of the moon. And you can do like this anytime you want, even after a thousand years: To take the sum of all of the remainders and add it to the base time – and it will come out for you [to] the place of the average [movement]. And likewise can you do this for the average [movement] of the moon and for the average [movement] of each and every star: Once you know how much its movement is for one day and know the base time from which you start – take the sum of its movement for all of the years and days that you want, and add it to base time. And what comes out is its place in its average movement. And likewise can you do this for the apogee of the sun: Add its movement for those days or years to the base time. What comes out is the place of the sun's apogee for that day that you want. And likewise if you want to make another base time from which to start, besides the base time from which we have started in this year – in order that [such a] base time be at the beginning of the [first] year of a specific cycle or at the beginning of one of the centuries – you have permission in your hand [to do so]. And if you want to make the base time from which you start to be in years that have passed before this base date or after several years from this base date, the procedure is known. How is the procedure? You already know the movement of the sun in an ordered year, its movement for twenty-nine days and its movement for one day. And it is well-known that a year the months of which are complete is one day more than an ordered year; and that a year the months of which are lacking is one day less than an ordered [one]. And [regarding] a leap year: If its months would be in their order, it will be thirty days more than a [simple] ordered year. And if its months would be complete, it will be thirty-one days more than an ordered [year]. And if its months would be lacking, it will be twenty-nine days more than an ordered [year]. And once all of these things are known, you may come out with the average movement of the sun for all of the years and days that you want. So you can add to the [original] base time that we made – and you will have the average [place of the movement] for the day that you want from the years to come. [Then] you can make that the base time. Or you can subtract the movement that you have come up with from the base time that we have made – and you will have the base time that you want from years that have passed. [Then] you can make that average [place of the movement] the base time. And you can do like this for the average [movement] of the moon and the other stars if they be known to you. And it has already been explained that in the same way that you can know the average [movement] of the sun from the days to come, so can you know its average [movement] for every day that you want from the days that have passed."

[Then] subtract the place of the apogee from the average [place]. The path comes out for you to be eighteen degrees, fifty-two parts and two seconds. Its symbol is 18.52.2. And do not be exacting with any path about the parts. Rather if they be less than thirty, do not [pay attention] to them. And if they be thirty or more, count them as one degree, and add it to the amount of the degrees of the path. Hence this path will be nineteen degrees; and its divergence will be – according to the procedure we explained – thirty-eight degrees. ",

The remainder is one hundred and four degrees, fifty-nine parts and twenty-five seconds. Its symbol is 104.59.25. And it comes out that the true place of the sun at the beginning of this night is in the constellation of Cancer at fifteen degrees in it – minus 35 seconds. And do not [pay attention] to the seconds at all – whether regarding the place of the sun, the place of the moon or in the other calculations of sighting. Rather only seek the parts. But if the seconds were close to thirty, make them into one part, and add it to the parts.",

            "Once you know [the number of] these parts, subtract them from the first width, or add them to it, as we have let you know; and it will come out for you to the second width. And you have already known whether it is northern or southern. And you will [now] know how many degrees and how many parts this second width is. And prepare this in front of you so it will be [ready for you in the] future.",
            "And afterwards, come back to take a portion of this second width, since the moon deviates a little in its orbit. And how much is the portion that you take from it? If the place of the moon would be from the beginning of the constellation of Aries up to twenty degrees into it or from the beginning of the constellation of Libra up to twenty degrees into it, take two fifths of the second width. And if the place of the moon would be from twenty degrees into the constellation of Aries up to ten degrees into the constellation of Taurus or from twenty degrees into the constellation of Libra up to ten degrees into the constellation of Scorpio, take a third of the second width. And if the moon would be from ten degrees into the constellation of Taurus up to twenty degrees into it or from ten degrees into the constellation of Scorpio up to twenty degrees into it, take a quarter of the second width. And if the moon was from twenty degrees into the constellation of Taurus up to its end or from twenty degrees into the constellation of Scorpio up to its end, take a fifth of the second width. And if the moon would be from the beginning of the constellation of Gemini up to ten degrees into it or from the beginning of the constellation of Sagittarius up to ten degrees into it, take a sixth of the second width. And if the moon would be from ten degrees into the constellation of Gemini up to twenty degrees into it or from ten degrees into the constellation of Sagittarius up to twenty degrees into it, take half of a sixth of the second width. And if the moon would be from twenty degrees into the constellation of Gemini up to twenty-five degrees into it or from twenty degrees into the constellation of Sagittarius up to twenty-five degrees into it, take a quarter of a sixth of the second width. And if the moon would be from twenty-five degrees into the constellation of Gemini up to five degrees into the constellation of Cancer or from twenty-five degrees into the constellation of Sagittarius up to five degrees into the constellation of Capricorn, do not take anything – since there is no deviation of the orbit. And if the moon would be from five degrees into the constellation of Cancer up to ten degrees into it or from five degrees into the constellation of Capricorn up to ten degrees into it, take a quarter of a sixth of the second width. And if the moon would be from ten degrees into the constellation of Cancer up to twenty degrees into it or ten degrees into the constellation of Capricorn up to twenty degrees into it, take a half of a sixth of the second width. And if the moon would be from twenty degrees into the constellation of Cancer up to its end or from twenty degrees into the constellation of Capricorn up to its end, take a sixth of the second width. And if the moon would be from the beginning of the constellation of Leo up to ten degrees into it or from the beginning of the constellation of Aquarius up to ten degrees into it, take a fifth of the second width. And if the moon would be from ten degrees into the constellation of Leo up to twenty degrees into it or ten degrees into the constellation of Aquarius up to twenty degrees into it, take a quarter of the second width. And if the moon would be from twenty degrees into the constellation of Leo up to ten degrees into the constellation of Virgo or from twenty degrees into the constellation of Aquarius up to ten degrees into the constellation of Pisces, take a third of the second width. And if the moon would be from ten degrees into the constellation of Virgo up to its end or from ten degrees into the constellation of Pisces up to its end, take two fifths of the second width. And this portion that you take from the second width is that which is called the orbit of the moon.",
            "And afterwards go back and consider the width of the moon and see whether it is northern or southern. If it was northern, subtract this orbit of the moon from the second length. But if it was southern, add this orbit to the second length. To what are these words applicable? When the place of the moon was from the beginning of the constellation of Aries to the end of the constellation of Gemini. But if the moon was from the beginning of the constellation of Cancer to the end of the constellation of Capricorn, the thing would be the opposite. Such that if the width of the moon would be northern, add the orbit to the second length. But if the width of the moon was southern, subtract the orbit from the second length. And that which is the second length after you have added to it or subtracted from it is that which is called the third length. And know that if there is no deviation of the orbit, that second length itself is the third length – no less and no more.",
            "And afterwards go back and see in which constellation is this third length – and that is the degrees that are between the moon and the sun: If it would be in the constellation of Pisces, add a sixth to the third length. And if the length would be in the constellation of Aquarius or the constellation of Taurus, add a fifth to the third length. And if the length would be in the constellation of Aries or the constellation of Gemini, add a sixth to the third length. And if the length would be in the constellation of Capricorn or the constellation of Cancer, leave the third length as it is, and do not add upon it or subtract from it. And if the length would be in the constellation of Scorpio or the constellation of Leo, subtract a third from the third length. And if the length would be in the constellation of Libra or the constellation of Virgo, subtract a fifth from the third length. And that which is the third length after you have added to it or subtracted from it or left it as it is, is that which is called the fourth length. And then go back to the first width of the moon, and always take two thirds of it. And that is what is called the divergence of the height (latitude) of the province. And consider and see: If the width of the moon is northern, add the divergence of the height of the province to the fourth length. But if the width of the moon is southern, subtract the divergence of the province from the fourth length. And that which is the fourth length after we add to it or subtract from it is that which is called the arc of the sighting. ",
            "How is this? See that [if] we came to determine if the moon would be visible or not on the night of the eve of Shabbat (Friday night) on the Second of the month of Iyar of this year: Produce the true place of the sun and the true place of the moon for this year, as we have informed you. It will come out for you that the true place of the sun is seven degrees and nine parts into the constellation of Taurus. Its symbol is 7.9. And the true place of the moon will come out for you to be eighteen degrees and thirty-six parts. Its symbol is 18.36. And it will come out for you that the width of the moon is three degrees and fifty-three parts on the southern side. Its symbol is 3.53. And that is the first width. Then subtract the the place of the sun from the place of the moon. The remainder will be eleven degrees and twenty-seven parts. Its symbol is 11. 27. And that is the first length. And since the moon was in the constellation of Taurus, the difference of the sighting of the length would be one degree. And it is fitting to subtract if from the first length. It comes out for you that the second length is ten degrees and twenty-seven parts. Its symbol is 10.27. And similarly would the difference of the sighting of the width be ten parts. And since the width of the sun was southern, it is fit to add the difference of the sighting – which is ten parts – to it. It comes out for you that the second width is four degrees and three parts. Its symbol is 4.3. And since the moon was eighteen degrees into the constellation of Taurus, it is fit to take a quarter from the second width; and that is called the orbit of the moon. It comes out for you that the orbit of the moon at that time is one degree and one part – for we are not exacting about seconds.",
            "And since the width of the moon is southern and the true place of the moon is between the [beginning] of Capricorn and the [beginning] of Cancer, it is fitting to add the orbit to the second length. It comes out for you that the third length is eleven degrees and twenty-eight parts. Its symbol is 11.28. And since this length is in the constellation of Taurus, it is fitting to add its fifth – which is two degrees and eighteen parts – to the third length. And it comes out for you that the fourth length is thirteen degrees and forty-six parts. Its symbol is 13:46. And we go back to the first width and take two thirds and it comes out to the divergence of the height of the province, which is two degrees and thirty-five parts. And since it was a southern width, it is fitting to subtract the height of the divergence of the province from the fourth length. The remainder for you is eleven degrees and eleven parts. Its symbol is 11.11. And that is the arc of the sighting on this night. And in this way you can [calculate] and know how many degrees and how many parts is the arc of the sighting for any night of sighting that you will ever want.",
            "And after you produce this arc, understand it and know that if the arc of the vision would be nine degrees or less, it is (then) [im]possible to see it in all of the Land of Israel. But if the arc of the sighting is more than fourteen degrees, it is impossible not to see it, and it would be visible in all of the Land of Israel.",
            "And if the arc of the sighting would be from the beginning of the tenth degree to the end of the fourteenth degree, measure the arc of the sighting with the first length; and you will know if it will be seen or not from the edges that it has – and they are called the edges of the sighting.",
            "And these are the edges of the sighting: If the arc of the sighting would be from more than nine degrees to the end of ten degrees or more than ten; and the first length would be thirteen degrees or more – it will certainly be seen. But if the arc will be less than this or the length will be less than this, it will not be seen. ",
            "And if the arc of the sighting would be from more than ten degrees to the end of eleven degrees or more than eleven; and the first length would be twelve degrees or more – it will certainly be seen. But if the arc will be less than this or the length will be less than this, it will not be seen. ",
            "And if the arc of the sighting would be from more than eleven degrees to the end of twelve degrees or more than twelve; and the first length would be eleven degrees or more – it will certainly be seen. But if the arc will be less than this or the length will be less than this, it will not be seen. ",
            "And if the arc of the sighting would be from more than twelve degrees to the end of thirteen degrees or more than thirteen; and the first length would be ten degrees or more – it will certainly be seen. But if the arc will be less than this or the length will be less than this, it will not be seen. ",
            "And if the arc of the sighting would be from more than thirteen degrees to the end of fourteen degrees or more than fourteen; and the first length would be nine degrees or more – it will certainly be seen. But if the arc will be less than this or the length will be less than this, it will not be seen. ",
            "How is this? We have come to examine [the sighting] with the arc of the sighting of the night of the eve of the Shabbat, the Second of the month of Iyar of this year. It came out in the calculation of the arc of the sighting to be eleven degrees and eleven parts, as you know. And since the arc of the sighting was between ten and fourteen, we measured it with the first length. And you have already known that the length on this night was eleven degrees and twenty-seven parts. And since the arc of the sighting was more than eleven degrees and the first length was more than (ten) [eleven], it is known that it will certainly be seen on this night, according to the edges fixed. And so should you estimate for each and every arc with its first length.",
            "And you have already seen from all of these actions, how many calculations are in it and how many additions and how many subtractions to the point that we have toiled much before we could produce approximate ways that do not have great sophistication to their calculations. For the [trajectory of the] moon is crooked. And therefore the Sages said (Rosh Hashanah 25a), \"'The sun knows its way' (Psalms 104:19); the moon does not know its way.\" And the Sages [also] said, \"Sometimes it comes long, sometimes it comes short.\" As you can see from these calculations that sometimes you add and sometimes you subtract until there is the arc of the sighting; and sometimes the arc of the sighting is long and sometimes short, as we have explained.   ",
            "And the explanation of all these calculations and what reason we add this amount and what reason we subtract and how we know each and every thing from these things and the proof for each and every thing is [all from] the wisdom of the seasons and of geometry, about which the sages of Greece composed many books. And they are now found in the hands of the sages. But the books that were composed by the Sages of Israel that were in the times of the prophets from the Children of Yissachar did not reach us. But since all of these things are with clear proofs that have no doubt and it is impossible for a person to question them, we are not concerned about the author – whether the prophets composed them or the nations composed them. As [regarding] anything the explanation of which is revealed and its truth is known from proofs that have no doubt, we relay on the man that said it or taught it with the proof that is revealed and the reason that is known. "
        ],
        [
            "It is well-known and clear that if the calculation [demonstrated] that the moon will be seen at night, it is [only] possible that it will be seen. But it is [also] possible that it will not be seen because of the clouds covering it or because of the place which is a valley or that there is a tall mountain blocking the western direction from the people of that place, such that it is as if they are residing in a valley. For the moon is not visible to someone in a low place even if it is big, but it is seen to someone standing on the top of a tall and steep mountain even when the moon is very small. And likewise is it visible to one dwelling by the seashore or to one traveling on a boat in the Great (Mediterranean) Sea, even though it is very small. ",
            "And likewise if it is a clear day in the winter, the moon will be more visible than it would be in the summer. [This is] because if it would be a clear day in the winter, the air would very pure and the sky would be seen with greater transparency; as there is no dust there to mix into the sky. But in the summer the air is as if it is smoky because of the dust, so the moon looks small.",
            "And anytime you find the arc of the sighting and the first length that you measure with it [to establish] the two edges to be narrow, the moon will be very small and it will only be visible in a very high place. But if you find the arc of the sighting and the first length to be very large and they have more degrees to the end of their edges, the moon will look large. So the size and visibility will be according to the largeness of the arc and the first length. ",
            "Hence it is fitting for the court to [pay attention] to these two things, which are the time of the sighting and its place. And they ask the witnesses, \"In which place did you see [it]?\" As if the arc of sighting was small and the calculation [demonstrates] that it will be seen narrowly – such as if the arc of the sighting was thirteen degrees and five parts, and the first length was exactly thirteen degrees – and witnesses came that saw it: If it was in the summer or they were in a low place, we suspect them and examine them much. But if it was in the winter or in a very high place, it was certainly seen unless there were clouds there intervening. ",
            "Witnesses that saw the [new] moon in its time and came and testified, and the court accepted them and sanctified this first month; and [then the court] counted twenty-nine days from the sanctified day and the moon was not visible on the thirtieth day, because it was impossible to see it, or it was covered with clouds – and surely the court anticipates it the whole thirtieth day, as we have explained – and witnesses do not come that the moon be ratified, it comes out that the second Rosh Chodesh (first day of the month) is the thirty-first day, as we have explained. ",
            "And they began to count twenty-nine days from the second Rosh Chodesh and the moon is not seen on the Night of the Thirtieth: If you say that we ratify it this way and make [that month] thirty and set the third Rosh Chodesh [on] the thirty-first day, it is thus possible that the moon will not be seen on the thirtieth night of this month as well, and they will come out continuing to ratify the months after the Thirtieth the whole entire year! And it comes out that in the last month, it is possible that the moon be seen on the Night of the Twenty-fifth or the the Night of the Twenty-sixth. And there is no more laughable and injurious matter than this.",
            "And do not say that this thing is not common, that the moon not be visible the whole year. Rather it is something very likely. As many times this, or that which is similar to it, happens in the provinces in which their winters are long and the clouds many. For we are not saying that the moon is not seen the whole year, but rather that it is not seen at the beginning of the month, but it is seen afterwards. And sometimes it is not seen because it is impossible to see it on [those times], and on the months that it is possible for one to see them, he does not see [it] because of the clouds or because it was very small and he did not focus on it.",
            "Rather the tradition that was in the hand of the Sages – one man from the mouth of another, from the mouth of Moshe, our teacher – is thus: That at a time when the moon is not seen at the beginning of [several] months – one month after the other – the court sets a [full] month of thirty days and a lacking month of twenty-nine day. And so they calculate and set the [full] month and the lacking month by setting – not by sanctification. For we only sanctify based on sighting. And sometimes they make a full [month] after a full [month], and sometimes a lacking [month] after a lacking [month], as it appears to them from the calculation. ",
            "And they always intend in their calculations that if the moon be sighted in the next month, it would be sighted in its time or on the night of the intercalation; not that it be seen before its time, which is the night of the twenty-eighth. And in these calculations of the sighting that we have explained it will be become elucidated to you and you will know when it is possible that it will be seen and when it is possible that it will not be seen. And upon this do we rely and intercalate one month after [another] or make one lacking month after [another]. But we never have less than four intercalated months in a year nor more than eight intercalated months. And also when we intercalate these months according to the calculation, we make the meal of intercalating the month, [that] we mentioned in the third chapter.",
            "And all that you find in the Gemara of the things that show that the court relies on the calculation, or from the mouth of Moshe from Sinai that the thing is given over to them and authority is in their hand to make a lacking [month] or to intercalate – and likewise that which one made nine lacking months in a year, or anything that is similar to it – it is all built on this principle, at a time when the new moon is not seen at its time. ",
            "And likewise that which the Sages said that we intercalate the month for a purpose is with these months that we intercalate according to the calculation and make one full and one lacking. And they may [thus] intercalate one month after another or make [two consecutive months] lacking. It is in this that we intercalate for a purpose, as the moon was not seen in its time. But when the moon is seen in its time, which is the beginning of its being seen after it intersects the [orbit of the] sun, we always sanctify it.",
            "And all of these things are at a time when there is a court and we rely upon the sighting. But in these times, we only rely upon the fixing with this intermediate calculation which has spread among all of Israel, as we have explained in these laws.",
            "It is explained in the books of the seasons and geometry that if the moon is seen in the Land of Israel, it will be seen in all of the provinces of the world that are to the west of the Land of Israel across from it. But if the calculation comes out that it will not be seen in the Land of Israel, it is possible that it will be seen in [other] provinces that are to the west of the Land of Israel across from it. Hence if the moon would be seen in a province that is to the west of the Land of Israel, there is no proof in this that it will not be seen in the Land of Israel. Rather it is possible that the moon will be seen in the Land of Israel. ",
            "But if the moon would not be seen at the top of the hills in the western province across from the Land of Israel, it is known that it was not visible in the Land of Israel. ",
            "And likewise, if the moon will not be seen in the Land of Israel, it is known that it not visible in all of the provinces of the world that are to the east of the Land of Israel across from it. But if it will be seen in the Land of Israel, it is possible that it will be seen in the eastern provinces, but it is [also] possible that it will not be seen. Hence if it will be seen in a province that is east of the Land of Israel and across from it, it is known that it is visible in the Land of Israel. But if it is not visible in the eastern provinces, there is no proof in this. Rather it is possible that it will be seen in the Land of Israel. ",
            "And all of these things are when the province in the west or in the east were across [from it], such that they extended to the north of the world (from its midpoint, meaning the equator) from thirty degrees to thirty-five degrees. But if they extended further or less than this to the north, they have different properties. For they are surely not across from the Land of Israel. And these things that we have explained about the cities of the East and the West are only to tell you the properties of sighting, 'to enlarge the Torah and to magnify it.' It is not that the residents of the East or the residents of the West rely upon the [local] sighting of the moon, or that it helps them at all. Rather we always only rely upon the sanctification of the court in the Land of Israel, as we have mentioned several times."
        ],
        [
            "Since the Sages said that among the things with which they would examine the witnesses was that they would say to them, \"Towards where was the moon inclining\" – it is proper in my eyes to make known the way of the calculation of this thing. But I will not be precise about it, since it is not useful in the sighting at all. And the beginning of this calculation is to know the incline of the constellations first.",
            "The orbit that the sun passes through half of the constellations is not one in which it passes through the middle of the [universe] from the eastern side to the western side. Rather it diverts from the even [circle] that circles in the middle of the [universe], towards the north or the south. Half of [its orbit] inclines towards the north and half of it inclines towards the south.",
            "And there are two points in it in which it meets the orbit of the even circle that circles in the middle of the [universe]. One point is at the [beginning] of the constellation of Aries. The second point across from it is at the [beginning] of the constellation of Libra. And it comes out that six constellation incline to the north, from the beginning of Aries to the end of Libra. And six incline to the south, from the beginning of the constellation of Libra to the end of the constellation of Pisces.",
            "And from the beginning of the constellation of Aries, the constellations begin to inline, little by little, and to move away from the even [circle] towards the north, to the [beginning] of Cancer. And the beginning of Cancer is approximately twenty-three and a half degrees away to the north of the even [circle]. And the constellations return to approach, little by little, the even [circle], until the [beginning] of Libra, which is on the even [circle]. And from the beginning of Libra, they begins to inline and to move away towards the south, to the [beginning] of Capricorn. And the [the beginning] of Capricorn is approximately twenty-three and a half degrees away to the south of the even [circle]. And the constellations return to approach, little by little, the even [circle], until the [beginning] of Aries. ",
            "It comes out that the [beginning] of Aries and the [beginning] of Libra orbit on the even [circle]. And hence when the sun will be in these two [beginnings], it will not incline – not to the north and not to the south. And it will rise at the midpoint of the east and it will set at the midpoint of the west. And day and night will be the same [amount of time] in all of civilization. ",
            "See that it is elucidated for you that each and every degree of the degrees of the constellations inclines to the north or to the south, and there is a [standard] measurement to its incline. And (the largeness) [the width] of the incline will not be more than approximately twenty-three and a half degrees.",
            "And these are the standard measures of the inclines according to the amount of degrees of the constellations: The incline of ten degrees is four degrees. The incline of twenty degrees is eight degrees. The incline of thirty degrees is eleven degrees. The incline of forty degrees is fifteen degrees. The incline of fifty degrees is eighteen degrees. The incline of sixty degrees is twenty degrees. The incline of seventy degrees is twenty-two degrees. The incline of eighty degrees is twenty-three degrees. The incline of ninety degrees is twenty-three and a half degrees.",
            "And if there be single digits, take their divergence for them from between the two [proximate] inclines [of tens], like we explained with the sun and with the moon. How is this? The incline of five degrees is two degrees. And if the amount of degrees was twenty-three, their incline is nine degrees. And in this way [should you calculate] with all the single digits that are with the tens. ",
            "And once you know the incline of the degrees up to ninety, you will know the incline of all of [the degrees], in the way that we informed you about the width of the moon: That if the amount was more than ninety up to one hundred and eighty, subtract it from one hundred and eighty. And if the amount was more than one hundred and eighty to two hundred and seventy, subtract one hundred and eighty from it. And if it was more than two hundred and seventy to three hundred and sixty, subtract it from three hundred and sixty. And you will know the incline of the remainder, and it is the incline of that amount that is in your hand (from 19:7-8 above) – without subtraction and without addition.",
            "If you want to know how many degrees the moon inclines from the the even [circle] towards the north of the universe or towards the south of the universe: First know how much is the incline of the degree which is the true place of the moon, and to which direction it inclines – to the north or to the south. Then go back and calculate and produce the first width of the moon and see if it is northern or southern. If the width of the moon and the incline of its degree are in one direction – such as if both of them were northern or southern – gather the sum of both of them. But if it comes out about the two directions that one is northern and one is southern, subtract the smaller of the two of them from the larger. And the remainder is the distance of the moon from the even [circle] in that direction which was the larger of the two of them.",
            "How is this? [If] we came to know how much the moon is inclining from the even [circle] on the night of the sighting, which is the Second of the month of Iyar of this year: And you have already known that the degree of the moon was nineteen degrees into the constellation of Taurus – its incline is about eighteen degrees to the north – and [that] the width of the moon was about four degrees to the south. Subtract the smaller from the larger. The remainder will be fourteen degrees. And it comes out that the moon is fourteen degrees from the even [circle] in the northern direction. As the larger amount – which is eighteen – was surely northern. And all of this calculation is approximate, as it is not useful in the sighting.",
            "If you want to know to which direction of the directions of the [universe] the moon inclines, calculate and know its distance from the even [circle]: If it is exactly on the even [circle] or within two or three degrees close to it to the north or to the south, it will appear even in the middle of the west and its [shady side] will appear exactly towards the east of the universe.",
            "But if it would be further to the north of the universe from the even [circle], it will be seen between the west of the universe and its north. And its [shady side] will be appear inclining across from the east of the universe towards the north of the universe. ",
            "And if it was further to the south of the universe from the even [circle], it will be seen between the west of the universe and its south. And its [shady side] will appear inclining across from the east of the universe towards the north of the universe. And according to the greatness of the distance [is] the greatness of the incline. ",
            "And among the investigations of the witnesses is that we say to them, \"How high was [it]?\" And this thing is known by the arc of the sighting: At the time that the arc of the sighting is small, the moon will appear as if it it close to the earth. And at a time when it is long, it will appear high from upon the earth. So its height from upon the earth as seen by the eyes [is] according to the size of the arc of the sighting. ",
            "See that we have elucidated the calculations of all of the ways that we require about the knowledge of the sighting and the investigating of the witnesses; so that all will be known to those who understand and that no path of the paths of the Torah be missing and that they [need] to stray to seek after it in other books. \"Search and read it in the book of the Lord; not one of these shall be absent\" (Isaiah 34:16).",
