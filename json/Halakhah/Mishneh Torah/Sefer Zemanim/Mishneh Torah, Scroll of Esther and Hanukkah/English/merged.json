            "We are bidden by the sages to read the <i>Megillah</i> at its proper time. It is widely known that this reading was prescribed by the prophets. Everyone is required to hear its reading: men, women, proselytes, and emancipated slaves. Minors should be trained to read it. And even priests amidst their service stop their service and come to hear the reading of the Scroll. And likewise do we stop Torah study to hear the reading of the Scroll — all the more so for the other commandments of the Torah. All of them are overridden on account of the reading of the Scroll. And there is nothing that overrides the reading of the Scroll, [to go] before it, except for a commanded corpse — [meaning one] that has no one to bury it. For one who encounters it must bury it first; and read [the Scroll] afterwards.",
            "It is the same [for both] the reader and the one who listens to the reader — he has fulfilled his obligation. And that is so long as he hears [it] from someone who is obligated in its reading. Hence if the reader was an infant or one mentally incapacitated, the one who listens [to it] from him has not fulfilled [his obligation]. ",
            "It is commandment to read all of it; and it is a commandment to read it at night and during the day. And all of the night is fit for the reading of the night; and all of the day is fit for the reading of the day. And before its reading at night, one recites three blessings — and these are them: Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us about the reading of the Scroll; Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who made miracles for our ancestors in those days at this time; Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has kept us alive, and preserved us and made us reach this time. And during the day, one does not repeat and recite the blessing, \"who has kept us alive.\" And in a place where they are accustomed to reciting a blessing after it, they should recite the blessing, \"Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who pleads our cause, and who judges our claim, and who avenges our vengeance, and who punishes our foes, and who brings retribution to our enemies. Blessed are You, Lord, who, on behalf of Israel, exacts punishment from all of their foes — the saving God.\"",
            "On what date should it be read? The sages prescribed several dates for it, because it is written: \"At their appointed times\" (Esther 9:31). These are the dates of reading the <i>Megillah:</i> Every town in Eretz Yisrael or abroad that was surrounded by a wall since the time of Joshua the son of Nun should read it on the fifteenth of <i>Adar</i>, even if it has no wall at the present. Such a town is referred to as a walled city. Every town that was not surrounded by a wall in the days of Joshua, even if it has a wall now, should read the <i>Megillah</i> on the fourteenth of <i>Adar</i>. Such a town is referred to as an open city.",
            "Although the castle-city of Shushan was not surrounded by a wall in the days of Joshua the son of Nun, the <i>Megillah</i> is read there on the fifteenth of <i>Adar</i>, because it was there that the miracle occurred, as it is written: \"They rested on the fifteenth\" (Esther 9:18). This was made to depend on the days of Joshua in deference to Eretz Yisrael which was in ruins at that time. The inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael were to be considered residents of walled cities so as to read the <i>Megillah</i> at the same time as the residents of Shushan. Although Eretz Yisrael is still desolate, its residents are to read the <i>Megillah</i> on the fifteenth of <i>Adar</i> in localities that used to be surrounded by defense walls during the period of Joshua. Eretz Yisrael is thus remembered in connection with the miracle of <i>Purim</i>.",
            "[Regarding] residents of villages that only gather in the synagogues on Monday and Thursday, [the Sages] ordained for them that they could preempt and read on the day of the assembly. How is this? If the day of the Fourteenth fell out to be on Monday or Thursday, they read it on the day. But if it come out to be on another day besides Monday or Thursday, they preempt and read it on the Monday or Thursday closest to it.",
            "How is that? If the Fourteenth came out to be on Sunday, they preempt and read on Thursday which is the Eleventh. If it came out to be on Tuesday, they read on Monday, which is the Thirteenth. If it came out to be on Wednesday, they read on Monday, which is the Twelfth. And all of these who preempt and read before the Fourteenth may not read with less than ten. ",
            "[Regarding] a village [that could otherwise] preempt and read on the day of the assembly: When they do not [actually] assemble on Mondays and Thursdays, they may only read it on the Fourteenth. And any city that does not have ten fixed idlers in the synagogue (ready to help) for the needs of the community, is surely like a village. So they can preempt and read on the day of the assembly. And if there are not ten men [in a village], its improvement is its ruin and they are surely like residents of a large city. So they can only read on the Fourteenth. ",
            "To what are these words applicable — that we preempt and read on the day of the assembly? At the time that Israel has a monarchy (ruled over themselves). But at this time, we may only read it in its time, which is the Fourteenth and the Fifteenth: The residents of the villages and the cities read on the Fourteenth and the residents of the [walled cities] read on the Fifteenth.",
            "[In a case of] a resident of a city that went to a [walled city]; or a resident of a [walled city] that went to a city: If he had in mind to return to his place at the time of the reading, but he delayed and did not return [in time] — he must read [on the date] like his place. But if he did not have in mind to return until after the time of the reading — he must read with the people of that place where he is [now]. And a [walled city] and all that is adjacent to it and all that can be seen with it — if there is no more than two thousand ells between them — is surely like the [walled city] and reads on the Fifteenth.",
            "A city which is a doubt — and it is not known whether it was surrounded by a wall at the time of Joshua bin Nun or it was surrounded afterwards — reads on both days, which are the Fourteenth and Fifteenth and on their nights. And they recite the blessing on its reading only on the Fourteenth, since that is the time of its reading for most of the world.",
            "[If] they read the Scroll during First Adar; and subsequently the year was made a leap year by the court — they must read it again during Second Adar at its time.",
            "The <i>Megillah</i> must not be read on the Sabbath. This is a precautionary measure, lest someone might take the <i>Megillah</i> to a skilled reader, transporting it four cubits or more through a public domain; for, though everyone is required to read the <i>Megillah</i>, not everyone is a skilled reader. For this reason, if the date for the reading of the <i>Megillah</i> falls on the Sabbath, it should be read prior to the Sabbath, while on the Sabbath itself the rules concerning <i>Purim</i> should be thoroughly discussed as a reminder that the day is <i>Purim</i>.",
            "If, for example, the fourteenth falls on a Sabbath, the inhabitants of open towns should read the <i>Megillah</i> on the preceding Friday, while the inhabitants of walled cities should read it on Sunday, their normal time. If the fifteen occurs on a Sabbath, the inhabitants of fortified cities should read it earlier, on Friday, which is the fourteenth, while the inhabitants of open towns should read it on the same day, which is the normal time for them. In such a case, all will be reading the <i>Megillah</i> on the fourteenth."

If] he read and forgot a verse and [then] read the next verse [after] it; went back to read the verse he forgot and [then] went back and read a third verse (where had had left off) — he has not fulfilled [his obligation], since he read one verse out of order. Rather what should he do? He should begin with the other verse that he forgot and read in order [from there].",

If a speaker of a foreign tongue heard the <i>Megillah</i> read from a copy written in the Hebrew language and in Hebrew script, he has fulfilled his duty, even though he did not know what they said. Similarly, if the <i>Megillah</i> is written in Greek, and he heard it read, he has discharged his duty, even though he knows no Greek, and even if the listener is familiar with Hebrew.",

And that is so long as it is written in the script of that language. But if it was written in Hebrew script and one read it in Aramaic to an Aramean — he has not fulfilled [his obligation]. For it comes out that this one was reading by heart. And since the reader did not fulfill his obligation, the one who heard it from him [also] did not fulfill his obligation.",

If, for example, while copying the <i>Megillah</i>, or expounding it, or proof-reading it, he intended to fulfill his duty with this reading, he has discharged his obligation; if he did not so intend, he has not fulfilled his duty. How is this? [If] he was writing it, or explicating it, or examining it: If he intended to fulfill [his obligation] with this reading, he has fulfilled [it]. But if he did not intend [to fulfill it], he did not fulfilled [it. If] he read and he was dozing off: Since he did not [actually] fall sleep, he has fulfilled [his obligation]. ",

When he had intention to fulfill [it] by reading the [Scroll] from which he is copying, at the time that he is writing. But if he does not have intention to fulfill [it in that manner], he does not fulfill it with this reading of that which he wrote. For one only fulfills his obligation by reading it from a [Scroll] in which all of it is written at the time of the reading.",
            "One who reads the scroll and erred in its reading and executed a flawed reading has fulfilled [his obligation] — since we are not exacting about its reading. [If] he read it standing or sitting — he has fulfilled [it] — even within a community (in the context of a public reading). But he should not, at the outset, read sitting within a community, due to the honor of the community. [If] two read it — [and] even ten — together, the readers and those listening to the readers have fulfilled [it]. And an adult can read it with an infant — even within a community.  ",

            "We may only write a Scroll with ink on a hide or on a parchment, like a Torah [scroll]. But if one wrote it with gallnut extract and iron sulfate, it is [also] fit. If he wrote it with other types of dyes, it is disqualified. And it requires scoring like a Torah itself. But its leather does not require processing for the sake of [the commandment. If] it was written on paper or on hide that was not processed or was written by an idolater or a heretic, it is disqualified.",
            "[If] it had blurred or torn letters in it: If their imprint is recognizable [as the correct letters] — it is fit, even if they were its majority. But if their imprint is not recognizable — if the majority of [its letters] were whole, it is fit; but if not, it is disqualified. And one who reads from it has not fulfilled [his obligation. If] the scribe had omitted letters or verses in it, but the reader reads them by heart — he has fulfilled [it].",
            "All of a Scroll needs to be sewn to the point that all of its hides be one scroll. And it can only be sewn with sinews, like a Torah [scroll]. So if one sewed it without sinews, it is disqualified. But one is not required to sew all of its pages with sinews, like a Torah [scroll]. Rather even if he sewed three stitches with sinews at the end of the page, three in the middle and three at the other end, it is fit — since it is called a letter (<i>iggeret</i>).",

And when he finishes, he goes back and rolls all of it and recites the blessing. ",

Lamentation and fasting are forbidden on these two days of the first <i>Adar</i> and the second <i>Adar</i>. The residents of the villages that preempted and read on the Monday or Thursday adjacent to Purim are permitted to eulogize and fast on the day of their reading.

Work is permitted; nevertheless it is improper to work on <i>Purim</i>. The sages have declared that anyone who works on <i>Purim</i> will never see a sign of success in that work. [Regarding] the residents of the villages that preempted and read on Monday or Thursday: If they distributed coins to the destitute on the day of their reading, they have fulfilled [their obligation]. But they may only do the joy and the meal on the Fourteenth. And if they preempted [this], they have not fulfilled [it]. And [one who] made a Purim meal at night has [also] not fulfilled his obligation.  ",
            "How is the obligation of this meal? That one eat meat and prepare as pleasing a meal as his hand can [afford]. And he should drink wine until he becomes intoxicated and falls asleep from his intoxication. And likewise is a person obligated to send two portions of meat or two types of dishes or two types of food to his fellow, as it is stated (Esther 9:22) \"and sending portions, one man to another\" — two portions to one man. And anyone who increases sending to friends is praiseworthy. And if he has no [means to do this], he should trade with his fellow: This one sends his meal to that one and that one sends his meal to this one — in order to fulfill, \"and sending portions, one man to another.\" ",

One gives one gift to each one: Coins or types of dishes or types of food. As it states (Esther 9:22) \"and gifts to the destitute\" — two gifts to two poor people. The applicants for <i>Purim</i> money should not be scrutinized; it should be given to anyone who holds out his hand. <i>Purim</i> money must not be diverted to any other charity.",

No joy is greater and more glorious than the joy of gladdening the hearts of the poor, the orphans, the widows, and the strangers. He who gladdens the heart of these unhappy people imitates God, as it is written: \"I am … to revive the spirit of the humble, and to put heart into the crushed\" (Isaiah 57:15).",

            "During the period of the second Temple, when the Greek kings were in power, they proclaimed decrees against the Jewish people, abrogating their religion and forbidding them to study the Torah or to perform the divine precepts. They laid their hands on their wealth and their daughters; they entered the Temple and broke through it, defiling the things that were pure. The people of Israel were sorely distressed by their enemies, who oppressed them ruthlessly until the God of our fathers took pity, saved and rescued them from the hands of the tyrants. The Hasmonean great priests won victories, defeating the Syrian Greeks and saving Israel from their power. They set up a king from among the priests and Israel's kingdom was restored for a period of more than two centuries, until the destruction of the second Temple.",
            "When, on the twenty-fifth of <i>Kislev</i>, the Jews had emerged victorious over their foes and destroyed them, they re-entered the Temple where they found only one jar of pure oil, enough to be lit for only a single day; yet they used it for lighting the required set of lamps for eight days, until they managed to press olives and produce pure oil.",
            "Because of this, the sages of that generation ruled that the eight days beginning with the twenty-fifth of <i>Kislev</i> should be observed as days of rejoicing and praising the Lord. Lamps are lit in the evening over the doors of the homes, on each of the eight nights, so as to display the miracle. These days are called <i>Hanukkah</i>, when it is forbidden to lament or to fast, just as it is on the days of <i>Purim</i>. Lighting the lamps during the eight days of <i>Hanukkah</i> is a religious duty imposed by the sages, like the reading of the <i>Megillah</i> on <i>Purim</i>.",
            "Anyone obligated to read the Scroll is obligated to light the Chanukah lamp. And the one who lights on the first night recites three blessings — and these are them: Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us to light the Chanukah lamp; who made miracles for our ancestors, etc.; and who has kept us alive, and preserved us, etc. And anyone who sees it and did not [yet] recite the blessing, recites two blessings: Who made miracles for our ancestors; and who has kept us alive. And on the other nights: The one who lights recites two blessings and the one who sees  recites one blessing. For we only recite the blessing, \"who has kept us alive,\" on the first night. ",
            "We complete the Hallel on each and every day of the eight days of Chanukah. And before it, we recite the blessing, \"Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us to complete the Hallel\" — both the individual or the community. Even though the reading of the Hallel is a commandment from the words of the Scribes (rabbinic), one recites the blessing, \"who has sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us\" — in the [same] way that we recite the blessing on the Scroll and on the <i>eruv</i> (which are also rabbinic). For we recite a blessing over any definite [commandment] from their words.  But we do not recite [this] blessing upon something from their words when its main doing is on account of a doubt. For example, we do not recite a blessing on the tithe of <i>demai</i>. So why do we recite a blessing on the second day, given that [the Sages] only ordained it because of a doubt? In order that [people] would not disparage it.  ",
            "And it is not only the Hallel of Chanukah that is from the words of the Scribes. Rather the reading of the Hallel is always from the words of the Scribes on all of the days in which we complete the Hallel. And it is a commandment to complete the Hallel on eighteen days in the year. And these are them: The eight days of the Festival (Sukkot); eight days of Chanukah; the first day of Passover; and the day of [Shavuot]. But there is no Hallel on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur because they are days of repentance, awe and fear — not days of excessive joy. And they did not ordain Hallel on Purim, because the Scroll [of Esther that is read on it] is the Hallel. ",
            "[In] places that make a holiday two days, they complete the Hallel on twenty-one days: The nine days of the Festival; eight days of Chanukah; two days of Passover; and two days of [Shavuot]. But on Rosh Chodesh, the reading of the Hallel is a custom and not a commandment; and it is [only practiced] in the community. Hence we read it with skipping; and we do not recite a blessing over it — since we do not recite blessing over customs. And an individual should not read [it] at all. But if he started, he should finish it. However he should read [it] with skipping, in the way that the community reads [it]. And likewise on the other days of Passover do we read with skipping, like Rosh Chodesh. ",
            "How do we skip? We begin from the beginning of the Hallel (Psalms 114:1) until \"a flinty rock into a spring of water\" (Psalms 114:8). [Then] one skips and says, \"The Lord is mindful of us\" (Psalms 115:12) until \"Halleluyah\" (Psalms 115:18). [Then] he skips and says, \"What can I repay the Lord\" (Psalms 115:12) until \"Halleluyah\" (Psalms 116:19). [Then] he skips and says, \"From the distress I called to the Lord\" (Psalms 118:5) until the end of the Hallel. This is the widespread custom, but there are those that skip [with] a different skipping. ",
            "The whole day is fit for reading the Hallel. And one who reads the Hallel out of order has not fulfilled [the obligation. If] he read and paused and went back to read it — even if he paused long enough to finish all of it — he has fulfilled [his obligation. On] days that we complete the Hallel, one may interrupt between one section (paragraph) and [another]. But he may not interrupt in the middle of a section. However on days on which we read with skipping, he may interrupt even in the middle of  a section.",
            "Every day that we finish the Hallel, we recite a blessing before it. And in a place where they are accustomed to reciting a blessing after it, one should recite the blessing. How should he recite the blessing? \"They shall bless You, Lord, our God — all of Your creations and the righteous ones and those that do Your will. And all of Your people, the House of Israel will praise Your name with glee. For You, Lord, is it good to praise, and it is pleasant to sing to Your name. And from everlasting to everlasting You are God. Praised are You, Lord, the King that is praised, exalted and glorified, living and existing — He will always reign forever and ever.\"",
            "There are places where they are accustomed to repeat [the verses] from \"I will praise You, because You have answered me\" (Psalms 118:21) until the end of the Hallel, [and] repeat each and every thing twice. And in a place where they are accustomed to repeat, one should repeat. And in a place where they are accustomed not to repeat, we should not repeat.",
            "The custom of reading the Hallel in the days of the early Sages was like this: After the [leader] who reads out the Hallel recites the blessing and begins and says, \"Halleluyah\" — [then] all of the people answer, \"Halleluyah.\" And he [continues] and says, \"Praise, servants of the Lord\" — and all of the people answer, \"Halleluyah.\" And he [continues] and says, \"Praise the name of the Lord\" — and all of the people answer, \"Halleluyah.\" And he [continues] and says, \"May the name of the Lord be blessed from now and forever\" — and all of the people answer, \"Halleluyah.\" And likewise for each and every thing; until they come out answering \"Halleluyah\" one hundred and twenty-three times in all of the Hallel. Its mnemonic is the years (lifespan) of Aaron.  ",
            "And likewise when the reader reaches the beginning of each and every section, they go back and repeat what he said. How is this? When he says, \"In the exodus of Israel from Egypt\" — all of the people repeat and say, \"In the exodus of Israel from Egypt.\" [Then] the reader says, \"the House of Jacob from a people of foreign speech\" — and all of the people answer, \"Halleluyah.\" Until he says, \"I have loved that the Lord hears my voice in my supplications\" — [then] all of the people repeat and say, \"I have loved that the Lord, etc.\" And likewise when the reader says, \"Praise the Lord, all of the nations\" — all of  the people repeat and say, \"Praise the Lord, all of the nations.\" ",
            "The reader [then] says, \"Please, Lord, save us\" — and they answer after him, \"Please, Lord, save us,\" even though it is not the beginning of a section. He says, \"Please, Lord, make us succeed\" — and they answer, \"Please, Lord, make us succeed.\" He says, \"Blessed is the one who comes\" — and all of the people answer, \"Blessed is the one who comes.\" But if the [leader] who reads out the Hallel was an infant or a slave or a woman, one answers what they say, word by word after them, throughout the Hallel. This is the first custom and it is appropriate to follow it. But in these times of ours, I have seen differing customs for its reading and for the answering of the people in all of the places. And not one is similar to the next."

            "[In a case of] a Chanukah lamp that was lit by a deaf-mute, a mentally incapacitated person, a minor or an idolater: He has not done anything until one who is obligated in lighting has lit it. [If] one lit it inside, took it lit outside and placed it at the entrance of his house — he has not done anything until he lights it in its place. One who held the lamp in his hand and stands has not done anything; for the viewer will say he is standing for his needs. [In a case of] a lantern that was lit the whole entire day: At the conclusion of Shabbat, he should extinguish it, recite the blessing and light it. For the lighting is the commandment, and not the placement. And it is permissible to light a Chanukah lamp from [another] Chanukah lamp.",
            "A courtyard that has two entrances on two sides needs to light two lamps — lest passersby on this side will say he did not place a Chanukah lamp [at all]. But if they were [both] on one side, he [only needs to] light in one of them.",
            "A guest for whom they light in his home does not need to light for himself in the place in which he is a guest. [But if] he does not have a home in which [they] light for him, he must light in the place where he is a guest; so he participates with them in [the cost of] the oil. But if (as a guest) he had his own house — even though they are lighting for him in his house — he needs to light in the house he is in because of the passersby.",
            "The precept of lighting the <i>Hanukkah</i> lamp is exceedingly precious, and one should carefully observe it in order to acclaim the miracle, ever praising and thanking God for the miracles which he has performed for us. Even if one has nothing to eat except what he gets from charity, he should borrow, or sell his garment, to buy oil and lamps and light them.",
            "See that [if] one has only one coin, and the Kiddush of the [Shabbat] and lighting the Hanukah lamp are before him — he should have buying oil for lighting the Hanukah lamp precede over buying wine for Kiddush of the day. Since they are both from the words of the Scribes (rabbinic) — it is better to have the Hanukah lamp precede, as it contains a memorial of the miracle.",
            "If a [poor] person must choose between Sabbath lights and <i>Hanukkah</i> lights, or between Sabbath lights and wine for <i>Kiddush</i>, the lighting of his home takes priority, so as to sustain peace in the house, since even the divine name was erased [in the oath of purgation—Numbers 5:12-31] to make peace between [a jealous] husband and his wife. Great is peace, since the entire Torah has been given to create peace in the world, as it is written: \"Its ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its paths are peace\" (Proverbs 3:17)."
