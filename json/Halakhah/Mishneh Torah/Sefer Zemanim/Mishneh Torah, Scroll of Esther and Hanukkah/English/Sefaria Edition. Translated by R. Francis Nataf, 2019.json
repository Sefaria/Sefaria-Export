            "We are bidden by the sages to read the <i>Megillah</i> at its proper time. It is widely known that this reading was prescribed by the prophets. Everyone is required to hear its reading: men, women, proselytes, and emancipated slaves. Minors should be trained to read it. And even priests amidst their service stop their service and come to hear the reading of the Scroll. And likewise do we stop Torah study to hear the reading of the Scroll — all the more so for the other commandments of the Torah. All of them are overridden on account of the reading of the Scroll. And there is nothing that overrides the reading of the Scroll, [to go] before it, except for a commanded corpse — [meaning one] that has no one to bury it. For one who encounters it must bury it first; and read [the Scroll] afterwards.",
            "It is the same [for both] the reader and the one who listens to the reader — he has fulfilled his obligation. And that is so long as he hears [it] from someone who is obligated in its reading. Hence if the reader was an infant or one mentally incapacitated, the one who listens [to it] from him has not fulfilled [his obligation]. ",
            "It is commandment to read all of it; and it is a commandment to read it at night and during the day. And all of the night is fit for the reading of the night; and all of the day is fit for the reading of the day. And before its reading at night, one recites three blessings — and these are them: Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us about the reading of the Scroll; Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who made miracles for our ancestors in those days at this time; Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has kept us alive, and preserved us and made us reach this time. And during the day, one does not repeat and recite the blessing, \"who has kept us alive.\" And in a place where they are accustomed to reciting a blessing after it, they should recite the blessing, \"Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who pleads our cause, and who judges our claim, and who avenges our vengeance, and who punishes our foes, and who brings retribution to our enemies. Blessed are You, Lord, who, on behalf of Israel, exacts punishment from all of their foes — the saving God.\"",

            "[Regarding] residents of villages that only gather in the synagogues on Monday and Thursday, [the Sages] ordained for them that they could preempt and read on the day of the assembly. How is this? If the day of the Fourteenth fell out to be on Monday or Thursday, they read it on the day. But if it come out to be on another day besides Monday or Thursday, they preempt and read it on the Monday or Thursday closest to it.",
            "How is that? If the Fourteenth came out to be on Sunday, they preempt and read on Thursday which is the Eleventh. If it came out to be on Tuesday, they read on Monday, which is the Thirteenth. If it came out to be on Wednesday, they read on Monday, which is the Twelfth. And all of these who preempt and read before the Fourteenth may not read with less than ten. ",

And if there are not ten men [in a village], its improvement is its ruin and they are surely like residents of a large city. So they can only read on the Fourteenth. ",

But if he did not have in mind to return until after the time of the reading — he must read with the people of that place where he is [now].

How is this? [If] he was writing it, or explicating it, or examining it: If he intended to fulfill [his obligation] with this reading, he has fulfilled [it].

[If] he read it standing or sitting — he has fulfilled [it] — even within a community (in the context of a public reading). But he should not, at the outset, read sitting within a community, due to the honor of the community. [If] two read it — [and] even ten — together, the readers and those listening to the readers have fulfilled [it]. And an adult can read it with an infant — even within a community.  ",

Lamentation and fasting are forbidden on these two days of the first <i>Adar</i> and the second <i>Adar</i>.

For we recite a blessing over any definite [commandment] from their words.  But we do not recite [this] blessing upon something from their words when its main doing is on account of a doubt. For example, we do not recite a blessing on the tithe of <i>demai</i>. So why do we recite a blessing on the second day, given that [the Sages] only ordained it because of a doubt? In order that [people] would not disparage it.  ",
            "And it is not only the Hallel of Chanukah that is from the words of the Scribes. Rather the reading of the Hallel is always from the words of the Scribes on all of the days in which we complete the Hallel. And it is a commandment to complete the Hallel on eighteen days in the year. And these are them: The eight days of the Festival (Sukkot); eight days of Chanukah; the first day of Passover; and the day of [Shavuot]. But there is no Hallel on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur because they are days of repentance, awe and fear — not days of excessive joy.

But on Rosh Chodesh, the reading of the Hallel is a custom and not a commandment; and it is [only practiced] in the community. Hence we read it with skipping; and we do not recite a blessing over it — since we do not recite blessing over customs. And an individual should not read [it] at all. But if he started, he should finish it. However he should read [it] with skipping, in the way that the community reads [it]. And likewise on the other days of Passover do we read with skipping, like Rosh Chodesh. ",
            "How do we skip? We begin from the beginning of the Hallel (Psalms 114:1) until \"a flinty rock into a spring of water\" (Psalms 114:8). [Then] one skips and says, \"The Lord is mindful of us\" (Psalms 115:12) until \"Halleluyah\" (Psalms 115:18). [Then] he skips and says, \"What can I repay the Lord\" (Psalms 115:12) until \"Halleluyah\" (Psalms 116:19). [Then] he skips and says, \"From the distress I called to the Lord\" (Psalms 118:5) until the end of the Hallel. This is the widespread custom, but there are those that skip [with] a different skipping. ",

However on days on which we read with skipping, he may interrupt even in the middle of  a section.",

How should he recite the blessing? \"They shall bless You, Lord, our God — all of Your creations and the righteous ones and those that do Your will. And all of Your people, the House of Israel will praise Your name with glee. For You, Lord, is it good to praise, and it is pleasant to sing to Your name. And from everlasting to everlasting You are God. Praised are You, Lord, the King that is praised, exalted and glorified, living and existing — He will always reign forever and ever.\"",

And in a place where they are accustomed to repeat, one should repeat. And in a place where they are accustomed not to repeat, we should not repeat.",

Its mnemonic is the years (lifespan) of Aaron.  ",
            "And likewise when the reader reaches the beginning of each and every section, they go back and repeat what he said. How is this? When he says, \"In the exodus of Israel from Egypt\" — all of the people repeat and say, \"In the exodus of Israel from Egypt.\" [Then] the reader says, \"the House of Jacob from a people of foreign speech\" — and all of the people answer, \"Halleluyah.\" Until he says, \"I have loved that the Lord hears my voice in my supplications\" — [then] all of the people repeat and say, \"I have loved that the Lord, etc.\" And likewise when the reader says, \"Praise the Lord, all of the nations\" — all of  the people repeat and say, \"Praise the Lord, all of the nations.\" ",

He says, \"Please, Lord, make us succeed\" — and they answer, \"Please, Lord, make us succeed.\" He says, \"Blessed is the one who comes\" — and all of the people answer, \"Blessed is the one who comes.\" But if the [leader] who reads out the Hallel was an infant or a slave or a woman, one answers what they say, word by word after them, throughout the Hallel. This is the first custom and it is appropriate to follow it. But in these times of ours, I have seen differing customs for its reading and for the answering of the people in all of the places.
