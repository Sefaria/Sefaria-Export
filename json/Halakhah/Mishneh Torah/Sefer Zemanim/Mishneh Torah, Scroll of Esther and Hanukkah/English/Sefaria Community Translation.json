As it is said: \"And presents to the poor.\" (Esther 9:22) -- [This implies] two gifts to two poor individuals. We should not be discriminating in selecting the recipients of these Purim gifts. Rather, one should give to anyone who reaches out their hand. Money given to be distributed on Purim should not be used for other charitable purposes."

They could not find any pure oil in the Sanctuary, with the exception of a single cruse. It contained enough oil to burn for merely one day. They lit the arrangement of candles from it for eight days until they could crush olives and produce pure oil."

Even if one does not have anything to eat outside of tzedakah [charity], [such] a [poor] person lends or sells their clothing and[, using that money,] acquires oil and candles and kindles [the flames]."
