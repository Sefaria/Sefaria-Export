            "We are bidden by the sages to read the <i>Megillah</i> at its proper time. It is widely known that this reading was prescribed by the prophets. Everyone is required to hear its reading: men, women, proselytes, and emancipated slaves. Minors should be trained to read it.— —",

            "On what date should it be read? The sages prescribed several dates for it, because it is written: \"At their appointed times\" (Esther 9:31). These are the dates of reading the <i>Megillah:</i> Every town in Eretz Yisrael or abroad that was surrounded by a wall since the time of Joshua the son of Nun should read it on the fifteenth of <i>Adar</i>, even if it has no wall at the present. Such a town is referred to as a walled city. Every town that was not surrounded by a wall in the days of Joshua, even if it has a wall now, should read the <i>Megillah</i> on the fourteenth of <i>Adar</i>. Such a town is referred to as an open city.",
            "Although the castle-city of Shushan was not surrounded by a wall in the days of Joshua the son of Nun, the <i>Megillah</i> is read there on the fifteenth of <i>Adar</i>, because it was there that the miracle occurred, as it is written: \"They rested on the fifteenth\" (Esther 9:18). This was made to depend on the days of Joshua in deference to Eretz Yisrael which was in ruins at that time. The inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael were to be considered residents of walled cities so as to read the <i>Megillah</i> at the same time as the residents of Shushan. Although Eretz Yisrael is still desolate, its residents are to read the <i>Megillah</i> on the fifteenth of <i>Adar</i> in localities that used to be surrounded by defense walls during the period of Joshua. Eretz Yisrael is thus remembered in connection with the miracle of <i>Purim</i>.",

This is a precautionary measure, lest someone might take the <i>Megillah</i> to a skilled reader, transporting it four cubits or more through a public domain; for, though everyone is required to read the <i>Megillah</i>, not everyone is a skilled reader. For this reason, if the date for the reading of the <i>Megillah</i> falls on the Sabbath, it should be read prior to the Sabbath, while on the Sabbath itself the rules concerning <i>Purim</i> should be thoroughly discussed as a reminder that the day is <i>Purim</i>.",
            "If, for example, the fourteenth falls on a Sabbath, the inhabitants of open towns should read the <i>Megillah</i> on the preceding Friday, while the inhabitants of walled cities should read it on Sunday, their normal time. If the fifteen occurs on a Sabbath, the inhabitants of fortified cities should read it earlier, on Friday, which is the fourteenth, while the inhabitants of open towns should read it on the same day, which is the normal time for them. In such a case, all will be reading the <i>Megillah</i> on the fourteenth."

            "During the period of the second Temple, when the Greek kings were in power, they proclaimed decrees against the Jewish people, abrogating their religion and forbidding them to study the Torah or to perform the divine precepts. They laid their hands on their wealth and their daughters; they entered the Temple and broke through it, defiling the things that were pure. The people of Israel were sorely distressed by their enemies, who oppressed them ruthlessly until the God of our fathers took pity, saved and rescued them from the hands of the tyrants. The Hasmonean great priests won victories, defeating the Syrian Greeks and saving Israel from their power. They set up a king from among the priests and Israel's kingdom was restored for a period of more than two centuries, until the destruction of the second Temple.",

            "Because of this, the sages of that generation ruled that the eight days beginning with the twenty-fifth of <i>Kislev</i> should be observed as days of rejoicing and praising the Lord. Lamps are lit in the evening over the doors of the homes, on each of the eight nights, so as to display the miracle. These days are called <i>Hanukkah</i>, when it is forbidden to lament or to fast, just as it is on the days of <i>Purim</i>. Lighting the lamps during the eight days of <i>Hanukkah</i> is a religious duty imposed by the sages, like the reading of the <i>Megillah</i> on <i>Purim</i>."
