            "It is a positive  commandment from the Torah to hear the sound of the shofar (animal horn) on Rosh Hashanah; as it is stated (Numbers 29:1), \"it shall be a day of blowing for you.\" The shofar which is blown — both on Rosh Hashanah and for the Jubilee year — is a bent ram's horn. And all shofars are disqualified except for the horn of a ram. Even though blowing with a shofar is not mentioned explicitly [in the passage] about Rosh Hashanah; it surely does state about the Jubilee year (Leviticus 25:9), \"you shall blast the shofar.\" And we have learned through the oral tradition that just as the blowing of the Jubilee year is with a shofar, so too is the blowing of Rosh Hashanah with a shofar. ",
            "In the Temple on Rosh Hashanah, they would blow with one shofar and two trumpets [on its two] sides. The shofar would blow long and the trumpets would blow short, since the commandment of the day was with the shofar. And why would they blow it together with trumpets? Because it is stated (Psalms 98:6), \"With trumpets and the blast of the shofar blow before the Lord, the King.\" But in other places on Rosh Hashanah, we only blow with a shofar exclusively.",
            "We do not blow with a shofar of idolaters at the outset. But if one did blow [with one], he has fulfilled [the commandment]. And if one blew [with a shofar] of a condemned city (<i>eer hanidachat</i>), he has not fulfilled [his obligation. Regarding] a stolen shofar with which he has blown, he has fulfilled [the obligation]. For the commandment is only listening to the sound — even though he did not touch it and did not raise it up, the listener has fulfilled [it] — and there is no law of theft with sound. And likewise should one not blow with the shofar of a burnt offering; but if he did blow [with it], he has fulfilled [the obligation]. For there is no law of misappropriating [the sacred] with sound. And if you say, \"Did he not derive pleasure from listening to the sound\"; [the answer is] that the commandments are not given for pleasure. Hence, one who has vowed not to derive pleasure from the shofar is permitted to blow the blow of the commandment with it.  ",
            "We do not profane the holiday — even regarding something that is on account of a Shabbat (holiday) decree — for the shofar of Rosh Hashanah. How is this? If a shofar was on top of a tree or over a river and one does not have [another] shofar besides it, he may not climb the tree and he may not swim over the surface of the water in order to bring it. And it is not necessary to say that we may not cut down [the tree] or do [other] forbidden work upon it. For blowing the shofar is a positive commandment, whereas [the sanctity of] the holiday is a positive commandment and a negative commandment — and a positive commandment does not override a negative commandment and a positive commandment. It is permissible to put water, wine or vinegar into [the shofar] on a holiday in order to make [its sound] clear. But one may not ever put urine into it, due to the respect [that must be shown to the shofar] — so that the commandments not become contemptible to him. ",
            "The [requisite] size of a shofar is [that it be long enough] that one hold it in one hand and it be seen from this [side] and that [side of his hand]. If it is cracked: Along its length, it is disqualified; along its width — if enough of it remained [intact to be] like the [requisite] size, it is fit, and it is as if it is cut off from the place of the crack. If  it became perforated: If he filled [the holes] with [something] that is not its type, it is disqualified. If he filled it with its type — if most of it remained intact and the holes that were filled do not prevent the sound, it is surely fit. [If] he drilled its [bone that fills the horn, and flattened it instead of removing it], it is fit — for its own type (which is now doubled up inside it) does not separate. [If] one glued shofar shards until he fashioned them into one [whole shofar], it is disqualified.",
            "If he added a minimal amount to it — whether of its type or whether not of its type — it is disqualified. If he plated it with gold inside or on the place that he puts his mouth (made a mouthpiece), it is disqualified. If he plated it on the outside: If the sound was changed from how it had been, it is disqualified; but if it did not change, it is fit. If one placed a shofar into a shofar: If he heard the sound of the inner one, he fulfilled [his obligation]; but if he heard the sound of the outer one, he did not fulfill [it]. If he widened the narrow [end of the shofar] and narrowed [its] wide [end], it is disqualified. ",
            "If it was long and one shortened it, it is [still] fit. If he scraped it out — whether from the inside or whether from the outside —  even if he left it so that [only] its soft layer remains, it is fit. [If] its sound was low or high or rough, it is fit. For all sounds are fit with a shofar.",
            "[If a case of] one who blows a shofar inside a pit or inside a cave: Those standing inside the pit or the cave have fulfilled [their obligation. Regarding] those standing outside — if they heard the sound of the shofar, they have fulfilled [their obligation]; but if they heard the sound of an echo, they have not fulfilled [their obligation]. And likewise one blowing into a large barrel — if he heard the sound of the shofar, he has fulfilled [his obligation]; but if he heard the sound of an echo, he has not fulfilled [his obligation]."
        ],
        [
            "All are obligated to hear the sound of the shofar — priests (Kohanim), Levites, Israelites, converts and freed slaves. But women, slaves and children are exempt. One who is half a slave and half a free person, one who has genitalia of both sexes and one whose genitalia are covered by a layer of skin (and, so, undetermined) are obligated.",
            "Anyone who is not obligated in something may not serve as an agent to fulfill the obligation of one who is obligated. Hence one who hears a child or a woman who blew with a shofar has not fulfilled [his obligation]. One who has genitalia of both sexes may serve as an agent for its [own] type, but may not serve as an a agent for [those] not its type. One whose genitalia are covered by a layer of skin may neither serve as an agent for its type nor not its type. For [if the layer of skin] is torn, it is possible that it will be found to be a male and it is possible that it will be found to be a female (such that in actual fact, it is not really a different type, but rather definitively either male or female).",
            "And likewise one who is half a slave and half a free person may not even serve as an agent for himself. For the side of slavery in him may not serve as an agent for the side of freedom in him. So how can he fulfill his obligation? He should listen to a free man that will blow for him.",
            "One who is [practicing] blowing the shofar to teach himself, has not fulfilled his obligation. And likewise one who hears [the shofar] from one [practicing] has not fulfilled [his obligation]. If the hearer [of the shofar] had intent to fulfill [his obligation], but the blower did not have intent to be his agent, or if the blower had intent to be his agent, but the hearer did not have intent to fulfill [his obligation] — he has not fulfilled his obligation, until [both] the hearer and the sounder have intent. ",
            "[In a case of] one who blew and had intent to serve as an agent for every one hearing his blowing, and a hearer heard [it] and had intent to fulfill his obligation: Even though the blower did not have intent for this [particular person] that heard his blowing, and does not [even] know him, he has fulfilled [his obligation]. For he surely had intent for all who would hear him. Hence one who was walking on the way or sitting in his house and heard the blows from the prayer leader has fulfilled [his obligation] — if he had intent to fulfill [it]. For the prayer leader surely intended to serve as an agent for the community to fulfill their obligation. ",
            "[When] the holiday of Rosh Hashanah falls out on Shabbat, we may not blow the shofar in any place. [This is the case] even though blowing [the shofar] was forbidden only on account of a Shabbat decree; so it would have been appropriate that we would blow — a positive commandment of the Torah would come and override a Shabbat decree from the words [of the Sages]. So why do we not blow? [Because of] a decree lest one take it in his hand and carry it to someone to blow for him, and [in the process,] carry it four ells in the public domain, or transfer it from one domain to another — and come to a prohibition [punishable by] stoning. [This is necessary because] all are obligated in  blowing [the shofar], but not all are expert at blowing [it].",
            "We do not prevent infants that have not reached [the age of] education from blowing [the shofar] on a Shabbat that is not the holiday of Rosh Hashanah in order that they learn [how to blow]. And on a holiday, it is [even] permissible for an adult to be involved with them in order to teach them — whether it is a child that has reached [the age of] education or whether it is a child that has not reached [the age of] education. For blowing is only forbidden on account of a Shabbat decree. ",
            "When they made a decree not to blow on Shabbat, they only decreed about a place where there is no court. But at the time that the Temple existed and the High Court was in Jerusalem, everyone in Jerusalem  would blow on Shabbat [that was Rosh Hashanah] the whole time that the court was seated [there]. And it was not only the people of Jerusalem, but rather every city that was within the perimeter of Jerusalem  — and could see it, [which excludes one] in a ravine; and could hear it, [which excludes one] on a mountaintop; and that was able to come to Jerusalem, [which excludes one with] a river separating them — the people of that city would blow on Shabbat, like Jerusalem. But in the other cities of Israel, they did not blow.",
            "But at this time [after] the Temple was destroyed, we may blow on Shabbat in any place that has a permanent court — and that is so long as it was ordained in the Land of Israel. And we only blow on Shabbat in a court that has sanctified the moon (ratified the new month). But we may not blow in other courts, even though they were ordained. And we only blow exclusively in front of the High Court, so long as they are seated. And even if they moved to get up but did not [yet] get up, we may blow in front of them. However we may not blow outside of the court. And why may we blow in front of the court? Because the court is alacritous and the blowers would not come to transport a shofar in the public domain in front of them. For the court would warn the people and inform them [of the prohibition].",
            "At this time that we make two days [of Rosh Hashanah] in the Exile — in the same way that we blow on the first, so too do we blow on the second. And if the first day fell out on Shabbat and there was no court fitting to blow in that place, we blow only on the second."

        [
            "How many blasts is one obligated to hear on Rosh Hashanah? Nine blasts. Since it is stated, \"<i>teruah</i>,\" with regards to the jubilee year and to Rosh Hashanah three times. And every teruah requires a simple blast (tekiah) before it and a simple blast after it. And from the oral tradition, they learned that all of the teruahs of the seventh month are the same: Whether on Rosh Hashanah, or whether on Yom Kippur of the Jubilee year, we blow nine blasts on both of them — tekiah, teruah, tekiah; tekiah, teruah, tekiah; tekiah, teruah, tekiah. ",
            "Due to the length of the years and the great [burdens] of exile, we have a doubt about this teruah that is mentioned in the Torah, and we do not know how it is. It may be the wail that women wail amongst themselves at the time that they weep. Or it may be the sigh that one sighs, time after time, whilst his heart is worried about a big thing. Or both of them together — the sigh and the wail, as it is the way [of a wail] to come after it — may be called teruah. For this is the way of a worrier, to first sigh, and then wail. Hence we do all [three possibilities].",
            "The wail is what we [today] call teruah (even though it is only one possibility of what the Torah meant by the word). And the sighing — this after that — is what we call three shevarim. It comes out that the order of shofar blasts is like this: One recites the blessing and blows — a tekiah, three shevarim after it, a teruah after that and a tekiah after [the teruah]. And he goes over this order three times. Then he blows — a tekiah, three shevarim after it and a tekiah after that. And he goes over this order three times. Then he blows — a tekiah, a teruah after it and a tekiah after that. And he goes over this order three times. It comes out that the number of blasts is thirty — in order to avoid a doubt. ",
            "The [requisite] measure of a teruah is like two tekiahs. The [requisite] measure of three shevarim is like a teruah. See that if one sounded a tekiah and a teruah and sounded a long tekiah like two of the first, we do not say [that] it is considered like two tekiahs and that he can [continue the order and] sound a teruah after it and then a tekiah. Rather even if he dragged out the sound of the tekiah the whole day, it is only one tekiah; so he must go back and sound [another] tekiah [before] he sounds a teruah and a tekiah [to complete the] three times.",
            "[If] one heard a tekiah at one time and a second one at a second time — even if he waited the whole entire day — they surely combine, and he has fulfilled his obligation. And that is so long as he heard each of the three series of them in its order. Not that he heard a teruah and two tekiahs after it, or two tekiahs and a teruah after them, or that which is similar to them. ",
            "[If] one heard nine blows from nine men at once (together), he has not fulfilled even one. [But if it was] a tekiah from this one, a teruah from that one and a tekiah from the third one, one after the other, he has fulfilled [his obligation] — and even if was interrupted and even if it was [over] the entire day. However, he does not fulfill his obligation until he hears all nine blows, since they are all one commandment. Hence they impede one another.",
            "The community is obligated to hear the tekiahs according to the order of the blessings (of the silent amidah prayer). How is that? The prayer leader says [the three standard introductory blessings known as], <i>avot</i> (forefathers), <i>gevurot</i>, (strengths) and <i>kedushat Hashem</i> (sanctity of the name); <i>malkhiot</i> (kingships); and blows three blows. He then says, <i>zikhronot</i> (remembrances) and blows three. Then he says <i>shofarot</i> (shofar blows) and blows three. And he [concludes with the concluding sections known as] <i>avodah</i> (service), <i>hodiyah</i>; (thanksgiving) and the blessing of the priests.",
            "These three middle blessings of Rosh Hashanah (every year) and Yom Kippur on the Jubilee year — which are <i>malkhiot</i>, <i>zikhronot</i> and <i>shofarot</i> impede one another. And in each of these blessings, one must say ten verses [that are] like the essence of the blessing — three verses from the Torah, three from the Book of Psalms, three from the Prophets, and one [more] from the Torah. But if he concludes with [a verse] from a Prophet, he has fulfilled [his obligation]. And if he [only] said one verse from the Torah, one from the Writings and one from the Prophets, he has fulfilled [it]. And even if [all he] said was, \"And in Your Torah, Lord, our God, it is written, stating\" — and he says a verse from the Torah, and stopped — he no longer needs anything [else to fulfill the obligation].   ",
            "We may not mention <i>malkhiot</i>, <i>zikhronot</i> and <i>shofarot</i> of punishment — such as [in] <i>zikhronot</i>, \"And all flesh shall remember that, etc.\" (Psalms 78:39);  [in] <i>malkhiot</i>, \"with outpoured anger shall I rule over you\" (Ezekiel 20:33); [and in] <i>shofarot</i>, \"Blow the shofar on the mountain, etc.\" (Hosea 5:8). Nor [may we mention] the remembrance of an individual — even if it was for good — such as \"Remember me, O Lord, in the desire of Your people\" (Psalms 106:4); and \"Remember me, my God, for the good\" (Nehemiah 13:31). And recollections (<i>pikdonot</i>) — such as \"I have surely recalled you\" (Exodus 3:16) — are not the same as remembrances. But one may mention the punishment of idolatrous nations, such as \"The Lord reigned, nations tremble\" (Psalms 99:1); \"Remember the day of Jerusalem to the Children of Edom\" (Psalms 137:7); [and] \"the Lord, God, will blow with the shofar, and go in the storms of the south\" (Zechariah 9:14). All of these verses: \"Hear Israel, the Lord, our God, the Lord is one\" (Deuteronomy 6:4); \"You have been shown to know\" (Deuteronomy 4:35); \"And you shall know today and place upon your hearts, etc.\" (Deuteronomy 4:39) — their content is kingship. Even though there is no mention of kingship [in them], it is surely like, \"The Lord will reign forever and ever\" (Exodus 15:18); [and] \"And then He became King in Jeshurun, etc.\" (Deuteronomy 33:5).",
            "The widespread custom about the order of the public [shofar] blows on Rosh Hashanah is like this: After we read from the Torah and return the Torah scroll to its place, all of the people sit; and one [of them] stands and recites the blessing, \"Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us to listen to the sound of the shofar,\" and all the people answer, \"Amen.\" And he then recites the blessing, \"who has kept us alive;\" and all the people answer, \"Amen,\" after him. And he blows the thirty blows that we mentioned [were] on account of the doubt, according to [their] order. And we say, Kaddish, and stand and pray the additional (Musaf) prayer. And after the prayer leader finishes the fourth blessing — which is <i>malkhiot</i> — he blows a tekiah, three shevarim, a teruah and a tekiah one time. And he recites the fifth blessing — which is <i>zikhronot</i>. And after he finishes it, he blows a tekiah, three shevarim and a tekiah. And he [then] recites the sixth blessing — which is <i>shofarot</i>. And after he finishes it, he blows a tekiah, a teruah and a tekiah one time, and he finishes the prayer. ",
            "The one that blows when they are sitting is the one that blows [afterwards] according to the order of the blessings (of the silent amidah prayer) when they are standing. And he does not speak between the blows of [when they are] seated and the blows of [when they are] standing. But if he did speak between them — even though he transgressed — he does not recite the blessing again.",
            "It would have been appropriate  that they would blow all of the sets for each blessing, in the way that they blew [them] when they were sitting. However, since they have already [covered] the doubt with the blows of [when they were] seated, we do not burden the community to repeat them all during the order of the blessings. Rather one set in each blessing is enough for them [just] so that they hear [shofar] blows during the order of the blessings. And all of these things are in public. But [regarding] an individual — whether he heard [the blows] according to the order of the blessings, or did not hear according to the order of the blessings; whether standing or sitting — there is no custom about it.",
            "The [shofar] blows do not impede the blessings [of the Musaf prayer on Rosh Hashanah]. Nor do the blessings impede the [shofar] blows. [In a case of] two cities — in one, one knows that there is certainly someone there who will recite the nine blessings for [the community], but there is no one to blow; and in the second, there is a doubt if there is someone to blow or there is not someone to blow (but there is no one to recite the blessings): One should go to the second. For blowing is from the words of the Torah, whereas the blessings are from the words of the Scribes (rabbinic)."

[This is as a] decree lest one move it in his hand four ells in a public domain, like [the Sages] decreed concerning the shofar. ",
            "And why did they not decree this decree on the first holiday? Because it is a commandment from Torah writ — even in the outlying areas (outside of Jerusalem). It comes out that its law and the law of the other days are not the same; as in the other days of the festival, one is not obligated to lift up the <i>lulav</i> except in the Temple.",
            "After the destruction of the Temple it was ruled that the <i>lulav</i> should be waved on each of the seven days of the festival, in remembrance of the Temple usage. And each and every day, he recites upon it the blessing, \"who has sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us about the lifting up of the <i>lulav</i>\" — for it is a commandment of the words of the Scribes (on the other days). And [regarding] this ordinance — along with all of the ordinances ordained by Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai after the Temple was destroyed — the things will return to their previous state, when the Temple will be rebuilt.",
            "At the time when the Temple was standing, the <i>lulav</i> was lifted up [in Jerusalem] on the first day that came out to be on Shabbat. And likewise in other places that knew with certainty that this day was the day of the festival in the Land of Israel. But distant places that did not know about the [time of the] determination of the new month did not lift up the <i>lulav</i>, because of [this] doubt.",
            "But from when the Temple was destroyed, the Sages forbade to lift up the <i>lulav</i> on Shabbat on the first day — even [for] the residents of the Land of Israel that sanctified the month. [This was] on account of the residents of the distant outlying areas that do not know about the [time of the] sanctification of the [new] month — so that all would be the same in this thing, and it not be that these would lift it up on Shabbat and those would not lift it up. [This is] since the obligation of the first day is the same in every place and there is no Temple there upon which to make [a difference] dependent.",
            "And at this time when all go according to the calculation (set calendar), the thing remained as it was; that the <i>lulav</i> not be lifted up on Shabbat at all — not in the outlaying areas and not in the Land of Israel — and even on the first day; even though everyone knows about the [time of the] sanctification of the [new] month. And we have already explained that the the main [reason] for the prohibition of lifting up the <i>lulav</i> on Shabbat is lest one will transport four ells in a public domain.",
            "",
            "It is a law from Moses [received] at Sinai that we bring another willow branch in the Temple besides that willow in the <i>lulav</i>. And one does not fulfill his obligation with the willow in the <i>lulav</i>. And its requisite size is even one leaf on one branch.",
            "How was its commandment? On each and every one of the seven days, they would bring tall willow branches and stand them upright at the sides of the altar, and the tops of the branches would be inclined over the altar. And at the time that they would bring them and arrange them, they sounded [three shofar blasts,] a tekiah, a teruah, and a tekiah. If the Shabbat came out to be in the middle of the festival, they did not stand the willow upright; unless the seventh day came out to be on Shabbat. [Then] they would stand it upright in order to publicize that it is a commandment.",
            "How would they do it? They would bring it from the eve of Shabbat and place it in basins of gold so that the leaves would not wilt. And on the morrow, they would stand it upright over the altar. And the people would come and take from it and lift it up like they would do every day. And since this [practice with the] willow is not explicit in the Torah, we do not lift it up all seven days of the festival. Rather, at this time, it is only on the seventh that we lift it up. How does one [do it]? One takes one branch or several branches besides that willow in the <i>lulav</i>. And one hits with it two or three times on the ground or on a vessel, without a blessing. For this thing is a custom of the prophets.",
            " And each and every day, they would circle the ark one time with their <i>lulav</i>s in their hands. And [they would] say, \"Please, Lord, save us please; please, Lord, make us succeed, please\" (Psalms 118:25). And on the seventh day, they would circle the altar seven times. And all of Israel in all of the places have already been accustomed to placing an ark in the middle of the synagogue and circling it on each day — in the way that they circled the altar — in memory of [what was done in] the Temple.",
            "",
            "A woman may receive the <i>lulav</i> from the hand of her son or from the hand of her husband and return it to water on Shabbat, at the time that they would lift up the <i>lulav</i> on Shabbat. And she may add water [to it] on a holiday; and change the water on [the intermediate days of] the festival.",
            "It is forbidden to smell from the myrtle in the <i>lulav</i>, because it is only fit for smelling. And since it was designated (<i>muktseh</i>) for the commandment, it is forbidden to smell from it. But it is permissible to smell from the citron. For it was surely designated (<i>muktseh</i>) [away] from eating.",
            "And it is forbidden to eat the citron all of the seventh day. Since it was designated (<i>muktseh</i>) for part of the [seventh] day, it is designated for the whole day. But it is permissible to eat [it] on the eighth day. But at this time that we do two days — even though we do not lift up the <i>lulav</i> on the eighth [day] — the citron is forbidden on the eighth, the [same] way it was forbidden on the eighth at the time that they were doing two days because of a doubt that [the eighth day was actually] the seventh. [If] one designated out seven citrons for the seven days — he fulfills [his obligation with] each and every one, and he may eat it on the morrow. "
