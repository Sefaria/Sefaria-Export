            "It is a positive commandment from the Torah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sefer Hamitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 170) and <i>Sefer Hachinuch</i> (Mitzvah 405) count this mitzvah as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> to hear the sounding of the shofar<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The mitzvah is not the blowing of the shofar, as might be inferred from the verse, but rather listening to the blowing. The blessing recited before the fulfillment of this mitzvah, praising God for commanding us \"to listen to the sounding of the shofar (Chapter 3, Halachah 10),\" emphasizes this principle.<br>Accordingly, the Rambam writes (Chapter 1, Halachah 8) that a person who blows a shofar without hearing it does not fulfill the mitzvah. Conversely, he writes (Responsum 78) that if the mitzvah were the blowing of the shofar, a person who heard it being blown, but did not blow it himself, would not fulfill his obligation.<br>It must be noted that the published text of the siddur of Rav Amram Gaon states that the mitzvah is \"to sound the shofar.\" Also, concerning the blowing of the shofar in the <i>yovel</i>, the Rambam himself writes that: \"it is a positive mitzvah to blow the shofar on the tenth of Tishre... (<i>Hilchot Shemitah V'Yovel</i> 10:10).\"</i> on Rosh HaShanah, as [Numbers 29:1] states: \"It shall be a day of sounding [the ram's horn] for you.\"<br>The<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Though the ram's horn is not explicitly mentioned in the verse, our Sages derived the requirement as the Rambam explains.</i> shofar, which is sounded both on Rosh HaShanah and for the <i>yovel</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">to announce the freeing of the slaves and the return of property, as explained in Leviticus 25:9-13.</i> is a bent<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rams' horns are always bent. This, too, has homiletic significance, referring to the bending over of our proud hearts. (See <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 26b.)</i> ram's horn.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 16a states that a ram's horn is used to recall the <i>akedah</i> (binding) of Isaac.</i> All shofarot other than that of a ram are unacceptable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's opinion is based on the statement of Rav Levi (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 26b), who declares: \"The mitzvah of Rosh Hashanah is to be performed with bent [shofarot],\" implying the use of a sheep's or ram's horn for that is their natural shape.<br>The Ra'avad, Rabbenu Asher, and many other Rishonim maintain that Rav Levi desired to designate the type of shofar which is most preferable to use, but did not intend to disqualify the horns of other animals. Their view is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 586:1), which states that it is desirable to use the horn of a ram. However, if that is not possible, the horn of any animal may be used. The only exceptions are the horns of a cow and some wild animals whose horns are single, solid entities (Ramban).</i><br>Even though the sounding of the shofar on Rosh HaShanah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The above verse merely mentions יום תרועה - \"a day of sounding\" - without stating what must be sounded.</i> is not explicitly mentioned in the Torah [it was derived by our Sages in the following manner]. Concerning the <i>yovel</i>, [Leviticus 25:9] states: \"You shall make a proclamation, sounding the shofar... you shall proclaim with the shofar.\" The oral tradition<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 33b</i> explains that just as the \"sounding\" required by the Torah in the <i>yovel</i> requires a shofar, so, too, the \"sounding\" on Rosh HaShanah requires a shofar.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An analogy (גזרה שוה) is drawn between the two verses, to teach that the same type of \"sounding\" is required on both occasions. Thus, since the Torah specifies states that the \"sounding\" of the <i>yovel</i> is carried out with a shofar, that same instrument is used on Rosh HaShanah.</i>",
            "In the Temple,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As will be explained in the commentary to Chapter 2, Halachah 8, and Chapter 7, Halachah 13, in certain contexts the Rambam interprets the expression במקדש - literally, \"in the holy place\" - as referring to the entire city of Jerusalem. (See also the Rambam's commentary to the mishnah, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 4:1.) However, in the present context, it refers to the Temple alone. Thus, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 27a states that the shofar was sounded in this manner only \"on the Temple Mount and at the eastern gate.\"</i> on Rosh HaShanah, they would blow [the shofar in the following manner]: There was one shofar and two trumpets, [one on either] side.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse from Psalms mentions \"the voice of the shofar,\" using the singular. In contrast, it refers to \"trumpets.\"</i> The sounding of the shofar was extended,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">for greater emphasis</i> while that of the trumpets was shortened, because the mitzvah of the day is performed with the shofar.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 26b contrasts the sounding of the shofar and trumpets on Rosh HaShanah with their being blown on a fast day declared because of unfavorable conditions. On the latter occasion, the sounding of the trumpets was emphasized in keeping with the instructions of Numbers 10:9.</i><br>Why were the trumpets sounded together with it? Because [Psalms 98:6] states: \"You shall sound trumpets and the voice of the shofar before God, the King.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 27a states that the expression \"before God\" implies: in the Temple.</i> However, in other places<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">even within Jerusalem</i> on Rosh Hashanah, only the shofar is blown.",
            "At the outset, we should not blow a shofar of idol worship.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For it is not appropriate to use such a shofar for a mitzvah.</i> However, if one sounded it, one has fulfilled his obligation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that this refers to a shofar belonging to a gentile that was used in the worship of idols, or a shofar which was itself worshiped as an idol. However, as will be explained, if the shofar of idol worship belonged to a Jew or if it was made from the horn of an animal that was sacrificed to an idol, even after the fact, its use is not acceptable.</i> [In contrast,] should one sound a shofar belonging to an apostate city,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">עיר הנדחת. Deuteronomy 13:13-19 describes the laws governing a city in which the majority of the inhabitants have turned to idol worship. All the idolaters must be slain and all the homes and property burned. No benefit may be derived from them. (See also <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i>, Chapter 4.)</i> one has not fulfilled one's obligation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 28a explains that the difference between a shofar of idol worship and one of an apostate city is that all the property within the latter must be destroyed. Since ultimately this shofar must be burnt, even before it is actually destroyed it is no longer considered to be an existent entity. Thus, we may not use it on Rosh HaShanah, because a shofar used for the mitzvah must be of a specific size - slightly larger than one's hand, as mentioned in Halachah 5 - and a nonexistent entity has no size at all.<br>A shofar of idol worship must also be destroyed. However, should the gentile negate its connection to idol worship before it is acquired by a Jew, it need not be destroyed, as stated in <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 8:8. Since there is a possibility that it will not have to be destroyed, it is considered to be an existent entity and may be used for the mitzvah.<br>This principle applies only to aspects of idol worship belonging to a gentile. It is impossible to negate the connection between an idol worshiped by a Jew and its forbidden nature. (See <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 8:9.) Hence, a Jew's shofar of idol worship may not be used. Similarly, if a Jew has acquired a shofar of idol worship that belonged to a gentile before the latter negated its connection to idol worship, the Jew is no longer capable of negating this connection. Therefore, such a shofar may not be used on Rosh HaShanah.<br>Also, once an animal has been sacrificed to an idol, there is no possibility of negating its connection to idol worship. Hence, its horn may not be used as a shofar.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 586:3-4) quotes all the above laws as halachah. The Ramah relates that certain authorities recommend not using even a gentile's shofar of idol worship unless we know that he negated its connection with idol worship before Rosh HaShanah begins.</i><br>Concerning a stolen shofar:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">one who blows it fulfills his obligation - Though in general, a mitzvah performed with a stolen article is not acceptable (see Chapter 8, Halachah 1; <i>Hilchot Chametz U'Matzah</i> 6:7), this case is an exception...</i> one who blows it fulfills his obligation, because the mitzvah is only to listen to the sound,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence, a person who listens to the shofar being blown fulfills his obligation</i> even though the listener does not touch [the shofar]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Based on this statement, the commentaries propose that, according to the Rambam, a person who blows a shofar without putting his lips to it fulfills his obligation. The Ramban (see <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> 1:6) does not accept this view.</i> or lift it up.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Accordingly, after the fact, by hearing such a shofar, one has fulfilled one's obligation, because</i> The laws of theft do not apply to sound alone.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">for sound is not a physical entity that can be possessed. Rabbenu Manoach and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cite other examples from <i>Nedarim</i> 13b-15a, where the Sages differentiate between sound and material entities.<br>The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:1) derives this law as follows:Everyone agrees that a stolen lulav is unacceptable. What is the difference between a shofar and a lulav?<br>Rabbi Yosse responded: \"Concerning a lulav, [Leviticus 23:40] states: 'You shall take for yourself,' implying that only 'your own' is acceptable. In contrast, [Numbers 29:1] states: 'It shall be a day of blowing for you,' implying that regardless [of the nature of the shofar used, the blowing shall be 'for you']\".<br>Rabbi Eliezer explained: \"There, [concerning the lulav,] one must perform the mitzvah with the lulav itself. Here, [concerning the shofar,] one performs the mitzvah with its sound.\"Nevertheless, because a sin is associated with this mitzvah, Ashkenazic custom is that no blessing should be recited before blowing such a shofar (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 586:4).</i><br>Similarly, a shofar from an<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">animal consecrated as an...</i> <i>olah</i> offering should not be sounded,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Once an animal is consecrated as an <i>olah</i> offering, no part of its body may be used any other purpose. Therefore, we should not use such a shofar from such an animal for any purpose whatsoever.<br>This halachah applies before the blood from the sacrifice has been offered on the altar. Afterwards, the skin and horns of the animal become the property of the priests and may be used for mundane purposes (Rashi, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 28a).</i> but<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Hilchot Me'ilah</i> 5:16, the Rambam writes:Concerning the sound, sight, and smell of consecrated objects: We should not derive benefit from them. However, all the implications of the prohibition against using them for mundane purposes do not apply.</i> if one sounds it, he fulfills his obligation, because the laws of<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The prohibitions forbidding use of consecrated articles for mundane purposes...</i> מעילה do not apply with regard to sound alone. If you ask: \"Behold, he has derived benefit from hearing [the shofar's] sound?\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Though the laws of מעילה do not apply to sound, there is still a Rabbinic prohibition against benefiting from the sound of consecrated articles. Therefore, one might think that we would be unable to fulfill the mitzvah with such a shofar (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>). Accordingly, the Rambam explains:</i> - mitzvot were not given for our benefit.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, ibid.) states: \"the mitzvot were not given to the Jewish people for their enjoyment, but rather as a yoke.\"<br>This concept has relevance in the ethical, as well as the halachic sphere. In the tenth chapter of <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i>, the Rambam writes:One who serves [God] out of love occupies himself with the Torah and the mitzvot...for no ulterior motive, not because of fear that evil will occur, nor in order to acquire benefit...<br>The great Sages would command the more understanding and brilliant among their students in private: \"Do not be like servants who serve their master for the sake of receiving a gift. Rather, since he is the Master, it is fitting to serve Him\"; i.e., serve [Him] out of love.The above is not intended to imply that a person should not feel happy and fulfilled in the service of God. Quite the contrary; indeed, the Rambam concludes these halachot (Chapter 8, Halachah 15) with a description of the importance of happiness in the service of God. However, the intent is that the happiness should be a byproduct and not the goal of the service. We should be totally committed to fulfilling God's will, and the expression of that commitment should generate satisfaction and joy.<br><b>Based on this concept -</b> that mitzvot were not given for our benefit;<br><b>a person who vows not to derive benefit from a shofar may use it to blow the teki'ot required to fulfill the mitzvah. -</b> Doing so is not considered a violation of his vow.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 586:5) advises that the person who took the vow should not blow the shofar himself [because many consider that to be a pleasurable experience (<i>Taz</i>)]. Rather, he should hear the <i>teki'ot</i> from a colleague.<br>Also, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid.) notes that if a person specifically states that he vows not to listen to a colleague's <i>teki'ot</i>, he may not hear that person blow the shofar on Rosh HaShanah, because a vow (<i>neder</i>) can also negate a mitzvah. (See <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 3:6-8.)</i><br>Based on this concept, a person who vows not to derive benefit from a shofar may use it to blow the <i>teki'ot</i> required to fulfill the mitzvah.",
            "Regarding a shofar to be used on Rosh HaShanah: It is forbidden to violate the festival laws to obtain it. This applies<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">not only when obtaining the shofar requires the violation of a <i>melachah</i> (forbidden labor) prohibited by the Torah, but</i> even when the forbidden practice is in the category of <i>sh'vut</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 21:1, the Rambam defines <i>sh'vut</i> as a prohibition instituted by the Sages because a particular activity resembles one forbidden as a <i>melachah</i> by Torah law, or because performing it may cause one to perform a <i>melachah</i>.<br>Though these prohibitions are of Rabbinic origin, the Sages reinforced the power of their decrees and equated them with Torah law. Hence, just as one may not violate a <i>melachah</i> forbidden by the Torah to obtain a shofar, so, too, it is forbidden to violate a <i>sh'vut</i> forbidden by Rabbinic law (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). [Nevertheless, note the clarification of this principle in Chapter 2, Halachah 6.]</i><br>How is the above exemplified? If there is a shofar in a treetop or across a river<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">and that is the only shofar available - one may not climb the tree - lest one accidentally cut off a branch (ibid., 6)</i> - and that is the only shofar available - one may not climb the tree or swim across the water to bring it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">lest one prepare a swimming aid (ibid., 23:5). The Mishnah (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 32b) mentions other examples of forbidden activities.</i> Needless to say, we may not cut the shofar [from the animal's head]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his commentary on the mishnah, the Rambam explains that this refers to cutting the horn off with a household knife. Since a craftsman's knife is not being used, cutting the shofar off is not forbidden by Torah law. Nevertheless, the Rambam uses the expression \"needless to say,\" because such an activity bears a closer resemblance to one forbidden by Torah law than those mentioned previously.</i> or perform a forbidden labor<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">cutting off the horn with a craftsman's knife</i> [to prepare a shofar so that we may blow it].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">[to prepare a shofar so that we may blow it].</i><br> [The rationale for the above is:] Blowing the shofar fulfills a positive commandment,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">as stated in Halachah 1.</i> while [the observance of] the festivals fulfills both a positive and a negative commandment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Yom Tov</i> 1:2, the Rambam writes:Whoever rests from a <i>melachah</i> categorized as \"work\" on one of [these days] fulfills a positive commandment, because the Torah describes them as \"days of rest\"... if one performs a <i>melachah</i> that is not intended to prepare food,... one negates the performance of a positive commandment and transgresses a negative commandment, as [Leviticus 23:8] states: \"You shall not perform any servile work.\"</i> The observance of a positive commandment does not negate the observance of both a positive and negative commandment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Though the performance of a positive commandment overrides a negative commandment (<i>Yevamot</i> 3b), that applies only when the negative commandment is not reinforced by a positive commandment, as in the case at hand.</i><br>It is permitted to rinse a shofar with water, wine, or vinegar in order to improve its tone.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is forbidden to prepare a utensil for use on a festival. (See <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Yom Tov</i> 4:8.)

Thus, the difference between the width of a thumb and the other fingers accounts for the \"expansion.\" In modern measure, a handbreadth is considered between 8 (<i>Shiurei Torah</i>) and 9.6 (<i>Chazon Ish</i>) centimeters.</i><br>Should a shofar be cracked lengthwise,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., from its mouth to its end;</i> it is unacceptable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a quote from <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 27b. The Rabbis have noted that, in contrast to a crack along the shofar's width, in this context no minimum figure is mentioned with regard to the portion of the shofar remaining uncracked. Two contrasting interpretations are offered to explain the difference.<br>Some maintain that as long as the entire length (or the majority of the length) of the shofar is not cracked, the shofar is not disqualified. Others maintain that even the slightest crack along the length of the shofar disqualifies it, because the pressure of the blowing will cause the crack to grow until, ultimately, the entire shofar will be cracked (Rabbenu Asher; <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 586:8).<br>Concerning <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>, both the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (586:8) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (586:43) write that when no other shofar is available, one may rely on the first opinion. Nevertheless, even the latter opinion does not disqualify a shofar that is cracked lengthwise if it is tied firmly so that the crack will not expand, or if the shofar is heated and the crack closed. Some opinions also allow such a shofar to be used if the crack is plugged closed with other substances.</i> Should it be cracked along its width<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">with the crack extending along the majority of the shofar's circumference (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> ibid., 9),</i> - if a measure equivalent to the minimum size of a shofar remains,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Most authorities require a handbreadth to remain from the crack to the shofar's mouth (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).

This point is not accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid., 7), which emphasizes that if the hole is not plugged, the shofar is kosher even though its sound has changed. Nevertheless, the Ramah states that if another shofar is available, a shofar with a hole should not be used.</i> with another substance,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., any substance other than a ram's horn;</i> it is unacceptable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">because the sound produced does not come from the shofar alone, but rather from the shofar and the other substance.</i> If it was plugged with its own kind, it is kosher [under the following conditions]:<br>the majority of the shofar remained whole;<br>the plugging of the holes did not alter its sound.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These three conditions are dependent on the Rambam's interpretation of <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 27b. Rabbenu Asher interprets the passage differently. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid.) favors the Rambam's interpretation, but states that under difficult circumstances, when no other shofar is available, one may rely on Rabbenu Asher's interpretation.</i><br>If one [merely] perforated the insides of the horn,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">the bonelike tissue inside the horn</i> [but did not remove them,] it is kosher, because a substance of the same kind is not considered an intervening entity.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The presence of a foreign substance inside the shofar would cause it to be disqualified, as stated in the following halachah. However, since this tissue is considered to be part of the horn itself, the shofar is acceptable.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid., 586:15) quotes this law, but also adds that if one removed this tissue from the horn and then hollowed it out, the tissue would be unacceptable for use as a shofar.</i> Should one stick together fragments of <i>shofarot</i> until one has constructed a shofar, it is unacceptable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tosafot, Rosh Hashanah</i> 27a explains that this construction is not called a shofar.

Whenever a person performs the deed of a mitzvah, he fulfills his obligation, regardless of his intention.<br>On the surface, the Rambam's own decisions regarding this question appear paradoxical. <i>Hilchot Chametz U'matzah</i> 6:3 states:A person who eats matzah without the intention [of fulfilling the mitzvah] - e.g., if gentiles or thieves force him to eat - fulfills his obligation.There, it appears that the Rambam does not require a person to have the intention to fulfill a mitzvah, for in this instance the only reason the person ate the matzah was the coercion of the gentiles.<br>The commentaries attempt to resolve the issue. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that to fulfill his obligation, the person being forced to eat the matzah must know that today is Pesach, that he is obligated to eat matzah, and that it is matzah which he is eating. Rabbenu Nissim, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, and Rabbenu Manoach follow a different line of reasoning. They differentiate between eating matzah and hearing a shofar. In the former case, a person's body benefits from the activity regardless of his intention.

This applies even when the forbidden practice is in the category of <i>sh'vut</i>.The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> offers a number of resolutions to this difficulty. Among them:<br>a) Had the proper attention been paid to the matter before Rosh Hashanah, the <i>sh'vut</i> mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 4 with regard to obtaining the shofar would not exist. In contrast, the <i>sh'vut</i> involved in blowing the shofar cannot be avoided.<br>b) The <i>sh'vut</i> mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 4 must be violated before the mitzvah is performed. Hence, there is no way the prohibition can be relaxed in the mere expectation that a mitzvah will be performed. In contrast, in this instance, the performance of the mitzvah and the <i>sh'vut</i> occur concurrently.<br>However, the order of the halachot here suggests a different explanation. As the Rambam states in the following halachah, certain leniencies are taken regarding the <i>sh'vut</i> of sounding the shofar on Rosh Hashanah (since, as mentioned above, it is forbidden only because it is a \"weekday act\"). In contrast, the activities mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 4 are of a more severe nature, and hence no leniency may be taken in their regard.</i> If so, why is the shofar not sounded?<br>Because of a decree [of the Sages] lest a person take it in his hands and carry it to a colleague so that the latter can blow for him,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam alters the expression used by <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 29b, which states: \"perhaps he will take it to a skilled person so that the latter will teach him.\" Perhaps, the emendation was made because it is more likely that a person would desire that his colleague blow for him than begin to teach him on Rosh Hashanah itself.</i> and [in the process,] carry it four cubits in the public domain or transfer it from one domain to another,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 12:8 equates the two and explains the nature of this <i>melachah</i>.

Note our commentary on Chapter 7, Halachot 13 and 14, which explains the difference between the two festivals.<br>The fact that a Rabbinic decree can cause a mitzvah to be nullified - particularly as significant a mitzvah as the blowing of the shofar - has been the subject of much discussion by the Rabbis. In his commentary on the tractate of <i>Sukkah</i>, Rabbenu Nissim states that this decree was instituted only because in most Jewish communities, the people were not aware of the date the Rabbis had established for Rosh Hashanah. Hence, since the people could not be sure that they were in fact performing a mitzvah, the Rabbinic decree had the power to negate its performance. Even in the places where they were conscious of the proper date, they would not blow the shofar in such a year, so that great divisions in Torah practice would not be created among the Jewish people.<br>In <i>Likkutei Torah</i>, Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi explains the matter from a mystical perspective. He writes that the Sabbath itself generates spiritual influences which resemble those produced by the blowing of the shofar. Thus, there is no necessity to blow the shofar, and the Sages were therefore willing to allow such a decree to negate its observance.</i>",

(See <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 4:1-2.)</i> in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>semichah</i> could be conveyed only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> (ibid.:6).</i> permanently holds sessions,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., if, on Rosh Hashanah, the court held special sessions in a city where it was not normally located, the shofar would not be sounded.

Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai asked the family of Beteira: \"Shall we blow?\"<br>\"Let us consider the matter,\" they replied to him.<br>\"Let us blow, and then consider the matter after having blown,\" he answered them.<br>\"Let us consider the matter,\" they replied again.<br>He told them, \"The sounding of a horn has already been heard in Yavneh. Once a deed has been performed, no further discussion is entertained.\"</i> Furthermore, the shofar is sounded on the Sabbath only in a court that has sanctified the new moon.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Originally, the months were sanctified by the courts after hearing the testimony of witnesses who saw the new moon. (See <i>Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh</i>, Chapters 1 and 2.)</i> However, the shofar will not be sounded in other courts, even though their judges have received <i>semichah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's statements represent a middle road in a difference of opinion between the Rabbinical giants upon whom our understanding of the Talmud is based. Rashi (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 29a) states that the shofar was sounded on the Sabbath only in the presence of the Supreme Sanhedrin. Thus, this law applied only in Yavneh and in the few other cities where the Sanhedrin subsequently held its session.<br>Rav Yitzchak Alfasi (the Rif) quotes this law in his <i>Halachot</i> even though he quotes only those laws which are applicable in his age. From this it appears that he maintains that the shofar may be sounded in the presence of any court of stature on the Sabbath, even if its judges do not possess <i>semichah</i>. Indeed, the Ramban and Rabbenu Nissim write that Rav Yitzchak Alfasi would have the shofar sounded in his own court when Rosh Hashanah fell on the Sabbath. Similarly, the text <i>Haezer</i> records that the author saw a Sage from Damascus who stated that he saw the shofar blown on Rosh Hashanah which fell on a Sabbath.<br>(The Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, ibid., does not mention the need for the judges to possess <i>semichah</i>. Thus, it is possible that he also originally subscribed to this view.)<br>In the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Rambam's position lies in between these views. On one hand, unlike Rav Yitzchak Alfasi, he requires that the judges possess <i>semichah</i> and be of sufficient stature to have sanctified the new moon (thus, excluding any contemporary courts). Nevertheless, unlike Rashi, he allows the shofar to be sounded in the presence of any court that has those qualifications, and not the Supreme Sanhedrin alone.</i> Also, the shofar is sounded only in the presence of a high court.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our translation of בית דין גדול is based on the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, who explains that in this context the term refers to an established court of judges with <i>semichah</i>, and not the Supreme Sanhedrin, as is sometimes the case. Indeed, authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> from Yemen omit the word גדול from the above expression.</i><br>It may be sounded during the entire time they are in session.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">but only while they are in session. If they have risen, the shofar can no longer be sounded. However...</i> Even after they<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">the judges</i> have begun preparing to rise<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">as long as they have not risen - the shofar may be sounded before them - Though the Sages (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 30a) raised a question on this matter and left it unanswered, the Rambam allows the shofar to be sounded under such circumstances. Since the question concerns a Rabbinic decree, the more lenient approach is taken (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i> - as long as they have not risen - the shofar may be sounded before them. However, outside the court, the shofar may not be sounded.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this aspect, there was a difference between the sounding of the shofar on the Sabbath between Jerusalem and Yavneh. In Jerusalem, the influence of the Temple and the court was felt so strongly that even outside the presence of the court, the shofar could be sounded. In contrast, in Yavneh and other cities where courts were located, the shofar was sounded only in the presence of a court (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, ibid.).</i><br>Why is the shofar allowed to be sounded in the court? Because the court is scrupulous [in the observance of the mitzvot] and, in its presence, those who blow the shofar will not carry the shofar in the public domain, for the court will warn the people and inform them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>S'dei Chemed</i> derives a general principle from this law. <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 21:27 states that all Sabbath and festival prohibitions that were categorized as <i>sh'vut</i> were suspended in the Temple, because the priests were scrupulous in their observance of the mitzvot and there was no danger that any infringement of Torah law would occur. Similarly, the above text continues, all decrees of this nature may be suspended in the presence of a high court, because the court will ensure that the Torah's laws will be kept.<br>This logic runs contrary to a statement of Rabbenu Nissim, who writes that although Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai instituted the blowing of the shofar on the Sabbath in the presence of a court, he was not that lenient regarding the taking of the lulav and etrog. Thus, we see that the leniency mentioned here applies to the shofar alone and not to other cases.</i>",
            "In the present age, when we celebrate Rosh Hashanah in the exile for two days,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a slight imprecision with the Rambam's statements. Rosh Hashanah was celebrated for two days throughout almost the totality of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> even while the Temple was standing. It was impossible to notify the people in most of the land (for the messengers were not allowed to travel more than two thousand cubits beyond Jerusalem) whether or not the court had substantiated the testimony of the witnesses on the day when Rosh Hashanah was expected to fall. (See <i>Beitzah</i> 4b-5a; <i>Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh</i> 5:7-8.)</i> the shofar is sounded on the second day just as it is sounded on the first.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to the actual sounding of the shofar.

Thus, the Rambam could be referring to such a court.<br>b) In <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 4:11, the Rambam discusses the possibility of the renewal of the practice of <i>semichah</i>.

Since the shofar was sounded each year, surely the tradition could have been maintained. Hence, he explains that all the different manners of sounding the shofar were acceptable and that Rabbi Abahu's contribution was the establishment of a uniform custom that included all the different practices common among the Jewish people.

Hence, according to the Rambam, the length of the <i>teki'ot</i> are dependent on the length of the <i>teru'ot</i>.<br>Rabbenu Nissim objects to the Rambam's interpretation, explaining that the word והעברת, the verb mentioned in the commandment to blow the shofar, implies a long blast, and hence the measure mentioned by the Rambam would not be appropriate.<br>Similarly, the Ra'avad does not accept the Rambam's interpretation, and explains that the Mishnah establishes an independent measure for the length of a <i>teki'ah</i> - three <i>teru'ot</i> - with each <i>teru'ah</i> being equal to three short sobs.

Furthermore, the <i>Tosefta</i> 2:12 states specifically that one does fulfill one's obligation in this manner.<br><i>Tosafot</i> disagrees with Rashi, mentioning the second reason stated by Rabbenu Manoach. It appears that the Rambam goes further and discounts Rashi's opinion entirely. According to <i>Tosafot</i>, the listener will have heard at least the first <i>teki'ah</i>, while the Rambam explicitly states \"he has not fulfilled his obligation for a single blast.\" (See <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>.)<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 588:3 quotes the Rambam's decision as halachah. The Ramah quotes the law from <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 27a, allowing a person to fulfill his obligation even though he heard two people blowing the shofar at the same time, provided he heard the blasts in the proper order.</i> [If he heard] a <i>teki'ah</i> from one, a <i>teru'ah</i> from another, and another <i>teki'ah</i> from a third, in sequence, he has fulfilled his obligation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The fact that different people sounded the shofar does not prevent the fulfillment of the mitzvah.</i><br>The above applies even if one heard [the shofar blasts] with interruptions, even if [the blowing was extended] over the entire day.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a certain redundancy with this statement, because the same principle was mentioned in the previous halachah. Nonetheless, the Rambam included it to emphasize that the passage of time is not considered an interruption even when the shofar is being blown by different people (Rabbenu Manoach).</i> A person does not fulfill his obligation until he hears all nine shofar blasts, for they are all [only] one mitzvah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">as explained in Halachah 1.</i> Thus, they are dependent one on the other.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Based on this principle, a person who does not know how to blow either the <i>shevarim</i> or the <i>teru'ot</i> should not sound the <i>teki'ot</i>, for he will accomplish nothing by doing so (<i>Tosafot, Rosh Hashanah</i> 33b). Nevertheless, if a person knows how to sound both <i>teki'ot</i> and <i>shevarim</i>, he should sound three series of such blasts even if he does not know how to sound a <i>teru'ah</i>. Since it is possible that the mitzvah may be fulfilled by these series (as explained in Halachot 2 and 3), at the very least they should be sounded (Rabbenu Nissim, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 593:2).</i>",

The Sages explain (ibid., 32b) that it would have been appropriate to institute the shofar blowing in the morning service. However, the Romans desired to stamp out the performance of the mitzvot and sent guards to make sure that the mitzvah was not fulfilled. After midday, the guards left, and then, in the musaf service, the shofar would be sounded.<br>Originally, the Sages' decree involved determining the place of the service when the mitzvah required by the Torah would be fulfilled and this halachah must be interpreted in that context. However, as explained in Halachot 11 and 12, it became universally accepted Jewish custom to blow the shofar before the musaf prayers to fulfill the Torah's commandment, and thus \"confuse the Satan\" even before the beginning of our prayers, and then to sound the shofar again in the midst of those prayers to fulfill the Rabbinic decree.

Generally, a person who does not know all the blessings of the <i>Amidah</i> should recite those that he knows.

Among the resolutions offered to this difficulty is that chronologically, the Psalms were written before the prophecies quoted (<i>Tosafot, Rosh Hashanah</i> 32a).<br>Examples of the verses recited are mentioned in the following halachah and commentary.</i> One concludes with a verse from the Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">because of the dearness of the Torah. <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 32b explains that this was the custom of the experienced Sages of Jerusalem.</i> Should a person conclude with a verse from the prophets, he fulfills his obligation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">However, one should preferably conclude with a verse from the Torah. This is our present practice.<br>From the statements of the Rambam and the relevant passages from the Mishnah and Talmud, it would appear that originally there was no standard text containing universally accepted verses for these blessings. Rather, certain verses were commonly accepted and would be recited by almost all those who prayed. Others were left to the preference of each individual.<br>(One must remember that machzorim were uncommon in this period, and most of the prayers were recited by heart. Thus, the verses chosen by an individual might often have been those which he had been able to commit to memory.)</i><br>Should a person recite only one verse from the Torah, one from the sacred writings, and one from the prophets,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus mentioning three verses in each blessing, one from each division of the <i>T'nach</i></i> he fulfills his obligation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">after the fact.

In the previous clause, he stated that one must recite three verses - one from the Torah, one from the prophets, and one from the writings - to fulfill one's obligation, while this clause implies that the recitation of one is sufficient.<br>The source for the difficulty is the following quotes: The Mishnah, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 32a, states:One should not recite fewer than ten verses for <i>Malchuyot</i>, ten for <i>Zichronot</i>, and ten for <i>Shofarot</i>. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri says: \"If one recites three - three of each - one fulfills his obligation.\"<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 35a quotes Rav Chanan'el as saying in the name of Rav:Even if he states: \"In Your Torah, it is written...\" [and recites one verse], nothing further is necessary.From the Talmud, it appears that both these statements are accepted as halachah. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam interprets Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri's requirement of three verses as the total for all three blessings. Thus, for each blessing, one must state \"In Your Torah, it is written...\" and recite a single appropriate verse. [This surely differs from the Rambam's statements in his commentary on the Mishnah.]<br>The Ramban, Rabbenu Nissim, and others explain that Rav Chanan'el agrees with Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri and thus, in addition to \"In Your Torah, it is written...,\" he also requires one to say: \"In Your holy writings, it is recorded...,\" and: \"by your prophets, it was proclaimed...,\" mentioning an appropriate verse in each instance. (This opinion is quoted by <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 586:8 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 591:11.)<br>Alternatively, one may explain the Rambam's position as follows: Ideally, one should recite ten verses for each blessing; after the fact, three are sufficient, as stated by Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri. When does this apply? Once one has recited at least one verse from the Torah. However, if one has not recited any verses, it is sufficient to say \"In Your Torah, it is written...\" and recite a single verse from the Torah, as Rav Chanan'el said in the name of Rav.<br>The flexibility regarding the number of quotes in each blessing was only granted in the previous generations. Since at present we have adopted a standard set of blessings, a person should not delete verses at will (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 591:6; <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 591:8).</i>",

Nevertheless, since there are many verses that use the verb זכר, there is no difficulty in establishing a practice that will be accepted by all opinions (<i>Beit Yosef</i> 591).</i> One may mention verses that refer to retribution to be visited upon the gentile nations - for example, [Psalms 99:1]: \"God is King, the nations will tremble...\"; [Psalms 137:7]: \"Remember, O God, against the Edomites, the day of Jerusalem\"; or [Zechariah 9:14]: \"God, the Lord, will sound the shofar and proceed in a southerly storm-wind.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Despite this decision, only the latter verse is included in the text of the blessings we recite on Rosh Hashanah.</i><br>All the following verses: [Deuteronomy 6:4]: \"Hear Israel, God is our Lord, God is one\"; [Deuteronomy 4:35]: \"To you, it has been revealed that you may know...\"; and [Deuteronomy 4:39]: \"And you shall know today and draw it close to your heart...\" express the concept of God's sovereignty.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These verses all express the oneness of God and creation; thus they emphasize how \"He is unique and one, with none that compare to Him.

The vegetables are not considered to be non-kosher <i>s'chach</i>, which would invalidate the sukkah if they take up four handbreadths, as explained in Halachah 14.

In this halachah, the Rambam describes the rulings which govern the situation when an effort has been made to rectify the situation by detaching the branches from their source of nurture.

Though he is obligated to pay the owner for his wood, that obligation does not prevent the sukkah from being considered as his.<br><i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i> 1:5 explains this principle by stating:Anyone who steals is obligated to return the stolen property itself... If it was lost or changed, he is obligated to return its monetary value...<br>Even if one steals a beam and builds a mansion [using it], since [the beam] has not been changed, the Torah law would require him to destroy the entire building and return the beam to its owner.<br>Nevertheless, the Sages instituted a decree [to encourage] those who repent; they ordained that all that is necessary is for him to return [the beam's] monetary value, and thus he will not forfeit his building.Rabbenu Manoach asks: Since the mitzvah of sukkah is commanded by the Torah, and Torah law regards these boards as stolen, how can the Sages' decree change their status in this context?<br>He explains that, as implied by the principle הפקר הפקר בית דין, the Torah has granted the Sages the right to determine the status of property. Their decree can alter entirely a person's rights to its title. Thus, in the present case, since Rabbinic law entitles the thief to use of the boards, he is permitted, according to Torah law, to use them as a Sukkah.<br>The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (637:5) writes that if the thief refuses to pay for the wood, it is considered to be the property of its original owner, and the thief does not fulfill his obligation.</i> Even if one stole boards and merely put them in place without attaching them or changing anything about them, he has fulfilled his obligation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a special leniency granted out of respect for the mitzvah of sukkah (<i>Sukkah</i>, ibid.). Since the thief has not made any changes in the wood itself or built a permanent structure from it, the Rabbinic decree mentioned above would not apply. Thus, during the rest of the year (and even in this case, after the Sukkot festival), the wood would have to be returned.

They explained: \"We are emissaries involved in a mitzvah\" (<i>Sukkah</i> 26a).<br>Though these Sages were visiting a city which served as a center of Jewish life and surely could have found a sukkah to lodge in, they did not see the necessity for doing so. (See also <i>Sukkah</i> 10b.)<br>Nevertheless, <i>Tosafot, Sukkah</i> 10b, interprets the passage differently and explains that leniency is granted these emissaries only when dwelling in the sukkah would in some way prevent them from carrying out the mitzvah which they set out to perform. If it is possible to do both - perform the mitzvah they set out to do and fulfill the mitzvah of sukkah - one must endeavor to do so.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam shares Rashi's view. However, the final halachic position followed by most Ashkenazic authorities is closer to <i>Tosafot</i>'s position: i.e., these emissaries are not obligated to trouble themselves to find a sukkah. However, if there is a sukkah available, they should make use of it. Nevertheless, if sleeping in the sukkah would prevent them from getting proper rest, and thus hold them back from fulfilling their mitzvah in a proper manner, they are not required to sleep in a sukkah (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 640:18; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 640:38).<br>(Abstractly, it is possible to differentiate between the two positions as follows. According to Rashi, there is no obligation of sukkah incumbent on this person whatsoever. In contrast, <i>Tosafot</i> would maintain that the person is obligated to perform the mitzvah. However, at all times he is bound by another commitment which takes precedence.)</i> People who journey during the day are freed from [fulfilling the mitzvah] of sukkah during the day<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., while they are traveling. <i>Tosafot, Sukkah</i> 26a explains that this concept is derived from the principle: תשבו כעין תדורו - i.e., dwelling in the sukkah is comparable to living in one's own home.

However, if a watchman is charged with guarding produce which is collected in one place, he is capable of fulfilling the mitzvah and discharging his duty. Hence, he is obligated to construct a sukkah there.</i>",

In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam defines קבע as \"of primary importance and a constant practice.\"</i> as [Leviticus 23:42] states: \"You shall dwell in sukkot for seven days.\"<br>What does this imply?

The Rambam's intent is that after the meal there is no necessity to keep one's plates in the sukkah, because they are not attractive and are generally stored in pantries outside the home. In contrast, it is customary in many communities not to bring pots into the sukkah, even while eating (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 639:5). [Needless to say, plates that must be washed must be removed from the sukkah.]<br>The printed (as opposed to certain manuscripts) text of Rashi (<i>Sukkah</i> 29a) also shares the Rambam's interpretation. <i>Tosafot</i> explains the passage slightly differently, rendering \"utensils used for food\" as \"utensils used in the preparation of food\" - i.e., pots and pans.</i> A candelabra<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., the source of light</i> [should be brought] to the sukkah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">even when it is not burning, since it is attractive.</i> However, if the sukkah is small, it should be left outside the sukkah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">lest it cause a fire (<i>Tosafot, Sukkah</i>, ibid.). This differs from Rashi's interpretation of <i>Sukkah</i>, ibid., which explains that the Talmud is referring to an earthenware lamp. Thus, we may assume that it should not be brought into the sukkah because it is unattractive. This, appears to justify the statements of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, who writes that the lamp should not be brought into the sukkah when it is not burning. Both opinions are quoted by the later halachic authorities (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 639:3; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 639:7-8).</i>",
            "We should eat, drink, and sleep in the sukkah through the entire seven days [of the festival], both during the day and at night.

The same principles are also applied to cooked foods made from the five species of grain.</i><br>One may not sleep outside the sukkah at all, even a brief nap.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In contrast to eating, where there is a difference between a fixed meal and a snack, no such difference exists regarding sleep. At times, even a rest of a few moments can have a major effect on a person. (See <i>Sukkah</i> 26a; Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Sukkah</i> 2:5.)<br>At present, there are many communities where leniency is taken in this regard. In some climates, the cold will cause everyone to consider sleeping in the sukkah as uncomfortable and, hence, they are freed of that obligation. Furthermore, in many communities, there is also a danger involved. In addition, if a husband would sleep in a sukkah, he would deprive his wife of some of the happiness and satisfaction that should accompany a festival. (See Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 639:2.)<br>Nevertheless, many authorities explain that these leniencies apply only at night, but during the day one is obligated to sleep in the sukkah.</i> It is permissible to drink water<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">or any other beverage, including wine (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 639:2), outside the sukkah. There is a difference of opinion among the later halachic authorities if this decision also applies when one sits down to a party centering on drinking wine (קובע עצמו לשתות). Some (the <i>Bach</i> and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 639:12) require that such drinking be carried out in a sukkah. However, others (the Vilna Gaon and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 639:13) are more lenient.</i> and eat fruit outside the sukkah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">for these do not constitute a significant meal.<br><i>Sukkah</i> 27a relates that Rabbi Elazar ben Shamu'a ate dates and grapes outside the sukkah, because \"fruit does not require a sukkah.\"<br>Rabbenu Manoach and some other commentaries maintain that this leniency applies only to fruit. In contrast, meat, fish, cheese, and other substantial foods which form the basis of a meal must be eaten in a sukkah. While many later halachic authorities do not accept this view, some maintain that one should not sit down with company to a meal of such foods outside a sukkah. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 639:11; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 639:15.)</i> However, a person who follows the stringency of not drinking even water outside the sukkah is worthy of praise.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To exemplify this principle, the Mishnah (ibid.) quotes the following:Once they brought a cooked dish for Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai to taste, and two dates and a pitcher of water for Rabban Gamliel. They said: \"Take them up to the sukkah.\"<i>Sukkah</i> 26b explains that often our Sages counselled against accepting extra stringencies upon oneself, lest one take pride in one's piety. However, in this instance they make no such reservations.</i>",
            "Eating in the sukkah on the first night of the festival is an obligation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sukkah</i> 27a draws an analogy between the first night of Sukkot and the first night of Pesach. Just as eating a <i>k'zayit</i> of matzah on the fifteenth of Nisan is a mitzvah, so too, each Jewish male is required to eat in the sukkah on the fifteenth of Tishre.</i> If a person eats merely a <i>k'zayit</i> of bread,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the minimum amount required by the Torah in all mitzvot that involve eating.

Afterwards, [the matter is left to one's] volition.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The difference in the requirement between the first night and the remaining days has other ramifications. As mentioned in Halachah 2, a person who is uncomfortable in the sukkah is freed from his obligation. However, this leniency applies only on the first night after the mitzvah of eating a <i>k'zayit</i> has been fulfilled (<i>Maggid Mishneh; Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 639:3).</i> If one desires to eat a meal,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">including bread, or according to some authorities, other hearty foods, as mentioned above</i> one must eat it in the sukkah.

However, one is obligated to eat three meals on the Sabbath as an expression of the mitzvah of honoring the Sabbath and taking pleasure in its celebration. (See <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 30:9.) Similarly, one is required to eat festive meals on the first day of Sukkot in honor of the holiday. These meals must be eaten in the sukkah.</i> The same laws apply as those regarding the eating of matzah on Pesach.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's intent is that, as explained in <i>Hilchot Chametz U'matzah</i> 6:1, after the first night of the festival a person is not obligated to eat matzah and may subsist on other foods. Similarly, on Sukkot one may eat foods that do not require consumption within a sukkah.<br>However, according to most authorities, his choice of words is not exact. The mitzvah of sukkah differs from that of matzah. In the latter instance, there is no mitzvah involved in eating matzah after the first night of the holiday. In contrast, every activity performed in the sukkah constitutes a further fulfillment of the mitzvah.<br>Accordingly, after the first night of the festival no special blessing is recited before partaking of matzah. In contrast, as stated in Halachah 12, a blessing is recited every time we make use of the sukkah. See also the Moznaim publication of <i>Hilchot Chametz U'Matzah</i> 6:1.</i>",

The Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 2:8) compares the matter to a servant who came to serve his master drink and the latter poured the pitcher in his face.<br><i>Tzafenat Paneach</i> explains that there is a fundamental difference between this law and the case of a person who is uncomfortable while in the sukkah. In the latter instance, in essence, the person is obligated to fulfill the mitzvah. However, because of his discomfort, his obligation is temporarily waived. In contrast, when rain descends it is impossible to fulfill the mitzvah at all, because the sukkah is not fit to dwell in. Hence, there is no obligation whatsoever.<br>There is a practical difference between these two abstract positions regarding the question whether a person is obligated to eat in the sukkah on the first night of the holiday even when it rains. (See the commentary on Halachah 7.) According to the <i>Tzafenat Paneach</i>, under these circumstances there is no mitzvah which one is required to fulfill. Thus, one may eat at home. In contrast, most authorities do not differentiate between rain and other uncomfortable situations. Thus, since eating in the sukkah on that night is a binding obligation, they require a person to fulfill the mitzvah.<br>There is a further aspect to this concept. The Maharil explains that a person who eats in a sukkah when he is not obligated to do so is a simple person and receives no reward for his \"piety.\" On this basis, in many communities, people make no effort to stay in the sukkah when it rains. In contrast, there are some communities where people will continue to eat in the sukkah despite pouring rain.<br>What is the difference between these two approaches? The first approach follows the perspective that, during the rain, there is no mitzvah to dwell in the sukkah whatsoever. Hence, there is no need to strain oneself to remain there. In contrast, the second perspective does not differentiate between rain and any other uncomfortable circumstances, but maintains that, in essence, dwelling in the sukkah is a mitzvah even under such circumstances. Accordingly, they remain in the sukkah, because while they are involved in fulfilling God's will they do not feel even the slightest trace of discomfort.</i> When is one permitted to leave [the sukkah]?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Maharil writes that when a person is forced to leave the sukkah because of rain, he should depart with humility rather than with anger.</i> When enough raindrops descend into the sukkah so that they would spoil a cooked dish<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We need not wait until the food actually spoils.

Rather, one must perform an activity that reflects \"dwelling.\" Hence, the blessing is not recited until one sits down, because previously it is not obvious that one wants to perform a significant activity in the sukkah.<br>The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's decision, maintaining that one should recite the blessing only before partaking of a meal in the sukkah. This reflects the decision of the Ashkenazic authorities, who maintain that though the performance of all one's activities in the sukkah is a mitzvah, it is not customary to recite the blessing except when eating.

Nevertheless, dwelling in the sukkah on the eighth day does not constitute a violation of this commandment, because the time when the mitzvah is to be performed has already passed. Placing a fifth passage in one's tefillin during the day violates this commandment, because we are obligated to perform the mitzvah at this time. However, once the seven days of Sukkot pass, there is no mitzvah associated with the sukkah whatsoever (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 28b).<br>Nevertheless, many Ashkenazic authorities would carry out additional safeguards regarding this matter. For example, the <i>Tur</i> relates (though he opposes this practice himself) that some follow the custom of eating in the Sukkah only on the day of Shemini Atzeret, but not the night. Many of the Rabbis who would sleep in the Sukkah throughout the festival refrain from doing so on Shemini Atzeret.

However, regarding obligations of a Rabbinic nature, one may opt towards leniency. Since the mitzvah is required by the Torah, even a person in doubt must perform it. However, the blessing is a Rabbinic requirement; hence, there is no necessity in reciting it. Furthermore, by reciting the blessing when one is not required, one uses God's name in vain.<br>This perspective is not accepted by all authorities. As explained in the commentary on Chapter 2, Halachah 1, the Ashkenazic practice is to allow women and others who are not obligated in the performance of a mitzvah to recite a blessing when fulfilling it.<br>The above applies only regarding the doubts concerning the obligations of a <i>tumtum</i> and an <i>androgynous</i>.

However, since all three handbreadths of the lulav must be shaken (see the following two halachot) an additional handbreadth was required for the person to hold the lulav in his hand (Rambam, Commentary on the Mishnah).<br>[Rashi and most other commentaries based on <i>Sukkah</i> 32b consider the handbreadth of the lulav that extends beyond the myrtle and the willow as the addition included \"so that it can be shaken.\" From the latter clauses of this halachah, it appears that the Rambam may have also adopted this interpretation.]<br>A handbreadth is 8 centimeters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 9.6 centimeters according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>. In his commentary on the above Mishnah, the Rambam emphasizes that the measure refers to three full handbreadths, each four fingerbreadths in length. This is necessary to negate the opinion of certain authorities (see the Ra'avad), who state that here the intent is three \"small\" handbreadths, so that the total length is only 10 fingerbreadths.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 650:1) accepts the Ra'avad's opinion.

Indeed, in general, this clause appears to be more closely related to the principles mentioned in the following chapter, where the Rambam mentions the characteristics that disqualify the various species, rather than in this chapter, where he relates the fundamental requirements of each one. Based on <i>Sukkah</i> 34a, which relates that myrtles which are not dry (a factor still common in many Diaspora communities today) are very difficult to find, we can interpret this as an almost parenthetical expression teaching that freshness is not among the fundamental requirements for a myrtle.]</i><br>If one has bound [the other species together with] the lulav, the <i>shidrah</i> of the lulav must extend beyond the myrtle and the willow a handbreadth or more.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam maintains that regardless of the length of the myrtles and the willows, the <i>shidrah</i> of the lulav must extend beyond them an additional handbreadth, so that it can be shaken.

In contrast, in other contexts, since we follow a fixed calendar and know that the holidays fall on their appropriate dates, the restrictions applying to the first day do not apply on the subsequent days (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).<br>Rabbenu Asher differs and maintains that all the restrictions that apply to the lulav on the first day must also be observed on the second day as well.

Though Deuteronomy 16:13 states \"Celebrate the Sukkot holiday for yourself for seven days.\" In this context, only a stolen sukkah is disqualified and a borrowed sukkah is permitted (<i>Sukkah</i> 27b).<br>Since in both cases, the source for the exclusion is the same phrase, one might ask why the laws pertaining to each are different. Many explain that since, as explained in the commentary to that halachah, the Torah includes a special verse to teach us that a borrowed sukkah is permitted, the scope of the exclusion implied by \"for yourself\" is limited.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 637:3 explains that since the person owning the sukkah grants his colleague the use of it, the borrowed sukkah can be considered \"as his own.\" Since a person has to treat a sukkah as his permanent dwelling for the seven days of the holiday, it follows that the sukkah was lent for that purpose. Thus, while a person is using it, he may consider it \"as his own,\" i.e., just like his own dwelling.

From the Rambam's phraseology, it appears that he includes all minors in this category. However, Rabbenu Nissim writes that a child of six or seven can transfer property and, hence, his return of the lulav is valid.<br>Support for Rabbenu Nissim's position is brought from the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:10), which relates that Rav Nachman bar Ya'akov gave his etrog as a present to his son and told him: \"When you take possession of it and fulfill the mitzvah, return it to me.\" Nevertheless, the passage does not serve as conclusive proof, because the possibility exists that his son had already reached majority. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid. 6) follows the Rambam's view.</i> since, according to Torah law, a minor can acquire articles<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">which are given to him by others who consciously desire that the minor acquire the property, in contrast to ownerless articles, which he cannot acquire according to Torah law (<i>Maggid Mishneh, Hilchot Zechiyah Umatanah</i> 4:7).</i> but cannot transfer them to others.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The transfer of the ownership of an article requires a conscious decision.

Thus, the Rambam's statements seem to imply that any of the four species that are acquired only according to Rabbinic law may not be used for this mitzvah.<br>A very practical point can be derived from this concept. According to Torah law, property that is purchased changes ownership only after it has been paid for. The completion of a transaction when the property are taken by the purchaser (<i>meshichah</i>) is a Rabbinic institution. Accordingly, if a person purchased a lulav and etrog on the condition that he pay for it after the holiday - even though the seller willingly consented - the purchaser has only acquired the lulav and etrog according to Rabbinic law. Thus, based on this halachah, he would not be able to use it for the mitzvah.</i><br>The above applies to the lulav and to each of the other species of the four taken with it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse quoted above includes all the four species, and not only the lulav.

            "When partners purchase a lulav or etrog together, neither is<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">considered to be the owner of the species in its entirety. Therefore, neither is...</i> able to fulfill his obligation with it on the first [day of the festival]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bava Batra</i> 137b relates that the requirement of owning a lulav includes not only having a share in it, but rather owning it entirely.</i> unless his colleague gives him his portion as a present.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The principles mentioned in the previous halachah regarding giving a lulav as a present also apply to giving a share of it as a present.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> mentions a very frequent application of this concept: a lulav and etrog purchased by a synagogue for the use of all of its members. He quotes the Rashba, who explains that since the etrog was purchased with the intent that it be used by each member of that community, implicit in their agreement is that, on the first day, it will belong to each individual entirely at the time he uses it to fulfill the mitzvah.<br>The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 648:7) quotes this statement as halachah. However, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 648:10 raises questions concerning it and suggests that each member of the community should grant his colleague his share as a present.</i><br>Should brothers purchase etrogim from the funds [of their father's] estate, which they have not divided yet:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the case mentioned in <i>Bava Batra</i> (ibid.), from which the above principle is derived. In such an instance, the estate is considered to be the mutual property of all the brothers concerned.</i> If one of them takes an etrog with the intent of fulfilling his obligation, [the following rules apply:] If he could eat it without the other brothers objecting,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">it is considered to be his own. Hence,...</i> he has fulfilled his obligation. If they would object,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">and require that an equal division of the property be made before it was used, he cannot be considered to be the full owner of the etrog. Hence,...</i> he does not fulfill his obligation until they give him their share [in the etrog] as a present.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The above principles apply only when the funds of the estate were used to purchase a number of etrogim. Since many fruits of the same species were purchased with the money from the estate, it is possible that the other brothers will not object to one brother's taking an etrog for his own use. However, if the money of the estate was used to buy a number of different species of fruit - e.g. ….</i><br>If one brother bought an etrog and another a quince, or together they bought an etrog, a pomegranate, and a quince from the funds [of their father's] estate, which they have not divided yet,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">we assume that the brothers would desire to have the property formally divided before using it. Hence, they are all considered to be mutual owners of the fruit. Thus,...</i> one cannot fulfill one's obligation with the etrog until the others give him their share [in it] as a present, even though they would not object to his [use of it].",
            "Even though it is a mitzvah to rejoice on all the festivals,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">as Deuteronomy 16:14 teaches: \"And you shall rejoice on your festivals.\" Though that verse is mentioned with regard to Sukkot, Deuteronomy 16:11 states with regard to Shavuot: \"and you shall rejoice before God,\" and <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 4b explains that an analogy is established to include Pesach as well.</i> there was an additional celebration in the Temple on the festival of Sukkot,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's words present a question: The Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 5:1) refers to this celebration as <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i>, connecting it with the drawing of water for the water libation. (See <i>Hilchot T'midim Umusafim</i> 10:6-10.) Indeed, the Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 50b; see also the Rambam's commentary on the above-mentioned Mishnah) emphasizes that connection, quoting Isaiah 12:3: \"And you shall draw water with happiness.\" However, here, the Rambam makes no mention of that water at all!<br>We are forced to say that the Rambam views the verse from Isaiah as a mere <i>asmachtah</i> (an allusion from the Bible with which our Sages connected a verse to an independent concept) and that the celebration came about because of the unique nature of the Sukkot festival. Though this celebration was associated with the water libation, the latter is not the source for the practice. Indeed, the choice of the name <i>Simchat Beit HaSho'evah</i> (the celebration of the house of drawing the water), and not <i>Simchat Hasho'evah</i> (the celebration of the drawing of the water) allows for such an interpretation. (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XVII).</i> as [Leviticus 23:40] commands: \"And you shall rejoice before God, your Lord,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., in the Temple</i> for seven days.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although this verse is used to derive the requirement of taking the lulav in Jerusalem for each of the seven days of the festival (Chapter 7, Halachah 13), its simple meaning remains.<br>Nevertheless, this charge is not considered to be an independent commandment, but rather an extension (and an intensification) of the mitzvah of celebrating on the festivals. Thus, in <i>Sefer Hamitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 54), the Rambam describes that mitzvah and explains that it includes \"to celebrate with musical instruments and to dance in the Temple....This is <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i>.\"<br>This explanation resolves another question: <i>Mo'ed Kattan</i> 8b teaches that one celebration should not be interposed upon another. For this reason, weddings are not held during the festivals so that the wedding celebrations should not clash with those of the festival.<br>Thus, were one to consider the celebration of <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i> as associated with the water offering, one might ask why the Sages instituted such a celebration which might appear to overshadow the celebration of the festival itself. However, the above explanation resolves this difficulty as well, for as stated above, the <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i> celebration is an extension of the festival celebrations and not an independent matter. (See <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, ibid.)</i><br>What was done? On the eve of the first day of the festival,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Two reasons are given why the courtyard was not set up during the festival itself:<br>a) It involved construction, which is forbidden on Chol Hamo'ed (<i>Knesset Hagedolah</i>)<br>b) Preparing the courtyard before the festival would allow the celebrations to begin immediately after the departure of the festival (<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>).</i> they would set up a place in the Temple<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">in the open courtyard before the entrance to the Temple courtyard proper. This was called <i>Ezrat Nashim</i> - the women's courtyard - because in contrast to the Temple courtyard, women were allowed to enter the <i>Ezrat Nashim</i> even when they were not offering sacrifices. The Rambam describes the <i>Ezrat Nashim</i> in <i>Hilchot Beit Habechirah</i> 5:7.</i> where women [could watch] from above, and men from below, so they would not intermingle with each other.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Originally, the men and the women would stand in separate sections on the same level. However, the Sages feared that, particularly during a time of celebration, such closeness might lead to frivolous interaction between the sexes, and decided to have a balcony constructed for the women (<i>Sukkah</i> 51b).</i><br>The celebration would begin on the night after the first day of the festival.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since, as explained in the following halachah, the celebration was not held on the first night of the festival.</i> Similarly, on each day of Chol Hamo'ed, after offering the daily afternoon sacrifice, they would begin to celebrate for the rest of the day and throughout the night.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sukkah</i> 53a quotes Rabbi Yehoshua ben Chananyah as saying: \"While we were celebrating at <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i>, our eyes saw no sleep.\"</i>",
            "What was the nature of this celebration?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 5:1-2) states:Whoever has not seen <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i> has never seen rejoicing in his life!...<br>There were golden candelabras....There was not a courtyard in Jerusalem that was not illuminated with the light of <i>Beit Hasho'evah</i>.<br>The pious and men of stature would dance before them with torches of fire in their hands and recite songs of praise. The Levites would play the harps, lutes, cymbals, and all other types of instruments on the steps...leading down from the Israelites' courtyard.</i> The flute would be sounded<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Indeed, from the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 5:1), which states: \"The flute, for five or six days; this was the flute of <i>Beit Hasho'evah</i>,\" it appears that this was the major element of the celebration.</i> and songs played on the harp, lute, and cymbals. [In addition,] each person would play on the instrument which he knew. Those who could sing, would sing.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the quote from the Mishnah above.</i> They would dance and clap their hands, letting loose and whistling, each individual in the manner which he knew. Words of song and praise were recited.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note the following halachah and commentary.</i><br>This celebration does not supersede either the Sabbath or the festival [prohibitions].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since, as explained above, the celebration involved musical instruments, it would not be held on the first night of the festival (or on the Sabbath), when playing such instruments is forbidden (<i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 23:4).<br>The celebration is an extension of a Torah commandment, while the above prohibition is only Rabbinic in nature. Furthermore, it was held in the Temple, where Rabbinic prohibitions of this nature were usually suspended (אין שבות במקדש, <i>Pesachim</i> 65a). Nevertheless, since there is no specific Torah obligation to celebrate in this manner, the celebrations were suspended because of the Rabbinic prohibition (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, ibid.).</i>",
            "It is a great mitzvah to maximize this celebration.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">for the experience of genuine Torah happiness is a fundamental and necessary element of our service of God, as explained in the following halachah.</i> The common people and anyone who desired would not perform [in these celebrations];<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Though they would attend, as mentioned in the final clause of the halachah</i> only the greatest of Israel's wise men: the <i>Rashei Yeshivot</i>, the members of the high court, the pious, the elders, and the men of stature.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">for it was only their celebration that could inspire the people with spiritual feeling.</i> They were those who would dance, clap their hands, sing, and rejoice in the Temple on the days of the festival of Sukkot.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sukkah</i> 53a relates how Hillel the Elder would rejoice at <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i>. Other Sages would also participate. For example, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel would juggle eight torches of fire and bow down so low he could kiss the ground. The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 5:3) relates how Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzedek would perform unique feats of jumping.</i> However, the entire people<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">the men and the women - would come to see and hear - deriving joy from this passive participation.</i> - the men and the women - would come to see and hear.",
            "The happiness with which a person should rejoice in the fulfillment of the mitzvot and the love of God who commanded them is a great service.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">By mentioning this concept at the conclusion - but as part - of the these halachot, the Rambam emphasizes how the celebration of the festivals is not just an isolated experience, but rather is intended to influence the totality of our service of God. The rejoicing of the festival of Sukkot enables us to appreciate true happiness in all aspects of our Torah service.</i> Whoever holds himself back from this rejoicing is worthy of retribution, as [Deuteronomy 28:47] states: \"...because you did not serve God, your Lord, with happiness and a glad<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This verse comes after the full description of the curses and retribution which God will visit upon the Jewish people for their sins. From the Rambam's statements, it appears that it is the lack of happiness in the service of God, and not the sins themselves, which brought about this punishment.<br>The <i>Ari</i>, Rabbi Yitzchak Luria, explains that even though the punishment comes for the sins, had the Jewish people served God with true joy and happiness, that happiness would have caused Him to overlook those transgressions, regardless of how serious they were. In contrast, a lack of happiness in the performance of the mitzvot demonstrates a deficiency in the person's awareness of the connection to God established thereby.</i> heart.\"<br>Whoever holds himself proud, giving himself honor, and acts haughtily in such situations is a sinner and a fool.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">for he is concerned with himself, rather than with God.</i> Concerning this, Solomon warned [Proverbs 28:10]: \"Do not seek glory before the King.\"<br>[In<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., God, in whose presence we are at every moment.</i> contrast,] anyone who lowers himself and thinks lightly of his person in these situations<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">transcending his self-consciousness and committing himself to God totally, without any restrictions</i> is [truly] a great person, worthy of honor,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">his ability to open himself up to God allows him to serve as a medium for the expression of His greatness, and thus, his own personal prestige rises, because, as our Sages commented: \"A king's servant is like a king.\"</i> who serves God out of love.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i>, Chapter 10.</i> Thus, David, King of Israel,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The mention of David's position further emphasizes the concept explained.

David answered her sharply, explaining that it is precisely this ability to give oneself totally over to Godliness which characterizes a Jewish monarch and makes him fit to lead the people in the service of God.<br>Though the Rambam stresses how an approach of humility and happiness befits people of honor - as is obvious from the nature of the Sages' celebration of <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i> - these ideas also apply to every Jew. When an individual is conscious of God's constant presence, he will naturally be infused with these two emotions. He will feel his own smallness in God's presence, yet he will also feel real joy at the knowledge that God is with him at every moment, and that through his service of Torah and mitzvot, he can develop a greater connection with Him.<br>May our service of God with joy hasten the time when \"crowned with eternal joy\" (Isaiah 35:10 , we will be able to \"rejoice before God, your Lord, for seven days,\" in the Messianic Temple. May we merit it, speedily, in our days.</i>"
