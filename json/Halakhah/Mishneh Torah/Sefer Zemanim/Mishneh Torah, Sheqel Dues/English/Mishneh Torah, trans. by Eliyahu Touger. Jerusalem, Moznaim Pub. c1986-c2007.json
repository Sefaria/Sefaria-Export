There is normally an emphasis that one's offerings be complete and unblemished. Why in this instance were we obligated to give only a half-shekel?<br>To offer a homiletic resolution to this question: Giving a half-shekel emphasizes that a person is only a half and can never reach fulfillment until he joins together with another individual. Alternatively, it is God who contributes the second half, which enables an individual to reach fulfillment (<i>Likkutei Sichot,</i> Vol. III, <i>Parashat Ki Tissa</i>).</i>-shekel each and every year.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sefer HaKovetz</i> states that this teaches that one may not give several shekalim in one year to fulfill the mitzvah for many future years.</i> Even a poor man who derives his livelihood from charity is obligated [to make this donation]. He should borrow from others or sell the clothes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Halachah 9.

For example, concerning a Hebrew maidservant, Exodus 21:7 states, \"She shall not go out [to freedom] as the slaves go out.\"<br>The Rambam explains that this is not a negative commandment, but a narrative verse introducing the concept. Similarly, the commentaries explain that the verse under discussion is not a negative commandment, but rather a description of how the half-shekel is given (<i>Nimukei Mahari</i>).</i> nor should the poor give less.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is also a homiletic dimension to this requirement: The half-shekel relates to a level of soul shared equally by all.</i><br>[The half-shekel] should not be given in several partial payments - today a portion, tomorrow a portion. Instead, it is to be given all at once.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Kapach emphasizes that there are two dimensions implied by this law: a) that the half-shekel should be given on a single day, not in several payments;<br>b) that a single coin should be given, not several coins equal in value to a half-shekel.</i>",

According to the figures he gives, in modern measure, a shekel of the Torah is 16 grams of pure silver.</i><br>The Sages increased its value and made it equivalent to the coin called a <i>sela</i>, [which was prevalent] during the Second Temple period. How much did a <i>sela</i> weigh? 384 average size barley corns [of pure silver].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Today, it is common custom to give 96 grams of silver for the five shekalim required for the <i>pidyon habeyn</i> ceremony. Thus a shekel is 19.2 grams. According to the <i>Piskei Siddur</i> of Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi a shekel is 20.4 grams.</i>",
            "A <i>sela</i> is four <i>dinarim</i>, a <i>dinar</i> is six <i>ma'ah</i> and a <i>ma'ah</i> was called a <i>gerah</i> in the time of Moses our teacher.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 30:13 describes a shekel as being twenty <i>ma'ah</i>.

We have described them so that we will not have to describe their weight at all times.",
            "The mitzvah of giving the half-shekel entails giving half of the coin that is [common] currency at the time in question, even if that coin is larger than the shekel used for the sanctuary. [The converse, however, does not apply.] Never should one give less than the half-shekel<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Mishnah (<i>Shekalim</i> 2:4) relates that, at one time, the <i>dinar</i> was the common currency in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, and the people proposed giving half a dinar instead of a half-shekel. The Sages, however, did not accept this proposal, since it entailed giving less than the half-shekel given at the time of Moses.</i> that was given in the time of Moses our teacher, which weighed 160 barley corns [of silver].",
            "At the time when the common currency was a <i>darcon</i>, everyone would give a <i>sela</i> as a half-shekel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This halachah provides examples of the principles mentioned in the previous halachah, quoting from <i>Shekalim, loc. cit.</i> The Mishnah refers to the initial years of the Second Temple period.<br>The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam's interpretation of that Mishnah and offers another explanation why the people gave a larger coin at that time: Only a small portion of the Jewish people returned to Zion with Ezra. Had the people been required to give only the minimum amount, there would not have been enough funds to purchase communal sacrifices. In his Commentary on the Torah, the Ramban (Exodus 30:12  also follows the Ra'avad's interpretation.</i> At the time when the common currency was a <i>sela</i>, everyone would give half a <i>sela,</i> the equivalent of two <i>dinarim</i>, as a half-shekel. At the time when the common currency was half a <i>sela,</i> everyone would give that coin, half of a <i>sela</i>, as a half-shekel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because it was the equivalent of the half-shekel given in the time of Moses.</i> At no time did the Jews ever give less than the half-shekel mentioned in the Torah for the half-shekel.",
            "Everyone is obligated to give a half-shekel: priests,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Mishnah (<i>Shekalim</i> 1:4) mentions an opinion that maintains that priests are not obligated to give a half-shekel because they are entitled to partake of certain communal offerings.<br>The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Shekalim</i> 1:3) mentions another rationale why some maintain that priests are not obligated: The Torah (Exodus 30:13  states that the half-shekel should be given by: כל העובר על הפקודים, \"all those included in the census.\" Since the priests were not included in the census, they are not obligated to fulfill this mitzvah.<br>Significantly, in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shekalim, loc. cit. Avot</i> 4:7), the Rambam appears to accept the view that the priests are not required to give a half-shekel. Similarly, in his <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam cites the above verse as a proof-text explaining why women are not obligated in this mitzvah. Thus, his ruling in this halachah appears to reflect a change of position.</i> Levites, Israelites, converts, and freed slaves. Women,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although giving a half-shekel is a positive mitzvah that is not limited to a specific time, in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) the Rambam states that women are explicitly excluded from the obligation to perform this mitzvah, as implied by the verse cited above, \"all those included in the census.\" As mentioned in the previous note, although the Rambam appears to have changed his mind in relation to this phrase, it nevertheless appears that there is a specific exclusion concerning women, for the previous verse states, \"A man shall give....\" (See the glosses of Rabbenu Asher and Rabbenu Ovadiah of Bertinoro, <i>Shekalim</i> 1:3.)</i> slaves, and children<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although the Torah obligates only those included in the census - and that meant men of the age of twenty and above - for posterity, the mitzvah must be fulfilled by any child who reaches the age of thirteen.<br>This ruling is not accepted by many authorities. The <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) and Rabbenu Ovadiah of Bertinoro (<i>Shekalim</i> 1:3) maintain that the requirements of the original census were observed for posterity.</i> are not obligated. Nevertheless, if they give [a half-shekel], it may be accepted.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Several commentaries have offered explanations why the Temple treasury was allowed to accept the gift of a child, when (as reflected in <i>Hilchot Lulav</i> 8:10) according to Torah law, a child is not able to transfer ownership of his property to others.<br>[<i>K'tzot HaShulchan</i> (Section 235) uses this law as the basis for a thesis of a larger scope: That once a transaction sanctioned only by Rabbinic law is completed, it is acceptable according to the Torah. For if the child's gift of the half-shekel (a transaction sanctioned by Rabbinic law only) were not acceptable according to the Torah, the money could not be used to purchase sacrifices. <i>Netivot HaMishpat</i> and others do not accept this thesis and offer other explanations why a child's gift is acceptable.]</i> By contrast, if a Samaritan<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This restriction would appear to refer to all gentiles. Indeed, Rav Kapach's Yemenite manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> state גוי, \"a gentile,\" rather than כותי, \"a Samaritan.\"<br>Without discounting the possibility of a change having been made because of censorship, it would appear that the reference to Samaritans is historical in nature. The reason why donations were not accepted from gentiles is that, as stated in Chapter 4, Halachah 8, funds from these donations were also used to maintain the city of Jerusalem. No monies from gentiles may be used for that purpose, as reflected by Nechemiah 2:20: \"You have no portion, or right, or memorial in Jerusalem.\" And that narrative (<i>ibid.</i> 3:34) relates that the Samaritans were among the foes of Israel at that time. (See also <i>Hilchot Matnot Ani'im</i> 8:8.)</i> gives a half-shekel, it should not be accepted.<br>A father who began giving a half-shekel on behalf of a child should not stop. Instead, he should [continue to] give a half-shekel on the child's behalf every year until he comes of age and gives [the half-shekel] by himself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shekalim</i> 1:3), the Rambam mentions that by giving a half-shekel once, a father \"obligates his son in this mitzvah.\" Hence, it is inappropriate for him to cease giving on his son's behalf.</i>",

Therefore, it must be performed in all places. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> draws attention to <i>Shekalim</i> 3:4, which states that the third time during the year that funds were taken from the Temple treasury, they were taken on behalf of the Jews living in the diaspora.</i> When, however, it is destroyed, even in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> it is not necessary to give.",

Rav Kapach notes that, on occasion, the Holy of Holies is referred to as \"the chamber of the <i>kaporet</i>.\" This appears to be the Rambam's intent. Rabbenu Ovadiah of Bertinoro, by contrast, interprets this term as referring to the Temple vessels made from gold.</i><br>The eighth<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Concerning the purpose of the latter six chests, the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states \"six were for voluntary donations.\" The <i>Tosefta</i> and the Jerusalem Talmud each offer a different interpretation of the purposes for which these six chests were used.

Those funds were deposited in this [chest].<br>The ninth was for the [money that] remains after [purchasing] a guilt-offering; the tenth, for the [money that] remains after [purchasing] the pairs [of doves necessary] for [the offerings of] <i>zavim, zavot</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Zavot</i> is a venereal condition resembling gonorrhea that renders men (<i>zavim</i>) ritually impure.

Since these six chests were mentioned in one group by the Mishnah, this represents somewhat of a difficulty.</i>",
            "The [purpose] for each category for which the funds in the chest were used was written on the outside of the chest. The court stipulated that all the monies that remained after the purchase of sacrifices for which they were designated should be used to offer animals as burnt offerings.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Had the court not made such a stipulation, it would not have been permissible to change the purpose of these funds from the intent for which they were originally donated.

All the doors to the chamber were closed [under lock and] key, and then they were covered with seals. All the shekalim that were collected there [were stored] in three large baskets. Each of the baskets was large enough to contain nine <i>seah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, the basket would contain 74.6 cubic liters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> and 130 cubic liters according to <i>Chazon Ish</i>.</i> The remainder [of the money] was left in the chamber.<br>The money in the baskets was referred to as <i>terumat halishcah</i> (\"[the funds of] the chamber that were set aside\").<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These funds were used to purchase the communal sacrifices and for other purposes, as related in Chapter 4, Halachot 1-7.</i> [The funds that] remained besides [the funds] stored in the baskets were referred to as <i>sheyarei halishcah</i> (\"the remainder within the chamber\").<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These funds were used for various communal projects, as mentioned in Chapter 4, Halachah 8. There is a substantial difference in status between these two groups of funds.

The other funds, by contrast, were used for mundane purposes, albeit those of the community, and not those of an individual. (See <i>Hilchot Me'ilah</i> 6:13.)</i>",
            "On three occasions during the year<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shekalim</i> 3:1), the Rambam explains that the funds were set aside on these three occasions so that the matter would be publicized.</i> funds were taken from this chamber: On Rosh Chodesh Nisan, on either the day before or the day after the festival of Rosh Chodesh Tishrei<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although the wording of the <i>Mishnah</i> (<i>Shekalim</i> 3:1) implies that the money was set aside on Rosh HaShanah, since Rosh HaShanah is a holiday, the money was set aside either beforehand or afterwards.</i>, and fifteen days before Shavuot.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note also the parallel to (and slight difference from) <i>Hilchot Bechorot</i> 7:8, which describes the setting aside of the tithes of the herds on three occasions during the year.</i><br>How is the money set aside?

This is inaccurate, for there are far more days between the middle of Iyar - the time of the second separation - and Tishrei - the time of the third - than between Tishrei and Nisan - the time of the first separation. And both of these periods are far greater than the period from Rosh Chodesh Nisan until the middle of Iyar. In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shekalim</i> 3:1), the Rambam resolves this difficulty, explaining that on each occasion they would set aside an amount of money appropriate for the period, implying that the amounts were not equal.</i> On Rosh Chodesh Nisan, [funds] were set aside from the new collection.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 7b emphasizes that Rosh Chodesh Nisan was considered to be Rosh HaShanah concerning the Temple sacrifices, and from that time onward the funds to purchase the sacrifices were taken from the new collection.</i><br>If the funds in the three large containers were insufficient and were exhausted before the month of Nisan, they would set aside other funds from the remainder within the chamber.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the funds that were not within the three large baskets and were ordinarily used for other communal purposes.<br>In explanation of this halachah, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> points to a difference of opinion in the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Shekalim</i> 3:3) between Rabbi Meir and the Sages. The Sages maintain that if the funds were exhausted, a new collection should be made. Rabbi Meir, by contrast, maintains that the funds should be taken from those remaining in the chamber.<br>There is, however, a difficulty with the reference to this source, because Rabbi Meir maintains that the funds remaining in the chamber were consecrated, and therefore one who uses them for his individual purposes transgresses the prohibition against <i>me'ilah</i>. As mentioned above, the Rambam (<i>Hilchot Me'ilah</i> 6:13) does not accept that ruling.</i>",
            "The three smaller baskets into which the funds were set aside and taken outside were labeled <i>alef, bet, gimmel</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The first three letters of the Hebrew alphabet.

Afterwards, he should fill the second basket from the second large basket and then cover the large basket with a handkerchief, and then the third basket from the third large basket.<br>He does not cover this large basket with a handkerchief, thus making it apparent that he concluded with it. And he would begin with it when he entered a second time before Shavuot. At that time, he would first set aside [the funds] from the large basket that was uncovered, and then he covered it. He then set aside from the large basket from which he had taken [the funds] first on the previous occasion, and covered it. He would then take funds from the large basket that is next to it.<br>He would not cover this basket, so that [he would know] to start from it in Tishrei, the third time he entered.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's ruling is dependent on his interpretation of the Mishnah (<i>Shekalim</i> 3:4).

The Ra'avad, Rabbenu Asher, and others offer a different interpretation, which appears to fit more closely the plain meaning of the Jerusalem Talmud's explanation of the Mishnah.</i> Thus, he would have placed [funds] into the first, second, and third of the small baskets from each of the large baskets.",
            "When he placed the funds in these three [small] baskets, he placed the funds in the first basket on behalf of [the inhabitants of] <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>; in the second basket, on behalf of [the inhabitants of] the walled cities surrounding <i>Eretz Yisrael,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Ovadiah of Bertinoro (<i>Shekalim</i> 3:4) gives as examples, the inhabitants of the lands of Ammon and Moab.</i> and on behalf of [the inhabitants of] the totality of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>; and in the third basket, on behalf of [the inhabitants of] Babylonia, on behalf of [the inhabitants of] Media, on behalf of [the inhabitants of] other distant countries, and on behalf of the remainder of the Jewish people.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Ovadiah of Bertinoro (who interprets the abovementioned Mishnah differently from the Rambam) explains that the reason for the mention of these three locales is chronological. First, the shekalim would be collected from <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, then from the surrounding areas, and lastly from the outlying diaspora. Nevertheless, whenever they set aside the money for the communal sacrifices, they had the intent that the money was to be given for the entire Jewish people.<br>It is unlikely that the Rambam would follow this view. It appears that he considers these divisions as merely geographic indicators.</i>",
            "When he set aside the funds, he had the intention of including [all those whose shekalim] had been collected and were present in the chamber, [all those whose shekalim] had been collected and had not reached the chamber, and [all those whose shekalim] would be collected in the future.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., even if for some reason a person had not given his half-shekel as yet, retroactively he received a share in these sacrifices.

Nevertheless, since the lost shekalim were not mentioned in the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Shekalim</i> 2:1), nor in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Shekalim</i> 2:5), the Rambam also omits mention of them. (See also Chapter 3, Halachot 8-9.)</i><br>[In this manner,] the shekalim that he set aside to use [to purchase the sacrifices] would serve as atonement for the entire Jewish people.

The Meiri explains that since half-shekel coins were in demand, the value of two such coins was slightly more than a shekel. Rav Kapach [based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shekalim</i> 1:6)] explains that this additional amount was a fee paid to the Temple treasury for providing the services of a money-changer. Based on the latter two explanations, if a person gives a half-shekel coin, he is not obligated to add a <i>kolbon</i>.</i> This extra amount is referred to as a <i>kolbon</i>. Therefore, when two individuals give a shekel [to discharge the obligation incumbent] upon both of them, they are obligated to give a <i>kolbon</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A single <i>kolbon</i>.

Whenever these individuals are not obligated to give a <i>kolbon</i>, their herds are considered as a single entity, and they are obligated to tithe them together. Whenever they are obligated to give a <i>kolbon</i>, their herds are not considered as a single entity, and they are not obligated to tithe them together.</i><br>When does the above apply? When the partners have conducted business with the funds of the partnership, and [the initial funds are no longer present].

When the initial funds have been spent and the partnership begins generating its own income, then the two people are considered to have a joint income.</i><br>If they conducted business with the funds of the partnership, afterwards divided the assets, and then entered into a new partnership, they are obligated to give a <i>kolbon</i> until they conduct business under the new partnership agreement, and exchange the money [in the partnership's account].",

If they did comprise the majority of the assets, a different ruling would apply.

In the First Temple, a wall served this function. The Second Temple was much taller than the First Temple (100 cubits, as opposed to 30), and a wall only a cubit thick and 100 cubits high would not be structurally sound. Therefore, the Sages replaced the wall with two curtains. See <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 4:2. Since these curtains replaced a structure of stone, they were governed by different rules from those governing the other curtains in the Temple. Among the differences was that they were not paid for from these funds.</i>Therefore, they should not be purchased [with the funds of] <i>terumat halishcah</i>, but rather [with funds that were] consecrated for <i>bedek habayit</i> [\"the upkeep of the Temple\"]. The curtains covering the gates, by contrast, should be purchased [with the funds of] <i>terumat halishcah</i>.<br>It is ordained that [the funds necessary to fashion] the <i>menorah</i> and the other sacred articles should come from [the funds stemming from] the remainder of the libations.

If the price for these commodities increases on the general market, the suppliers are still obligated to provide the Temple with the commodities at the price agreed upon previously. If, however, the price for them decreases on the general market, the suppliers must sell them to the Temple at their present market value. The profit realized by the Temple treasury in this manner is referred to as \"the [funds stemming from] the remainder of the libations.\"<br>Significantly, however, in those laws the Rambam mentions that these funds are used to purchase burnt offerings, and does not mention that they were used to fashion the sacred articles. The commentaries resolve this discrepancy by stating that only rarely was it necessary to purchase sacred articles. Hence, these funds were primarily used for the purchase of burnt offerings.</i> If, however, no such funds are available, [the funds necessary for] these [sacred articles] should come from <i>terumat halishcah</i>.<br>[The funds necessary to fashion] the priestly garments, those of the High Priest and those of all the other priests who serve in the Temple should come from <i>terumat halishcah</i>.",
