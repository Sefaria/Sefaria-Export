            "The Torah commands each member of Israel to contribute half a shekel each year. Even a poor man who lives on charity is required to give; he borrows or sells the garment off his back and contributes a silver half-shekel, as it is written: \"The rich shall not give more and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel\" (Exodus 30:15). One must not pay the half-shekel in several instalments, a little today and a little tomorrow, but has to contribute it all at once in a single payment.",
            "The silver denomination spoken about in the Torah regarding rape, seduction, one who puts out a bad name and one who kills a slave – that silver denomination is the shekel that is spoken about in every [other] place in the Torah. And its weight is three hundred and twenty barley seeds. And the Sages already added to it and made its weight [to be] like the weight of the coin called, [the] <i>sela</i>, at the time of the Second Temple. And how much is the weight of the <i>sela</i>? Three hundred eighty four medium barley grains.",
            "And the <i>sela</i> is four dinar; and a dinar is six <i>maah</i>. And the <i>maah</i> is what was called <i>gerah</i> in the days of Moshe, our teacher. And a <i>maah</i> is two <i>fundyon</i>; and a <i>fundyon</i> is two <i>issar</i>. And a <i>ferutah</i> is an eighth of an <i>issar</i>. It comes out that  the weight of a <i>maah</i> – which is a <i>gerah</i> – is sixteen barley grains; and the weight of an <i>issar</i> is four barley grains; and the weight of a <i>perutah</i> is half a barley grain.",
            "And there was yet another coin there – the weight of which was two <i>sela</i> – and it was called the <i>darkhon</i>. And all of these coins, that we have said and explained the weight of each one of them, are the ones with which we measure in every place. And we have explained them [now], so that I will not have a need to explain their weight in every place.",
            "This half-shekel requirement signifies that one is to give half of the contemporary standard coin, even if this coin happens to be larger than the sanctuary standard of a shekel. However, one is never allowed to pay less than the half-shekel used in the time of Moses our teacher, which weighed one hundred and fifty barley grains.",
            "At the time when the currency of that time was [the] <i>darkhon</i>, each and every one would give a  <i>sela</i> as his half shekel. And at the time that the currency was [the]  <i>sela</i>, each one would give half a <i>sela</i> – which is two <i>dinar</i> – as his half shekel. But at the time that the currency was the half <i>sela</i>, each and every one would give that [same] half <i>sela</i> for the half shekel. And regarding [the commandment of] the half shekel, Israel never weighed less than the Torah's half shekel.",
            "All are required to contribute half a shekel: priests, Levites, Israelites, proselytes, and emancipated slaves; but not women, slaves or minors. If these, however, offer to pay, the half-shekel is accepted from them. If non-Jews offer it, it is not accepted from them. If the father of a minor begins paying the half-shekel on behalf of his son, he is no longer free to discontinue it, but must go on paying each year until his son grows up and pays for himself.",
            "The shekel dues are applicable only when the Temple is in existence. As long as the Temple was in existence, shekel dues were contributed both in Eretz Yisrael and outside it. After the destruction of the Temple, the half-shekel payments ceased even within Eretz Yisrael.",
            "On the first of <i>Adar</i> announcement is made concerning the payment of shekel dues, so that each individual may prepare his half-shekel and be ready to pay it. On the fifteenth of <i>Adar</i>, the money-changers sit down in each town and gently request everyone to pay. They accept from everyone who offers them the half-shekel, without using compulsion against anyone who does not. On the twenty-fifth of <i>Adar</i>, they sit down in the Temple to enforce collection. From then on, payment is obtained by force from those who have not yet paid. Anyone who refuses to pay is subjected to compulsion by levy; a pledge is taken from him forcibly, even the garment he is wearing.",
            "We do not take collateral from someone not obligated [to pay the half shekel] – even though it is their way to give [it], or they will be giving it in the future. And we never take collateral from the priests (Kohanim), on account of the ways of peace. Rather we take it from them when they give it, but we do claim it until they give [it]."
        ],
        [
            "How would the money-changers collect the shekels in each and every province? They would place two boxes in front of them. The bottom of the box would be wide below and its opening would be narrow above – like a type of shofar – so that they could throw [the coins] into it, but it would not be possible to take [them out] easily. And why would they make two boxes? One in which they throw the shekels from this year; and in the second one, they would place the shekels of the past year. For they collect [that] from one who did not [give] it in the past year. ",
            "And there were always thirteen boxes in the Temple in front of them – each box was [shaped] like a type of shofar. The first was for the shekels of that year. The second was for the shekels of the past year. The third was for anyone who is [obligated to offer] two doves or young pigeons – whether as a burnt-offering or as a sin-offering – he would throw their cost to this box. The fourth was for anyone who is [obligated to offer] a burnt-offering of fowl only – he would throw its cost to this box. The fifth was for one who pledged money with which to buy wood for the arrangement (of wood on the altar). The sixth was for one who pledged money for the frankincense. The seventh was for one who pledged gold for the ark cover. The eighth was for the remnant  of [the cost of] a sin-offering. For example, [if] one designated money for his sin-offering and bought a sin-offering, but there was money left over from it – he throws the rest into it. The ninth one was for the remnant of a guilt-offering. The tenth was for the remnant of \"bird nests\" of a <i>zav</i>, a <i>zavah</i> or a woman who gave birth. The eleventh was for the remnant of the offerings of a nazerite. The twelfth was for the remnant of the guilt-offering of a <i>metsora</i>. The thirteenth was for one who pledged money for a burnt-offering of an animal. ",
            "And the name of each thing for which its money was inside the box was written on the box on the outside. And there was a stipulation of the court on all of the remnants, that they would [be used] to offer animal burnt-offerings. It comes out that you have learned that all of the money found in the last six is for animal burnt-offerings – and their skins [would go] to the priests, like the rest of all the skins. And all of the money in the third box is to purchase fowl with them – half of them burnt-offerings and half of them sin-offerings. And in the fourth one, it was all [for] burnt-offerings of fowl.",
            "[After] they collected the shekels in each and every province, they would send them to the Temple in the hand of messengers. And they needed to change them into golden dinars (which were more compact), because of the load of the journey (to lighten the burden). And all of them would be gathered to the Temple and placed in one of the Temple's chambers. And they would close all of its doors with keys, and seal it over with seals. And they would fill three big chests from all of the shekels that were gathered there. The requisite size of each chest was enough to contain nine <i>seah</i>. And they would place the remnant in the chamber. And that which is inside the chests is what is called the allocation of the chamber (<i>terumat halishkah</i>). And that which remains as the surplus of what is in the chests is called the leftovers of the chamber. ",
            "Three times a year sums are taken from the Temple treasury: on <i>Rosh Hodesh Nisan</i>, on <i>Rosh Hodesh Tishri</i>, before or after the festival, and on the fifteenth day before <i>Shavuoth</i>. And how do we perform its appropriation? One enters inside the chamber while guards stand on the outside. And he says to them, \"Should I make the appropriation?\" And they say to him, \"Make the appropriation; make the appropriation; make the appropriation\" – three times. And afterwards, he fills three small chests – each of the chests containing three <i>seah</i> – from those three large chests, and brings them out in order to use them until they finish. And he returns and fills those three small chests from the three big ones a second time before [Shavouot]; and they make use of them until they finish.",
            "And he returns and fills them from the three big chests a third time in Tishrei; and they make use of them until they finish, until the beginning of the month of Nissan. And on Rosh Chodesh of Nissan, they make the appropriation from the new appropriation. If the shekel dues in the three large baskets were insufficient and all spent before <i>Nisan</i>, sums were taken again from the residue of the chamber.",
            "Upon the three small chests with which he makes the appropriations and which he takes out is written, <i>aleph, bet</i>, and <i>gimmel</i> (respectively). [This is] so that they will use [the contents] from the first one until it finishes. And [only] afterwards will they use [the contents] from the second one until it finishes. And afterwards will they use [the contents] from the third one until it finishes. And he makes the first appropriation from the first big chest and he covers [what is left in] that big one with a handkerchief. And he makes the second appropriation from the second one and he covers that big one with a handkerchief. And he makes the third appropriation from the third big chest, but he does not cover it with a handkerchief – so that where he stopped be recognizable. And he begins with it first the second time, when he enters before [Shavouot]; and makes the first appropriation from [that] big one that was uncovered, and he covers it. And he makes the second appropriation from the big one from which he made the first appropriation at the beginning, and he covers it. And he makes the third appropriation from the big one next to it, but he does not cover it – so that he begin from it first on the third time, when he enters in Tishrei – until it comes that he has made an appropriation with the first, second and third of the small ones from each and every one of the large ones. ",
            "When he makes the appropriation [with] these three chests, he makes the first appropriation on behalf of the Land of Israel; the second one on behalf of the cities surrounding it and on behalf of all of (the Land of) Israel; and the third on behalf of Babylon and on behalf of Medea and on behalf of [other] distant provinces and on behalf of all of the rest of Israel. ",
            "When he makes the appropriation, he should intend to make the appropriation from that which has been collected that is in the chamber; that which has been collected but has not yet arrived to the chamber; and that which will be collected in the future – so that these shekels that he is taking out to use will be atonement for all of Israel. And [it will] be as if all of their shekels arrived to the chamber, and this appropriation was made from all of them.",
            "The priest entering the chamber to take up the heave offering must not wear a garment in which money can be concealed, nor shoes, sandals, a phylactery, or an amulet, that people should not become suspicious and say: \"He has concealed money from the chamber on his person while taking up the heave offering.\" Besides, conversation was maintained with him from the moment he entered the chamber until he left it, to prevent him from putting coins in his mouth. Yet, despite all these precautions, a poor man or a greedy person should not take up the heave offering, because of possible suspicion, as it is written: \"You shall be clear before the Lord and before Israel\" (Numbers 32:22)."

        [
            "Everyone needed half shekels, in order that each and every one could give the half shekel that he was obligated. Hence when one went to a money-changer to change a shekel into two half shekels, he would need to give [the money-changer] a surcharge over the shekel. And that surcharge is called a <i>kalbon</i>. Hence two [men] that gave a shekel for both of them are obligated [to pay] a <i>kalbon</i>.",
            "Any one who is not obligated [to give] shekels – such as two women or two slaves – are exempt from the <i>kalbon</i>. And likewise if there was one who was obligated and one who was exempt, and the obligated one gave on behalf of the one who was exempt – such as a man who gave a shekel for himself and for a woman or a slave – he is exempt from the <i>kalbon</i>. And likewise are priests exempt from the <i>kalbon</i>. And one who [pays a shekel] on behalf of a priest [and himself] is exempt from the <i>kalbon</i>.",
            "And [in a case of] one who gives a shekel for himself and for a poor person or his neighbor or his townsman: If he gave it to them as a gift, he is exempt from the <i>kalbon</i> – for he surely gave the half shekel as a gift in order to increase the shekels [given]. But if he gave them the half shekel for them by way of a loan until they return it to him, when it is found in their hand, he is obligated [to pay] the <i>kalbon</i>.",
            "Brothers who have not yet divided what the father left them – and likewise partners – that gave a shekel on behalf of one another are exempt from the <i>kalbon</i>. To what are these words applicable? To partners that have bought and sold with the money of the partnership and the money has changed its form. But if this one brought his money and that one his money and they mixed it, but the money has not yet changed and they have not spent it, these ones are surely obligated [to pay] the <i>kalbon</i>. If they bought and sold and, after a time, divided [the funds of the partnership]; and [then] went back to a partnership, they are obligated [to pay] the <i>kalbon</i> until they buy and sell in this later partnership and [this] money changed.",
            "Brothers and partners that have animals and money [in partnership], but [only] divided the money are obligated [to pay] the <i>kalbon</i> – even though they have not yet divided the animals. However if they divided the animals and did not divide the money, they are exempt from the <i>kalbon</i> until they divide the money; and we do not say [that] it is surely about to be divided.",
            "One who gives a shekel to [become] consecrated property (<i>hekdesh</i>), so that they will consider it for him to be the half shekel that he is obligated; and he takes a half shekel from that which is collected from others – he is obligated [to pay] two <i>kalbon</i>s. For if the whole shekel had [gone] to the shekels, he would have been obligated one <i>kalbon</i>.",
            "How much is the requisite amount of a <i>kalbon</i>? At the time that they were giving two dinars as a half shekel, the <i>kalbon</i> was half a <i>maah</i> – which is a twelfth of a dinar. And there never was a <i>kalbon</i> given that was less than this. And the <i>kalbon</i>s are not [treated] like the shekels. Rather the money-changers [store] them on their own until the consecrated property takes [it] from them.",
            "One who lost his shekel is responsible for its liability until he delivers it to the treasurer. [In a case of] the people of a city who sent their shekels in the hand of a messenger, and they were stolen or lost: If he was an unpaid guardian (of the money), such a one must surely swear to them, and he will be exempt like any unpaid guardian; and they go back and give their shekels a second time. And if the people of the city said, \"Since we will be paying our shekels [again], we don't want the messenger to swear – as he is believed by us,\" we don't listen to them. For it is an ordinance of the Sages that consecrated property is not released without an oath. If the first shekels are found after the messenger swore, these and those are [considered] shekels, but they do not count for the next year. [Rather] the first ones go to the shekels of the year, and the later ones go [with] the shekels of the past year.",
            "If they sent their shekels in the hand of a paid guardian, such that he is surely responsible for theft or loss, but it was lost from him by force majeure – such as if armed brigands took it from him – so that he is exempt; we see if the messenger was extorted after the treasurers made the appropriation. [If he was,] the messenger swears to the treasurers, and the people of the city are exempt. For the one making the appropriation makes [it] from that which is collected and that which will be collected in the future, so that [these shekels] were [already] in possession of the consecrated property. And what was there for the people of the city to do? See that they gave it only to a paid guardian who is liable for theft or loss; and force majeure is not common (that they should have taken precautions against it). But if they were lost before the appropriation was made, [the shekels] were still in the possession of the people of the city. So the messenger swears in front of the people of the city, and they must pay [a second time. If] after the messenger swore and they collected the shekels a second time, the brigands returned them – these and those are [considered] shekels, and they do not count for the next year. [Rather] the later ones go [with] the shekels of the past year. There is someone who says that the first ones which go for the shekels of this year are the ones that were collected first and lost or extorted and returned. And there is someone who says that the first shekels are the ones that arrived to the treasurer first.",
            "[In a case of] one who gave his half shekel to his fellow to bring it to the money-changer to [pay] it on his behalf; but [his fellow] paid it on behalf of himself, so that collateral not be taken from him (as he does not presently have his own half shekel): If the appropriation had already been made – he is guilty of misappropriation, as this shekel was in the possession of consecrated property. For they already made [the appropriation] from that which will be collected in the future. So it comes out that this one saved himself with the money of consecrated property [when] he drew benefit from this shekel. But if the appropriation was not [yet] made – he has not misappropriated, and is obligated to give his fellow the half shekel that [the latter] gave to him. And likewise does one who extorts or steals a half shekel and [gives] it for himself fulfill his obligation, and is obligated to pay twice to the owners or add a fifth.",
            "[In a case of] one who gives half a shekel from consecrated property [that he is holding], and the appropriation is made: Once some of it used, he is liable for misappropriation, and has fulfilled his obligation for the half shekel. [If] he gave it from monies of the second tithe – he must eat corresponding to [its value] in Jerusalem. [If he gave it] from monies of seventh-year [produce] – he must eat corresponding to [its value] with the [laws that apply to] the sanctity of the seventh year. [If it was] from a condemned city, he did not do anything.",
            "[In a case of] one who designated his shekel and thought that he was obligated to [give] it, and it comes out that he is not obligated: It is not consecrated. [In a case of] one who designated two [shekels] and it comes out that he is only obligated one: If [he gave them] one after the [other] – the later one was not consecrated. But if at one time, the first one is [considered] shekels and the second one is the leftover of shekels. [In a case of] one who designated his shekel and died, it goes to voluntary offerings.",
            "[If] one takes money in his hand and said, \"These are for my shekel\"; or he was gathering several <i>maah</i> or several <i>perutah</i> and, when he began to gather, said, \"Behold I am gathering <i>maah</i>s for my shekel\" – even if he collected a purse full – he [only] gives the half shekel that he is obligated from them, and the rest is non-consecrated. For the leftover of shekels is non-consecrated. ",
            "[In a case of] money that was found between the box for shekels and the box for voluntary offerings: [If] it was closer to the shekels – it goes to the shekels; [if] it was closer to the voluntary offerings – it goes to the voluntary offerings; half and half – it goes to the voluntary offerings. For the voluntary offerings all go to fire-offerings, whereas the shekels are used for burnt-offerings and other things.  ",
            "And likewise any money that is found between boxes goes to the closer one. If it is half and half: If found between the wood and the frankincense, it goes to the frankincense; if between the \"birds nests\" and the burnt-offerings [of fowl], it goes to the burnt-offering [of fowl]. This is the general principle: We go according to the closest with all of them; [if] half and half – [it goes] to the [more] stringent. And any money found on the Temple Mount is non-consecrated. For the treasurer does not remove money from the appropriation of the chamber until he transfers its sanctity to animals that he buys for sacrifices."

            "What is done with the Temple fund? It is used for the purchase of the daily offerings, the additional offerings, and all other public offerings with their libations, as well as the salt with which all sacrifices were salted, and the firewood, if it has not been brought as a gift and is obtainable only for money. And the incense and the wage of its makers; the showbread and the wage of those that made the showbread; the <i>omer</i> (barley offering); the two breads; the red heifer; the scapegoat; and the crimson strip that we tie between its horns. All of these come from the appropriation of the chamber.",
            "But we collect the [monies for] a bull of communal forgetting and goats [to atone for] idolatry at the outset; and they do not come from the appropriation of the chamber. The curtains for the [Temple] chamber were made instead of a [part of the Temple] structure, so they do not come from the appropriation of the chamber, but rather from the consecrated property of Temple upkeep. The [stipulations] of the commandment of the menorah and the [other] service vessels is that they should come from the remnant of the libations. And what the remnant of the libation is will be explained in the Laws of the Temple Vessels and Those who Serve Therein. But if they did not have a remnant of the libations for them, they should bring [their funds] from the appropriation of the chamber. Garments of the priests – whether the garments of the high priest or the rest of the garments of the priests with which they served in the Temple – all of it is from the appropriation of the chamber.",

[And] their libations are brought from the appropriation of the chamber. And likewise [if] an idolater sent a burnt-offering from a different province but did not send the value of [its] libations – they would bring its libations from the appropriation of the chamber.",
            "[In a case of] a convert that died and left over sacrifices: If he has libations [to accompany the sacrifices], we bring them from him. But if not, they came from the appropriation of the chamber. [In a case of] a high priest that died, and they did not [yet] appoint another in his place: We offer the griddle cakes (which the high priest would otherwise offer daily) from the appropriation of the chamber. Those who examine blemishes [of sacrifices] in Jerusalem; Torah scholars that teach the laws of slaughtering to the priests and the laws of pinching [the meal offering]; and women raising their sons for the red heifer – all of them would take their wage from the appropriation of the chamber. And how much was their wage? According to that which the court determined for them. ",

And these guards take their wages from the appropriation of the chamber.",
            "We do not listen to one who volunteers to guard for free, on account of the thugs – lest they come and take them from him. Hence the Sages ordained for them that they take their wage from the chamber – in order that all would (know about them and) separate from the place that these guards were there.",
            "The official proofreaders of biblical manuscripts in Jerusalem, and the judges who tried robbers in Jerusalem, received their salaries out of the Temple fund. How much did they receive? Ninety <i>maneh</i> (9,000 <i>zuz</i>) annually. If this was insufficient for their maintenance, they were given, whether they wanted it or not, enough additional pay to provide for their own needs and the needs of their wives and children and other members of their households.",

And both of them were made from the leftovers of the chamber. And likewise the sacrificial altar; the chamber; and the courtyards were made from the leftovers of the chamber. The aqueduct in Jerusalem; the wall of Jerusalem and all of its towers; and all of the needs of the city come from the leftovers of the chamber. [In a case of] an idolater that pledged money for these things or to do them for free: We do not accept it from him – even if he is a resident alien (who is not an idolater) – as it is stated (Ezra 4:3), \"It is not for you and us to build, etc.\"; and it is [also] stated (Nehemiah 2:20), \"and you have no portion, etc.\"",

For it is a stipulation of the court on all of the remnants, that they would [be used] to offer animal burnt-offerings. But [they would] not [purchase] burnt-offerings of fowl, since there are no fowl among the communal sacrifices.

And then [the treasurers] would purchase the incense from them with the new allocation, in order to offer it from the money of the new allocation.
