            "According to biblical law, if a courtyard has many tenants, each living in a house of his own, they may all move objects throughout the courtyard as well as from the houses into the courtyard and from the courtyard into the houses, because the entire courtyard is a single private domain, so that it is permissible to move objects through the whole of it. The same rule applies to an alley that has courtyards opening into it on three sides and the fourth side opening into the public road. By fastening at this fourth side a stake in the ground or a cross-beam above, the alley and the courts opening into it become a single private domain, so that all the residents of the alley are permitted to transfer objects throughout the alley as well as from the courtyards into the alley and from the alley into the courtyards.— —",
            "By rabbinical enactment, however, it is forbidden to transfer objects within a private domain where there is a separation of tenants, each living in a separate house, unless they create a symbolical fusion of all the tenants by preparing an <i>eruv</i> on Friday. It is all the same whether it is a courtyard, an alley or a town. This regulation was originated by Solomon and his legislative body.",

            "The <i>eruv</i> prepared by the tenants of a courtyard is called a <i>courtyard eruv;</i> the one prepared by the inhabitants of an alley or by all the residents of a town is called a <i>shituf (cooperative eruv)</i>.",
