            "According to biblical law, if a courtyard has many tenants, each living in a house of his own, they may all move objects throughout the courtyard as well as from the houses into the courtyard and from the courtyard into the houses, because the entire courtyard is a single private domain, so that it is permissible to move objects through the whole of it. The same rule applies to an alley that has courtyards opening into it on three sides and the fourth side opening into the public road. By fastening at this fourth side a stake in the ground or a cross-beam above, the alley and the courts opening into it become a single private domain, so that all the residents of the alley are permitted to transfer objects throughout the alley as well as from the courtyards into the alley and from the alley into the courtyards. And the same is the law in a city that is surrounded by a wall [at least] ten handbreadths tall that has gates that are locked at night, as it is all a private domain. This is the biblical (Torah) law.",
            "By rabbinical enactment, however, it is forbidden to transfer objects within a private domain where there is a separation of tenants, each living in a separate house, unless they create a symbolical fusion of all the tenants by preparing an <i>eruv</i> on Friday. It is all the same whether it is a courtyard, an alley or a town. This regulation was originated by Solomon and his legislative body.",
            "And likewise may those dwelling in tents or huts or a camp that they encircled with a partition not carry from one tent to [another] tent until they all make an <i>eruv</i>. But [members] of a caravan that is surrounded by a partition do not need to make an <i>eruv</i>, but may rather transport from one tent to [another] tent without an <i>eruv</i> — since they are all [already] joined together (which is the function of an <i>eruv</i>), and those tents are not permanent [dwellings] for them.  ",
            "And for what [reason] did Solomon ordain this thing? So that the people would not err and say [that] in the same way as it is permissible to transport from the courtyards to the plazas of the city and its marketplaces; so is it permissible to transport from the city out to the field, or to transport from the field into the city. And they will [further] think that since the marketplaces and plazas are a domain for everyone, they are surely like the fields and the deserts. And they will say that only courtyards are a private domain; and it will appear to them that transporting is not a [forbidden type of] work and that it is permissible to bring [things] in and out from a private domain to a public domain.",
            "Hence he ordained that every private domain that is divided into domiciles, and each and every one holds [such a domicile] for himself, but a piece of it is left over for the needs of all and the power of all is equal in it — such as a courtyard for houses — that this place that the power of all is equal be considered like a public domain; and that each and every place that each one of the neighbors holds and separated out for himself — that it alone be considered a private domain. So it would be forbidden to transport from a domain that he separated out for himself into the domain in which the power of all is the same — in the way that we may not transport from a private domain into a public domain. Rather each one may only use the domain that he separated out for himself, until they all make an <i>eruv</i> — even though (without this ordinance,) it is all a private domain.",
            "What is the form of the prescribed <i>eruv?</i> It consists of a quantity of food contributed by the residents jointly and deposited on Friday, as if to say: \"We are all one fellowship, we all have the same food, and none of us keeps a domain distinct from that of his neighbor; just as we share equally the area of the <i>eruv</i>, so we have equal rights in each of the areas held by each individually; all of us are a single domain.\" This symbolical act serves to prevent people from falling into error and imagining that it is permissible to move objects from a private domain to a public domain.",
            "The <i>eruv</i> prepared by the tenants of a courtyard is called a <i>courtyard eruv;</i> the one prepared by the inhabitants of an alley or by all the residents of a town is called a <i>shituf (cooperative eruv)</i>.",
            "We only make an <i>eruv</i> with a complete [loaf of] bread. We may not make an <i>eruv</i> with even a loaf of a baked <i>seah</i> that is a sliced. [But] if it was complete, we may make an <i>eruv</i> with it, [even] if was an <i>issar</i>. And in the [same] way that we can make an <i>eruv</i> with the bread of grain, so may we make an <i>eruv</i> with the bread of rice or the bread of lentils; but not with the bread of millet. And a <i> shituf</i> is either with bread or with other foods. We may make a <i>shituf</i> with any food except for water by itself or salt by itself. And likewise may we not make a <i>shituf</i> with truffles or mushrooms, as they are not considered foods. If one mixes water with salt, it becomes like brine, so we may make a <i>shituf</i> [with it].",
            "And what is the [requisite] amount with which we make a <i>shituf</i>? A dried fig-bulk for each and every one of the residents of the alley or of the city. And that is when they are eighteen or less. But when they are more numerous than that, its amount is [food for] two meals — which is like eighteen dried fig-bulks, which [in turn] is [the size of] six medium eggs — even if the participants are thousands and tens of thousands, it is two meals (that are this size) for all of them.",
            "If they made a <i>shituf</i> with any food that is eaten as it is (by itself), such as bread or types of grain or raw meat — its [requisite] amount is nourishment for two meals. But the amount of anything that is an accompaniment and the way of the people is to eat their bread with it — such as cooked wine or roast meat or vinegar or brine or olives or onion bulbs — is enough to eat two meals with it.",
            "[If] they made a <i>shituf</i> with raw (unprocessed) wine, its amount is two <i>reviit</i> (each) for all of them; and likewise with beer, two <i>reviit</i>; two eggs — and we may make a <i>shituf</i> with them even if they are raw; two pomegranates; one citron; five nuts; five peaches; a liter of vegetables — whether raw or boiled, but we may not make a [<i>shituf</i>] with it if it was neither cooked nor uncooked, as it is not fit to eat; an <i>ukla</i> of spice; a <i>kav</i> of dates; a <i>kav</i> of dried figs; a <i>maneh</i> of pressed fig cake; a <i>kav</i> of apples; a handful of dodder; a handful of fresh beans; a liter of green grain. And beets are included in vegetables and we make a [<i>shituf</i>] with them. We may not make a [<i>shituf</i>] with onion leaves unless they have firmed up and the length of each of its leaves becomes a <i>zeret</i>. But less than that is not food. And all of these things mentioned are accompaniments. Hence [the Sages] gave these [requisite] amounts for them — and likewise, anything that is similar to them. And all foods combine for the [requisite] amount of the <i>shituf</i>.  ",
            "The liter mentioned in every place is the fill of two <i>reviit</i>; and an <i>ukla</i> is half a <i>reviit</i>. And the <i>maneh</i> mentioned in every place is a hundred dinar. And a dinar is six <i>maah</i>. And the weight of a <i>maah</i> is sixteen barley seeds. And the <i>sela</i> is four dinar. And a reviit is that which contains [the amount] of water or of wine that weighs about seventeen and a half dinar. It comes out that the weight of a liter is thirty-five dinar; and the weight of an <i>ukla</i> is nine dinar less a <i>fourth</i>.",
            "The <i>seah</i> mentioned in every place is six <i>kav</i>; and the <i>kav</i> is four <i>log</i>; and the <i>log</i> is four <i>reviit</i>. And we have already explained the size of the <i>reviit</i> and its weight. These are the [requisite] amounts that one must always remember.",
            "One may make an <i>eruv</i> or make a <i>shituf</i> with food that is permissible to eat, even though it is forbidden to the one making the <i>eruv</i>. How is this? A nazerite may make a <i>shituf</i> with wine, and an Israelite [may do so] with priestly tithe. And likewise one who has made a vow from eating this, or sworn not to eat it, may make an <i>eruv</i> with it or make a <i>shituf</i> with it. For [even] if it is not fit for this one, it is fit for another.",
            "But we may not make an <i>eruv</i> or make a <i>shituf</i> with something that is forbidden to everyone, such as fruits that have not been tithed — even if they are only [obligated in rabbinic tithes] — or first tithe the priestly tithe of which has not been properly taken; and likewise second tithe and consecrated foods that have have not been redeemed according to the law. But we may make an <i>eruv</i> or make a <i>shituf</i> with <i>demai</i>, since it is fit for the poor; and with first tithe the priestly tithe of which has been taken; and second tithe and consecrated foods that have been redeemed, even though one did not [add the mandatory] fifth — as the fifth does not impinge [on its permissibility as food]. And we may make an <i>eruv</i> with second tithe in Jerusalem, since it is fit for food there; but not in the outlying areas (outside of Jerusalem). ",
            "How is a <i>courtyard eruv</i> prepared? A whole loaf of bread is collected from each house, and all the loaves are placed within a single container and deposited in one of the dwellings of the courtyard. Even in a room for straw or a room for cattle or a storehouse. But if they put [it] in a gatehouse — even the gatehouse of an individual — or a veranda or a balcony or a room that does not consist of four ells by four ells, it is not an <i>eruv</i>. When gathering and depositing the food contributed by the various tenants, one should recite this benediction: \"Blessed art thou, Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us with thy commandments, and commanded us concerning the precept of <i>eruv</i>.\" He should then add: \"By virtue of this <i>eruv</i>, all the residents of this courtyard will be permitted to transfer objects from house to house on the Sabbath.\" And a child may collect courtyard <i>eruv</i>s. And if they were accustomed to leave it in [one home], they should not change it — on account of [the need to maintain] the ways of peace. ",
            "How should an <i>alley eruv</i> be prepared? One collects the smallest quantity of food, the size of a dry fig, from each resident, or even less than that if there are many residents, and puts it all into a single container; he then deposits it in one of the courtyards of the alley or in one of the houses, even in a small room or a veranda or a balcony, it is surely a <i>shituf</i>. But if he leaves it in the [empty] space of the alley, it is not a <i>shituf</i>. And if he left the vessel in the courtyard, he must raise the vessel a handbreadth from the ground, so that it be recognizable. And one recites the blessing, \"on the commandment of <i>eruv</i>.\" And he says: \"By virtue of this <i>cooperative eruv</i>, all residents of the alley are permitted to transfer objects between the courtyards and the alley on the Sabbath.\"",
            "[If] they divided the <i>eruv</i>, it is not an <i>eruv</i> — even if it is in one house. But if they filled the vessel with the <i>eruv</i> and a little was left over — such that they put it in another vessel — it is permissible. ",
            "Those who make a <i>shituf</i> in an alley need to [nevertheless also] make an <i>eruv</i> in [each] of their courtyards, so that the infants will not forget the law of the <i>eruv</i>. Hence if they made the <i>shituf</i> in the alley with bread, they can rely upon it and need not make an <i>eruv</i> in [each] of their courtyards; as the infants will surely [notice it] with bread. [In the case of] members of a group that were dining [together] when the day became sanctified upon them (Shabbat began), they may rely upon the bread on the table for the <i>eruv</i> in their courtyards. And if they want, they may rely upon it for the <i>shituf</i>, even though they are dining in the courtyard. ",
            "[If] one of the residents of the courtyard took a [loaf] of bread and said, \"Behold this is for all of the residents of the courtyard\"; or if it was [other] food, like [that of] two meals, and he said, \"Behold this is for all the residents of the alley\" — he does not need to collect [it] from each and every one. However he must acquire if for them through another (who will serve as their agent and receive it from him). And he may acquire it through his adult son or daughter or through his Hebrew slave or through his wife; but not through his minor son or daughter, nor through his Canaanite (gentile) slave or maidservant — since their hand (to acquire) is like his hand. But he may likewise acquire it for them through his Hebrew maidservant, even though she is a minor — as a minor may acquire for others with regards to something from the words of the Scribes (rabbinic). And he need not inform the residents of the courtyard or the residents of the alley that he surely acquired [it] for them, and made an <i>eruv</i> for them. For it is a benefit to them, and we may benefit [another] person not in his presence (without his knowledge).",
            "We may not make an <i>eruv</i> nor make a <i>shituf</i> on Shabbat, but rather [must make them] while it is still day. And we may make an <i>eruv</i> or make a <i>shituf</i> at twilight — even though it is a doubt whether it is from the day or from the night. However the <i>eruv</i> or the <i>shituf</i> must always be present and possible to eat during the whole twilight period. Hence if a pile [of stones] fell upon it or it got lost or burnt or it was priestly tithe and became impure while it was still day, it is not an <i>eruv</i>. [But if one of these things happened] from when it got dark, it is surely an <i>eruv</i>. And if it is in doubt, it is an <i>eruv</i> — as an <i>eruv</i> in [a state of] doubt is an <i>eruv</i>.",
            "[If] one placed the <i>eruv</i> into a closet and locked it in, and [then] lost the key before it got dark: If it is impossible for him to remove the <i>eruv</i> unless he did a forbidden type of work at twilight, it is surely like it is lost and is not an <i>eruv</i> — as it is surely impossible to eat it. If he separated out the priestly tithe of the tithe or the great priestly tithe and stipulated about it that it not be priestly tithe until it gets dark, we may not make an <i>eruv</i> with it — as it is still untithed all of the twilight period; and it needs to be a fit meal from when it is still day."

            "[In a case wherein] all the residents of a courtyard made an <i>eruv</i> except for one of them who did not [participate] in the <i>eruv</i> with them: Such a one surely prohibits them [its use] — so it is forbidden for any of them to transport from their houses to the courtyard and from the courtyard to their houses. [If] this one that did not [participate] nullifies his rights only to the courtyard to them, they are surely permitted to transport out and in from their houses to the courtyard and from the courtyard to their houses — but it is forbidden to [do so, to and from] his house. [But if] he [also] nullified the rights to his house to them, they are surely all permitted — they, because they made an <i>eruv</i> and he nullified his rights to them over his house and [the] courtyard; and he is also permitted, since no rights remain to him. So he is surely like a guest; and a guest does not [create this] prohibition. ",
            "One who nullifies his rights without specification has nullified his rights to [the] courtyard, but not nullified his rights to his house. And one nullifies his rights to the residents of the courtyard needs to explicitly nullify [it] to each and every one and say, \"My rights are nullified to you and to you and to you.\" And an inheritor may nullify his rights — even though his bequeather died on Shabbat. For the inheritor stands in the place of the one that bequeaths it to him for every matter; and nullification of rights is permissible at the outset [anytime] on Shabbat.",
            "[If] these ones that made an <i>eruv</i> nullified their rights to this one that did not [participate] — he is permitted [in it], as he surely remained [as if] alone. But they are forbidden, as there are no rights left to them — and we do not say that they should be like guests, as the many are not guests with the one.",
            "[In a case in which] the ones that did not [participate] are two or more: If they nullified their rights to the ones that made the <i>eruv</i>, the [latter] are permitted and those that did not [participate] are forbidden. But the ones that made the <i>eruv</i> may not nullify their rights to the two that did not [participate] — since each one forbids [it] for his fellow. And it is surely forbidden, even if one that did not [participate] subsequently nullified his rights to the other that did not [participate] — as it was forbidden at the time that the ones who made the <i>eruv</i> nullified their rights to him. [In a case where only two make an <i>eruv</i>, the] one who made an <i>eruv</i> may not nullify his rights to [the] one who did not [participate]. But the one who did not [participate] may nullify his rights to the one who made the <i>eruv</i>.",
            "In the way that one homeowner nullifies his rights to another homeowner in one courtyard, so [too] may we nullify [rights] from one courtyard to [another] courtyard. And we may nullify rights and nullify rights again. How is that? [In a case of] two that dwelt in a courtyard and an <i>eruv</i> was not made: One of them may nullify his rights to the second, and it comes out that the second may carry in the domain that his fellow nullified to him until he does all that he needs. And subsequently the second one nullifies his rights to the first, and the first may carry in the domain that he nullified to him. And likewise several times. And one can nullify rights in a ruin (between two homes) in the [same] way as in a courtyard.   ",
            "[In the case of] one who nullified his rights and then carried where he had nullified his rights: If he transported volitionally, such a one surely forbade [the others from using that domain], for he did not stand by his nullification. But if he transported inadvertently, he does not forbid them, as he surely stood by his nullification. To what are these words applicable? [When] the ones to whom he nullified [his rights] did not precede him and take possession. But if they preceded him and took possession, [in that] they transported [there]; if he subsequently [also] transported — whether inadvertently or volitionally — he does not forbid them [from using it].",
            "[In a case of] two houses on two sides of a public domain that gentiles encircled [with a] partition on Shabbat: They may not nullify the rights of the one to the other, since it was impossible for them to make an <i>eruv</i> yesterday. [In a case of] one of the residents of the courtyard who dies and leaves his rights to someone from the marketplace (who is not from the courtyard): If he died while it was still day (before Shabbat), the inheritor who is not from the residents of the courtyard forbids [it] to them. But if he died from when it got dark, he does not forbid it  to them. And [in the case of] one from the marketplace who dies and leaves his rights [that he owns in the courtyard] to one of the residents of the courtyard: If he dies while it is still day, he does not forbid them — for they are all [participating in the] <i>eruv</i>. But if he died from when it got dark, he forbids them until the one who inherits it nullifies his rights to them.",
            "[In the case of] an Israelite and a convert (with no inheritors) who were dwelling in a cave and the convert died while it was still day: Even though another Israelite did not take possession of his possessions until after it got dark, this one that takes possession surely forbids [it] until he nullifies [his rights] — since he is surely like an inheritor. But if the convert dies from when it got dark — even though the other Israelite took possession of his property, he does not forbid [it]. Rather it stands in its original permissibility. ",
            "[In a case of] an Israelite who lives in a courtyard with an idolater or a resident alien: [The latter] does not forbid [it] to him — as the residence of an idolater is not [considered] residence, but is rather considered like an animal. But if there were two or more Israelites and an idolater living with them, he surely forbids them. And this thing is a decree, such that idolaters not dwell with them, so that they not learn from their actions. So why did [the Sages] not decree about one Israelite and one idolater? Because it is not a common thing, as he would surely be afraid, lest he be alone with him and [the idolater] kill him. And they already forbade one to be alone with an idolater. ",
            "[In the case of] two Israelites and an idolater who dwell in the same courtyard and the Israelites made an <i>eruv</i> for themselves, it is completely ineffective. And likewise, if they nullified [their rights] to the idolater or he nullified [his rights] to them or the Israelites nullified [the rights of] one to the other and they become like [the case of] one individual with an idolater, it is totally ineffective. For an <i>eruv</i> is not effective with the presence of an idolater; and nullification is [also] not effective with the presence of an idolater. And they have no solution except for them to rent his domain, such that the idolater become as if he is a guest with them. And likewise if many idolaters were renting out their domains and the Israelites made an <i>eruv</i>, they would be permitted. And one Israelite who rents from an idolater may make an <i>eruv</i> with the other Israelites, and [it thereby] becomes permitted [to] all of them. And there is no need for each one to rent [the domain] of the idolater.",
            "[In a case of] two courtyards — one behind the other — and an Israelite and an idolater were living in the inner one and another Israelite in the outer one, or the Israelite and the idolater were in the outer one and another Israelite was in the inner one: This surely forbids the outer one until he rents it from him — as the feet of the two Israelites and the idolater are [all] found there. But the [one living in] the inner one is permitted in the inner one.",
            "We may rent from the idolater even on Shabbat — as [this] rental is like the nullification of rights, which is not a full rental but only [symbolic]. Hence we rent from the idolater for even less than the value of a <i>perutah</i> (small coin). And the idolater's wife may rent [it] out without his knowledge. And likewise his worker or his butler may rent [it] out without his knowledge. And even if his worker or butler is an Israelite, he may surely rent [it] out without his knowledge. If [the Israelite] requested a place from the idolater to place his objects and he lent [it] to him, he is a partner in his property and may rent it out without his knowledge. If this idolater had many workers or butlers or wives, it is enough for [the Israelite] to rent it from one of them. ",
            "[In a case of] two Israelites and an idolater living in one courtyard and [the Israelites] rented [the rights] from the idolater on Shabbat — one may subsequently nullify his rights to the other and [it becomes] permissible. And likewise if the idolater dies on Shabbat, the [one] Israelite may nullify [his rights] to the other Israelite, and it becomes permissible to carry. ",
            "[In the case of] an idolater that rented out to an idolater: If the first is not able to evict the second idolater until the period of his rental is completed, we rent from this second idolater — as he comes in place of the owners. But if the first has the right to evict the renting idolater from it at any time he wants — if the second one was not present and the Israelites rented it from the first, they are surely permitted [to carry].",
            "[In a case of a] courtyard in which Israelites and idolaters dwell and there were windows opening from the house of this Israelite to the house of that Israelite and they made an <i>eruv</i> through the windows: Even thought they are permitted to transport from one house to [the other] house through the windows, they are surely prohibited from transporting from one house to [the other] house through the entrances — until they rent [the rights of the idolater] — on account of [the presence of] the idolater. As the many do not become like an individual in the presence of an idolater.",
            "An Israelite who publicly profanes Shabbat or worships idolatry is surely like an idolater in every matter. So we may not make an <i>eruv</i> with him and he may not nullify his rights. Rather we rent from him, like [with] an idolater. But if they were from the heretics that do not worship idolatry and do not profane Shabbat — like the Sadducees and Boethusians and all of those that deny the Oral Law — the principle of the matter is [that] we do not make an <i>eruv</i> with anyone who does not concede about the commandment of <i>eruv</i>, since he does not concede about the <i>eruv</i>. And we [also] do not rent from him since he is not like an idolater. But he may nullify his rights to a proper Israelite, and this is the solution for him.

But rather even if he came down from the attic to walk to that place — but before he could go out of the courtyard entrance, he was brought back by his friend — this one surely started [his journey] and acquired the resting. And anyone who acquires resting from a distant place need not say, \"My resting is in place x.\" Rather once he has decided [it] in his heart and started [even] the smallest [distance] on the journey, he acquired his resting there. And there is no need to say [that] one who [actually] went out with his feet and stood on the place in which he acquires resting does not need to say anything.

For we do not make two <i>eruv</i>s for one day. [If] one erred and made [two] <i>eruv</i>s in two directions [because] he imagined that we make <i>eruv</i>s in two directions; or he said to two people, \"Go out and make an <i>eruv</i> for me,\" [and] one made an <i>eruv</i> for him in the north and one made an <i>eruv</i> for him in the south — he may [only] walk like the feet of both (the area that is within the limits of both <i>eruv</i>s).",

            "The same as it is forbidden to go beyond the Sabbath limits on the Sabbath, so it is forbidden to go beyond these limits on a holyday and on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, and in the same way that one who transports from one domain to [another] on Shabbat is liable, so too is one who transports from one domain to [another] on Yom Kippur liable, but on a holyday it is permissible to transfer objects from one domain to another. Accordingly, we must lay an <i>eruv</i> for courts and form a <i>cooperative eruv</i> for alleys for <i>Yom Kippur</i> as well as for the Sabbath, and we must prepare an <i>eruv</i> for Sabbath limits for <i>Yom Kippur</i> and for holydays just as it is required for the Sabbath.",
            "If a holyday occurs on the day before or after the Sabbath, or in the Diaspora where two days are observed instead of the one, a person may deposit two <i>eruv</i> symbols in two different directions, relying on whichever of the two he pleases on the first day, and upon the second <i>eruv</i> on the second day. Or he may make one <i>eruv</i> in one direction and rely upon it for one of the two days; and on the second day be like the residents of the city — as if he did not make an <i>eruv</i> — and he will have two thousand ells in every direction [from the edge of the city]. This applies only to the two Diaspora holydays. The two days of <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, however, are considered as a single day, and only one <i>eruv</i> symbol in one direction is sufficient for both days.",
            "And likewise one may stipulate about his <i>eruv</i> and say, \"My <i>eruv</i> is for this Shabbat but not for another Shabbat,\" or \"for another Shabbat but not for this Shabbat\"; \"for Shabbats but not for holidays\"; \"for holidays but not for Shabbats.\"",

[This is because] there is [retroactive] clarification [about] something that is from the words of the Scribes (rabbinic). And likewise one who makes an <i>eruv</i> for the Shabbats of the whole year and said, \"If I want, I will go [out]; if I do not want, I will not go [out], but I will rather be like the residents of the city\" — may go out any Shabbat that he wants, even though he [decides] from when it got dark.",

How does he do [it]? He brings it on the eve of the holiday or of the Shabbat and waits with it until dark and takes it in his hand and goes back — if it is the night of a holiday (on which carrying is permitted). And on the morrow, he takes it to the same place and leaves it there until dark and eats it if it was Shabbat night; or takes it with him if it is a holiday. [This is] because the [two days] are two [separate periods of] holiness and are not [considered to be] one day, such that we could say that he acquired the <i>eruv</i> from the first night for both days. ",
            "[If] the <i>eruv</i> was eaten on the first day, he acquired the <i>eruv</i> for the first day; but there is no <i>eruv</i> for the second day. [If] he made the <i>eruv</i>with his feet on the first day, he needs to make [it] with his feet on the second day — this being, walking to the place and standing there, and thinking in his heart that he acquires his resting there. [If] he made the <i>eruv</i> with bread on the first day: If he wants to make it with his feet the second day, it is surely an <i>eruv</i>. But if he wants to make the <i>eruv</i> with bread [the second day], he needs to make the <i>eruv</i> with the same exact bread with which he made the <i>eruv</i> the first day. ",

But if it is impossible for him to get to the <i>eruv</i> of the second day on the first day, the second <i>eruv</i> is not an <i>eruv</i>. [This is] because the commandment [of the <i>eruv</i>] is that it should be within a meal that is fit while it is still day. And [in] this [case] — because he can not get to this <i>eruv</i> on the first day — it is surely not fit while it is still day. ",
            "How is this? See that when he placed the <i>eruv</i> a distance of two thousand cubits to the east of his house and relied upon it for the first day; and placed the second <i>eruv</i> a distance of one, one hundred or one thousand ells west [of his house] and relied upon it for the second day — this second [<i>eruv</i>] is not an <i>eruv</i>. For on the first day, the second <i>eruv</i> was surely not fit for him while it was still day because he is not able to get to it — as he has no [allotment] left to the west at all. ",
            "But if he placed his <i>eruv</i> one thousand five hundred ells east of his house and relied upon it for the first day; and placed a second <i>eruv</i> within five hundred ells west of his house and relied upon it for the second day — it is surely an <i>eruv</i>.

            "If a holyday occurs on Friday, one must not prepare an <i>eruv</i> for courtyards nor for Sabbath limits on that day, but must do so on Thursday which is the day preceding the festival. If the two Diaspora holydays occur on Thursday and Friday, the <i>eruv</i> for Sabbath limits and the <i>eruv</i> for courtyards should be deposited on Wednesday. But if he forgot and did not make an <i>eruv</i>, this one may surely make a courtyard <i>eruv</i> on Thursday and Friday and stipulates (see below); but [he may] not [make a perimeter <i>eruv</i>.",
            "How does he stipulate [this condition]? He says on Thursday, \"If today is a holiday, my words [making an <i>eruv</i>] lack substance; but if not, this is surely an <i>eruv</i>.\" And on the morrow, he makes an <i>eruv</i> again and says, \"If today is a holiday, I already made an <i>eruv</i> yesterday and my words today lack substance; but if yesterday was a holiday, this is surely an <i>eruv</i>.\" To what are these words applicable? On the two days of a holiday in the Diaspora; but the two holy days of Rosh Hashanah are surely [considered to be] one day — so he may only make an <i>eruv</i> for them on the eve of the holiday. ",
