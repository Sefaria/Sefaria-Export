            "Anyone who volitionally eats a <i>kazayit</i> (the size of a large olive) of <i>chamets</i> (leavened foods) on Passover - from the beginning of the night of the 15th until the end of the day of the 21st of Nissan is liable for excision - as it is stated (Exodus 12:15), \"for anyone who eats <i>chamets</i>, [that soul] will be cut off.\" Inadvertently - one is liable for a fixed sin-offering. It is the same [for] one who eats [it] and one who liquefies [it] and drinks [it]. ",
            "It is forbidden to derive benefit [from] <i>chamets</i> on Passover. As it is stated (Exodus 13:3), \"no <i>chamets</i> shall be eaten\" - there shall be no dispensation for eating it. And one who leaves <i>chamets</i> in his domain on Passover - even though he did not eat it - transgresses two commandments, as it is stated (Exodus 13:7; Deuteronomy 16:4) \"leaven shall not be seen in all of your border\"; and as it is stated (Exodus 12:19) \"leaven shall not be found in your houses.\" And the prohibition of <i>chamets</i> and the prohibition of leaven with which we rise [foods] is the same.",
            "One is not lashed [from Torah writ] on account of \"[it] shall not be found, [it] shall not be seen,\" unless he bought <i>chamets</i> on Passover or he made it rise - in order that he do an act upon it. But if he had <i>chamets</i> from before Passover; and [when] Passover came, he did not destroy it but rather left it in his domain, he is not lashed from Torah writ - even though he transgressed two negative commandments - since he did not do an act. However we strike him with lashes for rebellion.",
            "It is forbidden to derive benefit forever from <i>chamets</i> [under Jewish ownership] over which Passover transpired. This is a penalty from the words of the Scribes (rabbinic), since one violated [the prohibition of  \"it] shall not be found, [it] shall not be seen.\" They forbade it even if one left it inadvertently or under duress, so that no one would leave <i>chamets</i> on Passover in his domain in order that he would benefit from it after Passover. ",
            "<i>Chamets</i> that became mixed with something else in the middle of Passover - whether with its own type [of food] or with other types - is certainly forbidden [from] a minimal amount. Even though <i>chamets</i> of an Israelite over which Passover transpired is forbidden to derive benefit from, if it became mixed  - whether with its own type [of food] or with other types - it is surely permitted to eat it after Passover. As [the Sages] only penalized and forbade <i>chamets</i> itself. But a mixture is permissible to eat after Passover.",
            "We are not liable for excision except for eating actual <i>chamets</i>. But [in a case of] a mixture of <i>chamets</i>, such as Babylonian <i>kutach</i> and Medean beer and that which is similar to them of things with which <i>chamets</i> is mixed: If he ate them on Passover, he is lashed - but there is no excision for it - as it is stated (Exodus 12:20), \"You shall eat nothing leavened.\" To what are these words applicable? When he ate a <i>kazayit</i> of <i>chamets</i> in the mixture within enough [time] to eat three eggs - that is when he is lashed from Torah writ. But if there is not a <i>kazayit</i> of <i>chamets</i> in the mixture [to be eaten] within enough [time] to eat three eggs - even though it it is forbidden to eat it - if he ate it, he is not lashed [from Torah writ]. Nonetheless we strike him with lashes for rebellion.",
            "[In the case of] one who eats a minimal amount of actual <i>chamets</i> on Passover: It is surely forbidden from Torah writ, as it is stated (Exodus 13:3), \"no [<i>chamets</i>] shall be eaten.\" Nevertheless, he is not liable for excision or a sacrifice except with [its] requisite amount, which is a <i>kazayit</i>. But we [do] strike  one who volitionally eats less than a <i>kazayit</i> with lashes for rebellion.",
            "It is forbidden to eat <i>chamets</i> on the fourteenth from midday - which is the beginning of the seventh hour of the day (if the day is divided into twelve hours) - and onward. And anyone that eats [it] at that time is lashed by Torah writ, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 16:3), \"You shall not eat <i>chamets</i> upon it\" - meaning to say, upon the Passover sacrifice. Thus did they learn the explanation of this thing from the oral tradition: \"You shall not eat <i>chamets</i>\" from the time that is fit for the sacrifice of the Passover sacrifice, which is in \"the afternoon\" (Exodus 12:6) - and that is half the day.",
            "And the Sages forbade eating <i>chamets</i> from the beginning of the sixth hour so that one not touch a Torah prohibition. So from the beginning of the sixth hour, <i>chamets</i> will be forbidden for eating and benefit the whole sixth hour from the words of the Scribes (rabbinically); and the rest of the day from the seventh hour and onward from Torah writ. [In addition], we may not eat <i>chamets</i> in the fifth hour, [as a] decree on account of a cloudy day lest he mistake the sixth hour [for] the fifth hour. But it is not forbidden for benefit in the fifth hour. Hence we suspend priestly tithe and thanksgiving bread and that which is similar to them of <i>chamets</i> which is consecrated - we neither eat [it], nor burn [it] until the sixth hour arrives and we burn it [then].",
            "Behold you have learned that it is permissible to eat <i>chamets</i> on the fourteenth until the end of the fourth hour. And we may not eat [it] in the fifth hour [either], but we may benefit from it. And we strike one who eats it during the sixth hour with lashes for rebellion. And one who eats [it] from the beginning of the seventh hour is lashed (from Torah writ)."

            "The Torah commands us to put away the <i>ḥametz</i> before the time when it is forbidden to eat it, as it is written: \"On the first day you shall put away leaven out of your houses\" (Exodus 12:15); according to the traditional interpretation, the <i>first day</i> in this verse refers to the fourteenth of <i>Nisan</i>. This is obvious from what is written in the Torah: \"You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven\" (Exodus 34:25), which means: \"You shall not slaughter the paschal lamb while leavened bread still exists\"; the time for slaughtering the paschal lamb is the afternoon of the fourteenth day of <i>Nisan</i>.",
            "What is meant by the biblical term <i>putting away</i>? It means that one should regard the <i>ḥametz</i> as nonexistent or as mere dust of the earth, impressing on his mind that he has no <i>ḥametz</i> in his possession and that all the <i>ḥametz</i> in his possession is equivalent to dust or something entirely useless.",
            "By rabbinic enactment, one must search for <i>ḥametz</i> in hiding-places and holes, and remove it from his entire domain. Also, by rabbinic enactment, one should search and remove the <i>ḥametz</i> by lamplight at night, at the beginning of the night preceding the fourteenth day of <i>Nisan</i>, because all the people are then at home and lamplight is best for searching. And we do not fix study at the end of the thirteenth day [of Nissan]. And likewise should a sage not begin to read at that time, lest he be drawn [by it] and be prevented from searching for <i>chamets</i> at the beginning of its time. ",
            " 4 We do not search by the light of the moon, nor by the light of the sun nor by the light of a torch, but rather by the light of a lamp. To what are these words applicable? To holes and hiding places. But if one searched in a veranda - the light in which is great - by the light of the sun, it is enough for it. And the middle of a courtyard does not need searching, since birds are common there; and they eat all of the <i>chamets</i> that one drops there. ",
            "[In a case of] a hole in the middle of a house [wall] that is between a person and his fellow: This one searches until the place that his hand reaches, and that one searches until the place that his hand reaches. And one [then] nullifies the rest in his heart. But [in a case of] a hole between an Israelite and and an idolater: He does not search at all, lest the idolater say, \"He is doing magic on me.\" Rather he should nullify [the <i>chamets</i>] in his heart, and that is enough for it. And any place in which we do not introduce <i>chamets</i> does not require searching. ",
            "The upper and lower holes of [the walls of] a house, [as well as] a balcony roof, a cowshed, chicken coops, a storehouse for straw, a wine cellar or a storeroom for oil from which one does not supply [wine or oil during the meal] and a storage room for large fish do not require searching unless one introduced <i>chamets</i> into them. But a beer cellar, a wine cellar or a storeroom for oil from which one does supply [wine or oil during the meal], a storage room for small fish, a wood storage room, a storage room for brine, the middle holes of [the walls of] a house and that which is similar to them require searching. For their usual [way] is that we introduce <i>chamets</i> in them. But if one knows with certainty that he did not introduce <i>chamets</i> there, it does not require searching. And when one searches a wine cellar, he searches the two outer rows - which are the top one and the one below it.",
            "We do not concern ourselves lest a weasel dragged <i>chamets</i> to a place in which we do not introduce <i>chamets</i>. For if we concern ourselves from [one] house to [another], we will concern ourselves from [one] city to [another] and [then] there is no end to the matter. If one searched on the fourteenth, and [then] left ten loaves but only found nine - such a one must surely concern himself and needs to search a second time. For surely [in this case] a weasel or mouse certainly dragged it.",
            "And likewise, if after searching, one saw a mouse that entered the house and it had <i>chamets</i> in its mouth, he needs to search a second time. Even though he found crumbs in the middle of his house, we do not say, \"It already ate the bread in this place; and see, these are the crumbs [from that].\" Rather we are concerned lest it placed it in a hole or a window and these crumbs were there [from before]. Hence one must search again. And if he does not find anything, he must search all of the house. But if he found that bread that the mouse took and brought in, it does not require [any more] searching.",
            "[In a case of] one who saw an infant entering a house and there was a loaf [of bread] in his hand; and he entered behind him and found crumbs: [It] does not require searching. For there is a presumption that [the infant] ate it, and these are the crumbs that fell from it at the time of the eating. As it is the way of an infant to scatter crumbs at the time of eating, but it is not the way of a mouse to scatter [crumbs]. However if he did not find crumbs at all, he needs to search.",
            "[If] one left nine piles of matsa and one pile of <i>chamets</i> and a mouse came and took [from one], but we did not know if it took from the <i>chamets</i> or the matsa and brought it into the house [that was already] searched - he needs to search. For any [mixture that is] fixed (like these piles) is considered like half and half (and since it is considered as if there is no majority, we may not assume that it came from the majority, i.e. the nine piles).",
            "[In a case of] two piles, one of which is of <i>chamets</i> and the other of which is matsa, and two houses, one of which was searched and one of which was not searched - and two mice came, one taking <i>chamets</i> and one taking matsa, and it is not known which house the one that took <i>chamets</i> entered; and likewise two houses that are searched and there was one pile of <i>chamets</i> and a mouse came and took it and it is not known into which house he went; or [if] one knew that he went into one of them and he entered behind it, but when he searched, he did not find anything, or he found a loaf; or there were nine piles of matsa and one of <i>chamets</i> and one loaf got displaced from one of them, and it was not known if it was <i>chamets</i> or matsa, and a mouse took the loaf that was displaced and went into the house that was searched: In all of these cases he does not need to search a second time. [In the last case, the reason is] that there is nothing fixed (see the end of the previous law).",
            "[If] one left <i>chamets</i> in this corner and he found it in a different corner; or he left nine loaves and found ten; or a mouse came and took the <i>chamets</i>, but there is a doubt if it went into this house or did not go in: In all of these [cases], he needs to search.",
            "[If] a mouse entered a house and there was a loaf in its mouth, and [then] a mouse left from there and there was a loaf in its mouth - we say it is the first one that entered [and] it is the last one that left (it is one and the same); so one does not need to search. If the first one that entered was black, and this one that left was white, he needs to search. [If] a mouse entered and there was a loaf in its mouth, and [then] a weasel left from there and there was a loaf in its mouth, one needs to search. [If] a weasel came out from there and there was a mouse and a loaf in its mouth, he does not need to search - as this is the loaf that was in the mouth of the mouse. [If] a snake entered a hole and there was bread in its mouth, one is not obligated to bring a snake charmer to bring it out.",
            "[In a case of] a <i>kazayit</i> of <i>chamets</i> in a high beam, we obligate [its owner] to bring a ladder to take it down. For sometimes it will fall from the high beam. [If] the <i>chamets</i> was in a pit, we do not obligate him to bring it up. Rather, he may nullify it in his heart; and that is enough for it.",
            "[In a case of] a mass of (hardened) leaven that one designated for the purpose of sitting upon it: If he plastered its surface with plaster, it is surely nullified - so it is permissible to keep it. [In a case of] dough in a kneading trough: If there is a <i>kazayit</i> in one place, he is obligated to destroy [them]. But if not - if it was made to strengthen the shards of the trough with it or to seal a hole with it, it is nullified due to its insignificance. But if not, he is obligated to destroy [it. If] there were two halves of a <i>kazayit</i> in two places and a string of dough between them: We look at it all; such that if the string were to be picked up, they would be picked up with it - he is obligated to destroy [it]. But if not, he does not need to destroy [it].",
            "To what are these words applicable? To a kneading trough. But in a house - even though if the string were to be picked up, they would not be picked up with it - he is obligated to destroy [it]. For sometimes, he collects them [together. If] half a <i>kazayit</i> was in the house and half a <i>kazayit</i> was in the attic; half a <i>kazayit</i> was in the house and half a <i>kazayit</i> was in the veranda; half a <i>kazayit</i> was in this house and half a <i>kazayit</i> was in a house behind it - since these halves of a <i>kazayit</i> are stuck to the walls or in the beams or on the floors, he is not obligated to destroy [them]. Rather he may nullify [them] in his heart and that is enough for it.",
            "[In a case of] one who rents a house without specification on the fourteenth: It is surely with a presumption that it is searched, so he does not have to search [it]. But if this [owner] was presumed not to have searched it and a woman or a minor said, \"We checked it\" - these are surely believed. For all are believed about the destruction of <i>chamets</i>; and all are fit for searching - even women, slaves and minors. And that is so long as the minor has the intelligence to search. ",
            "[In a case of] one who rents out his house to his fellow: If the fourteenth [of Nissan] came out when he had not [yet] given over the key, it is up to the [owner] to search. But if the fourteenth came out from when he had [already] given over the key, it is up to the renter to search. [In a case of] one who rents a house with the presumption that it is searched and it comes out that it is not searched: It is up to the renter to search; and it is not a mistaken sale (such that he could annul the agreement) - even in a place where [people] are hired to search - for it is surely a commandment that he is doing.",
            "[In a case of] one who sets out on the sea or one who goes out with a caravan: [If] it is within thirty days [of Passover], he is obligated to search; before thirty days, he does not need to search. But if he has in mind to return before Passover, he needs to search, and he may then go out - lest he return on the eve of Passover at twilight and not have time to destroy [the <i>chamets</i> there]. However if he does not have in mind to return [by then], he does not need to search. And likewise, one who makes his house into a storehouse: [If] it is within thirty days, he is required to search, and he may then move his storage into it; before thirty days - if he has in mind to clear it before Passover, he needs to search [it] and he may then make it into a storehouse. But if he does not have in mind to clear it before Passover, he does not need to search. "

            "When one checks and seeks out the <i>chametz</i> on the night of the fourteenth [of Nissan], he removes it from the holes and the hiding places and the corners; and he gathers all of it and places it in one place until the beginning of the sixth hour and destroys it [then]. And if he wants to destroy it on the night of the fourteenth, he may destroy it.",
            "[Regarding] the <i>chametz</i> that one leaves over on the night of the fourteenth in order that he will eat from it on the morrow until four hours - he should not leave it 'scattered and asunder' in every place. Rather he should store it in a vessel or a known corner and be careful about it. For if he is not careful with it and finds it missing, he needs to seek after it and and to search another time, lest the mice dragged it [around].",
            "If the fourteenth fell out to be on Shabbat, we search for <i>chametz</i> on the night of the eve of Shabbat, which is the night of the thirteenth. And one leaves enough from the <i>chametz</i> to eat of it until four hours on Shabbat day and leaves it in a sheltered place; and he destroys the rest from before Shabbat. And if there is <i>chametz</i> left over on Shabbat day, one nullifies it and turns a vessel over it until the conclusion of the first holiday, and he destroys it [then].",
            "[In a case in which] one has many loaves of priestly tithe and needs to burn it on the eve of Shabbat: He may not mix the pure with the impure and burn [them together]. Rather he must burn the impure by itself, the pure by itself and the suspended by itself. And he should only leave enough of the pure [tithe] to eat until four hours on Shabbat day.",
            "One who forgot or was wanton, and did not search on the night of the fourteenth must search on the fourteenth in the morning. [If] he did not search in the morning, he must search at the time of the destruction [of the <i>chametz</i>. If] he did not search at the time of the destruction, he must search in the middle of the festival. [If] the holiday passed and he did not search, he must search after the festival in order to destroy what he finds of the <i>chametz</i> over which Passover transpired - since it is forbidden to benefit [from it].",
            "When one searches for <i>chametz</i> on the night of the fourteenth or the day of the fourteenth or in the middle of the festival, he should recite the blessing before he begins to search: Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments and has commanded us about destruction of <i>chametz</i>. And he searches and seeks [it] in all of the places into which we introduce <i>chametz</i>, as we have explained. But if he searches after the festival, he does not recite the blessing.",
            "And when he finishes searching - if he searched on the night of the fourteenth or on the day of the fourteenth before the sixth hour, he must nullify all of the <i>chametz</i> that remained in his possession and that he does not see. And he should say, \"All the <i>chametz</i> that is in my possession that I have not seen - behold it is like dust.\" But if he searched from the beginning of the sixth hour and onward, he is not able to nullify [it], for it is surely not in his possession - as it is already forbidden to benefit [from it].",
            "Hence if he did not nullify [it] before six [hours]; and he found <i>chametz</i> from six hours and onward that he had his mind upon and he forgot it at the time of the destruction and did not destroy it - this one has surely transgressed, \"it shall not be seen,\" and \"it shall not be found.\" For he surely did not destroy [it], nor did he nullify [it]. And nullification now does not help him at all, since [the <i>chametz</i>] is not in his possession. Yet Scripture made it as if it was in his possession, to make him liable for \"it shall not be seen,\" and \"it shall not be found.\" So he is obligated to destroy at any time that he finds it. However if he found in on the holiday, he covers it with a vessel until the evening and destroys it [then]. And if it is of consecrated [foods], he does not need to cover it with a vessel, since all separate from it [regardless].",
            "[In a case of] one who went out of his house before the time of the destruction to do a commandment or to eat at a commanded meal - such as a betrothal meal or a marriage meal - and remembered that he had <i>chametz</i> in his house: If he is able to return and destroy it and come back to his commandment, he should return. But if not, he should nullify [it] in his heart, and that is enough for it. [If] he went out to save [Jews] from a [foreign] troop, from a [flooding] river, from a fire or from the collapse [of a structure], he should [just] nullify [it] in his heart and that is enough for it. [If] he went out for his own sake and remembered that he had <i>chametz</i> in his house, he should return immediately. And [what is the minimum for which] he must return? Up to a <i>kabeitsah</i> (the size of a large egg). [If] it was less than a <i>kabeitsah</i>, he should nullify it in his heart and that is enough for it.",
            "[In a case of] one who left a kneaded dough in his house [on the festival] and went out and remembered [it] after he left; and he is [now] sitting before his teacher and is afraid lest it rise before he comes back: Such a one should surely nullify it in his heart before it leavens. But if it [already] leavened, the nullification does not help at all. Rather, he has already transgressed \"it shall not be seen,\" and \"it shall not be found.\" And he is obligated to destroy it immediately when he returns to his house.",
            "How is destruction of <i>chametz</i> [done]? One burns it, or crumbles [it] and winnows [it] in the wind. Or one throws it to the sea - but if the <i>chametz</i> is hard and the sea does not break it up quickly, he should surely crumble it and afterwards throw it to the sea. [In a case of] <i>chametz</i> upon which a collapsed [structure] collapsed and there was three or more handbreadths of [debris] found upon it: It is surely like it is destroyed. But he must [still] nullify it in his heart if the sixth hour did not yet begin. [If] he gave it to an idolater before the sixth hour, he does not need to destroy [it]. And if he burned it before the sixth hour, it is surely permissible to benefit from its coals in the middle of Passover. But if he burned it from the sixth hour and onward - since it is forbidden to benefit [from it], he surely may not feed an oven or stove with it and he may not bake with it and he many not cook. However if he did cook or bake [with it], it is forbidden to benefit from that bread or that cooked food. And likewise is it forbidden to benefit from its coals - as he burned it after it became forbidden to benefit [from it]."

            "It is written in the Torah: \"No leavened bread shall be seen with you\" (Exodus 13:7). One might suppose that a man commits no transgression if he hides the <i>ḥametz</i> or deposits it with a non-Jew; the Torah therefore says plainly: \"No leaven shall be found in your houses\" (Exodus 12:19), even if he has deposited or hidden it. Furthermore, one might suppose that a man transgresses only if the <i>ḥametz</i> is inside his house, but if it is far from his house, in the fields or in another town, he does not transgress the law; the Torah therefore says plainly: \"In all your territory\" (13:7), meaning: wherever you have control. It is possible that one is obligated to destroy <i>chamets</i> of an idolater or of consecrated food. Hence we learn to say, \"it shall not be seen with you\" (Exodus 13:7; Deuteronomy 16:4) - you may not see yours, but you may see that of others and of the Most High.",
            "See, you have learned that [regarding] <i>chamets</i> of an Israelite: If he left it in his possession - even [if] concealed, and even [if] in a different city or even [if] entrusted to the hand of an idolater - this one is surely transgressing \"it shall not be seen\" and \"it shall not be found.\" [Regarding] <i>chamets</i> that was consecrated or that belonged to an idolater and was with an Israelite  - even if it was with him in the house - it is surely permitted, because it is not his. And even if it belonged to a resident stranger over whom the hand of Israel rules, we do not force him to remove the <i>chamets</i> from his possession on Passover. But [the Jew that has it in his house] needs to make a partition ten handbreadths high in front of the  <i>chamets</i> of the idolater, lest [the Jew] come to supply from it. But consecrated [<i>chamets</i>] need not [be partitioned off], because everyone separates from consecrated [foods] in order not to come to [the prohibition of] misappropriation. ",
            "[In a case of] an idolater who deposited his <i>chamets</i> with an Israelite: If the Israelite accepted responsibility upon himself - that if it is lost or stolen, he will pay him for its value - this one is surely obligated to destroy it. Since he accepted responsibility upon himself, it became like his. But if he did not accept responsibility, it is permissible to keep it with him; and it is permissible to eat from it after Passover - as it is in the possession of the idolater.",
            "[In a case of] an extortionist idolater who deposited his <i>chamets</i> with an Israelite: If the Israelite knows that if it is lost or stolen, he will obligate him to pay [for] it and [then] force him and extort him to pay - this one is surely obligated to destroy it, even though he did not accept responsibility for it. For it is surely considered as if it is his, since the extortionist obligates him [to accept] responsibility.",

But if he did not say, \"you acquire from now\" - it comes out that that <i>chamets</i> is like a deposit with the idolater, so it is forbidden to benefit [from it] after Passover.",
            "[In a case of] an Israelite and an idolater who were coming on a ship and there was <i>chamets</i> in the hand of the Israelite and the fifth hour arrived: That one may surely sell it to the idolater or give it to him as a gift and [then] purchase it back from him after Passover.

            "If one keeps food that contains an admixture of <i>ḥametz</i> during Passover, he transgresses the prohibition against its being seen or found. For example brine, Babylonian <i>kutach</i> and Median beer, that they make from flour, and all of the edible things that are similar to them. However, if the thing containing an admixture of <i>ḥametz</i> is not edible, it is permissible to retain it during Passover.",

On all other nights we eat other vegetables; but tonight it is all bitter herbs. On all other nights we eat whether sitting or reclining; but tonight we are all reclining.\"",
            "At this time, he does not say \"tonight it is all roasted\" - since we do not have a sacrifice. And he begins with disgrace and reads until he finishes expounding all of the section, \"My father was a wandering Aramean\" (Deuteronomy 26:5).",
            "And he brings the table back in front of him and says, \"This Passover sacrifice that we are eating is for the sake of (to commemorate) that the Omnipresent passed over the homes of our ancestors in Egypt; as it is stated (Exodus 12:27), 'And you shall say, '\"It is the Passover sacrifice to the Lord, etc.\"'\" And [then] he lifts the bitter herbs in his hand and says, \"These bitter herbs that we are eating are [to commemorate] that the Egyptians embittered the lives of our ancestors in Egypt; as it is stated (Exodus 1:14), 'And they embittered their lives.'\"  And [then] he lifts the matsa in his hand and says, \"This matsa that we are eating is [to commemorate] that the dough of our ancestors did not have enough time to become leavened before the Holy One, blessed be He, revealed Himself and redeemed them immediately; as it is stated (Exodus 12:39), 'And they baked the dough that they had taken out of Egypt, etc.'\" And at this time, he says, \"The Passover sacrifice that our ancestors were eating at the time when the Temple existed is [to commemorate] that the Omnipresent passed over the homes of our ancestors, etc.\" ",
            "And [then] he says, \"Therefore we are obligated to thank, praise, laud, glorify, lavish, exalt, aggrandize and extol He who made all these miracles for our ancestors and for us: He brought us out from slavery to freedom, from sorrow to joy and from darkness to great light. And let us say before Him, Halleluyah! 'Halleluyah. Servants of the Lord, praise, etc.' (Psalms 113:1) until \"a rock to a spring of water' (Psalms 114:8).\" And he concludes, \"Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who redeemed us and redeemed our ancestors from Egypt, and brought us to this night to eat matsa and bitter herbs.\" And at this time, he adds, \"So too, Lord our God, and God of our ancestors, bring us to other appointed times and holidays that will come to greet us in peace, joyful in the building of Your city and happy in Your worship; and we should eat there from the offerings and from the Passover sacrifices, the blood of which should reach the wall of Your altar for favor, and we shall thank You with a new song upon our redemption and upon the restoration of our souls. Blessed are you, Lord, who redeemed Israel.\" And he recites the blessing, \"who creates the fruit of the vine,\" and drinks the second cup.",
            "And afterwards he recites the blessing over [washing] the hands and [washes] his hands a second time - since he removed his mind [from the first washing] at the time of the reading of the Haggadah. And he takes two [matsa] wafers, divides one of them, places the broken one inside the whole one and recites the blessing, \"who brings forth bread from the land.\" And because of what does he not recite the blessing over two [whole] loaves, as on other holidays? Because it is stated (Deuteronomy 16:3), \"bread of poverty\": Just like the way of the poor person is with a piece (and not a whole loaf), so too here is it with a piece. And afterwards he wraps the matsa and bitter herbs to be [like] one, dips it in <i>charoset</i>, recites the blessing, \"Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us about the eating of matsas and bitter herbs\" and eats them. And if he eats the matsa by itself and the bitter herbs by themselves, he recites a blessing upon this one by itself and upon that one by itself.  ",
            "And afterwards, he recites the blessing, \"Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us about eating the offering,\" and eats from the meat of the festival [offering] of the fourteenth first. And [then] he recites the blessing, \"Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us about the eating of the Passover sacrifice,\" and he eats from the body of the Passover sacrifice. And the blessing of the Passover sacrifice does not exempt that of the offering, nor does that of the offering exempt that of the Passover sacrifice.",
            "At this time when there is no sacrifice there - after he recites the blessing, \"who brings forth bread,\" he then recites the blessing, \"about the eating of matsa,\" dips the matsa in <i>charoset</i> and eats [it]. He then recites the blessing, \"about the eating of bitter herbs,\" dips the bitter herbs in <i>charoset</i> and eats [them]. And he may not keep [them for long] in the <i>charoset</i>, lest it nullifies their taste.",
            "And afterwards he continues with the meal and eats all that he wants to eat and drinks all that he wants to drink. And at the end, he eats [as little as] a <i>kazayit</i> of meat of the Passover sacrifice, and does not taste [anything] after it at all - and at this time, he eats a <i>kazayit</i> of matsa, and does not taste anything after it - in order that it will be the end of his meal and the taste of the meat of the Passover sacrifice or the matsa will be in his mouth, since eating them is the commandment. ",
            "And afterwards, he [washes] his hands and recites the Grace over the Meal over a third cup and drinks it. And afterwards, he pours a fourth cup and finishes the Hallel over it. And he recites the blessing over the song, and that is \"May all of your creatures praise you, etc.\" And he recites the blessing, \"who creates the fruit of the vine,\" [drinks it] and does not taste anything afterwards the whole night except for water. And he should pour a fifth cup and say the Great Hallel (Psalms 136) upon it, from \"Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good\" (Psalms 136:1) to \"Upon the rivers of Babylon\" (Psalms 137:1). And this cup is not obligatory like the [other] four cups. And he can finish the Hallel in any place that he desires, even though he is not in the place of the meal. ",
            "[In] a place  where they were accustomed to eat roasted meat on Passover evenings, we may eat it. [In] a place where they were accustomed not to eat [it], we may not eat it, [as a] decree lest they will say it is meat of a Passover sacrifice. And it is forbidden in every place to eat a whole roasted lamb at once on this night, since it appears like one eating consecrated foods outside [the Temple]. But if it was cut up or lacking one of its limbs or he boiled one of its limbs and it is connected, it is surely permissible in a place where they were accustomed [to eating it].",
            "One who does not have wine on Passover night can make the sanctification over bread (matsa) - in the way that he does on Shabbat - and does all of the [other] things in this order. One who does not have a vegetable besides bitter herbs alone recites two blessings on the bitter herbs at the beginning - \"about the eating of bitter herbs,\" and \"who creates the fruit of the ground\" - and eats [it]. And when he finishes the Haggadah, he recites the blessing over the matsa and eats [it]; and then eats from the bitter herbs again without a blessing.",
            "[In a case of] one who only has a <i>kazayit</i> of guarded matsa: When he finishes his meal with matsa that is not guarded, he recites the blessing, \"on the eating of matsa,\" eats that <i>kazayit</i>, and does not taste [anything] after it at all.  ",
            "One who slept in the middle of the meal and awoke may not eat again. [If only] some members of a grouping slept in the middle of the meal, they may eat again. [If] they all fell asleep and awoke, they may not eat. [If] they all nodded off, they may eat.",

            "The text of the Haggadah which Israel is accustomed [to use] at the time of the Exile is like this: He begins over the second cup and says:",
            "We left Egypt in frenzy. This is the bread of poverty that our ancestors ate in the land of Egypt. Anyone who is famished should come and eat; anyone who is in need to have the Passover sacrifice should come and partake of the Passover sacrifice. Now we are here, next year we will be in the Land of Israel; this year we are slaves, the year that is coming we will be free people.",

On all other nights we eat whether sitting or reclining; but tonight we are all reclining",
            "We were slaves to Pharaoh in the Land of Egypt. And the Lord, our God, took us out from there with a strong hand and an outstretched forearm. And if the Holy One, blessed be He, had not taken our ancestors from Egypt, we and our children and our children's children would [all] be enslaved to Pharaoh in Egypt. And even if we were all sages, all discerning, all elders, all knowledgeable about the Torah, it would [still] be a commandment upon us to tell the story of the exodus from Egypt. And anyone who speaks at length about the exodus from Egypt, behold he is praiseworthy.",
            "It happened once [on Passover] that Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Yehoshua, Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah, Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Tarfon were reclining in Bnei Brak and were telling the story of the exodus from Egypt that whole night, until their students came and said to them, \"The time of reciting the morning Shema has arrived.\"",
            "Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah said to them, \"Behold I am like a man of seventy years and I have not merited [to understand why] the exodus from Egypt should be said at night until Ben Zoma expounded it, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 16:3), 'In order that you remember the day of your going out from the land of Egypt all the days of your life' - 'the days of your life' [indicates that the remembrance be invoked during] the days; 'all the days of your life' [indicates that the remembrance be invoked also during] the nights.\" But the Sages say, \"'The days of your life' [indicates that the remembrance be invoked in] this world, 'all the days of your life' [indicates that the remembrance be invoked also in] the days of the Messiah.\"",
            "Blessed be the Place [of all], Blessed be He; Blessed be the One who Gave the Torah to His people Israel, Blessed be He. Corresponding to four sons did the Torah speak; one [who is] wise, one [who is] evil, one who is innocent and one who doesn't know to ask.",
            "What does the wise [son] say? \"'What are these testimonies, statutes and judgments that the Lord our God commanded you?'

            "What does the evil [son] say? \"'What is this worship to you?' (Exodus 12:26)\" 'To you' and not 'to him.' And since he excluded himself from the collective, he denied a principle [of the Jewish faith]. And accordingly, you will blunt his teeth and say to him, \"'For the sake of this did the Lord do [this] for me in my going out of Egypt' (Exodus 13:8).\" 'For me' and not 'for him.' And if he had been there, he would not have been saved.",
            "What does the innocent [son] say? \"What is this?\" (Exodus 13:14) And you will say to him, \"'With the strength of [His] hand did the Lord take us out from Egypt, from the house of slaves' (Exodus 13:14).'\"",
            "And [regarding] the one who doesn't know to ask, you will open [the conversation] for him.

            "From the beginning, our ancestors were idol worshipers. And now, the Place [of all] has brought us close to His worship, as it is stated (Joshua 24:2-4), \"Joshua said to the whole people, so said the Lord, God of Israel, 'Over the river did your ancestors dwell from always, Terach the father of Abraham and the father of Nachor, and they worshiped other gods. And I took your father, Abraham, from over the river and I made him walk in all the land of Canaan and I increased his seed and I gave him Isaac.

            "Blessed be the One who keeps His promise to Israel, blessed be He; since the Holy One, blessed be He, calculates the end [of the exile,] to do as He said to Abraham, our father, in the Covenant between the Pieces; as it is stated (Genesis 15:13-14), \"And He said to Abram, 'you should surely know that your seed will be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and they will enslave them and afflict them four hundred years.

Go out and learn what Laban the Aramean sought to do to Jacob, our father; since Pharaoh only decreed [the death sentence] on the males, but Laban sought to uproot the whole [people]. As it is stated (Deuteronomy 26:5), \"An Aramean was destroying my father; so he went down to Egypt and resided there\" - [this] teaches that Ya'akov, our father, didn't go down to settle in Egypt, but rather [only] to reside there, as it is stated (Genesis 47:4), \"And they said to Pharaoh, 'To reside in the land have we come, since there is not enough pasture for your servant's flocks, since the famine is heavy in the land of Canaan, and now please grant that your servants should dwell in the Land of Goshen.'\"",
            "\"As a small number\" - as it is stated (Deuteronomy 10:22), \"With seventy souls did your ancestors come down to Egypt, and now the Lord, your God, has made you as numerous as the stars of the sky.\"",
            "\"And he became there a nation\" - [this] teaches that Israel [became] distinguishable there. \"Great, powerful\" - as it is stated (Exodus 1:7), \"And the Children of Israel multiplied and swarmed and grew numerous and strong, most exceedingly and the land became full of them.\"",
            "\"And numerous\" - as it is stated (Ezekiel 16:7), \"I have given you to be numerous as the vegetation of the field, and you increased and grew and became highly ornamented, your breasts were set and your hair grew, but you were naked and barren;\" \"And I passed over you and I saw you wallowing in your blood, and I said to you, 'You shall live in your blood,' and I said to you, 'You shall live in your blood'\" (Ezekiel 16:6).",

            "\"And afflicted us\" - as is is stated (Exodus 1:11); \"And they placed upon him leaders over the work-tax in order to afflict them with their burdens; and they built storage cities, Pitom and Ra'amses.\"",

            "\"And we cried out to the Lord, the God of our ancestors\" - as it is stated (Exodus 2:23); \"And it was in those great days that the king of Egypt died and the Children of Israel sighed from the work and yelled out; and their supplication went up to God from the work.\"",
            "\"And the Lord heard our voice\" - as it is stated (Exodus 2:24); \"And God heard their groans and God remembered His covenant with Abraham and with Isaac and with Jacob.\"",
            "\"And He saw our affliction\" - this [refers to] the separation from the way of the world, as it is stated (Exodus 2:25); \"And God saw the Children of Israel and God knew.\"",
            "\"And our toil\" - this [refers to the killing of the] sons, as it is stated (Exodus 1:24); \"Every boy that is born, throw him into the Nile; and every girl you shall keep alive.\"",
            "\"And our duress\" - this [refers to] the pressure, as it is stated (Exodus 3:9); \"And I also saw the duress that the Egyptians are applying on them.\"",
            "\"And the Lord took us out of Egypt\" - not through an angel and not through a seraph and not through a messenger, but [directly by] the Holy One, blessed be He, in His glory, as it is stated (Exodus 12:12); \"And I will pass through the Land of Egypt on that night and I will smite every firstborn in the Land of Egypt, from men to animals; and with all the gods of Egypt, I will make judgments, I am the Lord.\"",
            "\"With a strong hand\" - this [refers to] the pestilence, as it is stated (Exodus 9:3); \"Behold the hand of the Lord is upon your herds that are in the field, upon the horses, upon the donkeys, upon the camels, upon the cattle and upon the flocks, [there will be] a very heavy pestilence.\"",
            "\"And with an outstretched forearm\" - this [refers to] the sword, as it is stated (I Chronicles 21:16); \"And his sword was drawn in his hand, leaning over Jerusalem.\"",
            "\"And with great awe\" - this [refers to the revelation of] the Divine Presence, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 4:34), \"Or did God try to take for Himself a nation from within a nation with enigmas, with signs and with wonders and with war and with a strong hand and with an outstretched forearm and with great and awesome acts, like all that the Lord, your God, did for you in Egypt in front of your eyes?\"",
            "\"And with signs\" - this [refers to] the staff, as it is stated (Exodus 4:17); \"And this staff you shall take in your hand, that with it you will preform signs.\"",
            "\"And with wonders\" - this [refers to] the blood, as it is stated (Joel 3:3); \"And I will place my wonders in the skies and in the earth; blood and fire and pillars of smoke.\"",
            "Another explanation: \"With a strong hand\" [corresponds to] two [plagues]; \"and with an outstretched forearm\" [corresponds to] two [plagues]; \"and with great awe\" [corresponds to] two [plagues]; \"and with signs\" [corresponds to] two [plagues]; \"and with wonders\" [corresponds to] two [plagues].

            "This matsa that we are eating, for the sake of what [is it]? For the sake [to commemorate] that our ancestors' dough did not have time to become leavened before the King of the kings of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, revealed [Himself] to them and redeemed them, as it is stated (Exodus 12:39); \"And they baked the dough which they brought out of Egypt into matsa cakes, since it did not rise; because they were expelled from Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they made for themselves provisions.\"",
            "These bitter herbs that we are eating, for the sake of what [is it]? For the sake [to commemorate] that the Egyptians embittered the lives of our ancestors in Egypt, as it is stated (Exodus 1:14); \"And they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field; in all their service, wherein they made them serve with rigor.\"",
