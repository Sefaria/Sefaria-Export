            "Anyone who volitionally eats a <i>kazayit</i> (the size of a large olive) of <i>chamets</i> (leavened foods) on Passover - from the beginning of the night of the 15th until the end of the day of the 21st of Nissan is liable for excision - as it is stated (Exodus 12:15), \"for anyone who eats <i>chamets</i>, [that soul] will be cut off.\" Inadvertently - one is liable for a fixed sin-offering. It is the same [for] one who eats [it] and one who liquefies [it] and drinks [it]. ",
            "It is forbidden to derive benefit [from] <i>chamets</i> on Passover. As it is stated (Exodus 13:3), \"no <i>chamets</i> shall be eaten\" - there shall be no dispensation for eating it. And one who leaves <i>chamets</i> in his domain on Passover - even though he did not eat it - transgresses two commandments, as it is stated (Exodus 13:7; Deuteronomy 16:4) \"leaven shall not be seen in all of your border\"; and as it is stated (Exodus 12:19) \"leaven shall not be found in your houses.\" And the prohibition of <i>chamets</i> and the prohibition of leaven with which we rise [foods] is the same.",
            "One is not lashed [from Torah writ] on account of \"[it] shall not be found, [it] shall not be seen,\" unless he bought <i>chamets</i> on Passover or he made it rise - in order that he do an act upon it. But if he had <i>chamets</i> from before Passover; and [when] Passover came, he did not destroy it but rather left it in his domain, he is not lashed from Torah writ - even though he transgressed two negative commandments - since he did not do an act. However we strike him with lashes for rebellion.",
            "It is forbidden to derive benefit forever from <i>chamets</i> [under Jewish ownership] over which Passover transpired. This is a penalty from the words of the Scribes (rabbinic), since one violated [the prohibition of  \"it] shall not be found, [it] shall not be seen.\" They forbade it even if one left it inadvertently or under duress, so that no one would leave <i>chamets</i> on Passover in his domain in order that he would benefit from it after Passover. ",
            "<i>Chamets</i> that became mixed with something else in the middle of Passover - whether with its own type [of food] or with other types - is certainly forbidden [from] a minimal amount. Even though <i>chamets</i> of an Israelite over which Passover transpired is forbidden to derive benefit from, if it became mixed  - whether with its own type [of food] or with other types - it is surely permitted to eat it after Passover. As [the Sages] only penalized and forbade <i>chamets</i> itself. But a mixture is permissible to eat after Passover.",
            "We are not liable for excision except for eating actual <i>chamets</i>. But [in a case of] a mixture of <i>chamets</i>, such as Babylonian <i>kutach</i> and Medean beer and that which is similar to them of things with which <i>chamets</i> is mixed: If he ate them on Passover, he is lashed - but there is no excision for it - as it is stated (Exodus 12:20), \"You shall eat nothing leavened.\" To what are these words applicable? When he ate a <i>kazayit</i> of <i>chamets</i> in the mixture within enough [time] to eat three eggs - that is when he is lashed from Torah writ. But if there is not a <i>kazayit</i> of <i>chamets</i> in the mixture [to be eaten] within enough [time] to eat three eggs - even though it it is forbidden to eat it - if he ate it, he is not lashed [from Torah writ]. Nonetheless we strike him with lashes for rebellion.",

But we [do] strike  one who volitionally eats less than a <i>kazayit</i> with lashes for rebellion.",
            "It is forbidden to eat <i>chamets</i> on the fourteenth from midday - which is the beginning of the seventh hour of the day (if the day is divided into twelve hours) - and onward. And anyone that eats [it] at that time is lashed by Torah writ, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 16:3), \"You shall not eat <i>chamets</i> upon it\" - meaning to say, upon the Passover sacrifice. Thus did they learn the explanation of this thing from the oral tradition: \"You shall not eat <i>chamets</i>\" from the time that is fit for the sacrifice of the Passover sacrifice, which is in \"the afternoon\" (Exodus 12:6) - and that is half the day.",
            "And the Sages forbade eating <i>chamets</i> from the beginning of the sixth hour so that one not touch a Torah prohibition. So from the beginning of the sixth hour, <i>chamets</i> will be forbidden for eating and benefit the whole sixth hour from the words of the Scribes (rabbinically); and the rest of the day from the seventh hour and onward from Torah writ. [In addition], we may not eat <i>chamets</i> in the fifth hour, [as a] decree on account of a cloudy day lest he mistake the sixth hour [for] the fifth hour. But it is not forbidden for benefit in the fifth hour. Hence we suspend priestly tithe and thanksgiving bread and that which is similar to them of <i>chamets</i> which is consecrated - we neither eat [it], nor burn [it] until the sixth hour arrives and we burn it [then].",
            "Behold you have learned that it is permissible to eat <i>chamets</i> on the fourteenth until the end of the fourth hour. And we may not eat [it] in the fifth hour [either], but we may benefit from it. And we strike one who eats it during the sixth hour with lashes for rebellion. And one who eats [it] from the beginning of the seventh hour is lashed (from Torah writ)."

            "By rabbinic enactment, one must search for <i>ḥametz</i> in hiding-places and holes, and remove it from his entire domain. Also, by rabbinic enactment, one should search and remove the <i>ḥametz</i> by lamplight at night, at the beginning of the night preceding the fourteenth day of <i>Nisan</i>, because all the people are then at home and lamplight is best for searching. And we do not fix study at the end of the thirteenth day [of Nissan]. And likewise should a sage not begin to read at that time, lest he be drawn [by it] and be prevented from searching for <i>chamets</i> at the beginning of its time. ",
            " 4 We do not search by the light of the moon, nor by the light of the sun nor by the light of a torch, but rather by the light of a lamp. To what are these words applicable? To holes and hiding places. But if one searched in a veranda - the light in which is great - by the light of the sun, it is enough for it. And the middle of a courtyard does not need searching, since birds are common there; and they eat all of the <i>chamets</i> that one drops there. ",

But [in a case of] a hole between an Israelite and and an idolater: He does not search at all, lest the idolater say, \"He is doing magic on me.\" Rather he should nullify [the <i>chamets</i>] in his heart, and that is enough for it. And any place in which we do not introduce <i>chamets</i> does not require searching. ",

But a beer cellar, a wine cellar or a storeroom for oil from which one does supply [wine or oil during the meal], a storage room for small fish, a wood storage room, a storage room for brine, the middle holes of [the walls of] a house and that which is similar to them require searching. For their usual [way] is that we introduce <i>chamets</i> in them. But if one knows with certainty that he did not introduce <i>chamets</i> there, it does not require searching.

If one searched on the fourteenth, and [then] left ten loaves but only found nine - such a one must surely concern himself and needs to search a second time. For surely [in this case] a weasel or mouse certainly dragged it.",

Even though he found crumbs in the middle of his house, we do not say, \"It already ate the bread in this place; and see, these are the crumbs [from that].\" Rather we are concerned lest it placed it in a hole or a window and these crumbs were there [from before]. Hence one must search again. And if he does not find anything, he must search all of the house.

For there is a presumption that [the infant] ate it, and these are the crumbs that fell from it at the time of the eating. As it is the way of an infant to scatter crumbs at the time of eating, but it is not the way of a mouse to scatter [crumbs]. However if he did not find crumbs at all, he needs to search.",

For any [mixture that is] fixed (like these piles) is considered like half and half (and since it is considered as if there is no majority, we may not assume that it came from the majority, i.e. the nine piles).",

If the first one that entered was black, and this one that left was white, he needs to search.

But if not - if it was made to strengthen the shards of the trough with it or to seal a hole with it, it is nullified due to its insignificance. But if not, he is obligated to destroy [it.

However if he does not have in mind to return [by then], he does not need to search. And likewise, one who makes his house into a storehouse: [If] it is within thirty days, he is required to search, and he may then move his storage into it; before thirty days - if he has in mind to clear it before Passover, he needs to search [it] and he may then make it into a storehouse.

For if he is not careful with it and finds it missing, he needs to seek after it and and to search another time, lest the mice dragged it [around].",

And one leaves enough from the <i>chametz</i> to eat of it until four hours on Shabbat day and leaves it in a sheltered place; and he destroys the rest from before Shabbat. And if there is <i>chametz</i> left over on Shabbat day, one nullifies it and turns a vessel over it until the conclusion of the first holiday, and he destroys it [then].",

Rather he must burn the impure by itself, the pure by itself and the suspended by itself. And he should only leave enough of the pure [tithe] to eat until four hours on Shabbat day.",

And he searches and seeks [it] in all of the places into which we introduce <i>chametz</i>, as we have explained. But if he searches after the festival, he does not recite the blessing.",

And he should say, \"All the <i>chametz</i> that is in my possession that I have not seen - behold it is like dust.\" But if he searched from the beginning of the sixth hour and onward, he is not able to nullify [it], for it is surely not in his possession - as it is already forbidden to benefit [from it].",

And nullification now does not help him at all, since [the <i>chametz</i>] is not in his possession. Yet Scripture made it as if it was in his possession, to make him liable for \"it shall not be seen,\" and \"it shall not be found.\" So he is obligated to destroy at any time that he finds it.

But if not, he should nullify [it] in his heart, and that is enough for it.

[In a case of] <i>chametz</i> upon which a collapsed [structure] collapsed and there was three or more handbreadths of [debris] found upon it: It is surely like it is destroyed. But he must [still] nullify it in his heart if the sixth hour did not yet begin. [If] he gave it to an idolater before the sixth hour, he does not need to destroy [it]. And if he burned it before the sixth hour, it is surely permissible to benefit from its coals in the middle of Passover. But if he burned it from the sixth hour and onward - since it is forbidden to benefit [from it], he surely may not feed an oven or stove with it and he may not bake with it and he many not cook.

Furthermore, one might suppose that a man transgresses only if the <i>ḥametz</i> is inside his house, but if it is far from his house, in the fields or in another town, he does not transgress the law; the Torah therefore says plainly: \"In all your territory\" (13:7), meaning: wherever you have control.

Servants of the Lord, praise, etc.' (Psalms 113:1) until \"a rock to a spring of water' (Psalms 114:8).\" And he concludes, \"Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who redeemed us and redeemed our ancestors from Egypt, and brought us to this night to eat matsa and bitter herbs.\" And at this time, he adds, \"So too, Lord our God, and God of our ancestors, bring us to other appointed times and holidays that will come to greet us in peace, joyful in the building of Your city and happy in Your worship; and we should eat there from the offerings and from the Passover sacrifices, the blood of which should reach the wall of Your altar for favor, and we shall thank You with a new song upon our redemption and upon the restoration of our souls.

Because it is stated (Deuteronomy 16:3), \"bread of poverty\": Just like the way of the poor person is with a piece (and not a whole loaf), so too here is it with a piece. And afterwards he wraps the matsa and bitter herbs to be [like] one, dips it in <i>charoset</i>, recites the blessing, \"Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us about the eating of matsas and bitter herbs\" and eats them. And if he eats the matsa by itself and the bitter herbs by themselves, he recites a blessing upon this one by itself and upon that one by itself.  ",

And [then] he recites the blessing, \"Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us about the eating of the Passover sacrifice,\" and he eats from the body of the Passover sacrifice.

He then recites the blessing, \"about the eating of bitter herbs,\" dips the bitter herbs in <i>charoset</i> and eats [them]. And he may not keep [them for long] in the <i>charoset</i>, lest it nullifies their taste. And this is a commandment from the words of the scribes (rabbinic).

And at the end, he eats [as little as] a <i>kazayit</i> of meat of the Passover sacrifice, and does not taste [anything] after it at all - and at this time, he eats a <i>kazayit</i> of matsa, and does not taste anything after it - in order that it will be the end of his meal and the taste of the meat of the Passover sacrifice or the matsa will be in his mouth, since eating them is the commandment.

            "And afterwards, he [washes] his hands and recites the Grace over the Meal over a third cup and drinks it. And afterwards, he pours a fourth cup and finishes the Hallel over it. And he recites the blessing over the song, and that is \"May all of your creatures praise you, etc.\" And he recites the blessing, \"who creates the fruit of the vine,\" [drinks it] and does not taste anything afterwards the whole night except for water. And he should pour a fifth cup and say the Great Hallel (Psalms 136) upon it, from \"Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good\" (Psalms 136:1) to \"Upon the rivers of Babylon\" (Psalms 137:1). And this cup is not obligatory like the [other] four cups. And he can finish the Hallel in any place that he desires, even though he is not in the place of the meal. ",

[In] a place where they were accustomed not to eat [it], we may not eat it, [as a] decree lest they will say it is meat of a Passover sacrifice. And it is forbidden in every place to eat a whole roasted lamb at once on this night, since it appears like one eating consecrated foods outside [the Temple]. But if it was cut up or lacking one of its limbs or he boiled one of its limbs and it is connected, it is surely permissible in a place where they were accustomed [to eating it].",
            "One who does not have wine on Passover night can make the sanctification over bread (matsa) - in the way that he does on Shabbat - and does all of the [other] things in this order. One who does not have a vegetable besides bitter herbs alone recites two blessings on the bitter herbs at the beginning - \"about the eating of bitter herbs,\" and \"who creates the fruit of the ground\" - and eats [it]. And when he finishes the Haggadah, he recites the blessing over the matsa and eats [it]; and then eats from the bitter herbs again without a blessing.",
