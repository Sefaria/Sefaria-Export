            "There is a positive commandment to rest from labor on the tenth of the seventh month [Tishrei], as it is stated (Leviticus 23:32), \"It shall be a Shabbat of rest for you.\" And anyone who does labor on it has negated a positive commandment and violated a negative commandment, as it is stated (Numbers 29:7), \"And on the tenth. etc. you shall not do any labor.\" And what is he liable for doing labor on this day? If he did it willingly and volitionally, he is liable for excision. But if he did it inadvertently, he is liable a fixed sin-offering . ",
            "Whenever the penalty for work done willfully on the Sabbath is stoning, the penalty for doing it willfully on <i>Yom Kippur</i> is <i>kareth;</i> whenever the penalty on the Sabbath is a sin-offering, the penalty on <i>Yom Kippur</i> is equally a sin-offering. Anything that must not be done on the Sabbath, though it is not actual work, must not be done on <i>Yom Kippur;</i> if one nevertheless performs it, he receives punishment for disobedience, the same as he would for a similar act on the Sabbath. And whatever is forbidden to move on Shabbat is forbidden to move on Shabbat. And whatever is forbidden to say or do at the outset on Shabbat, so is [it] forbidden on Yom Kippur. In brief: The only difference between the Sabbath and <i>Yom Kippur</i> in this respect is that the punishment for deliberate work on the Sabbath is stoning, while on <i>Yom Kippur</i> it is <i>kareth</i>.",
            "It is permitted to trim a vegetable on Yom Kippur from the afternoon prayer and on. And what is trimming? That he removes the rotten leaves, chops the rest and prepares it for eating. And likewise is it permitted to crack open nuts and break open pomegranates from the afternoon prayer and on because of the anguish of the soul (i.e. so one won't have to do it after the fast when he is very hungry). And Yom Kippur that come out to be on Shabbat is forbidden for trimming a vegetable, cracking nuts and opening pomegranates the whole day. But the people of Shin'ar (Babylonia) and the West (the Maghreb) have already accepted not to do any of these [activities] on the day of the fast; but rather it is surely like the Sabbath in all of its matters. ",
            "Another positive command concerning <i>Yom Kippur</i> requires us to abstain from eating or drinking on that day, as it is written: \"You shall afflict yourselves\" (Leviticus 16:29). According to tradition, self-affliction signifies fasting. Whoever fasts on <i>Yom Kippur</i> fulfills a positive command, and whoever eats or drinks on it breaks a positive command and transgresses a negative command, as it is written: \"Whoever will not abstain and fast on that day shall be cut off\" (Leviticus 23:29). Since the verse [explicitly] punished one who did not afflict himself [with] the punishment of excision, we have [also] learned that we are warned about eating and drinking on it. And anyone who eats or drinks on it inadvertently must bring a fixed sin-offering. ",
            "We have also learned from the oral tradition that it is forbidden to wash [one's body], anoint oneself, wear shoes, or have sexual relations on it. And it is a commandment to refrain from all of these [activities] in the same manner that one refrains from eating and drinking, as it is stated (Leviticus 16:31), \"a Sabbath of rest\" — \"a Sabbath\" for the matter of (eating); \"rest\" for these [other] matters. But one is only liable for excision or an offering for eating and drinking. However, if one washed, anointed, put on shoes, or had sexual relations, he is given (rabbinic) lashes for rebellion. ",
            "The same as the rabbinically forbidden occupations on <i>Yom Kippur</i> apply to both day and night, so the rabbinical interpretation of <i>affliction</i> applies to both day and night. One must add to <i>Yom Kippur</i> parts of the preceding and following weekdays, as it is written: \"You shall abstain and fast from the sunset of the ninth day\" (Leviticus 23:32), which means: you shall begin fasting and afflicting yourselves from the sunset of the ninth day bordering on the tenth day. So too, at the termination of <i>Yom Kippur</i>, one should prolong the fasting somewhat into the night of the eleventh day of <i>Tishri</i>, as it is written: \"From sunset of the ninth day to sunset of the tenth day you shall keep your Sabbath.\"",
            "If women continue eating and drinking until nightfall, because they fail to know the rule about adding part of the weekday to the holyday, we should not protest against their action, lest they come to do so willfully; for it is impossible to assign a policeman to each homestead in order to caution its womenfolk. Hence, leave them alone. It is better to let them act unwittingly rather than willfully. The same applies to all similar cases."

            "One who eats foods fitting for human consumption of the size of a thick date — which is slightly smaller than a [large] egg (<i>kabeitsah</i>) — on Yom Kippur is liable. And all foods combine to this measure. Similarly, one who drinks beverages fitting for human drinking of the [full] volume of the cheek of the drinker — each and everyone according to his cheek — is liable. How much is the [full] volume of his cheek? It is such that if he pushed [the liquid] to one side, it looks like his cheek is full. This measure in an average person is less than a <i>reviit</i>. And all beverages combine to this measure; but eating and drinking do not combine to one measure. ",
            "Whether one eats permitted foods or forbidden foods — such as sacrificial meat that was slaughtered with the intent to eat it after the designated time, sacrificial meat that was (actually) left over past the time, untithed food, meat from an unslaughtered (or improperly slaughtered) animal, meat from an animal with a mortal defect, forbidden fat, or blood — seeing as he ate foods fitting for human consumption, he is surely liable for excision on account of eating on Yom Kippur. ",
            "[If] one ate or drank less than this measure, he is not liable for excision. Even though [consuming] a partial measure is Biblically forbidden, we are only liable for excision for a [full] measure. However, one who eats or drinks a partial measure receives (rabbinic) lashes for rebellion. ",
            "[If] one ate a little and then ate again: If the time that elapsed from the beginning of the first eating to the end of the second eating was less than the time it takes to eat three eggs, they combine to the measure; but if not, they do not combine to the measure. [If] one drank a little and then drank again: If the time that elapsed from the beginning of the first drinking to the end of the second drinking was less than the time it takes to drink a <i>reviit</i>, they combine to one measure; but if not, they do not combine [to one measure]. ",
            "[If] one ate foods that are not fitting for human consumption, such as bitter grasses or foul syrups; or drank liquids that are not fitting for human drinking, such as [fish-]broth, fish oil or undiluted vinegar, he is exempt from excision — even [if] he ate or drank a lot. However he receives lashes for rebellion. ",
            "[If] one drank vinegar diluted in water, he is liable. One who chews peppercorns or dry ginger and that which is similar to them is exempt; but [if it was] fresh ginger, [he is] liable. If one ate grape leaves, he is exempt; grapevine tendrils, he is liable. These are grapevine tendrils — anything that blooms in the Land of Israel from Rosh Hashanah until Yom Kippur. Beyond this, they are surely like wood — so [he is] exempt; and likewise all that is similar to these. ",
            "[If] one ate roasted meat in salt, the salt combines with the meat [for the measure]; broth that is on a vegetable combines [with the vegetables] — because [food-items that help] prepare the food, [and] that are mixed with the food, are considered like [the] food. If one was full from gluttonous eating — [meaning] that he ate until he spurned his food — and [then] ate more than his fill, he is exempt like one who ate foods that are not fit for eating. As even though this extra food is fit for one who is hungry, it is not fit for any one who is full like this. ",
            "If a patient who is seriously ill asks for food on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, he should be given to eat as he desires, until he says \"enough,\" even though competent physicians say that he does not need any food. If the patient says that he does not require food, and the physician says that he does, he should be fed in accordance with the physician's order, provided that the physician is competent. If one physician says that the patient needs food and another says that he does not, he should be given food. [If] some physicians say he needs to and others say he does not need to, we go according to the majority or [according to] the more expert ones. And this is so long as the ill person does not say, \"I need [to eat].\" But if he says, \"I need [to eat],\" we feed him. [If] the ill person does not say that he needs [to eat] and the physicians disagree and all of them were experts and those who said that he does not need to [eat] are of the same number as those who said he needs [to eat], we feed him. ",
            "[In a case of] a pregnant woman who smelled [food and wants to eat it], we whisper in her ear that it is Yom Kippur. If she calmed down with this reminder, [all] is well (and we do not feed her); but if not, we feed her until she calms down. And likewise do we feed one who is struck with <i>bulmos</i> (a dangerous disease similar to bulimia that causes ravenous hunger), until his eyes light up. We even feed him unslaughtered animals and disgusting animals immediately; and we do not delay until things that are permissible are found. ",
            "A boy of nine years [or] of ten years should be trained to fast by the hours. For example, if he is used to eat at eight o'clock in the morning, he should be fed at nine; if he is used to eat at nine, he should be fed at ten; the number of hours is to be increased in accordance with the physical strength of the boy. A boy or a girl of eleven should fast the entire day, according to a rabbinical enactment, so as to be trained in the observance of religious duties.",
            "A girl of twelve years and one day (i.e. twelve complete years) and a boy of thirteen years and one day who have grown two [pubic] hairs are [considered] like adults for all commandments, and are Biblically obligated to complete the fast. But if they did not grow two hairs, they are still [considered] minors and are only [rabbinically] obligated to complete the fast. We do not have a child under nine afflict himself on Yom Kippur, so that he does not come to a danger. "

            "It is forbidden to bathe on Yom Kippur — whether with hot water or with cold water; whether his whole body or a single limb. It is even forbidden to put [one's] small finger into water. However, the king and a bride may wash their faces — the bride so she will not be disgusting to her husband; and the king so [people] will see his beauty, as it is stated (Isaiah 33:17), \"Your eyes shall see the king in his beauty.\" For how long [after her wedding] is she called a bride? Thirty days. ",
            "One who was dirty with excrement or mud may wash the dirty place in his usual way and [need] not be concerned (that perhaps he is violating a prohibition). A woman can rinse one hand in water and give bread to a baby. An ill person may bathe in his usual way even if he is not in danger. All those who are obligated to immerse (in a ritual bath) may immerse in their usual way, whether on the Ninth of Av or Yom Kippur. ",
            "[In a case of] one who [had] a seminal emission on Yom Kippur nowadays: If it is moist, he wipes it with a cloth, and that is enough for him. If it is dry or [he] became dirty [with it] — he just washes the dirty places and he ma y[then] pray. But it is forbidden for him to bathe his whole body or immerse. For one who immerses nowadays is not pure — due to impurity [from exposure to] the dead (which everyone is assumed to have) — so washing (i.e. immersing) from a seminal emission for prayer nowadays is only a custom. And a custom cannot permit something that is forbidden, but rather [only] forbid something that is permissible. And [the Sages] only said that one who [has] a seminal emission on Yom Kippur immerses, when they ordained that those who [had] seminal emissions must immerse. And we already explained that this ordinance was annulled. ",
            "It is forbidden to sit on mud that is so wet that a person can put one hand on it and pick up enough moisture that when he cleaves his other hand to [the first hand], moisture clings to it [as well]. A person may not fill up an earthenware utensil with water and cool off with it, because the water flows (lit. crawls) from its walls. It is even forbidden with metal utensils, lest water splash on his flesh. But it is permissible to cool oneself off with fruits. ",
            "A person may take a handkerchief on the eve of Yom Kippur, soak it in water, squeeze it out a little, and put it under the clothes. And on the morrow, he may pass it over his face and [need] not be concerned (that perhaps he is violating a prohibition), even though it [is very] cold. ",
            "One who goes to greet his teacher, his father or one who is wiser than he, or to read in the study hall may cross through water up to his neck and [need] not be concerned (that perhaps he is violating a prohibition). And he may perform the commandment that he went to perform and return through the water to his place. For if you do not permit him to return, he will not go [in the first place] and will have been obstructed from [doing] the commandment. And likewise may one who is going to guard his fruit cross through water up to his neck and [need] not be concerned (that perhaps he is violating a prohibition). And [that is] so long as they do not take their hands out from under the edges of their garments as they would do on [weekdays]. ",
            "It is forbidden to wear shoes and sandals even on one [of] his feet. But it is permissible to go out with a sandal of cork, or of reed or [of that] that which is similar to them. One may wrap a cloth around his feet and go out with it; for the hardness of the earth surely reaches his feet and he feels that he is barefoot. Even though infants are permitted with regards to eating, drinking, washing, and anointing, we prevent them from [wearing] shoes and sandals. ",
            "It is permitted for any person to wear a sandal because of a scorpion and that which is similar to it, in order that it will not 'bite' him. A woman who gave birth is permitted to wear a sandal for thirty days after the birth on account of coldness. An ill person [may act] similarly to her, even if [he] is not in danger. ",
            "It is [as] forbidden to anoint part of one's body as [it is to anoint] his whole body — whether it is an anointing of pleasure or it is an anointing that is not of pleasure. If one was ill — even though [he] is not in danger — or has scabs on his head, he may anoint in his usual way and [need] not be concerned (that perhaps he is violating a prohibition). ",
            "There are places which have become accustomed to lighting a light on the eve of Yom Kippur, so one will be embarrassed from his wife and not come to have marital relations [with her]. And there are [other] places which have become accustomed to not lighting [a light], lest one see his wife and she find favor in his eyes and he come to have relations [with her]. But if Yom Kippur falls out to be on Shabbat, everyone is obligated to light in all places — as the lighting of candles for Shabbat is an obligation. ",
