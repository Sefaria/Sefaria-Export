            "To rest on the seventh day of the week is a positive command, for it is written: \"On the seventh day you shall rest\" (Exodus 23:12). Anyone who works on it negates a positive command while transgressing a negative command, for it is written: \"You shall do no work\" (Exodus 20:10). What penalty does he deserve for doing work? If he did it voluntarily, willfully, he deserves <i>kareth;</i> if he acted in the presence of witnesses who forewarned him, he is stoned; if he acted unintentionally, he must bring a standard sin-offering.",
            "In Sabbath laws, wherever it is stated that someone deserves punishment for doing something, he deserves <i>kareth;</i> if he acted despite the forewarning of witnesses, he deserves stoning; if he committed the transgression inadvertently, he has to bring a sin-offering.",
            "And any place where it is stated that one who does this thing is exempt (<i>patur</i>), [it means] that he is exempt from excision, from stoning and from a sacrifice; but it is [still] forbidden to do this thing on Shabbat, the prohibition being rabbinic (literally, from the words of the scribes). And it is a distancing from forbidden work [forbidden by the Torah itself]. And one who does it volitionally is struck with lashes of rebellion. Likewise, any place where it is stated, “We do not do such and such,” or “It is forbidden to do such and such on Shabbat”; one who does it volitionally is struck with lashes of rebellion.",
            "---",
            "Things that are permissible to do on Shabbat, but it is possible that while doing it, he will do forbidden work through them and it is also possible that the will not do so; if he does not have intention to do that particular work, it is permissible. How is this? A man may drag a bed, a chair or a bench and that which is similar to them on Shabbat, so long as he does not intend to dig a ditch in the ground at the time that he drags them. Hence if they dug a ditch into the ground, he need not be concerned, since he did not have intention [for it]. Likewise, a man may walk on top of grass on Shabbat, so long as he does not intend to uproot it. Hence if they are uprooted, he need not be concerned. And he may wash his hands with “fruit dust” and that which is similar to it, so long as he does not intend to remove the hair [on his hands]. Hence if they fall out, he need not be concerned. It is likewise permissible to enter a small breach on Shabbat even though he removes small pieces [of the wall]. And likewise with anything that he does not intend like this – it is permissible.",
            "But if he did an act and forbidden work is done through it such that it is certain that it would be done from that act, he is liable [for it] even if he did not intend [to do the work]. For it is well-known that it is impossible that this work would not be done [through his act]. How is this? If one needs the head of a chicken for an infant to play with and he cuts off its head on Shabbat – even though his end purpose is not solely to kill the chicken – he is liable, since it is well-known that it is impossible to cut off the head of a living being and that it should live. Rather, death comes as a result of [his action]. And likewise with anything that is similar to this.",
            "Anyone who does forbidden work on Shabbat even though he does not need the work itself is [nevertheless] liable for it. How is this? If he extinguishes a lamp because he needs the oil or the wick so that it not to be consumed, or so that it not be burned or that it should not crack the clay of the lamp – he is liable. For extinguishing is forbidden work and he intended to extinguish [it], even though he did not need the extinguishing itself, and he only extinguished it for the sake of the oil or for the sake of the clay or for the sake of the wick. Likewise, one who transports a thorn four ells in the public domain or extinguishes a coal so that the public is not hurt by them is liable. As even though he does not need the extinguishing itself or the transporting itself but rather [just wants] to remove the danger, he is liable. And likewise anything that is similar to this.",
            "Anyone who intends to do forbidden work, but a different forbidden work that he did not intend is done [instead]; he is exempt for it, as he did not fulfill his thought. How is this? When he threw a stone or an arrow at his fellow or at an animal to kill them, and it went and uprooted a tree in its trajectory but it did not kill [the target], he is exempt. And it is an a fortiori case if he intends to do a lighter prohibition and he does a stringent prohibition. For example, if he intends to throw within a <i>karmelit</i> (a rabbinically defined public domain) and the stone reaches a public domain, he is exempt. And likewise, anything that is similar to this. If he intended to do something permissible and does something else – such as if he intends to cut detached [vegetation], but he cuts attached [vegetation] – he is not liable at all. And likewise anything that is similar to this.",
            "One who intended to pluck black figs but plucked [green] figs, or intended to first pluck figs and then grapes but the matter was switched and he plucked grapes first and then figs, is exempt. Even though he plucked all that he thought, since he did not pluck [them] in the order that he thought, he is exempt – as he did it without intention. For the Torah only prohibits thought out work (<i>melakhet machshevet</i>).",
            "When there are two lit lamps or two extinguished lamps in front of him and he intended to extinguish the one but extinguished [the other], or to light this one but he lit [the other], he is liable – as he did [the category] of the work that the thought to do. Behold what this resembles: One who intended to pluck this fig and he plucked [another]; or one who intended to kill this one and killed [another]. For you see that the forbidden work that he thought to do was done.",
            "But if he intended to light [one] first and to then extinguish the [other one] after it, but the matter was switched and he first extinguished [the one] and then lit [the other] after it, he is exempt. [But] when he extinguished this one and lit [the other] one in one breath, he is liable. As even though he did not have the lighting precede, he surely did not delay it, but rather both of them were as one and he is therefore liable. And likewise anything that is similar to this. And anyone who does forbidden work while unaware (of his actions) and did not intend it is exempt.",
            "Anyone who intends to do forbidden work, but more than his intention is done, is liable. [If] less than his intention [is done], he is exempt. How is this? If he intended to transport a load behind him and it came to be in front of him, he is liable. For he intended an inferior safekeeping [of the load] and it became a superior safekeeping. But if he intended to transport [it] in front of him and it came to be behind him, he is exempt. For he intended to transport it with a superior safekeeping and he transported it with an inferior safekeeping. And likewise anything that is similar to this.",
            "When he is bound with a sash and he placed a load between his flesh and his cloak; whether this load, the way of which is to be transported in this way, comes to be in front of him or it comes to be behind him, he is liable. As it is its way [of carrying in this manner], that it shifts.",
            "Anyone who intends to do forbidden work on Shabbat, begins it and does a [requisite] amount is liable – even if he does not finish all of the work that he intended to do. How is this? If he intended to write a letter or a deed on Shabbat, we do not say that he is not liable until he fulfills his intent and writes the whole bill or the whole letter. Rather, he is liable from when he writes two letters (of the Hebrew alphabet). Likewise if he intended to weave a whole garment, he is liable from when he weaves two threads. And even though his intention is to finish the garment, since he did the [requisite] amount with intention, he is liable. And likewise anything that is similar to this.",
            "Any forbidden work that an individual can do by himself, but it is done by two in partnership – whether this one does part of it and that one part [of it], such as when one lifts up an object in this domain and the other puts it down in another domain; or whether the two of them did it together from beginning to end, such as when the two of them grabbed a quill and wrote or grabbed a loaf (of bread) and transported it from [one] domain to [another] domain – they are surely exempt.",
            "But if neither of them is able to do it by himself unless they are combined, such as two that grabbed a beam and transported it to the public domain – since there is not enough strength in either of them to do it by himself and they did [the work] in partnership from beginning to end – they are both liable. And there is one [requisite] amount for both of them (i.e. as if they were one person). [But] if one of them had enough strength to transport it by himself, [yet] the two of them transported it [together], this first one who was able [to do it by himself] is liable, and the second one is [only considered] a helper – and a helper is not liable at all. And likewise anything that is similar to this.",
            "All that destroy are exempt. How is this? If he injured his fellow or an animal in a destructive way, and likewise if he tore clothing or burned them or broke vessels in a destructive way, he is surely exempt. When he dug a hole but only needs the dirt, this is damaging and he is [thus] exempt. Since his intention was to damage, even though he did forbidden work, he is exempt.",
            "Anyone who destroys in order to improve is liable. How is this? If he destroys [something] in order to build in its place, or erased in order to write in the place that he erased or dug a hole in order to build foundations in it, and likewise anything that is similar to this, he is liable. And their [requisite] amount is like the [requisite] amount of the one that improves [corresponding to that particular damage].",
            "Anyone who does forbidden work on Shabbat, part of it inadvertently and part of it volitionally – whether he was volitional and in the end became inadvertent or he was inadvertent and in the end became volitional – is exempt. [But when] he would do the entire [requisite] amount of the forbidden work from beginning to end volitionally, he would then be liable for excision. And if it would be with witnesses and a warning, he [would be] liable for stoning. And [if] he would do the entire [requisite] amount of the forbidden work inadvertently from beginning to end, he would then be liable for a set sin-offering."

            "Like all the other commandments, Shabbat is overridden by danger to life. Hence we execute all of the needs of an ill person in mortal danger according to the word of an expert physician in that place on Shabbat. When there is a doubt whether there is a need to profane the Shabbat for him or there is not a need, and likewise if [one] physician said to profane the Shabbat for him but another physician said he does not need [it], we profane the Shabbat. For [even] a doubt about [danger to] life overrides the Shabbat....",
            "When they evaluated him on Shabbat as requiring such and such for eight days, we do not say, “Let us wait until the evening, so as not to profane two Shabbats for him.” Rather we profane [it] from today, which is Shabbat, and we profane even a hundred Shabbats for him. So long as he needs [it] and he is in danger or the doubt of a danger, we profane [it]. And we light a lamp for him, we slaughter for him and we bake and cook and heat up hot water for him – whether to give him to drink or whether to bathe his body. The principle of the matter [is that] Shabbat for an ill person in [mortal] danger is like a weekday concerning all of the things that he needs.",
            "These things should not be performed by non-Jews, minors, servants or women, lest they consider the Sabbath a light matter; instead, scholars and sages of Israel are to carry them out. One must not put off the desecration of the Sabbath in treating a serious patient, as it is written: \"If a man obeys them he shall live by them\" (Leviticus 18:5), but he must not die by them. From this you may infer that the laws of the Torah are not meant to wreak vengeance upon the world, but to bestow on it mercy, kindliness, and peace. And it is written concerning those heretics that say that is desecrating the Shabbat (Ezek. 20:25), “I too have given them statutes that are not good and judgments that they will not live with.”",
            "If one feels pain in his eyes, being inflamed or affected by some disease, and pus, tears or blood flow from them, he is considered seriously ill, and we may break the Sabbath in preparing whatever cure he needs.",
            "Likewise if he has an internal wound in his body, from the lips inwards – whether in his mouth, whether in his intestines, whether in his liver and his spleen or in all of the other internal places – he is surely an ill person in [mortal] danger, and he does not need evaluation that his illness is serious. Hence we profane the Shabbat for him immediately without [need for] evaluation. And a wound that is on the back of his hand or the back of his foot is like an internal wound and does not require evaluation; and [so] we profane the Shabbat on account of it. And a fever that makes the flesh bristle is like an internal wound and we profane the Shabbat on account of it. And so too every illness about which the physicians say that there is a danger – even though it is external in the skin of the flesh – we profane the Shabbat on account of it, according to their word.",
            "We heat water for someone who has swallowed a water leech and we execute all of his medical needs on Shabbat, since it is a mortal danger. Likewise we execute all of the medical needs to save someone bitten by a rabid dog or one of the animals that crawl on the ground that kill – even if it is a doubt if they kill or if they do not kill.",
            "[In the case of] an ill person that the physicians evaluated that a dried fig should be brought to him and ten men ran and brought him ten dried figs at the same time, they are all completely exempt. And [this is so] even if they brought it one after the other, and even if he was healed with the first one. For they were all allowed to bring it.",
            "[In the case of] an ill person that requires two dried figs and we only found two dried figs on two stems and three dried figs on one stem, we cut the stem that has three – even though he only needs two – so that they do not increase the harvesting [done as a result]. We accordingly cut one stem and we do not cut two stems. And likewise anything that is similar to this.",
            "[In the case of] one who cooks for an ill person on Shabbat, and the ill person eats but leaves [some of it] over, it is forbidden for a healthy person to eat from the remainder, [as a] decree lest he increase [the food that he cooks] for his sake. But [in a case of] one who slaughters [an animal] for an ill person on Shabbat, it is permissible for a healthy person to eat raw meat from it, as there no addition [to the forbidden work involved] in the thing, such that we decree lest he increase for his sake. And likewise anything that is similar to this.",
            "[In the case of an ill person not in [mortal] danger, we execute all of his needs through a gentile. How is this? We say to a gentile to do it, and he does it – to cook, to bake, to bring medicine from one domain to [another] domain and that which is similar to these [actions]. Likewise, he may have his eyes colored by a gentile on Shabbat, even though there is no danger [to him]. And if they require things that have no forbidden work [involved] with them, even a Jew executes them. Hence we lift up the ears on Shabbat, lift up the cartilage (below the heart) and restore a broken bone. And all that is similar to this is permissible.",
            "A woman giving birth is surely in mortal danger when she bends down to give birth, and [so] we profane the Shabbat for her. We call a learned midwife from one place to [another] place and we cut the umbilical cord and tie it. And if she requires a lamp at the time that she yells out from her birth pangs, we light a lamp for her – even if she is blind, as her mind is put at ease by the lamp even if she does not see. And if she requires oil and that which is similar to it, we bring it to her. And anything that can be altered [from its usual way], we alter while it is brought. For example, her friend should bring [the item] hanging in her hair. And if [this is] impossible, she should bring it in its [usual] way.",
            "We do not assist an idolatress to give birth on Shabbat, even for pay and even when there is no profanation [of the Shabbat]; and we do not concern ourselves with enmity [that this may cause]. However we do assist the daughter of a resident stranger (<i>ger toshav</i>), since we are commanded to sustain him, but we do not profane the Shabbat for her.",
            "We profane the Shabbat for a birthing woman and execute all of her needs from when the blood starts to flow until she gives birth and for three days after she gives birth – whether she says, “I need [it],” or whether she says, “I do not need [it].” And from three to seven [days]; if she says, “I do not need [it],” we do not profane the Shabbat for her. But if she was quiet – and there is no need to say if she said, “I need [it]” – we profane the Shabbat for her. And from seven to thirty days, she is surely like an ill person that is not in [mortal] danger. And [so] even if she says, “I need [it],” we only do forbidden work for her through gentiles.",
            "We make a bonfire for a birthing woman even in the days of summer, since the cold is very difficult for a birthing woman in the cold areas. But we do not make a bonfire to warm an ill person. [However] if he let blood and got cold, we make a bonfire for him even during the season of Tamuz (the hottest part of the summer). And we bathe an infant on Shabbat on the day that it is born after we cut the umbilical cord – even with hot water that was heated on Shabbat. And we apply salt to him and give him a bone massage because it is dangerous if they do not do all these [things] to him. Likewise, we bathe him in hot water that was heated on Shabbat before circumcision, [right] after the circumcision and three days after the circumcision because of the danger.",
            "[If] a woman dies while sitting on the birthing chair, we bring a knife on Shabbat – even through a public domain – and cut her abdomen and take out the fetus, in case he be found alive. For a doubt about mortal [danger] overrides the Shabbat – even for one who does not have [a prior] assumption of being alive.",
            "We must save an endangered life on the Sabbath without first asking for permission from a religious authority. The more speedily a man saves a life, the more praise he deserves. If, for example, he sees a child falling into the lake on the Sabbath, he may cast a net and pull him out, even though he is likely to catch some fish along with him. [If] he heard that an infant was drowning in the sea, and he spread his net to bring him up but only brought up fish, he is completely exempt. If he intended to bring up fish, and he brought up fish and the infant, he is exempt. Since he brought up a child with the fish, even though he did not hear that he was drowning, he is exempt.",
            "[If] a child that fell into a well, one removes a ring [of its wall] and brings him up – even though he creates a step [to the well] at the time of its removal. [In a case in which] a door is locked in front of an infant, one breaks the door and extracts him – even though he splits it into wood [planks] that are fitting for work – lest the infant panic and die. [If] a fire erupts and there is a man there about whom we are concerned that he be burned [alive], we extinguish it to save him from the fire – even though he flattens a path and fashions it at the time of the extinguishing. And whoever is the first to save [another] is surely praiseworthy; and he need not get permission from the court (<i>beit din</i>) for anything that involves a [mortal] danger.",
            "[If] a rockslide (more frequently, the collapse of a building) falls on someone and there is a doubt if he is there or he is not there, we excavate [the debris] on his account. [If] they found him alive – even if he is crushed and it is impossible that he will heal – we excavate [it] on his account and extract him to live for the short time [he has left].",
            "[If] they checked to his nostrils and did not find any breath to him, they leave him there – as he is already dead. [If] they checked and found the [people] higher up dead, they should not say, “The [people] lower down have already died.” Rather, we excavate for all [of them], as it is possible in a rockslide that the higher one will die and the lower one be alive.",
            "[In the case of] a courtyard that had idolaters and Jews – even one Jew and a thousand idolaters – and a rockslide fell upon them, we excavate all of it for the sake of the Jew. [If] one of them left to a different courtyard and that courtyard collapsed upon him, we excavate [it] on his account, in case the one that left was a Jew and the remaining ones were idolaters.",
            "[If] they all moved from this courtyard to another courtyard; and when they moved, one of them left and entered [still] another courtyard and a rockslide fell upon him, but it is not known who he is; we do not excavate [it] on his account. For since they all moved, [we assume] the Jew is not here – since anyone who left them when they were walking is surely assumed to have left from the majority [of this group]. Hence if the majority were Jews – even though they all moved – and one of them left to another courtyard and the rockslide fell upon him, we excavate [it] on his account.",
            "One who is journeying in the wilderness and does not know when is Shabbat counts six days from the day upon which he [discovered his] error and sanctifies the seventh and recites the blessings of the day, and makes havdalah at the conclusion of the Shabbat [according to that count. And on each and every day – even on the one that he sanctifies and after which he makes havdalah – he is permitted to do only [work required] for his sustenance, in order that he not die. But it is forbidden for him to do more that [what is required] for his sustenance, as there is a doubt about each and every day that it is Shabbat. And if he knows that it is the eighth day from his departure or the fifteenth day and similar to this count, he is surely permitted to do [unlimited] work on that day. For the matter is certain that he did not leave with a caravan on Shabbat. But on the other days, he does only enough [work] for his sustenance.",
            "[If] idolaters besiege Jewish cities: If they came for monetary matters (i.e. to demand ransom, etc.), we do not profane the Shabbat on their account and we do not go out to war against them. But with a city near the border, we go out against them with weapons and profane the Shabbat on their account – even if they only came about matters of hay and straw. However if they came about matters of lives or they prepared for war or [the nature of the siege is unknown], we go out against them with our weapons and we profane the Shabbat on their account in every place. And it is commandment upon all Jews who are able, to come and go out and help their besieged brothers and save them from the idolaters on Shabbat. And it is forbidden for them to delay until the conclusion of Shabbat. And when they have saved their brothers, it is permitted for them to return with their weapons to their place, so as not to hinder them in the future.",
            "And likewise [in the case of] a mangled ship at sea or a city surrounded by troops or by [an overflowing] river, it is a commandment to go out and save them with anything with which he can save them. And it is even a commandment to save an individual that is being chased by idolaters or a snake or a bear that is chasing him to kill him. And it is even permissible to do several [types of] forbidden work and even to make weapons. And we cry out and supplicate for them on Shabbat and we blow horns to help them. But we do not supplicate or cry out about pestilence on Shabbat.",
            "We [begin] sieges against idolater cities [at least] three days before the Shabbat. But we make war against them each and every day, and even on Shabbat, until we conquer them – even if it is an optional war. They learned from the oral tradition (on Deut. 20:20), “until it be subjugated” – and even on Shabbat. And there is no need to say [this] regarding a commanded war. And Yehoshua only conquered Jericho on Shabbat."

            "It is permissible to start forbidden work from the eve of Shabbat, even though it is finished on its own on Shabbat; as we are only forbidden to do forbidden work on the day of Shabbat itself. But when the work is done by itself on Shabbat, it is permissible for us to benefit from that which was done on its own on Shabbat.",
            "How is this? We open water channels to a garden on the eve of Shabbat, and it fills up and continues the whole entire day. And we place the <i>mugmar</i> (sweet smelling smoke) under the clothes and they give off the smell and continue the whole entire Shabbat. And we place an eye-salve on the eye and a bandage on a wound and [the wounds] are medicated and continue the whole entire Shabbat. And we soak dyes and ink with the twilight [before Shabbat] and they soak and continue the whole entire Shabbat. And we put wool in the cauldron and strands of flax into the oven and they are transformed and continue the whole entire Shabbat. And we spread nets for wild animals, birds and fish with the twilight and they are trapped and continue the whole entire Shabbat. And we load the beams of the olive press and the wheel of the winepress with the twilight and the liquids flow [from the olives and grapes] and continue the whole entire Shabbat.

We do not leave on the fire on Shabbat, a cooked food that is not fully cooked or hot water that is not fully heated or a cooked food that is fully cooked, but the more it condenses the better it is for it – even though it was placed [on the fire] while still day [on the eve of Shabbat, as a] decree lest he stoke the coals on Shabbat in order to complete its cooking or in order to make it condense. Hence if he raked [the coals of] the fire; or covered the fire of the stove with ashes or with thin flax scraps; or the coals dimmed, as they are then surely as if covered by ashes; or he [only] fed the fire with straw or stubble or the dung of [sheep and goats], as there are surely no burning coals there – it is surely permitted to leave [cooking foods] upon it. For he has surely removed his mind from this cooked food, and [hence] we do not decree lest he stoke the fire.",

For since its fumes are very hot, he does not remove his mind [from the food] and we are concerned lest he stoke this small fire – even though it is the fire of straw and stubble or covered.",
            "And why did they forbid to leave [cooking food] on an oven even though it is raked? Because one who rakes only rakes most of the fire and its power. But it is impossible to rake all of the fire to the point that he does not leave a single remnant. Since its fumes are hot, [we are concerned] lest he stokes in order to enkindle the remaining remnants in the oven.",

But if he feeds it with straw or stubble, it is surely like a stove that is fed with straw or stubble and we leave [cooking foods] on it. And it is permissible to place [food not fully cooked] next to a stove from the eve [of Shabbat], even though it is not raked or covered by ashes. And which is a stove and which is a <i>kupach</i>? A stove has room for the placement of two stewpots on top and a <i>kupach</i> has room for the placement of one stewpot on top.",

Likewise, if one throws a [raw piece of meat] at twilight into any food that is partly cooked or that is fully cooked but the more it condenses the better it is for it – all of it becomes like a raw food, and it is [thus] permitted to leave it on the fire even though he did not rake and did not cover [it.

But it is forbidden to bring it into the other courtyard, such that he not fulfill the thought that he had at the time of his inadvertence.

However if he intended to throw the object four, but it landed at the end of eight, he is exempt. For it landed in a place through which he did not think it would pass – all the more so, land. Hence if – when he threw the object – he thought that it should land anyplace it wants, he is liable.",

If he threw [it] outside of the four ells and it rolled [back] into [the] four ells: If it rested on top of something outside of the four ells, and afterwards rolled and entered the four ells, he is liable.

[Regarding] three villages that were in a triangle: If there was two thousand ells or less between the middle one and each one of the two outer ones; and two hundred eighty three ells minus a third between the two outer ones, such that there be one hundred and forty and a third ells between each one of them and the middle one if you look at it as if the middle one was between them (on a straight line)—the three of them are surely like one city. And we measure two thousand ells in each direction from outside [all] three of them. A city that was encircled [by a wall] and later settled is measured from its settlement; a city that was settled and then encircled is measured from its walls.",
            "[In the case of] a city that was rectangular or square: Since it has four corners of equal [angles], we leave it as it is and measure two thousand ells in each direction of its four directions. [If] it was round, we make corners for it and see it as if it is within a square, and measure two thousand ells from the sides of that square in each direction—such that it comes out that it gains the corners [of that square that extends beyond the circle].",
            "And likewise if the city was like a triangle or had many sides, we make it into a square and then measure two thousand ells from the square in each direction. And when one squares it, he squares it in the [directions] of the world—so that each of its directions extends across from one of the directions of the world and faces it.",
            "[If] it was wide on one side and narrow on the other side, we see it as if it was all wide. [If] it was made like a type of a [Greek letter,] <i>gamma</i> (an L shape) or made like an arch: If there was less than four thousand ells between its two ends, we measure it from [the outer edge of] the gap and look at the entire space between the gap and the arch as if it was filled with houses. But if there was more than four thousand ells between the two ends, we only measure it from the [actual] arch.",
            "[In the case of a] city that sits upon a riverbank: If there is a dock four ells wide in front of it, upon the riverbank, so that [people] may stand upon it and use the river—it comes out that the river is included in the city. So we measure for [the city] two thousand ells from the second bank of the river, and the whole river [adjacent to the city] is included in the city because of the dock built on its side. But if there was no dock there, we only measure from the entrance of their houses; and it comes out that the river is measured as [part of] their two thousand [ells].",
            "We only measure [the perimeter] of those who dwell in shacks from the entrance of their houses. But if there were three courtyards of two houses each [there], they are all made permanent (and attain the status of a city regarding the perimeter). So we square it and give them two thousand ells in each direction like other cities.",
            "We may only measure with a rope of fifty ells—not less and not more—and with a rope of flax, so that it will not stretch too much. [If] one reached a vale [while measuring]: If it is [no more than] fifty ells, such that he he can subsume it with the measure of the rope, he subsumes it (he surveys it according to the measure of the rope stretched flatly over it). And that is so long as its depth is less than four thousand ells.",
            "To what are these words applicable? When a plumb line descends [directly] in front of him, such that it is impossible to use [the slope]. But if the plumb line does not descend in front of him, he does not subsume it unless its depth is two thousand ells or less.",
            "[If] the vale is sloped, one 'pierces' (see 28: 16) and ascends, 'pierces' and descends. [If] the vale was wider than fifty—such that one may not subsume it (due to the size of the rope)—he may walk to a place [where it is narrower, such] that he can subsume it, [then] subsume it, scout the measure across from it and return.",
            "[If] he reached a wall, we do not say, 'pierce' the wall. Rather one estimates its width and goes on. But if it is possible to use it, he must measure it properly. And if the plumb line descends [directly from the wall] in front of him, he must [also] measure its width properly.",
            "[If] he reached a hill: It the hill  slopes ten handbreadths [of height] within five ells, one subsumes it and goes back to his measuring. But if it was very tall—to the point that it slopes ten handbreadths within the space of four ells—he estimates it and goes on. And if he is unable to subsume it—such as when it is wider than fifty—he 'pierces' it, little by little. And this is [the meaning of] that which they said, \"We 'pierce' the hills.\"",
            "How do we 'pierce' in hills or vales that one cannot subsume? Two [surveyors] hold a rope of four ells: The higher one holds his end across from his feet and the lower one holds the second end across from this heart. And the higher one returns to stand in the place of the lower one, while the lower one descends and distances himself from him the length of the rope. And they repeat and continue [this] until they have measured all of it. And when the surveyor walks to subsume the hill or the vale, he does not go out of the perimeter; so that passersby not see him and say [that] the measure of the perimeters [reaches] there.",
            "We only rely upon the measurement of someone who is an expert, as he knows the measurement of the ground. If we had Shabbat perimeters that had been established and an expert came and measured, increasing (expanding) some of the perimeter and decreasing [some] of the perimeter—we listen to him about the perimeter that he increased. And likewise if two experts came and measured the perimeter—one increasing [it] and one decreasing [it]—we listen to the one who increases [it]. And this is so long as he does not increase it more than the measure of the city's diagonal.",
            "How is this? At the time that this one increases [over the other], we say [that] perhaps the first one measured two thousand [ells] diagonally from the corner of the city; whereas the latter measured the two thousand from the [middle of the] edge of the city. But we do not assume that the first erred more than this. Hence if this latter one increased about five hundred and eighty ells more than the first one, we listen to him; more than this, we do not listen to him.",
            "Even a slave or a maidservant is believed (to provide legal testimony) when they say [that] the perimeter of Shabbat is until here. And an adult is believed to say, \"I remember that we come [only] up to here on Shabbat when I was a child.\" And we rely upon his testimony in this thing. For the sages did not speak about the matter to be stringent, but rather to be lenient—since the [requisite] measurement of two thousand ells is from their words (rabbinic)."

            "What is meant by <i>honor</i>? The sages explained this by declaring that each person should wash his face, hands and feet with hot water on Friday in honor of the Sabbath, and then enwrap himself in a fringed garment and be seated with dignity in expectation of the Sabbath, receiving it as if he were coming out to meet the king. The ancient sages used to assemble their disciples on Friday, put on their best clothes, and say: \"Come, let us go out to meet King Sabbath.\"",

But one must stipulate with [the gentile ship captain that this is on the condition that] he rests, (i.e., stops the ship on Shabbat); and [even] if he does not rest.

And Shabbat is the sign between the Holy One, blessed be He, and us forever. Hence anyone who transgresses the other commandments is surely included among the evildoers of Israel. But one who desecrates Shabbat in public is surely like an idolater. So both of them are like (gentile) idolaters in all of their matters. Therefore the prophet praises [one who observes Shabbat] and says (Isaiah 56:2), \"Happy is the man who does this, and the man who holds fast to it; who keeps Shabbat and does not profane it, etc.\" And the reward in this world—beyond the reward that is saved for the world to come—[for] anyone who observes Shabbat according to its law, honors it and delights [in] it according to his ability is already explicit in the tradition. As it is stated (Isaiah 58:14), \"Then you can delight in the Lord; and I will set you astride the heights of the earth, and feed you the heritage of your father Jacob—for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.\""
