And it is a distancing from forbidden work [forbidden by the Torah itself]. And one who does it volitionally is struck with lashes of rebellion. Likewise, any place where it is stated, “We do not do such and such,” or “It is forbidden to do such and such on Shabbat”; one who does it volitionally is struck with lashes of rebellion.",

How is this? A man may drag a bed, a chair or a bench and that which is similar to them on Shabbat, so long as he does not intend to dig a ditch in the ground at the time that he drags them. Hence if they dug a ditch into the ground, he need not be concerned, since he did not have intention [for it]. Likewise, a man may walk on top of grass on Shabbat, so long as he does not intend to uproot it. Hence if they are uprooted, he need not be concerned. And he may wash his hands with “fruit dust” and that which is similar to it, so long as he does not intend to remove the hair [on his hands]. Hence if they fall out, he need not be concerned. It is likewise permissible to enter a small breach on Shabbat even though he removes small pieces [of the wall]. And likewise with anything that he does not intend like this – it is permissible.",

For it is well-known that it is impossible that this work would not be done [through his act]. How is this? If one needs the head of a chicken for an infant to play with and he cuts off its head on Shabbat – even though his end purpose is not solely to kill the chicken – he is liable, since it is well-known that it is impossible to cut off the head of a living being and that it should live. Rather, death comes as a result of [his action]. And likewise with anything that is similar to this.",

For extinguishing is forbidden work and he intended to extinguish [it], even though he did not need the extinguishing itself, and he only extinguished it for the sake of the oil or for the sake of the clay or for the sake of the wick. Likewise, one who transports a thorn four ells in the public domain or extinguishes a coal so that the public is not hurt by them is liable.

And it is an a fortiori case if he intends to do a lighter prohibition and he does a stringent prohibition. For example, if he intends to throw within a <i>karmelit</i> (a rabbinically defined public domain) and the stone reaches a public domain, he is exempt. And likewise, anything that is similar to this.

Rather, he is liable from when he writes two letters (of the Hebrew alphabet). Likewise if he intended to weave a whole garment, he is liable from when he weaves two threads.

And there is one [requisite] amount for both of them (i.e. as if they were one person). [But] if one of them had enough strength to transport it by himself, [yet] the two of them transported it [together], this first one who was able [to do it by himself] is liable, and the second one is [only considered] a helper – and a helper is not liable at all.

If he injured his fellow or an animal in a destructive way, and likewise if he tore clothing or burned them or broke vessels in a destructive way, he is surely exempt.

[But when] he would do the entire [requisite] amount of the forbidden work from beginning to end volitionally, he would then be liable for excision. And if it would be with witnesses and a warning, he [would be] liable for stoning.

Even though the partition does not reach the ground [at the bottom], it is permissible since it has ten handbreadths. And they only permitted [such] a suspended partition exclusively in the water. For the prohibition to carry in the water is from the words [of the Sages], and they [are the ones] that were lenient about [such] a partition that is only to make a marker.",

[If] he was dumping into the opening of the ditch and the waters go out to a <i>karmelit</i>, it is surely permissible - even in the dry season - as they did not make a decree about the force of his [actions] in a <i>karmelit</i>.

As anything less than three [handbreadths] is like it is joined [together]. Even though it is permitted to carry in an entire alley that is made permissible with a beam, one who throws from it to a public domain or from a public domain into it is exempt. For a beam is made as a marker (so it does not make the alley into a full-fledged private domain). But if it is made permissible with a post, one who throws from it to a public domain or from a public domain into it is liable. For a post is surely like a partition in the fourth direction (making it into a full-fledged private domain).",
            "10 How can we render fit [the area] between two walls, with people walking between them, in the public domain? One makes doors on this [side] and doors on that [side]. And afterwards a private domain is made between them. And one need not lock the doors at night, but they have to be fit to be locked. [Hence] if they were submerged in the dirt, he must clear them and fix them to be locked. But the outline of an entrance, a post or a beam are not effective to render a public domain fit [to change its status and permit carrying].",
            "11 It is permissible to carry in an alley under the beam or between the posts. To what are these words applicable? When it is adjacent to a public domain. But if it is adjacent to a <i>karmelit</i>, it is forbidden to carry under the beam or between the posts until one makes another post within the opening. For 'a type has found its own type and is awakened' (meaning that since the area under the beam or between the posts and the <i>karmelit</i> are both areas undefined by the Torah, the former takes on the identity of the latter).",
            "12 We may make posts with anything, even with something living, and even with that from which it is prohibited to benefit. [Hence] an actual idol or tree-god (<i>asherah</i>) that one made into a post is fit, since its [required] thickness is the smallest amount (such that the requirement to destroy it does not impinge upon any need for a horizontal dimension). The height of the post must be ten handbreadths, [but] its width and thickness is the smallest amount.",
            "13 We may make a beam from anything, but not from an <i>asherah</i>, since the width of a beam has a [requisite] measure. And any [requisite] amount is forbidden [to come] from an <i>asherah</i>, whereas the width of a beam is no less than a handbreadth - [though] its thickness is the smallest amount. But it must be sturdy [enough] to hold an <i>ariach</i> which is half a brick of three handbreadths by three handbreadths. And that which holds up the beam must be sturdy [enough] to hold the beam and a half brick. ",
            "14 How [large] may the entrance of the alley be in order for a post or a beam to be sufficient to render it fit? Its height may not be less than ten handbreadths nor more than twenty ells and its width than ten ells. To what are these words applicable? When it did not have the outline of an entrance. But if it had the outline of an entrance, it is permissible - even if it was higher then a hundred ells or less than ten [handbreadths] or its width was a hundred ells.",
            "15 Likewise if the beam of the alley had a relief or a drawing that all would look upon, it is fit even though it is above twenty ells. For a beam is made as a marker; and if it was above twenty, it would not be noticeable. But if there was a relief or a drawing on it, [people] would look upon it - and it would [thereby] come out to be a marker [nevertheless].",
            "16 An alley the height from the ground to the bottom of the beam of which is twenty ells, but the thickness of the beam is above twenty, is fit [to allow carrying within it. If] it was higher than twenty and one comes to reduce [this] with a beam that he places below, its width must be a handbreadth, like the beam [above]. If its height was less than ten [handbreadths], he may hollow out an area of four by four ells [in the ground] and go downwards enough to complete the ten. ",
            "17 [In a case when] a breach was made in [the alley's] side towards its head: If a board of four handbreadths remains standing at the head [of the wall that has been breached], it is permissible [to carry]. And that is when the breach is no more than ten [ells]. But if a board of four does not remain, it is forbidden unless the breach was less than three [handbreadths]. As anything less than three is like it is joined [together]. ",
            "18 [In a case when] the alley is completely breached to a courtyard and the courtyard is breached opposite [the alley] to the public domain, it is surely forbidden because it is an open alley. But the courtyard is permissible. For a courtyard in which the public treads and enter on this [side] and exit on that [side] is surely a full-fledged private domain.",
            "19 [In the case of] an alley that has paths on this side and paths on the other side that are found to be open to the public domain: Even though they are not opposite each other, each one is surely an open alley. How can we render [such an alley] fit? One makes the outline of an entrance for each and every one of the paths on one side, and likewise at the large entrance [at the front of the alley]; and he makes a post or a beam for each and every one of the paths on the other side.",
            "20 [In the case of an] alley one side of which is long and one side of which is short, one places the beam across from [the end of] the short [side. If] one places a post in the middle of an alley: It is permissible to carry in the inner [section] which is from the post inwards; but the outer half - which is from the post outwards - is forbidden. ",
            "21 [In a case of] an alley that is twenty ells wide, one may make a board ten handbreadths high [going back into the alley] a distance of four ells, which is the requisite size of an alley, and place it in the middle; and it comes out to be like two alleys the entrance of each of which is ten ells. Or he can go a distance of two ells from [one end] and put up a board of three ells and go a distance of two ells from [the other end] and put up a board of three ells; and it comes out that the entrance of the alley is ten ells, whereas the sides are surely as if sealed. For what is standing [at the ends] (the three ells) is greater than what is breached (the two ells). ",
            "22 A post that extends from the wall of the alley is fit. And a post that was put up for itself (and not to render the alley permissible) is fit if they relied upon it before Shabbat. And a post that appears as a post inside, but does not appear as a post outside; or it appeared as a post outside, but appears flat inside and as if there was no post there - is surely considered to have the status of a post. A post that is raised three handbreadths from the ground or distanced three from the wall does not do anything (is invalid). But [if] less than three, it is fit. As anything less than three is like it is joined [together]. A very wide post - whether its width was less than half the width of the alley or whether its width was half the width of the alley - is fit and considered to have the status of a post. But if it was more than half of the width of the alley, it is considered to have the status of 'more [of the wall] is standing than breached' (and the alley is permissible for that reason).",
            "23 [In the case of] a beam over which one draped a mat, [the mat] surely nullifies it, since it is no [longer] recognizable. Hence if the mat was removed three or more handbreadths from the ground, it is not a partition. [If] one planted two pegs into the [ends of the] alley walls outwards and placed a beam on top of them, he has not done anything. For the beam has to be on top of the alley, not near it.",
            "24 [In the case of] a beam that protrudes from [one] wall, but does not touch the second wall; and likewise two beams - one protruding from this wall and the other protruding from that wall - that do not touch each other: If [the gap] is less than three [handbreadths], he need not bring another beam. If [the gap] between them was three, he needs to bring another beam.",
            "25 Likewise [in a case of] two matching beams [but] there is not enough in this one to hold an <i>ariach</i> and there is not enough in that one to hold an <i>ariach</i>: If there is enough in both of them [together] to hold an <i>ariach</i>, there is no need to bring another beam. [If] one was above and one was below, we look at the top one as if it was below and the bottom one is if it was above (such that they be even) - so long as the top one is not above twenty [ells] and the bottom one is not below ten [handbreadths]; and there not be three handbreadths between them when we see it such that the higher one was lowered and the lower one raised to be even until one was across from the other.",
            "26 [If] a beam was bent, we look at it as if it was straight; round, we look at it as if it were square. And if there were three handbreadths in its circumference, there is a handbreadth in it width. [If] a beam was within an alley but it bent outside of the alley, or it bent above twenty [ells] or below ten [handbreadths], we look at the whole [beam] as if the bend was removed and [only] its two ends remained - if there was not three [handbreadths] between this [end] and that, he need not bring another beam; but if not, he needs to bring another beam.",
            "27 [In the case of] a well [around] which one made eight boards from the four corners - two boards connected in each corner - they are surely a partition. And even though the breach is larger than what is standing in each and every direction; because the four corners are standing, it is surely permissible to fill [water] from the well and give a beast to drink. And how much is the height of each of these boards? Ten handbreadths. And its width? Six handbreadths. And between every board [in one corner] and board [in the next corner]? Like the fill of two teams of four cattle each, one entering and one exiting. The measure of this width is no larger than thirteen ells and a third. ",
            "28 [In a case] in which in the place of one of the corners or [even] in each corner of these four, there is a large stone, a tree, a mound with an incline of ten [handbreadths] within four ells, or a bundle of reeds - we look to all of it as if it were divided; and so long as there is one ell on this [side] and one ell on that [side] at a height of ten [handbreadths], it is considered to have the status of a corner that has two boards. [In a case of] five reeds and there is not three [handbreadths] between [any of them], but there is [a total] of six handbreadths on this [side] and six handbreadths on [that] side - they are considered to have the status of a corner that has two boards. ",
            "29 It is permissible to make these four corners close to the well, so long as the head and most of a cow would [fit] inside the boards when it drinks. And even though one [might] not be holding the head of the animal together with the vessel which holds the water (such that he may follow the animal outside of the boards with the vessel) - since the head and most of it is inside, it is permissible even for a camel. [But if] they were closer than this, it is forbidden to water even a goat that is totally inside from it. And it is permissible to make them a little further. But this is so long as one adds straight boards that we place in each and every direction, so that there not be more than thirteen ells and a third between a board and its fellow. ",
            "30 They only allowed these boards in the Land of Israel for the livestock of the festival pilgrims. And it is [limited] to a living public spring. But in other lands, a man must go down to the well and drink, or make a partition with a height of ten handbreadths surrounding the well - and [then] he may stand within it and draw [water] and drink. But if the well was very broad, such that one cannot go down to it, he may surely draw and drink between the boards (the above leniency of the boards would then also apply).",
            "31 Likewise, we may not draw from a public pit of water or a private well (spring) - even in the Land of Israel - unless they made a partition ten handbreadths tall around it.",

But if there was a manger - the head of which protrudes between the boards and it was ten [handbreadths] tall and four wide - he may not fill [water] and place it in front of it; lest the manger get ruined and he take the pail out to the manger, and from the manger to the floor of the public domain. Rather he fills and pours it [on the ground] and [the animal] drinks on its own.",
            "33 One who throws from a public domain to between the boards is liable. Since there is a full-fledged partition with a height of ten [handbreadths] and more than four by four [handbreadths] and the square is recognizable and visible, everything between them becomes a private domain. And [this is so] even if it was in a glen without a well between them - since there is a board from here and a board from there in every direction. And even [if] the public was treading and passing through the boards, the partitions are not nullified. And they are surely like courtyards, such that the public treads in them - and [yet] one who throws into it is liable. And it is permissible to give an animal to drink between them if there is a well between them. ",
            "34 [In the case of] a courtyard the head of which protrudes between the boards, it is permissible to carry from within it to [the area] between the boards, and from between the boards to within it. [But] if there were two courtyards, they are forbidden until they make an <i>eruv</i> (which renders it all into one domain). [If ]the water dried up on Shabbat, it is forbidden to carry between the boards; as they are only considered a partition to carry within it on account of the water. If water arrived there on Shabbat, it is permissible to carry between them - as any partition formed on Shabbat is [still] called a partition. It is forbidden to carry in an alley, the beam of which or the post of which was taken away on Shabbat - even [when] it is open to a <i>karmelit</i>.",
            "35 It is permitted to carry throughout a veranda in a glen - even though it [only] has three partitions and a roof. For we see it as if the edge of the roof descends and seals the fourth direction. And one who throws from a public domain into it is exempt - just as one who throws into a closed lane that has a roof. [In the case of] a house or courtyard the corner of which is breached across ten ells, it is surely forbidden to carry in all of it. Even though any breach up to ten ells is like an entrance [and so, permissible], we do not make an entrance in a corner. But if there was a beam above there - over the length of the breach - we see it as if it descended and sealed it; so it is permitted to carry in the whole thing. And this is so long as [the beam] is not diagonal. ",
            "36 The fingerbreadth that we measure with in every place is the width of the thumb of the hand. And a handbreadth is four fingerbreadths. And every ell mentioned in every place - whether regarding Shabbat or regarding a sukkah or forbidden mixtures - is an ell of six handbreadths. Sometimes we measure with an ell of six handbreadths pushing against each other; and sometimes we measure with an ell of six handbreadths that are expansive and spaced out. And this and that are to be stringent. How is that? The depth of an alley is four expansive ells, but its height is twenty narrow ells; the width of a breach is ten narrow ells. And it is similar to [these examples] concerning a sukkah and forbidden mixtures."

From the Torah: \"Remember\" (Exodus 20:8) and \"Observe\" (Deuteronomy 5:12). And explicated through the Prophets: Honor and delight, as it is said, \"And call the sabbath a delight, And the holy of the LORD honourable\" (Isaiah 58:13).",
            "What is honor? It is what the Sages said that it is a mitzvah to wash one's face, hands, and feet in hot water on the eve of Shabbat for the sake of honor for Shabbat. One should wrap Tzitzit, and sit respectfully, waiting for Shabbat to commence just as one does he goes out to greet a king. And the early Sages would gather their students on the eve of Shabbat and wrap themselves and say, \"Come, let us go out and greet Shabbat, the king.\"",
            "Honoring the Sabbath includes wearing clean clothing. One's Sabbath rainment should be distinct from that of the week. If he has no additional set of clothing, he should loosen his garment so that his style of dress is not like that of the week. Ezra established that the people would wash their clothes on Thursday, to honor the [coming] Sabbath.",

And there should be a candle lit, the table set for eating, and the bed spread, for all of these are for the honor of Sabbath.",

Among the original sages were one who would split wood for cooking, one who would cook or cure meat, trim wicks, or light candles, and some who would go out and buy things needed for Sabbath, for eating and drinking, even though he wasn't accustomed to such. And anyone who increases implementation of this concept is praiseworthy.",

Anyone who increases in his Shabbat expenditures and in preparing many good foods is worthy of praise. If one is unable to afford (these expenditures), even if one only makes fried vegetables or something similar in honor of the Shabbat, this is considered fulfillment of  enjoyment of the Shabbat. One is not obligated to pain himeself or to ask from others in order to increase his Shabbat meal. The early Sages said \"make your Shabbat like a weekday and do not come to rely on people\".",
