            "Resting from labor<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Within the context of the Sabbath laws, labor does not refer to strenuous work, but rather to the performance of one of the thirty nine labors that were necessary for the construction of the Temple or a labor which is analogous to them. (See Chapter 7, Halachah 1.)<br>The Rambam's choice of wording in this halachah is significant. Our Rabbis have offered two definitions of the mitzvah of resting on the Sabbath: In his commentary on <i>Yevamot</i> 6a, the Rashba states that the mitzvah is negative in nature: one refrains from performing prohibited labors. In contrast, in his commentary on Leviticus 23:24, the Ramban explains that the mitzvah possesses a positive dimension: to spend the day in a restful frame of mind, abstaining from all activities - even those that are not forbidden labors - which would disrupt this tranquility.<br>From the Rambam's choice of wording in this halachah, it would appear that he follows the first view. From his statements in Chapter 21, Halachah 1, however, it would appear that he accepts the second perspective. (See also <i>Tzafenat Paneach</i>.)</i> on the seventh day fulfills a positive commandment,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 154) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 85) consider this to be one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> as [Exodus 23:12] states, \"And you shall rest on the seventh day.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (General Principle 9), the Rambam mentions that the commandment to rest on the Sabbath is mentioned 12 times in the Torah. <i>Sefer HaKovetz</i> and others question why the Rambam cites this proof-text in particular.</i> Anyone who performs a labor on this day negates the observance of a positive commandment and also transgresses a negative commandment,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Many of the mitzvot involve a positive and a negative commandment which share a single objective.</i> for [<i>ibid.</i> 20:10] states, \"Do not perform any labor [on<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i> Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 320) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch </i>(Mitzvah 32) consider this to be one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> it].\"<br>What are the liabilities incurred by a person who performs labor [on this day]? If he does so willingly,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., without being forced by others</i> as a conscious act of defiance,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">and not inadvertently.<br>The Radbaz (Vol. V, Responsum 1510) notes that the Rambam uses the expression \"willingly, as a conscious act of defiance\" with regard to the transgressions of idolatry (<i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 3:1), the Sabbath laws, and the laws of Yom Kippur (<i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i> 1:1). With regard to all other transgressions punishable by כרת, the Rambam merely states \"as a conscious act of defiance.\"<br>The Radbaz explains that it is possible that the Rambam mentioned the concept of \"willingly\" with regard to these three transgressions because they are the first cases of כרת mentioned in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. After mentioning the concept on these three occasions, he does not think further repetition is necessary.</i> he is liable for <i>karet</i>;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">כרת means \"cut off.\" <i>Mo'ed Katan</i> 28a relates that a person liable for כרת would die prematurely, before reaching the age of fifty. The Rambam (<i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 8:1) emphasizes that being \"cut off in this world\" is not the sum total of Divine retribution for such a transgression. In addition, the person's soul is also cut off and prevented from reaching the world to come.</i> if witnesses who administer a warning are present,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As explained in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 12:1-2, punishment is not administered for the violation of a transgression unless the transgressor is made aware of the punishment he could receive for his deed.</i> he should be stoned [to death].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Numbers 15:35. This is the most severe form of execution.</i> If he performs [labor] without being conscious of the transgression,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">accidentally, performing a forbidden labor or doing so without awareness of the transgression involved</i> he is liable to bring a sin offering of a fixed nature.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam uses this term to differentiate the sin offering required from a קרבן עולה ויורד - a guilt offering - which differs depending on the financial status of the person bringing it. See <i>Hilchot Shegagot</i> 1:4.</i>",
            "Whenever the expression, \"one who performs this is liable\" is used within the context of the Sabbath laws, the intent is that he is liable for <i>karet</i>, and if witnesses are present and administer a warning, he is liable to be stoned to death. If he performs such an activity without being aware of the transgression, he is liable for a sin offering.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam is explaining that by performing a forbidden act on the Sabbath, a person incurs liability. The nature of this liability depends on his intent and on whether witnesses are present. These factors are common, however, to all the laws of the Sabbath. Therefore, in the future, all that is necessary to say is that \"the person is liable,\" and based on the principles stated here, we can determine what his liability is.</i>",
            "Whenever the expression, \"one who performs this is not liable\" is used, the intent is that he is not liable for <i>karet</i>, for [execution by] stoning, or for bringing a [sin] offering. It is, however, forbidden to perform this act on the Sabbath.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shabbat</i> 3a makes a similar statement of principle, but states that there are three exceptions to this rule. When discussing these exceptions, the Rambam deviates from the terminology used in the Talmud and states that these three acts are \"permitted.\"</i><br>In such an instance, the prohibition is Rabbinic<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our translation reflects the usual interpretation of the Hebrew expression מדברי סופרים. There are commentaries (e.g., the gloss of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> to <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 2:1) who cite the Rambam's statements in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (General Principle 2) and explain that this expression can refer to a prohibition of the Torah which is derived through the accepted traditions of Biblical exegesis. In this instance, however, the Rambam's intent is clear; the term refers to prohibitions that the Rabbis instituted on their own initiative as safeguards.</i> in origin and was instituted as a safeguard against [the performance of] labor. A person who performs such an act is given \"stripes for defiance.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam discusses this punishment in <i>Hilchot Edut</i> 18:6, explaining that the person is flogged to the extent of the court's discretion (in contrast to the number of lashes received for the violation of a Torah command, which is fixed at 39). Other authorities offer different interpretations.</i>Similarly, whenever the expressions \"this should not be performed...\" or \"it is forbidden to do this on the Sabbath\" are used, a person who performs such an act as a conscious act of rebellion<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shoshanat Ha'amakim</i> states that this expression implies that a person must be given a warning before such a punishment is administered.</i> is given \"stripes for defiance.\"",
            "Whenever the expression, \"it is permissible to do this\" is used, the intent is that, at the outset, one may perform this act.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., there is no prohibition whatsoever for performing the act in question.</i> Similarly, whenever the expressions, \"one is under no obligation\" or \"one is not liable at all\" are used, one does not receive any punishment at all [for performing such an act.]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This expression implies that, at the outset, it is improper to perform such an act. Nevertheless, doing so does not warrant punishment (<i>Maggid Mishneh, Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i>",
            "It is permissible to perform an act that is permitted on the Sabbath, despite the fact that it is possible - but it is not an absolute certainty<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If, however, it is certain that the forbidden labor will be performed, it is prohibited to perform the permitted act, as explained in the following halachah.</i> - that, [as a result of one's actions], a forbidden labor<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbenu Avraham, the Rambam's son (<i>Birkat Avraham</i> 9), explains that by using the term \"forbidden labor\" in this and the following halachah, the Rambam implies that there is a difficulty only if a prohibition from the Torah is involved. If merely a Rabbinic prohibition is concerned, it is permitted without question. This question is also discussed by the <i>Mishneh L'Melech</i>.</i> will be performed, provided one does not have the intent to perform that labor.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's decision is the subject of a difference of opinion between Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. (See <i>Beitzah</i> 23b and other sources.) Rabbi Shimon maintains that although a forbidden labor results from a person's activity, since he did not desire that this labor be performed, he is not held liable. Rabbi Yehudah, in contrast, holds the person liable, for his actions brought about the performance of a forbidden labor.<br>The commentaries explain Rabbi Shimon's opinion based on the principle (<i>Chaggigah</i> 10b) that \"The Torah prohibited purposeful labor [on the Sabbath].\" A deed is forbidden only when it is associated with a purposeful intent. (See also the notes on Halachah 7.)<br>The concept discussed in this halachah, אינו מתכוין, differs from an ordinary example of a labor performed unintentionally. When we speak of a labor performed unintentionally (בשוגג), the person had no thought whatsoever of performing a forbidden activity. In the case of אינו מתכוין, by contrast, the person performs an act consciously with the knowledge that there is a possibility that it may lead to a forbidden act. Nevertheless, since there is no certainty that the transgression will be committed, he is not held liable.<br>Although this principle is applicable to the Sabbath laws in particular, the difference of opinion between these two sages on this issue is relevant, not only to the Sabbath laws, but to all other prohibitions in the Torah as well.<br>Based on <i>Pesachim</i> 25b-26b, it appears that one is allowed to perform an activity that may result in the incidental performance of a forbidden labor even when one has an alternative manner of accomplishing one's objective, which does not involve any risk of a forbidden labor being performed. See <i>Hilchot Kilayim</i> 10:16.</i><br>What is implied? A person may drag a bed, a chair, a bench<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our text follows the standard published text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, which quotes the text of <i>Shabbat</i> 22b. The original manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> substitute מגדל, \"cabinet,\" instead of ספסל, \"bench.\"</i> and the like [on the ground] on the Sabbath, provided he does not intend to gouge out a groove in the earth while dragging them. Therefore, even if he did gouge out [a groove] in the ground [while dragging them], it is of no consequence, for he did not have this intent in mind.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Digging a groove is forbidden because it is included in the category of forbidden labor, plowing. Nevertheless, since one did not intend to perform this labor, the fact that it was performed is of no consequence. Similarly, all the subsequent activities mentioned by the Rambam involve the performance of a forbidden labor without the intent to do so.</i><br>Similarly, a person may tread on grass on the Sabbath, as long as his intent is not to uproot it. Thus, should it be uprooted, that is of no consequence. Also, a person may rub powdered herbs and the like over his hands, provided he does not intend to remove his hair.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 22, Halachah 13.</i> Therefore, if the hair is removed, it is of no consequence. Based on the same rationale, one may enter a narrow opening on the Sabbath even though, [while doing so,] one causes pieces of the wall to fall. Similarly, it is permissible to perform any act with similar repercussions, provided that one does not have the intent of doing so.",
            "[In contrast,] when one performs a deed that results in the performance of a forbidden labor, and it is a certainty that this deed will cause [that labor] to be performed, one is liable<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned in Halachah 2, the use of this term implies that the prohibition has its source in the Torah itself (the Rambam's son, Rabbenu Avraham). Although some authorities have explained that since the person had no intent for the labor itself, the prohibition is only Rabbinic in nature, from the Rambam's perspective it appears that since he knows that the labor will be performed, it is considered as if he performed it intentionally.</i> even though one did not intend [to perform the forbidden labor].<br>What is implied? A person needs a fowl's head to serve as a toy for a child, and therefore cuts off the [fowl's] head on the Sabbath; although his ultimate purpose is not merely to slaughter the chicken,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The addition of the word \"merely\" implies that the person has a desire to slaughter the fowl. Albeit, his desire may not be to kill the fowl for food, but even for use as a toy it is preferable that the fowl be dead than alive.<br>This leads to another concept. The <i>Aruch</i> states that a person is not held liable when he performs an act that will inevitably bring about the commission of a forbidden labor, if he is displeased with the fact that the labor was committed (פסיק רישא דלא ניחא ליה). In his notes on Chapter 10, Halachah 17, Rabbenu Chayim Soloveitchik states that the Rambam also subscribes to this opinion.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 320:18) gives an example of this situation: The plug of a barrel of wine was closed with flax. Although some wine will inevitably be squeezed out when the barrel is unplugged - and squeezing is a forbidden labor - since the wine that is squeezed out will be lost, there is no prohibition.<br>This opinion is not, however, accepted by all authorities.<i> Tosafot</i> and Rabbenu Asher in their glosses on <i>Shabbat</i> 103a differ and maintain that, since it is inevitable that a forbidden labor will be performed, such an act is forbidden by Rabbinic decree. From the wording of the <i>Shulchan Aruch's</i> statements, it would appear that it is preferable to follow the more stringent view, but that the more lenient perspective has become popularly accepted.</i> he is liable. It is obvious that it is impossible for the head of a living being to be cut off and for that being to survive. Instead, the [fowl's] death came about because of [this activity]. [Therefore, he is liable.] The same applies in other similar situations.",
            "Anyone who performs a [forbidden] labor - even if he has no need for the actual labor he performed - is liable for his deed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This also represents a difference of opinion between Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, as evident from <i>Shabbat</i> 29b-30a, 73b, and other sources.<br>As in the laws mentioned in Halachah 7, the source of their difference of opinion is Rabbi Shimon's principle, \"the Torah prohibited purposeful labor [on the Sabbath].\" To explain: The prohibition against labor on the Sabbath is derived from the labors performed to construct the Sanctuary (see the commentary on Chapter 7, Law 1), and with regard to the construction of the Sanctuary, the Torah uses the expression, מלאכת מחשבת, \"contemplative work.\" Accordingly, Rabbi Shimon maintains that the Torah's prohibition against labor is related to thought. Only when one's actions are purposeful can they be forbidden.<br>For this reason, Rabbi Shimon maintains - as explained in Halachah 5 - that when a person performs a forbidden labor without the intention to do so (אינו מתכוין), he is not liable. Although a forbidden activity results from his conduct, since his thought was not involved in the matter, his work does not resemble the labor that was necessary to construct the Sanctuary. Hence, one is not held liable for such labor on the Sabbath.<br>In the situation at hand, a מלאכה שאינה צריכה לגופה, the person performing the forbidden labor is doing so intentionally. Nevertheless, since his intent is not the same as that ordinarily associated - or according to some authorities, associated at the time of the construction of the Sanctuary - with this labor, he is not held liable. (See the comments of Rabbenu Avraham, the Rambam's son, quoted by the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.)<br>Rabbi Yehudah differs on both issues, maintaining that since the performance of a forbidden labor results from this person's conscious activity, he is held liable. The Rambam (following the opinion of Shemuel, <i>Zevachim</i> 92a) accepts Rabbi Shimon's view with regard to אינו מתכוין, but follows Rabbi Yehudah's view with regard to a מלאכה שאינה צריכה לגופה.<br>The difference between these opinions can be explained based on the interpretation of the command תשבות, \"rest,\" on which basis we observe the Sabbath laws. We find another difference of opinion between Rabbi Yehudah and the other Sages (<i>Pesachim</i> 27a) concerning a word with a similar root. With regard to the command (Exodus 12:15 , תשביתו שאור, \"destroy leaven,\" Rabbi Yehudah maintains that leaven must be burned. The other Sages (including Rabbi Shimon) maintain that leaven may be destroyed be other means.<br>What is the difference between them? Rabbi Yehudah maintains that the destruction of leaven must be utter and complete as possible, while the Sages maintain that all that is necessary is to negate its usefulness (potential for purposeful use). Similarly, in the present instance, Rabbi Yehudah explains that all semblances of labor are forbidden on the Sabbath. In contrast, Rabbi Shimon maintains that only purposeful labor is forbidden; only when both the activity and the intent for which it is performed are analogous to the activities performed to construct the Sanctuary is a transgression committed. (See <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 7, p. 190-191.)<br>Shemuel and the Rambam take an intermediate position. They agree with Rabbi Shimon that an activity must be coupled with a purposeful intent, but maintain that since a מלאכה שאינה צריכה לגופה is an intentional act, it is forbidden as such a combination.<br>It must be noted that the Rambam's view is not accepted by all authorities. The Ra'avad, <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Zevachim, ibid.</i>) and subsequent Ashkenazic authorities state that Rabbi Shimon's opinion is accepted in both these instances. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 278:1, 334:12) accepts <i>Tosafot's</i> decision. Nevertheless, even the authorities who accept Rabbi Shimon's view maintain that, if there is no danger to the community involved, a מלאכה שאינה צריכה לגופה is forbidden according to Rabbinic decree.</i><br>What is implied? A person extinguished a lamp because he needed [to save] the oil or the wick from being destroyed or from burning or so that the earthenware reservoir of the lamp [that holds the oil] would not break. Since he had the intent of extinguishing the lamp, even though he did not do so for the [usual] purpose of extinguishing,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., his intent in extinguishing the lamp was not to produce coals to use for kindling an even flame, the purpose for which extinguishing was performed in constructing the Sanctuary.</i> but merely for the sake of the oil, the wick or the earthenware, he is liable.<br>Similarly, a person who moves a thorn four cubits in the public domain or extinguishes a coal so that many people will not be injured by it, is liable. Although the [usual] purpose [served] by extinguishing [the coal] or moving [the thorn] is not important to him,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., when constructing the Sanctuary, articles were transported because they were desired, and coals were extinguished to use for kindling an even flame.</i> and his intent was merely to prevent injury, he is liable. The same applies in other similar situations.",
            "Whenever a person intends to perform a forbidden labor, but instead [through his actions] causes the performance of another forbidden labor for which he had no intent, he is not liable, because his intent was not carried out.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although the instance stated by the Rambam is not found in the Talmud, it is a logical extension of the principle stated in <i>Keritot</i> 19b and <i>Shabbat</i> 97b (and expressed in the following halachah), \"The Torah prohibited purposeful labor [on the Sabbath].\" Since the labor ultimately performed was not the one originally intended, this is not considered to be \"purposeful work.\"</i><br>What is implied? A person threw a stone or shot an arrow at a colleague or at an animal with the intent of slaying them. Should [the object that he propelled] uproot a tree in its progress and not kill [the intended victim], he is free of liability.<br>How much more so does this principle apply if one had the intent of performing a lesser transgression and one performed a more serious one. For example, a person intended to throw [a stone] into a<i> carmelit,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As explained in Chapter 14, Halachah 4, a <i>carmelit</i> is a domain in which the Sages applied the prohibitions against transporting and throwing articles which apply in the public domain by virtue of Torah law. Thus, the person had the intent of violating merely a Rabbinic law.</i> and instead, the stone passed into the public domain.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> draws attention to Chapter 13, Halachah 21, which states that even when a person intended to throw an object four cubits in the public domain and instead the object traveled eight cubits, he is not held liable, because he did not accomplish his intent. Hence, he explains that the intent is not that the public domain is beyond the<i> carmelit</i> and the object did not rest in the <i>carmelit</i> as intended, but rather continued to the public domain.<br>Instead, the Rambam is referring to an instance where a person is standing in a private domain with both a public domain and a <i>carmelit</i> before him. Although he intended to throw the object into the <i>carmelit</i>, it traveled into the public domain.</i> He is not held liable. The same applies in other similar circumstances.<br>Should a person have the intent of performing a permitted act and instead perform another act [which is forbidden], he is not held liable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Shegagot</i> 7:11. This halachah represents a progressive sequence. In the first instance mentioned, the forbidden activity the person intended to perform was not performed at all. In the second instance, he intended to perform the forbidden activity - removing an object from his property - but his intent was not to transgress a Torah prohibition. In this third instance, the person had the intent of performing the activity that he performed for the sake of the result that activity produced. Nevertheless, since he desired to perform this activity with a permitted entity and that aspect of the desire was not fulfilled, he is not held liable (Rav Kapach).</i> For example, should he intend to cut produce that was not attached to the ground, and instead cut produce attached to the ground,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> offers two different interpretations of the Rambam's words: one that the person cut a different plant from the one he intended to cut, and one that he thought the plant he intended to cut had been detached from the earth, and discovered that it was attached. Although, both interpretations are halachically acceptable, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> favors the second one. The <i>Kovetz</i> and other authorities, however, favor the first.</i> he is not held liable. The same applies in other similar situations.",
            "Should a person intend<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This halachah develops the theme stated in the previous halachah, giving a further example of a case where a person is not held liable for a forbidden activity he performed, because of the principle, \"The Torah prohibited purposeful labor [on the Sabbath].\"</i> to pick black figs and pick white figs instead<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The difference in the color of the figs causes them to be regarded as two different types of fruit. This is significant, as is obvious from the contrast to the following halachah.</i> - or should he intend first to pick figs and then to pick grapes, but instead picked grapes and then figs - he is not liable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad takes issue with this point, arguing that since the person picking the fruit accomplished his objective, he should be held liable. It is insignificant that the order in which he picked them differed from that which he originally intended.<br>It can be explained, based on <i>Keritot</i> 19b, that the Rambam's understanding is that for a person to be held liable, not only must he accomplish his ultimate intent, but also, while he is performing the labor, his actions must be controlled by his thoughts.<br>Commenting on the difference of opinion between the Rambam and the Ra'avad, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> notes that there is no difference regarding practical halachah at present. The only difference will be in the Era of the Redemption, at which time there will be a question whether it is necessary for such a person to bring a sin offering or not, and in that era, \"the righteous instructor (<i>Mashiach</i>) will come\" and render a decision.</i> He in fact picked everything that he desired, but because he did not pick them in the order that he intended, he is not held liable, since he did not act according to his intent. It is \"purposeful labor\" that the Torah forbade.",

Although asking a gentile to perform a forbidden labor is also prohibited by the Rabbis, some commentaries make a distinction between such a prohibition and a prohibition that involves the performance of an activity.<br>The wording chosen by the Rambam in this halachah and in Chapter 21, Halachah 31, has left room for speculation concerning his ruling on this question. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam allows the performance of any activity even when there is a Rabbinic prohibition involved. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> differs, and explains that according to the Rambam, any activity forbidden by the Rabbis may not be performed despite the fact that a person is bedridden by illness.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) does not follow either of the interpretations of the Rambam's view, but instead suggests following the opinion of the Ramban, who permits the performance of any activity forbidden by the Rabbis, provided that it is performed in an abnormal manner. Furthermore, if there is a danger to a specific limb, the Rabbinic prohibitions are waived, and such activities may be performed in the normal manner. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 328:19 is even more lenient and allows one to perform activities that are forbidden by the Torah itself, provided one performs them in an uncharacteristic manner.</i> they may be treated even by Jews.

Others translate the term as a woman being bent over with labor pains. Compare to Halachah 13, which mentions the possibility of performing forbidden labors on a woman's behalf from the time \"when there is a show of blood.\" See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 330:3), which mentions both these terms and also refers to the condition when a woman is overcome by labor pains to the point where she must be carried by her friends. Any one of these three conditions constitutes a danger to life for which the Sabbath laws may be broken.</i> her life is considered in danger and the Sabbath laws may be violated on her behalf. A midwife may be called from a distant place<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 18:3) states that this leniency applies even when she lives beyond the Sabbath limits (see Chapter 27).

If it is possible to reduce the extent to which they are violated, one should do so.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> postulates that the Rambam would not require such stringencies at all times. Were that the case, the Rambam would have stated this principle earlier. Instead, this is a specific ruling applicable with regard to a woman in childbirth. Greater stringency is applied in this instance, because although there is a threat to the woman's life, the probability of a woman's actually dying is very low. (It can be explained that the difference of opinion between the Ramban and the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> revolves around the question whether the Sabbath laws are דחויה or הותרה in the face of a danger to life, as explained in the notes on Halachot 1 and 2.)</i> If this not possible, it may be brought in the ordinary manner.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note <i>Sefer HaChasidim</i>, which states that it is preferable that a woman prepare everything necessary for childbirth from the ninth month onward, so that if she gives birth on the Sabbath, only a minimal amount of forbidden labor will have to be performed.</i>",
            "We should not help an idolatress<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The term \"idolatress\" is used here to refer to a gentile who actually worships idols. In contrast, the term <i>ger toshav</i> refers to a gentile who accepts the seven universal laws commanded to Noah and his descendants. (See <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 9:1-2 and <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 10:6.)<br>In <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 10:2, the Rambam writes that it is forbidden to offer medical treatment to an idolater even for a fee. Accordingly, this halachah extends that principle to include a woman in childbirth. The question is raised, however, concerning the majority of the gentiles in the present age. Although the Rambam considers Christianity as idol worship, many authorities do not. According to the latter opinions, although these gentiles are not idolaters, they have not gone through the formal process of acceptance of the seven laws commanded to Noach and cannot therefore be considered as <i>gerim toshavim</i>.<br>Many authorities (see the commentary on the Moznaim edition of<i> Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i>) maintain that it is permitted to treat such people during the week. On the Sabbath, however, one may not perform forbidden labors on their behalf. (See the <i>Mishnah Berurah </i>330:8, which speaks very critically about physicians who violate the Sabbath laws on behalf of gentiles.) According to these authorities, one would be allowed to treat these gentiles on the Sabbath provided that there was not any forbidden labor involved.

According to the<i> Shulchan Aruch</i>, this situation teaches us that a person is considered praiseworthy for saving a life on the Sabbath even if he accrues personal benefit through his actions - for example, in the case at hand, in addition to saving a life, the person also receives a catch of fish.</i> If one sees that a child has fallen into the sea, one may spread out a net and hoist him up, although one catches fish together with him. If a person hears that a child fell into the sea and spreads out a net to hoist him up, but raises up only fish, he is absolutely free of liability.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam adds the term \"absolutely\" to indicate that it is desirable to spread out and raise one's nets to try to save the child (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>). Significantly, the Jerusalem Talmud,<i> Shabbat</i> 13:6, states that the person is not held liable even if he intended to catch the fish together with the child.</i><br>If he intended to raise up fish and [in fact] lifted up both fish and a child, he is not held liable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Or Sameach</i> writes that he is given \"stripes for rebelliousness\" (the punishment usually given for the violation of a Rabbinic ordinance), since he intended to perform a forbidden activity. See a parallel ruling, <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 12:18.<br>Significantly, when mentioning this instance in <i>Hilchot Shegagot</i> 2:15, the Rambam states that the person acted בשוגג when catching the fish - i.e., he was unaware that it was the Sabbath or was unaware that it is forbidden to fish on the Sabbath.</i> Since he lifted up a child together with the fish, he is not held liable even when he did not hear that the child had fallen into the water.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This reflects the Rambam's decision regarding a difference of opinion between the Sages in <i>Menachot</i> 64a.

Note, however, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 329:7 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 329:17, which state that at present, even when gentiles initially come only for pillage and plunder, since they have no compunctions about killing Jews, particularly if one will defend his property, any gentile raid on a Jewish community is considered a question of life and death warranting the violation of the Sabbath laws.</i> If a city is located near the border, however, we should march against them with weapons and wage war against them even when they are demanding hay or straw.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The rationale is that if a border city is conquered, the enemies will have a vantage point from which to conquer the entire land. This concept has relevance beyond the Sabbath laws. For example, the Lubavitcher Rebbe <i>Shelita</i> has explained that these principles are relevant to the territorial disputes between Jews and gentiles in <i>Eretz Yisrael </i>today.

Rabbenu Asher (in his gloss on <i>Shabbat </i>18b) interprets these laws as applying when the oven is closed, but not sealed. According to his view, if the oven is open, there is always reason to suspect that one will stir the coals. The <i>Tur</i> and the Ramah follow this interpretation.</i><br>If, however, one sealed the opening of the oven closed with clay, [roasting even the latter meats] is permitted, for if one opens the oven to stir [the coals], the wind will enter and cause the meat to harden and spoil.

According to Rashi, it is sufficient that it is one-third cooked.<br>Rav Moshe Cohen of Lunil questions why the Rambam differentiates between roasting - where he allows food that is partially cooked to continue cooking - and cooking in a pot - where he requires the food to be completely cooked and that further cooking will not benefit it.

Nevertheless, there are certain restrictions instituted against leaving food to cook, lest one stir the coals, as explained.</i> Instead, they are Rabbinic decrees [enacted] lest one stir the coals.

In his Commentary on the Mishnah,<i> Shabbat </i>1:10, he rules that the outer surface must crust before the Sabbath. (The latter ruling also conforms to his thesis regarding cooked food: that it must be completely cooked before the commencement of the Sabbath.) It must be emphasized that the version of this halachah found in the authoritative manuscripts and early printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> are in accordance with the ruling in the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah. Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 254:5) follows the more lenient ruling.</i> [Should this be done,] it is permissible to leave it to continue baking afterwards, for if one stirs [the coals], one will spoil the bread.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., cause it to burn.</i><br>[The following rules apply when one places bread in an oven] before nightfall and there is not sufficient time for its surface to crust before nightfall.

From this, one can postulate that if a person has no food other than that which has been left on a fire on the Sabbath, he is allowed to partake of that food so that he will not be required to fast on the Sabbath.</i> When one removes the bread, one should not remove it using a baker's peel as one does during the week.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the removal of bread is forbidden, it should be done in an abnormal manner. The commentaries question whether one is required to remove the bread in an abnormal manner only when it was placed in the oven later than the desired time, or whether this is necessary even when the bread was permitted to be left baking.<br>From the <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> notes on Chapter 5, Halachah 19, and from the simple interpretation of Chapter 22, Halachah 1, it would appear that one is always required to remove the bread in an abnormal manner. Nevertheless, Rabbenu Nissim maintains that this stringency applies only when one placed the bread in the oven after the desired time. If one placed the bread inside earlier, there is no necessity to deviate from one's ordinary practice. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 254:36 accepts this ruling when there is no way that one can remove the bread in an abnormal way.<br>It must be emphasized that the above discussion applies only to the ovens of the Talmudic period. At present, our ovens are constructed in a different manner, and the loaves of bread are not stuck to the sides of the oven. Accordingly, any bread that is required for the Sabbath itself can be removed in an ordinary manner.

This also follows the pattern of the Mishnah which discusses the kindling of the Sabbath lamps in the first two chapters of the tractate.</i> is not a matter left to our volition - i.e., [it is not a matter about which,] if one desires, one may kindle it, but if one does not desire, one need not. Nor is it a mitzvah that we are not obligated to pursue<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:2; the Rambam differentiates between mitzvot that are obligations that a person must endeavor to fulfill, mentioning tefillin which is a daily obligation and sukkah and lulav which are obligations that are incumbent on us at a certain time each year, and mitzvot \"that are not obligations, but resemble voluntary activities.\"<br>In the latter category, he includes mitzvot that we are obligated to fulfill only when we put ourselves in a situation that require it - e.g., the mitzvah of mezuzah.

If, however, he chooses to do so, he must fulfill that mitzvah.<br>Similarly, with regard to the mitzvot mentioned by Rambam in this halachah: There is no necessity to eat bread or other foods that require washing our hands, nor is it necessary to carry in a courtyard (or perform any of the other activities that require an <i>eruv</i>).<br>(<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i> comments that the Rambam chose the washing of the hands and <i>eruv</i> as examples in this halachah, because they - like the kindling of the Sabbath candles - are Rabbinic commandments.<br>See also <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i> 3:10 which mentions another dimension of the obligatory nature of this mitzvah.)</i> - e.g., making an <i>eruv</i> for a courtyard or washing one's hands before eating.

One defines <i>beyn hash'mashot</i> as the amount of time needed to walk four <i>mil</i> after sunset, and the other, as the time necessary to walk five <i>mil</i>.<br>There are two different opinions concerning the duration of the time it takes to walk a <i>mil</i>. The Rambam, Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Pesachim</i> 3:2), maintains that it takes 24 minutes to walk a <i>mil</i>. However, the most widely held opinion - and the opinion accepted regarding <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>, is that it takes 18 minutes to walk this distance.<br>The Rambam as well as many other <i>Rishonim</i> base their determination of <i>beyn hash'mashot</i> on <i>Shabbat</i> 34b. Thus in practice, the appearance of the stars is determined as 13 1/2 (3/4 x 18) minutes after sunset. Both the Vilna Gaon and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> maintain that this is the duration of <i>beyn hash'mashot</i>. Thus, the proper local time may be calculated by extrapolation based on the amount of light visible 13 1/2 minutes after sunset in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> on the day of the equinox.

Since he worked on a monthly basis, he is entitled to payment for all ten days he worked, including the Sabbath. This, however, is a delicate manner, and the exact wording of the contract between an employer and employee should be checked with a Rabbinic authority to prevent any problems from arising in this regard.<br>It must be emphasized that the same principles also apply with regard to the rental of homes, or money lent at interest to a gentile.

There is a question if this difference in sources creates a difference in law as well. See also the preface to <i>Eglei Tal,</i> which questions whether the definition of the categories of forbidden labor are taken from the activities necessary for the offering of the sacrifices in the Sanctuary, or merely the activities necessary for construction of the Sanctuary.

The threads of the warp are passed through these loops, one from one frame, and the next from the other, consecutively. When this is completed, the weaver lifts the two frames alternately.

If, however, one causes external bleeding, one is liable.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 316:8) accepts the opinion of the other authorities. This decision depends on the difference of opinion mentioned in note 31 as to the category of forbidden labor of which causing bleeding is a derivative. As mentioned, the Rambam considers this activity a derivative of the labor of threshing, and threshing involves removing a substance from a hard shell. Since the hides of the other crawling animals are not tough, causing them to bleed cannot be considered a derivative of this labor. According to the opinion that bleeding is a derivative of slaughtering, however, one is liable for making any animal bleed, regardless of the nature of its hide (<i>Ziv HaMishneh</i>).<br>The question whether one may kill creeping animals that are dangerous is discussed in Chapter 10, Halachah 25 and notes.</i><br>One who wounds an animal, beast, fowl, or one of the above-mentioned eight creeping animals is liable whether he caused an open wound from which they bled or he made a bruise that caused internal bleeding.",

With regard to other fruits, by contrast, it is not as common to use them for juice. From his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 22:1), it appears that the Rambam also accepts this rationale.<br>(Rabbenu Nissim gives another reason: The juices of other fruits are not considered as liquids, but as food. See <i>Hilchot Tum'at Ochalin</i> 1:4. The <i>Pri Megadim</i> and others consider these as two separate rationales.)<br>Note Chapter 21, Halachah 12, which states that there is a Rabbinic prohibition against squeezing other fruits that are frequently used for juice (<i>Shabbat</i> 144b gives as examples, berries and pomegranates). If, however, it is not common to use a fruit for juice, there is no prohibition at all against squeezing juice from it. Note also the discussion in the <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 320) regarding squeezing lemons to make lemonade.</i><br>It is, [however,] permitted to squeeze a cluster of grapes directly into food, since a liquid that is absorbed into food is considered as food.

The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 319:17 notes that some texts of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> also do not include it.<br>According to those versions that do include it, the intent is that using only one hand is not considered an abnormal way of performing this labor.</i> A person who separates <i>turmos</i> beans from their shucks is liable, for the shucks sweeten them when they are cooked together.

Separating food and setting it aside to be used later is not necessary to allow one to eat normally. Hence, it is considered in the category of this forbidden labor (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 1-2).</i> even later on [the Sabbath] itself, is considered to have separated for the purpose of storage and is held liable.<br>If there were two types of food mixed together before a person, he may separate one from the other and place it aside to eat immediately.

The only filtering that is permitted is filtering wine that is already fit to be drunk, so that it will become crystal clear. One might ask: Of what value is such an act? The answer is that precisely because most people would not consider this activity of value, and only the most spoiled individuals would require it, is it permitted. (According to the Rashba, such beverages may even be filtered with an ordinary filter.) Though the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 319:10) mentions the Rambam's view, the Rashba's ruling is favored.</i><br>We may pour water over wine dregs<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The dregs were placed in a strainer on Friday, and one desires to pour the water over them on the Sabbath day (Rav Ovadiah of Bertinoro, <i>Shabbat</i> 20:2).</i> so they will become clear.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To remove any residue of wine that might be left in the dregs (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> [Similarly,] we may place a raw egg in a mustard strainer so that it becomes clear.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The intent is to mix the egg with mustard lying at the bottom of the strainer that has already been strained before the Sabbath (<i>Shabbat</i> 134a). In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 20:2), the Rambam states that when raw eggs are mixed with coarse foods, they cause the lighter matter to rise above the heavier, coarse matter. Thus, by mixing the egg with the mustard, one will cause it to undergo a further process of refinement. Nevertheless, this is not included in the forbidden labor of separating.<br>It must be noted that the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 319) explains that the problem in question in this instance is that the egg yolk will pass through the strainer, while the albumen will not. Nevertheless, this is not considered a derivative of the forbidden labor of separating. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 319:15) follows this interpretation.</i><br>When one has mixed mustard on Friday, one may stir it by hand or with a utensil to make it fit to drink [on the Sabbath].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the mustard is already strained and is fit to be used, there is no difficulty in stirring it further. (See also Chapter 22, Halachah 12.)</i> Similarly, while wine is in the process of fermentation, one may pour out a barrel of wine together with the dregs over handkerchiefs, for the dregs have not been finely separated from the wine and they are still considered a single mixture.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 139b, explains that this straining process will not be very effective. Hence, it is permitted. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 319:14 focuses on the Rambam's words and explains that since the wine and the dregs are considered a single mixture, the forbidden labor of separation does not apply. The concept of separation applies when the desired entity and the dregs are distinct, and this is not true until the wine has completed the fermentation process.</i> The same applies to mustard and all similar substances.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., although it is forbidden to strain mustard using a strainer on the Sabbath, one may strain it through a handkerchief (<i>Or Sameach</i>).</i>",

Since a woman could remove the garment by untying only one strap and slipping it over her head, there is reason to think that one of the knots would be considered as permanent, and therefore forbidden to be tied on the Sabbath.

Since tying the animal does not necessitate using a knot that requires professional expertise, the Rambam would not consider it prohibited according to Torah law. And as the Rambam states, since the intention is not to leave the animal tied permanently, there is no reason for even a Rabbinic prohibition. Nevertheless, since it is forbidden to use a rope on the Sabbath unless it was designated for use beforehand, one may not bring a rope from home. If one tied the rope to the animal or to the feeding trough before the commencement of the Sabbath, however, it is obvious that one intended to use it on the Sabbath.</i> one may bring it and tie it to both the cow and the feeding trough.<br>[The rationale for these laws is that] all [the above] knots do not require professional expertise, nor are they intended to remain.

He maintains, however, that a person who performs these actvities is liable, the liability stemming from other categories of forbidden labors;<br>c) That of Rashi (<i>Shabbat</i> 42a, 134a), which holds a person liable for kindling metal, but exempts him for extinguishing. (See also the <i>Sefer Yereim</i>, which explains that, in the construction of the Sanctuary, the heating of metal and its refinement was necessary for the goldsmiths and silversmiths.)<br>Rav Kapach explains the Rambam's position, emphasizing that there is a difference between iron and other metals. All other metals are made more pliable when heated. In contrast, as iron is made into steel, it becomes harder when heated and then placed into water. Therefore, just as the labors of kindling and extinguishing are associated with making charcoal - a new entity - so, too, it is these categories of labor that relate to the process of making steel. (See also the responsum of Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, mentioned in the notes on the following halachah.)</i>",
            "A person who extinguishes [a fire]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is one of the 39 categories of labor forbidden on the Sabbath. Extinguishing was necessary for the construction of the Sanctuary, because it was used to create coals that were needed for the fires used to cook the herbs used for dye. Although these fires could also have been heated with wood, a fire heated with coals burns better (<i>Kiryat Sefer</i>).<br>See also the <i>Sefer Yereim</i> which mentions that extinguishing was necessary for the work of the goldsmiths and silversmiths.</i> of even the smallest size is liable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Regardless of the size of the fire, a piece of charcoal is created.</i> [This includes both] one who extinguishes a candle and one who extinguishes a coal that comes from wood.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned in the notes on Chapter 1, Halachah 7, this ruling follows the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah, who maintains that one is liable for the performance of a [forbidden] labor even if he has no need for the actual labor he performed (a מלאכה שאינה צריכה לגופה).<br>As mentioned in the notes on that halachah, many authorities, including the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 27:1, 334:27, differ and do not hold a person liable in such an instance. According to these authorities, a person is liable for extinguishing only when he requires the coals produced.</i> In contrast, a person who extinguishes a glowing piece of metal is not liable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In one of his responsa, Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, mentions the difference between a glowing piece of metal and a coal that comes from wood. When a fire fueled with wood is extinguished, a new entity - charcoal - is produced. Hence, one is liable for performing a forbidden labor. In contrast, when a glowing piece of metal is extinguished, no change is made in the metal itself unless the metal was heated with the intent of purifying it.<br>It must be noted that there are authorities who preceded the Rambam - Rav Yehudai Gaon, Rav Hai Gaon, and Rabbenu Chanan'el - who hold a person liable for extinguishing a glowing piece of metal. As mentioned in the notes on the previous halachah, most of the authorities in the Rambam's era, and surely those in the subsequent eras, exempt a person for such an activity.<br>It also must be noted that different rulings apply with regard to extinguishing an electric light or heater. In this instance, there are recent authorities who maintain that one is surely liable for kindling and extinguishing glowing metal. (See <i>Achiezer</i>, Vol. III, Responsum 60 and <i>Tzafenat Paneach</i>, Responsum 273.)</i><br>If, however, the person's intent is to purify the metal, he is liable. This indeed is the practice of blacksmiths; they heat the iron until it glows like a coal, and extinguish it in water to seal it. This is the process of purification for which one is liable. It is a derivative [of the category of forbidden labor] of extinguishing.<br>It is permissible to extinguish a glowing piece of metal<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Rambam, this applies only with regard to a glowing piece of metal and not to a burning coal. The authorities who maintain that one is not liable for performing a מלאכה שאינה צריכה לגופה, however, would allow one to extinguish a burning coal in this instance. Because of the danger involved, the Rabbinic prohibition against performing such an activity is waived (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 334:27).</i> in the public domain so that many people will not be injured by it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned above, although there is a Rabbinic prohibition involved, it is waived because of the danger.</i><br>A person who pours oil into a burning lamp is liable for kindling. [Similarly,] a person who takes oil from a lamp is liable for extinguishing.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that seemingly the opinions that do not accept Rabbi Yehudah's view regarding a מלאכה שאינה צריכה לגופה would not hold the person liable unless his intent in extinguishing the candle was for the charcoal produced. See the commentaries on the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 365:1).</i>",
            "Should a fire break out on the Sabbath, a person is liable if he extinguishes it because of fear of monetary loss.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As the Ra'avad emphasizes, this ruling follows those views which maintain that a person is liable for performing a מלאכה שאינה צריכה לגופה. According to the view which differs, even though it is forbidden to extinguish a fire to save one's money, one would not be liable. This allows for greater leniencies, as will be explained.</i> It is only the threat of loss of life,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Needless to say, if there is a threat to life the fire may be extinguished.</i> and not monetary loss, that supersedes the Sabbath prohibitions.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 2, Halachah 23.</i><br>Therefore, all people should leave [the area of the blaze] so they do not die. They should let the fire continue to burn, even if it consumes the entire city.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 334:26) follows the view that one is not liable for performing a מלאכה שאינה צ ריכה לגופה, and the prohibition against extinguishing a fire is merely Rabbinic in nature. Accordingly, he states that in the present time, it is permissible to extinguish a fire that has begun to blaze in a city.<br>In his time, it was common for the commotion caused by a fire to serve as an invitation for the gentiles to raid the Jewish quarters of the city, rampaging, pillaging, and creating havoc. In such a situation, it was very possible that Jewish lives would be threatened. Hence, he maintains that it is preferable for the fire to be extinguished than for such a situation to be created. Furthermore, in the cramped conditions of the ghettos, it was highly possible that the lives of the children, the elderly, and the disabled would be threatened by a fire.<br>Nevertheless, even the Ramah did not grant wholesale leniency on this matter and stated that, in practice, the ruling must be determined on the basis of our appreciation of whether there is a threat to life according to the circumstances at hand. Contemporary authorities add that because of the threat of electrical fires, gas explosions, and the like, a fire constitutes a real danger and should not be allowed to spread.</i>",

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 334:22) quotes the Rambam's ruling that it is permitted to cause a fire to be extinguished indirectly.

Furthermore, it is permissible to do so. Since it is not a certainty (פסיק רישא, see Chapter 1, Halachah 6) that the fire will be extinguished, this was not forbidden.<br>The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 334) states that one may not have the intention of extinguishing the fire, but merely of preventing it from spreading further. Note the difference of opinion between the <i>Magen Avraham</i> and the <i>Turei Zahav</i> if that ruling is accepted.</i> Similarly, if a Torah scroll has caught fire, one may unroll it and read from it, if [in the process, the fire] is extinguished, it is not significant. One may place water<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tosafot, Shabbat</i> 120a, accept the basis of the ruling cited by the Rambam, but maintain that one must use liquids other than water. Pouring water over a garment resembles the forbidden activity of laundering and is not permitted on the Sabbath, even in this situation. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 334:24) favors <i>Tosafot's</i> opinion.</i> on the portion that has not yet caught fire, if [in the process, the fire] is extinguished, it is not significant.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Based on <i>Shabbat</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi and the Ra'avad differ and forbid this leniency. They maintain that although it is permitted to cause a fire to be extinguished indirectly, placing water in such proximity to the fire is no longer considered an indirect activity. As obvious from the previous note, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) does not accept this opinion.</i><br>If a person left a burning candle on a board,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., it was not placed there with the intention that it remain there on the Sabbath (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 277:12).</i> one may shake the board, causing the candle to fall. If it is extinguished, it is not significant.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The commentaries have raised many questions about this ruling, since it is almost certain that the candle will be extinguished when it falls. Although the person does not intend to extinguish the candle, since this is an inevitable result of his actions (פסיק רישא), seemingly, it should be forbidden, as stated in Chapter 1, Halachah 6. (Note, however, <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 277:14). For this reason, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 277:3) states that this applies only with regard to a wax candle or an oil lamp if the oil has already burned out. In this instance, it is possible that the candle will continue burning even if it falls. In contrast, an oil lamp that contains oil may not be moved in this manner.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, however, explains that the Rambam's ruling can be accepted even with regard to an oil lamp which contains oil. The <i>Aruch</i> states that a person is not held liable when he performs an act that will inevitably bring about the commission of a forbidden labor, if he is displeased with the fact that the labor was committed (פסיק רישא דלא ניחא ליה). To apply that concept to the present situation, although spilling the oil from the lamp is considered as extinguishing the lamp, since th person did not intentionally desire to spill it and he regrets the loss of the oil, he should not be held liable. The commentaries also point to several other rulings that indicate that the Rambam accepts this principle.</i> If he [intentionally] placed it down [before] nightfall, it is forbidden to move [the board]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our translation is a slight extension of the actual text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, which states לטלטלו, concluding with a masculine suffix that seemingly refers to the candle, rather than the board. Nevertheless, as the commentaries point out, it is self-evident that the candle is forbidden to be moved. The new concept brought out by this law is that since the candle was intentionally left on the board before the commencement of the Sabbath, as explained in Chapter 25, Halachah 17, the board is considered a base for a forbidden object and is also <i>muktzeh</i>, forbidden to be moved (<i>Shulchan Aruch, loc. cit.</i>).</i> even after the candle is extinguished.",

We are not, however, obligated to prevent the gentile from performing a forbidden labor for his own sake. Thus, we cannot tell him to extinguish the fire, nor are we required to tell him to refrain from doing so. Indeed, this portion of the halachah is quoted in Halachah 4 of that chapter.</i><br>In contrast, should a child desire to extinguish [the fire], he should not be allowed if he is acting on his father's behalf.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 20:10 states, \"Do not perform any work, neither you, your son, your daughter,...\" implying that a father is responsible for seeing that his children rest on the Sabbath.

In a larger sense, it refers to the community as a whole.<br>From Chapter 24, Halachah 11, it would appear that the Jewish court is required to restrain a child from performing any violation of the Sabbath laws that originates in the Torah itself. This contradicts the Rambam's statements here and in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 17:27. Among the resolutions of this difficulty is that in the halachah cited, the Rambam is speaking about an activity that will benefit the child's father.

(See also the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Shabbat</i> 1:1, which states that transferring articles does not appear to be an activity fit to be considered a forbidden labor.)<br><i>Eruvin</i> 17b derives the prohibition against the transfer of articles from one domain to another from the exegesis of Exodus 16:29. <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Eruvin, loc. cit.; Shabbat, loc. cit.</i>) explain that both verses are necessary: one to teach that bringing an article in from the public domain to a private domain is forbidden, and the other to teach the converse, that it is forbidden to take an article out from the private domain to the public domain.<br>The Rambam (particularly according to the version of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> we have quoted) appears to view the concept of transferring as one activity which is prohibited on the basis of the oral tradition.

Among them: A person who throws an article does not have it in his power to return it. Hence, it is logical to assume that the area in the two public domains can be combined. In contrast, a person carrying an article can change his mind at any time. Therefore, it would have been possible to think that his entrance into the second public domain is an independent act.

This is problematic: Since logically a person would not be held liable in such an instance, and the obligation stems only from the parallel to the service of the Levites, why is it extended beyond the parameters of their service?

See <i>Hilchot Eiruvin</i> 1:4-5.</i> [referred to by our Sages with regard to transferring objects on the Sabbath]: a private domain,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 1:1), the Rambam describes a private domain as \"a place that is not traversed by many people.\"</i> a public domain,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam describes a public domain as \"a place traversed by many people.\"</i> a <i>carmelit</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam explains the meaning of this term: ארמלית is the Aramaic for \"widow\" and the prefix כ means \"like.\" Thus, the term means \"like a widow\" - i.e., neither an unmarried maiden nor a married woman. Similarly, since a <i>carmelit</i> is not a place traversed by many people (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 345:14), it is not classified as a public domain. Nevertheless, it is not set off from the public sufficiently to meet the criteria of a private domain.<br>(Others, based on the Jerusalem Talmud, define <i>carmelit</i> as having its root in the word <i>carmel</i>, which means \"partially ripe grain.\" The intent is also similar, an intermediate state. Note also the interpretation of Rashi mentioned below.)<br>The restrictions against carrying in a <i>carmelit</i> are Rabbinic in origin.

Rashi (<i>Eruvin</i> 6a) mentions this opinion, and it was accepted by the Ashkenazic authorities after him. The rationale for this ruling is that all the forbidden labors - and particularly, the labor of transferring - are derived from the construction of the Sanctuary. The public domain in that time was the encampment of the Jewish people in which 600,000 lived.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 345:7) mentions this view, but does not accept it. Nevertheless, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 345:11 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 345:23 write that it has already become public custom to accept the view that there is no possibility of a public domain in the present age. These texts do suggest that a God-fearing person should act stringently and should not rely on this leniency.<br>(It also must be noted that in many major cities today - e.g., New York, London, Paris - there are 600,000 people walking through a particular area. Hence, in a metropolis of this size, there are definitely places which could be categorized as public domains.)</i> Deserts,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This statement has raised many questions among the commentaries based on <i>Shabbat</i> 6b, which appears to imply that a desert was considered a public domain only when the Jews were encamped there. At the present time, a desert is considered as a <i>carmelit</i> and not as a public domain (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> attempts to resolve these difficulties by quoting a responsum of the Rambam's son, Rabbenu Avraham. Rabbenu Avraham explains that the deserts his father refers to are those wastelands that are frequently used as caravan routes. These are traversed by many merchants and are not under the control of any authority. Hence, these can surely be referred to as a public domain.<br>When defining a public domain and a <i>carmelit</i> in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 345:7, 14), Rabbi Yosef Karo does not mention a desert at all.

            "A person standing in a public domain may move [articles] throughout a private domain. Similarly, a person standing in a private domain may move [articles] within a public domain, provided he does not transfer them beyond four cubits.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In both these instances, there is not even a Rabbinic prohibition against moving the articles. As mentioned in the notes on the following halachah, Rashi and the Rashba state that this leniency applies only with regard to articles the person does not require in the domain in which he is standing. If he needs them, the Rabbis decreed that they may not be moved, lest the person forget and bring the articles into the domain where he is standing. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 350:1) appears to favor the view of these authorities.</i> If he transfers an article [beyond that distance], he is not liable, because he is located in a different domain.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad questions the Rambam's decision, noting that <i>Eruvin</i> 99a would appear to hold a person liable in such a situation. The difficulty with the Rambam's statements is compounded by the fact that the passage cited above associates the law in question with the following decision, \"A person who carries an article from the beginning [of a square] four cubits long to the end [of that square] in the public domain is liable, even when he lifts it above his head.\" Since the Rambam holds one liable in the latter instance (see Chapter 12, Halachah 14), it would seem that he would hold one liable with regard to the law under discussion. The Ra'avad's arguments are so powerful that the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> suggests amending the text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> accordingly.<br>The Radbaz (Vol. V, Responsum 1527) notes the Ra'avad's question, and states that he checked all the ancient manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> available to him, and they all state that the person is not liable. Therefore, he explains that a person is not liable for transfering an article unless he is standing in one of the domains involved in the transfer. This concept is derived from the transfer of the articles in the construction of the Sanctuary. In this instance, the people were not standing in a domain other than those involved in the transfer. Based on this foundation, he offers an interpretation - albeit a slightly strained one - for the passage in <i>Eruvin</i>.</i><br>Similarly, a person standing in a private domain may open [a door with a key<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This and the following law refer to situations where the key is located in the domain where the door is located.</i>] in a public domain.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> mentions the possibility of placing the key in the door as a forbidden transfer.

The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that although the Rambam's ruling appears most appropriate within the context of the Talmudic passage, in practice the more stringent ruling should be followed.

Significantly, this question is asked in this halachah and not in the previous one. In the previous halachah, although the conduit itself was considered a separate domain, since the opening was less than ten handbreadths, it is considered as an entrance and the enclosure is not nullified. This halachah, however, mentions an opening of more than ten cubits, an aperture which ordinarily nullifies an enclosure.</i> If there is even a small portion [of the wall] remaining on both sides of the opening, or if a portion [of the wall] four handbreadths in size remains on one side of the opening, it is permitted to carry in the entire courtyard.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Several explanations have been offered for the Rambam's ruling. Among them: the small portion of the wall which remains juts out over the water. Therefore, the opening to the courtyard is less than ten cubits (Rabbenu Yonason, commenting on Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi). The portions of the wall which remain on either side are considered like poles. As stated in Chapter 17, Halachah 7, it is permitted to carry in a courtyard with poles on either edges of the entrance to the fourth side (an ancient commentary on the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> from Egypt). See also the <i>Or Sameach</i>.</i> It is forbidden only to draw water from the conduit.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For the reasons mentioned above, the wall of the courtyard is an acceptable divider, and thus the courtyard as a whole is still considered to be a private domain. Nevertheless, since the wall was not made for the purpose of distinguishing the water that is outside the courtyard from that which is within the courtyard, a separate partition is required for that purpose (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> If, however, no portion of the wall remains, it is forbidden to carry in the entire courtyard, for it has been opened up to the sea,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When there are no portions jutting out over the water (according to the first interpretation in note 49) or when the entire wall is destroyed (according to the second), the courtyard is considered as enclosed on three sides alone and it is forbidden to carry within.</i> which is a <i>carmelit</i>.",

There must be a house that opens up to the enclosure.<br>The <i>Merkevet HaMishneh</i> states that, according to the Rambam, \"habitation\" does not necessarily mean \"human habitation.\" Therefore, the intent could be to use the enclosure as a corral for animals or the like. Rav Kapach cites the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Eruvin</i> 2:5), from which it appears that as long as there is a storage vat in the enclosure, it is considered as \"enclosed for the purpose of habitation,\" although it does not contain a house or lead to a house.<br>Thus according to the Rambam, \"everything depends on the person's intention.\" If he encloses the area for the sake of habitation, he is allowed to carry freely within it. Why is this leniency granted? Because the prohibition against carrying within such an area is Rabbinic in origin, and the Sages enforced this stringency only when a person's intent was not for the sake of habitation, for then the enclosure resembles a public domain. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 358:2), however, follows Rashi's view, that a house is required within the enclosure or the enclosure must lead to a home.</i> [After this has been done,] one may carry within the entire enclosure.<br>Moreover, even if one [did not complete the entire process at once, but rather] tore down a single cubit and re-enclosed that space for the purpose of habitation, tore down another single cubit and re-enclosed that space for the purpose of habitation<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the entire enclosure was never opened up for ten cubits at one time, one might assume that the original enclosure was never nullified.

Rav Kapach, however, notes that both the Talmud (<i>Eruvin, loc. cit.</i>) and the Rambam link this and the previous clause together. On this basis, he follows the interpretation of Rabbenu Chanan'el, which states that the unroofed area of the enclosure was originally not larger than the space for two <i>seah</i> of grain to be sown within it. Therefore, we were permitted to carry within it. When, however, the wall connecting it to the courtyard was torn down, the open space was increased and became larger than the space for two <i>seah</i> of grain to be sown within it. Hence, it became forbidden to carry within it.</i> [The rationale is:] The open space of the courtyard does not cause [carrying] to be permitted [within the enclosure].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., we do not say that the enclosure becomes considered as an extension of the courtyard.</i>",

Although the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 358:7) follows the Ra'avad's view, the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 358:55 states that the Rambam's opinion may be relied upon in time of need.</i><br>[The following rule applies when an area which is larger than the space required to sow two <i>seah</i> of grain is located on a mound:] If one builds a wall [with the intent of enclosing the area for habitation] at the edge of the mound, it is not of consequence,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We are speaking about a mound ten handbreadths high which is considered as set apart as a separate domain.

See also Halachah 12 and notes.<br>The Ra'avad, Rashi, and others follow a different text of the Talmud, which reads כל מחיצה העשויה לנח ת.

(Rav Kapach, however, cites interpretations of the <i>Geonim</i> that interpret the term \"for the sake of modesty\" literally, to change one's clothes behind.)<br>Thus, all three partitions mentioned in this halachah share the same drawback; they are not constructed in a lasting or sturdy manner.<br>In his gloss on this halachah, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> quotes the Rashba, who mentions that since all these partitions are valid according to Torah law, the expression \"they are not partitions\" must be interpreted as follows: They are not partitions constructed for the purpose of habitation. Therefore, if an area larger than 5000 square cubits is enclosed with such a partition, it is forbidden to carry within. If, however, an area less than 5000 square cubits is enclosed by such a partition, one may carry within. This opinion is quoted by the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>).<br>The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, the <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 362) and others maintain that the Rambam does not accept the Rashba's view. <i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>, however, notes that the fact that the Rambam mentions these laws directly after the laws concerning a <i>karpef</i> may have been intended to allude to the Rashba's concept.</i> is not considered a significant partition.<br>Any partition that is not ten handbreadths high is not considered to be a complete partition.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> interprets the phrase \"it is not a complete partition\" to mean: It is not a partition significant enough to cause an enclosure to be considered to be a private domain.

According to the Rambam, although the frame of an entrance enables an opening larger than ten cubits to be accepted, the opening is still considered an open space. Accordingly, if the total amount of open space on any one side of a partition exceeds the closed space, the partition is unacceptable, even though portions of the open space possess a frame of an entrance.<br>Many authorities (e.g., the Rashba and <i>Tosafot, Eruvin</i> 11a) differ and maintain that once a frame of an entrance is constructed, the space below it is deemed closed and should be considered as such when calculating whether the enclosed portion of a partition exceeds its open area. The opinion of these authorities is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 362:10). Nevertheless, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 362:19 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 362:59 state that it is proper to be stringent and follow the Rambam's ruling.<br>Rabbenu Asher cites the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Eruvin 1:9) and Kilayim</i> 4:2 as the source for the Rambam's ruling. (See also <i>Hilchot Shofar V'Sukkah V'Lulav</i> 4:12, where the Rambam accepts a more lenient view regarding the walls of a sukkah. Note also the glosses of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> there.)<br>See also the commentary of Rav Kapach, who advances an interpretation of the Rambam's statements here and in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Eruvin</i> 1:8) that maintains that the Rambam follows the view advanced by the Rashba. Even those who reject this interpretation in most instances are forced to accept it with regard to the third side of an alley, as stated in Chapter 17, Halachah 3. (Note also Chapter 17, Halachah 27.)<br>The difference between the Rambam's ruling and that of the other authorities is particularly relevant in contemporary communities that permit carrying because of an <i>eruv</i>. Most of these communities are enclosed, not by a proper wall, but by a series of \"frames of an entrance\" constructed using telephone poles and the like. According to the Rambam, these enclosures are not acceptable. Indeed, this is one of the reasons why the carefully observant refrain from carrying in these communities.</i>",

The opinion quoted by the Rambam maintains that although the Sages forbade carrying in such a domain, their prohibition is lifted because the beam serves as a distinction, setting this lane apart, physically and conceptually, from the public domain.<br>The other opinion maintains that the beam is considered to be a wall (i.e., it is considered as if there were a wall descending from the beam downward enclosing the lane).

(See the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 364:6.)</i> causing the space between them to be considered to be a private domain.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The definition of a public domain is taken from the encampment of the Jewish people in the desert, and there the public domain did not have gates (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 364:7).

Hence, even though many people walk through it, it is still considered as \"private.\"</i><br>[In practice,] the gates need not be locked at night, but they must be fit to lock.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Based on <i>Eruvin</i> 6a-b, many <i>Rishonim</i> differ with the Rambam on this point and maintain that not only must the gates be fit to be closed at night, they must actually be closed, in order for carrying to be permitted in a public domain. Gates that can be closed, but are not actually closed, are effective only in an open lane. Although the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 364:2) mentions the Rambam's view, the more stringent opinion is favored.<br>It must be emphasized that from Chapter 14, Halachah 1, and <i>Hilchot Eruvin</i> 1:1, it appears that the Rambam also requires doors that are actually closed.

Nevertheless, the Rabbis forbade carrying within an area fit to be considered a public domain unless it has a proper gate at its entrance. The Rambam, however, could not accept this ruling, because as stated in Chapter 16, Halachah 16, if the open portions of a barrier exceed the enclosed portions, it is not acceptable.</i> a pole, or a beam are not sufficient to make it possible for people to carry within a public domain.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Herein lies one of the points of controversy regarding the <i>eruvim</i> that are constructed around communities today. For few modern cities or villages are enclosed by actual walls with gates, and in practice, most of these <i>eruvim</i> employ a frame of an entrance, using telephone wires and the like.<br>As mentioned in Chapter 14, Halachah 1, and its notes, the Rambam does not subscribe to the opinion that a public domain must contain 600,000 people passing through it. Although the later Ashkenazic authorities accept this more lenient view, they also suggest that those who are careful in their observance accept the Rambam's ruling.<br>Whether this principle is to be applied with regard to great metropolises like Manhattan, Brooklyn, London, and the like which have more than 600,000 passersby or with regard to smaller communities which are considered a public domain only according to the more stringent view, the public domain must be enclosed by proper walls.

The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 365:27, however, mentions the more lenient views. Furthermore, many authorities (e.g., <i>Maggid Mishnah</i>, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 365:6) agree that if a beam is four handbreadths wide and is strong enough to support a roof, it is permitted to carry beneath it. In that instance, the outer end of the beam is considered to descend and serve as a fourth wall.</i> unless one erects another pole to permit carrying within the entrance.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In that instance, the area between the poles is considered to be a distinct entity, with walls on either side.</i><br>[The rationale for this stringency is that according to the Torah, a <i>carmelit</i> is a <i>makom patur</i>. Therefore, when] this entity, [the space opposite the pole or under the beam, which is also a <i>makom patur</i>, is adjacent] to an entity of this type, [the <i>carmelit</i>,] its presence is deemed significant [and it is considered to be an extension of the <i>carmelit</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Generally, one is allowed to carry within a <i>makom patur</i>.

(A pole worshiped by gentiles can be used if the gentiles nullfiy its connection with idol worship before it comes into the possession of a Jew. If, however, it is owned by a Jew, the connection with idol worship can never be nullified.)<br>Generally, since we are obligated to destroy objects that are associated with idol worship, from a halachic perspective, they are considered as if they have already been burnt to ashes. For example, <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 1:3 states that it is forbidden to use a shofar belonging to an עיר הנדחת (\"an apostate city\") and <i>Hilchot Lulav</i> 8:1 states that a palm branch used for idol worship is unacceptable for use as a lulav. Since both a shofar and lulav have a minimum requirement for their length, an object that must be destroyed because of its connection with idol worship is unacceptable.<br>In the case at hand, however, since there is no minimum requirement for the width or breadth of a pole, there is no difficulty in using a tree that has been worshiped.<br>The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's explanation, for although there is no minimum width or breadth required for a pole, there is a minimum requirement for its height. Since the wood of the tree that has been worshiped is considered as though it had been burned to ash already, it lacks this minimum height.<br>(The Ra'avad, therefore, differs with the Rambam and maintains that a pole, like a beam, is merely a distinction. Therefore, no minimum height is required.)<br>Many of the other <i>Rishonim</i> differ with the Ra'avad and accept the Rambam's decision. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> differentiates between a shofar and a lulav - which must have three coordinates: width, breadth, and height - and a beam, which requires only one: height. The fundamental point of his explanation is that although such a beam is considered to lack dimensions, it exists and in this instance all that is necessary is its existence. See the notes of Rav Chayim Soloveichik to this halachah.<br><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Eruvin</i> 80b) offers a different explanation, stating that even if the tree was burned, one could stick its ashes together and obtain a pole ten handbreadths high.</i> [The rationale for this ruling is that] there is no minimum requirement regarding the width of a pole.<br>The height of the pole may not be less than ten handbreadths.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Eruvin</i> 1:6), the Rambam explains that this height is required for a pole, because the minimum height of a lane is ten handbreadths.

The commentaries question, however, whether transferring less than a beneficial amount is forbidden according to Torah law or whether the prohibition is merely Rabbinic in origin.<br>Liability for most of the prohibitions of the Torah is associated with a specific measure (שיעור). For example, with regard to the majority of the prohibitions against eating forbidden foods, one is liable only if one eats a <i>k'zayit</i> (a measure of food the size of an olive). Should one eat less than that amount (חצי שיעור), one is considered to have transgressed the Torah's commandment. Nevertheless, one is not liable for punishment. (See <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 3:6, 7:15.)<br>The <i>Mishneh LaMelech</i> states that this same principle applies with regard to transferring objects on the Sabbath. Although one is liable only for transferring a beneficial amount, transferring any amount is forbidden by the Torah itself.<br>Note, however, <i>Totza'ot Chayim</i> (8) and others, who explain that according to the Rambam, there is no concept of חצי שיע ור with regard to the prohibition against work on the Sabbath. On the Sabbath, a person is liable only for performing מלאכת מחשבת, \"purposeful work.\" If an activity is not in itself beneficial, it does not serve a purpose. Therefore, it is not forbidden by the Torah on the Sabbath.<br><i>Kinat Eliyahu</i> notes that in Halachah 23, the Rambam states that \"A person who transfers half of the prescribed measure [of a substance] is not liable.\" According to the principles the Rambam states in Chapter 1, Halachah 3, the use of the term \"is not liable\" (פטור) indicates that the prohibition was instituted by our Sages. Significantly, in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot, loc. cit.,</i> and in other places where the Rambam discusses this issue, he uses the term אסור, \"forbidden.\" Thus the use of the term פטור in regard to the Sabbath laws clearly indicates a difference.

As the Rambam continues, there are instances where carrying such weaponry violates a Torah prohibition, and other instances where the prohibition is Rabbinic in origin.<br>This chapter represents a turning point in the structure of this text. From the middle of Chapter 12 onward, the Rambam has delineated the various factors involved in the forbidden labor of transferring articles from one domain to another. In this halachah, he begins speaking of the Rabbinic safeguards associated with this forbidden labor.</i> [The following rules apply should one] go out [wearing weaponry]: If they are objects that are worn as garments - e.g., a coat of mail, a helmet, or iron boots<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 6:2).</i> - one is not liable.

Our Sages rule that one is liable, while Rabbi Eliezer differs and states that one is not liable for carrying weapons, for they are ornaments, like jewelry.<br>Our Sages support their position by quoting Isaiah's (2:4) prophecy of the Era of the Redemption, \"And they shall beat their swords into plowshares.... Nation shall not lift up sword against nation....\" Since weaponry will be nullified in that era of ultimate fulfillment, it is a sign that it is not a true and genuine ornament.<br>The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> (in his gloss on <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 8:7) notes that there is a slight difficulty with the Rambam's ruling. The Talmud associates the opinion of the Sages (which the Rambam accepts) with the conception that Mashiach's coming will initiate a miraculous world order, and Rabbi Eliezer's ruling with the opinion of Shemuel that \"there is no difference between the present era and the Messianic era except [for the emancipation from] the dominion of [gentile] powers.\" In <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 9:2, and more explicitly in <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 12:1-2, the Rambam explains Shmuel's position, stating:<br>One should not entertain the thought that in the Messianic era any element of the natural order will be nullified, or that there will be an innovation in the order of creation. On the contrary, the world will continue according to its pattern.<br>Nevertheless, this approach does not necessarily contradict the Rambam's rulings here. The Rambam also maintains that war will be nullified in the Messianic era, as he writes (<i>loc. cit.</i> 12:5): \"In that era, there will be neither famine nor war, neither envy nor competition.\" Nevertheless, its nullification will not come because of miracles that defy the natural order, but because of the reasons he continues to mention in that halachah - that \"good will flow in abundance\" and \"'the world will be filled with the knowledge of God' (Isaiah 11:9 .\"</i>",

He resolves that difficulty by stating that the prohibition applies only when one puts them on at an improper time, with the intent of fulfilling a mitzvah. If that is not one's intent, there is no prohibition.</i> He should wear them in the ordinary fashion, placing the head <i>tefillin</i> on his head and the arm <i>tefillin</i> on his arm, enter a home and remove them there.

The rationale is that the only punishment which the Torah prescribed for this transgression is execution. There is no source in the Torah which prescribes a lesser punishment.<br>Nevertheless, within the context of this principle is also the concept that if a certain dimension of a prohibition involves capital punishment, the punishment of lashes is not given to a person who violates another act that is included in this prohibition, but is not punishable by death.<br>To apply these concepts to the case at hand: Working with an animal is the subject of a Torah prohibition. When a person works with an animal, however, he is not punished by lashes as are others who violate Torah prohibitions. Why? Because there are certain instances when working with an animal is punishable by death - i.e., when the activity is performed by a man and the animal together - for example, plowing. Therefore, even when the labor a person has the animal perform does not cause that person to incur the death sentence - for example, leading it while it is carrying a burden - he is not punished by lashes.<br>This is the interpretation of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>. The Ramban (in his gloss on <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, General Principle 14), however, interprets the Rambam's words to mean that the Torah's prohibition against working with an animal applies only to activities like plowing when the activity is performed by the man and the beast together.

For as soon as the gentile agrees to perform the forbidden labor on behalf of a Jew, he is considered as the Jew's hired hand.<br>The question may arise: Concerning whom is the Rambam speaking in Chapter 6 when he states that asking a gentile to work on our behalf is prohibited merely by virtue of Rabbinic decree? A gentile who has not accepted the observance of any mitzvot at all.</i>He may, however, perform [such labors] on his own behalf.

If the sacks are small, one may bring pillows and blankets and place them under them, so that the sacks will fall on the pillows.

Thus, one has not nullified the possibility of using a utensil prepared for use on the Sabbath.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are commentaries that emphasize that this is also a leniency. It is forbidden to nullify the possibility of using a utensil even temporarily. Hence, the only reason that putting the pillows under the sacks is permitted is that there is a substantial loss involved (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 266:27).<br>Note, however, the <i>Maggid Mishneh,</i> who mentions opinions that explain that since one can remove the pillows one by one at any time, one is never nullifying a utensil from being used.</i><br>If [the sacks are large and contain] large pieces of glass, one should release the sacks and let them fall. Even if they break, there will not be a great loss, for [such pieces of glass] are intended to be melted down.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi (<i>Shabbat</i> 154b) offers a slightly different interpretation of the type of glass used and the purpose for which it was intended.</i> [Therefore, only] a small loss [will be incurred],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., although the larger pieces will break when they fall, the broken pieces that will remain will also be able to be used for the original purpose.

Even though there is no way to remove the pillows from under the utensils on the Sabbath, this leniency is permitted because of the potential loss. The <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 266 explains that this is a matter of controversy among the halachic authorities.</i> One may not, however, leave them on the animal [for the entire Sabbath], because of the pain the animal [will suffer].",

The standard text is problematic, since straw and carobs are also produce, and if there were no prohibition against grinding produce, there would be no reason to forbid shredding them. The amended version, however, is also somewhat difficult, since gourds are also produce.<br>Rav Yosef Karo himself favors the standard text and states that the phrase \"there is no concept of grinding regarding...\" is the rationale for the prohibition against shredding carobs.<br>To explain: The word פירות in this instance has a more restricted meaning, meaning \"fruit\" rather than \"produce.\" The concept of grinding applies only with regard to grains and vegetables, but not with regard to fruit. Therefore, the prohibition against shredding carobs is only Rabbinic in origin.

Therefore, he rules that it is forbidden to wash the Temple floor on such an occasion, for doing so is an expression of respect for the Temple, but is not a necessity for its service to continue.<br>From the fact that the Rambam rejects Rabbi Natan's view, it is clear that he maintains that - as he says simply in this halachah - \"The prohibitions classified as <i>sh'vut</i> do not apply in the Temple\" - i.e., they do not apply at all. The <i>Mishnah</i> in <i>Eruvin</i> follows Rabbi Natan's opinion. Therefore, in his Commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam explains Rabbi Natan's position.

Other prohibitions - e.g., telling a gentile to perform a forbidden activity, or performing an act that resembles or that may lead to the performance of a forbidden labor (i.e., <i>shvut</i>) - are never relaxed, even for the sake of a mitzvah .<br>As the Rambam mentions (Chapter 6, Halachot 9-10), the prohibition against instructing a gentile to perform an act that is forbidden as a <i>sh'vut</i> is relaxed when a mitzvah is involved, but only when the prohibition is Rabbinic in origin.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 307:5) mentions an opinion permitting us to instruct a gentile to perform a forbidden act for matters of serious communal need, and also a more stringent opinion, that even forbids giving a gentile such instructions. The Ramah also notes a more lenient approach that allows one to tell a gentile to perform a task forbidden by the Torah. In practice, the Rambam's view, as interpreted by the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, is accepted by most authorities except in cases where a great loss is involved. In those instances, the leniency mentioned by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> is accepted.</i> - e.g., to run to the synagogue or the house of study.<br>We are permitted to calculate accounts associated with a mitzvah,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 306:10 gives as an example, calculating the cost of a feast associated with a mitzvah.</i> to make measurements concerning a mitzvah - e.g., to measure a <i>mikveh</i> to see if it contains [the required] quantity,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A <i>mikveh</i> must contain 40 <i>seah</i> to be halachically acceptable.</i> or a cloth to see if it is [large enough to] contract ritual impurity.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned in <i>Hilchot Keilim,</i> Chapter 22, a piece of cloth is susceptible to contracting ritual impurity only if it is of a specific size.

Significantly, the treatment of this subject in <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 287:1-3 appears to reflect a different emphasis from that of the Rambam.</i> A person who goes to visit a sick person should say, \"It is the Sabbath [when it is forbidden] to plead;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this context, note one of the Rambam's responsa (208), which emphasizes the importance of refraining from reciting any prayers containing requests whether of a communal or an individual nature on the Sabbath or on festivals.</i> healing will come soon.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As the Rambam writes in <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 14:6, one of the fundamental aspects of the mitzvah of visiting the sick is to arouse divine mercy on their behalf. Nevertheless, since it is forbidden to plead on the Sabbath, one makes a statement that acknowledges God's kindness. The phrase cited by the Rambam is also used as the basis of the <i>Mi Sheberach</i> prayers recited for a sick person in the synagogue on the Sabbath.</i><br>One may go to the end of the Sabbath boundary to wait until nightfall to take care of the needs of a bride or to take care of the needs of a deceased person [- e.g.], to bring a coffin or shrouds.<br>[When involved in these matters,] one may tell [a colleague,] \"Go to....

And the [verse from which the prohibitions against mundane activity is derived] states, \"pursuing your desires.\" \"Your desires\" are forbidden; God's desires are permitted.",
            "One may set out on a ship on the Mediterranean Sea on Friday for the sake of the fulfillment of a mitzvah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As the Rambam mentions in Chapter 30, Halachah 13, generally one is not allowed to set out on a sea journey less than three days before the Sabbath so that one will have already acclimated oneself to the travails of sea travel by the Sabbath. Nevertheless, because of the person's involvement in the performance of a mitzvah, this restriction is waived.</i> One [must] make an agreement with [the captain] to halt [the journey] on the Sabbath. If, [however,] he does not halt [the journey, it is of no consequence].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The later authorities maintain that particularly because a mitzvah is involved, if the gentile does not agree to halt the journey at the outset, one need not refrain from traveling with him (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 248:2).</i><br>We may nullify<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Torah gives a husband and a father the right to nullify vows made by his wife and daughter.

Therefore, if he were not able to nullify it on the Sabbath, he would never be able to nullify it in the future. To preserve this right, our Sages did not forbid nullifying vows on the Sabbath (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i> One may ask a wise man to absolve [a person] of a vow if this is necessary for the sake of the Sabbath.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this instance, only the vows that are necessary to be absolved for the sake of the Sabbath may be absolved on the Sabbath, since there is nothing preventing one from absolving the other vows on the following day (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i>This is possible despite the fact that the person had the opportunity to have [himself] absolved [of the vow] before the Sabbath. [This license is granted] because all of the above matters concern a mitzvah.",
            "Punishments may not be administered [by the court] on the Sabbath. Although [administering] punishment fulfills a positive command [of the Torah], the observance of a positive commandment does not supersede [the observance of] the Sabbath [laws].<br>What is implied?

He explains that it is inevitable that the administration of lashes will result in bleeding.<br>Alternatively, the commandment teaches us that no cases of this nature may be judged on the Sabbath. The <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> (Mitzvah 114) favors this answer, for it also resolves another problem: Why is this restriction given the status of a separate mitzvah? Since the principle that the observance of a positive commandment does not supersede the observance of the Sabbath laws is already known, why is it necessary for the Torah to give us this commandment?</i> This [verse serves as] a warning to the court not to [execute a person by] burning on the Sabbath. The same principle applies regarding other punishments [administered by the court].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his gloss on the <i>Mishneh Torah,</i> Rabbi Akiva Eiger notes that there is a principle that a person who refrains from performing a positive commandment should be beaten until he agrees to perform it. Since these blows are not given as punishment, but rather as a prod to motivate the person to observe the commandments, they may be administered on the Sabbath.</i>",

There is room to differentiate between them, because during <i>beyn hash'mashot</i> on Friday, the prohibition against these activities has not yet taken effect. On Saturday evening, by contrast, since the prohibitions have been in effect throughout the Sabbath, one might think that they need not be relaxed until the Sabbath has definitely concluded. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 342:1 rules that one may follow the more lenient view.

In one of his responsa (<i>Birkat Avraham,</i> Responsum 14), Rabbenu Avraham, the Rambam's son, explains that the Rambam changed his perspective when composing the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and adopted a more stringent view than he had originally held.</i><br>What is implied?

The present ruling does not, however, represent a change of opinion.

If, however, the prohibitions stem from Rabbinic law, the court is not obligated to rebuke the father.<br>This explanation of the Rambam's approach is based on the statements of Rav Yosef Karo in the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and on his rulings in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 343:1). The Ramah (based on <i>Tosafot, Shabbat</i> 121a) introduces a different perspective: that when a child has reached an age when it is fit to educate him in the performance of the mitzvot, the obligation to educate him falls on the court as well.

[These restrictions are necessary] for since the person is idle and sitting at home, [it is likely that] he will seek something with which to occupy himself.

Since it was on the Sabbath that it first became possible to use the broken pieces of the utensils for this new purpose, it is possible to consider them as <i>nolad</i> (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 308:14).<br>The prevailing view is that objects that are <i>nolad</i> are permitted to be moved on the Sabbath. They are, however, forbidden to be moved on a festival. Accordingly, if an article breaks on a festival, it would be forbidden to move its broken pieces even if they were fit to be used for a constructive (other than one resembling the article's original) purpose <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 308:24].<br>It must, however, be noted that the <i>Magen Avraham's</i> conception is not accepted by all authorities.

The first opinion of the Mishnah states that the broken pieces of a utensil may be carried provided they can be used for any constructive purpose. Rabbi Yehudah differs and maintains that the broken pieces may be carried only when they can be used for a purpose that resembles the intent for which they had originally been used.<br>Although the wording of the standard printed text follows Rabbi Yehudah's opinion, the examples he gives and the continuation of the halachah follow the other view. Significantly, many manuscripts and early printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> state \"provided the pieces can be used for a constructive purpose.\"<br>Although the <i>Baal Halachot Gedolot</i> and other sages of the early generations follow Rabbi Yehudah's opinion, in the later generations almost all the authorities accept the other view.</i><br>What is implied? The broken pieces of a kneading trough can be used to cover the opening of a jug. Broken pieces of glass can be used to cover the opening of a flask. The same rules apply in other similar situations.

Furthermore, if it is not common practice to use an object for this purpose - e.g., a stone - it may not be moved on the Sabbath despite the fact that it was used as a covering several times during the week (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 308:36).<br>(See also Rashi (<i>Shabbat</i> 126b), who states that we may carry a cover only when it is fit to be used as a utensil in its own right.

Since it is built in this manner, the Sages apply the laws governing pits and vats to it, lest people be unable to distinguish between them. If, however, a utensil that is attached to the ground projects from the ground, its cover does not require a handle, as will be explained (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 308:10).</i> If its cover has a handle, it may be carried.

If, however, the cover has a handle, it is clearly distinguished as a separate entity that is intended to be handled (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 308:37; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 308:42).

He objects to this conception, explaining that based on <i>Eruvin</i> 101a, it would appear that if a partition is suspended above the ground, it is considered to be a door even if it never had a hinge.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states, however, that it is possible that the Rambam also shares this conception. (<i>Merkevet HaMishneh</i> postulates that he surely does. Otherwise, the Rambam's words would be redundant, since it is impossible for a door to be suspended above the ground unless it hangs from the wall or is attached by a hinge.) The <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> view is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 313:3).</i> The same rules apply to a [partition made from] brambles or a mat that drags on the floor.",

Hence, one appears to be building when closing it. The Rambam, by contrast, explains that the prohibition stems from the fact that the door is not prepared to serve as a כלי, a useful article.

If the bolt is removed by detaching the rope from the door and carrying the bolt and the rope together, the presence of the rope serves as an indication that the bolt has been set aside to be used for a significant purpose. Therefore, there is no prohibition involved. If, as in the following clause, the bolt is detached from the rope, there is nothing to indicate that it is a useful article. Hence, it is forbidden (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's interpretation of the Hebrew ניטל באגדו. Instead, he offers a different explanation: that the rope with which the beam is attached to the door with a knot that is strong enough to hold the beam when it is removed. This is the interpretation that Rav Yosef Karo follows in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 313:1).</i><br>If, by contrast, the rope attaching it is fixed permanently to the door and the bolt is removed like a beam, placed in a corner, and then reattached when one desires, its use as a bolt is forbidden [on the Sabbath].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It was permitted to use such a bolt in the Temple, because none of the Rabbinic prohibitions in the category of <i>sh'vut</i> were in effect there. Outside of the Temple, using such a bolt was prohibited for the reasons mentioned by the Rambam (or according to others, because this resembles building, <i>Eruvin</i> 102a).</i> This is forbidden because [the bolt] is not considered to be a utensil, nor is there any indication [that it is being used as a utensil], for it is not attached to the door, nor is it connected to a rope.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Moshe Cohen of Lunil and others question the distinction between this halachah and Chapter 22, Halachah 30, which mentions a piece of wood that is used to close a window. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that in that instance, leniency was granted only when the piece of wood is prepared for that purpose. In the present halachah, by contrast, nothing has been done to indicate that the bolt is set aside for purposeful use.<br>It must be emphasized that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) takes a different perspective and maintains that the restrictions were instituted lest it appear that one is building when using such a door.

The Rashba maintains that it is desirable to place another article on the corpse, so that one will be carrying the corpse for the sake of a permitted article.<br>The Ramban, by contrast, explains that since one is carrying the corpse into a <i>carmelit</i> and violating a Rabbinic prohibition associated with a forbidden labor, it is preferable to minimize the violation of that prohibition by not carrying another article. Although the prohibition against carrying an entity (the corpse) that is <i>muktzeh</i> will be violated in a more serious way, it is preferable to violate that prohibition (which is associated with a <i>sh'vut</i>) than the prohibition against carrying into a <i>carmelit</i>, which has its source in the forbidden labor of transferring articles.<br>Although the Rashba's view is accepted by the later authorities (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 311:2; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 311:9), one may rely on the Ramban's view if there is not another useful article available, and carry the corpse out without anything else.</i> into a <i>carmelit is permitted</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The corpse may be carried into a <i>carmelit</i>, but not into a public domain (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 311:5; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 311:10).<br>The <i>Tur</i> allows carrying a corpse even into the public domain; since one does not intend to use the corpse, carrying it is a מלאכה שאינה צריכה לגופה, and the prohibition against performing such an activity is waived in this instance. The Rambam would surely not accept this premise, for he maintains that one is liable according to the Torah for performing a מלאכה שאינה צריכה לגופה. Even the later Ashkenazic authorities who accept the basic principle of the <i>Tur</i> do not accept this leniency.</i><br>[This leniency was granted because] the honor of the creatures is great enough to supersede [the observance of] a negative commandment of the Torah, namely: \"Do not swerve right or left from the words they tell you\" [Deuteronomy 17:11].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Mamrim</i> 1:2, which interprets this as a commandment prohibiting us from transgressing a directive instituted by the Rabbis.

            "A person who goes beyond [his] city's Sabbath limit should be punished by lashes, as [Exodus 16:29] states: \"No man should leave his place on the seventh day.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 321) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 24) include this prohibition as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.<br>Having covered all the prohibitions associated with the performance of labor on the Sabbath, in this and the next chapter the Rambam focuses on another Biblical prohibition associated with the Sabbath - the prohibition against departing from one's location. With regard to this prohibition, it is also significant to consult <i>Hilchot Eruvin</i>, Chapters 6-8, which mention extending the Sabbath limits mentioned here through a convention of Rabbinic origin known as <i>eruv t'chumim</i>.</i> [The term] \"place\" refers to the city's Sabbath limits.<br>The Torah did not [explicitly] state the measure of this limit. The Sages, however, transmitted the tradition that this measure was twelve <i>mil</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A <i>mil</i> is approximately one kilometer.<br>There are those who interpret the Rambam's ruling here as a change in his position from <i>Sefer HaMitzvot,</i> which can be interpreted as stating that the limit of two thousand cubits has its source in the Torah itself. In a responsa, however, the Rambam explicitly states that his statements in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> were intended to be general in nature, to be clarified in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.<br>It must also be noted that there are many authorities (among them the Ramban and the Rashba) who maintain that the Sabbath limits are a Rabbinic prohibition. (According to this view, the allusion to Exodus 16:29 is merely an <i>asmachta</i>.) Significantly, there is an early reference in the Rambam's works (Commentary to the Mishneh, <i>Sotah</i> 5:3) which supports this view.<br>The fundamental basis for these positions can be explained as follows: The measure of twelve <i>mil</i> is mentioned in the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Eruvin</i> 1:10), but not in the Babylonian Talmud. The Babylonian Talmud (<i>Eruvin</i> 17a) cites a dispute between Rabbi Akiva and other Sages. Rabbi Akiva maintains that the Torah established a Sabbath limit of two thousand cubits, but the other Sages differ. According to the Rambam, the ruling of the Jerusalem Talmud is accepted. According to the other view, this represents a difference of opinion between the majority opinion in the Babylonian Talmud (which appears to state that the Torah did not establish Sabbath limits) and the Jerusalem Talmud. Generally, when there is a difference between the majority opinion in the Babylonian Talmud, and the Jerusalem Talmud, the majority opinion of the Babylonian Talmud is accepted.<br>The Rabbinic origin of the prohibition of two thousand cubits is universally accepted. It would appear that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 404:1) accepts the position that the entire concept of Sabbath limits is a Rabbinic institution. The Ramah, however, requires that consideration be taken of the Rambam's view.<br>Note also the <i>Tzafenat Paneach,</i> which emphasizes that all authorities agree that the observance of limits on travel on the holidays is Rabbinic in origin.</i> the length of the Jews' encampment [in the desert].

Significantly, the Talmud (<i>Eruvin</i> 61b) gives Antioch as the example, and not Nineveh.<br>The entire city is considered to be the person's \"place,\" in the wording used in Exodus (<i>loc. cit.</i>). Hence, as long as he stays within the city's confines, or goes less than two thousand cubits beyond them, he is not considered to have \"left his place.\"<br>With the expression, \"whether or not, it is surrounded by a wall,\" the Rambam touches on a Halachic point of particular relevance in the diaspora where it is not common for a city to have an <i>eruv</i>. There is a question if the term \"city\" used throughout this chapter refers to all cities, or only to those surrounded by a wall.<br>The rationale behind the latter thesis is that only when a city is surrounded by a wall is it a private domain, and fit to be described as a person's \"place.\" When the city lacks a wall, the person's place is his individual domain. See Rashi, <i>Eruvin</i> 61b, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 396:1.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> (in his gloss to these halachot, and more specifically, in his gloss to <i>Hilchot Eruvin</i> 7:4), explains that the Rambam does not subscribe to this restriction, and considers even a city without a wall as \"one's place\" even if it is forbidden to carry within it.</i><br>Similarly, it is permitted for a person to walk two thousand cubits in all directions outside the city. [When calculating these two thousand cubits, the entire area] is considered to be square, like a tablet,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a difference of opinion among the Sages of the Mishnah (<i>Eruvin</i> 4:8) whether the city is considered to be the center of a circle with a radius of two thousand cubits, or the center of a square whose sides are twice that length. The Rambam follows the latter opinion, thus expanding the permitted area to include the corners of the square.<br>The determination of the limits of the city's boundaries from which these two thousand cubits are measured is discussed at the beginning of the following chapter.</i> so that [the area in between] its furthest corners will also be included.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that although the corners of the square are included, one is allowed to walk 2800 cubits (the approximate distance to the corner of the square) only when one is, in fact, pointed in the direction of that diagonal. One may not arbitrarily rotate the area encompassed by the square so that one will always be walking along its diagonal.</i><br>If a person goes beyond two thousand cubits up to a distance of twelve <i>mil</i>, he should be given \"stripes for rebelliousness\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the punishment given for the violation of a Rabbinic prohibition.</i>.

When a domain is classified within the category of <i>carmelit</i>, e.g., seas and rivers, the establishment of the Sabbath limits is merely Rabbinic in origin. Therefore, since the case at hand - whether the Sabbath limits apply above ten handbreadths - is a point in question, we follow the principle: When in doubt regarding a point of Rabbinic law, the more lenient view should be followed.

In the morning, the shepherds found him and told him, \"Rabbi, the city is right in front of you. Why don't you enter?\" He indeed did so, and lectured in the house of study throughout the entire day.<br>The Ra'avad questions why the Rambam quotes the story of Rabbi Tarfon, which is a <i>baraita</i>, rather than the Mishnah, <i>Eruvin</i> 4:4. The Mishnah states that a person who was journeying toward a city, but sat down to rest at nightfall, may enter the city on the Sabbath, if he has already passed within its Sabbath limits. Although the person was unsure whether or not he entered the Sabbath limits, since he was actually within those limits and desired to be in the city on the Sabbath, he is given the privileges of the city's inhabitants.<br>If, however, the person did not have a desire to be within the nearby city, or specifically stated \"This is my place for the Sabbath,\" he may walk no more than 2000 cubits from that specific place, despite the fact that he is within the city limits. Since he consciously segregated himself from the inhabitants of the city, he is not granted their privileges (<i>Maggid Mishneh; Shulchan Aruch</i> and Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 400:1).</i><br>[This is permitted] because his intent was to journey to this city. Therefore, he is considered to have established his \"place\" for the Sabbath together with the inhabitants of this city, since he entered into their limits.",
            "A person who goes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to a person who left the city's Sabbath limits either intentionally, for purposes not directly associated with a mitzvah, unintentionally, or because of forces beyond his control, as mentioned in the following halachah.</i> even a single cubit beyond [a city's] Sabbath limits should not reenter them. [The rationale is that] the four cubits that a person is granted in which to walk begin from the place where the person is standing. Therefore, since the person went a cubit or more beyond his Sabbath limit, he must remain in his place. He may not walk except in the four cubits that begin from the place in which he is standing, and continue in a forward direction.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A key to the understanding of this halachah and the questions it has raised among the commentaries is the principle of הבלעת תחומים, the overlapping of boundaries. What this means is that when a person has a Sabbath limit already established, but leaves - either intentionally or because of forces beyond his control - he is given a new Sabbath limit in which he may walk. If the boundaries of that new limit overlap into his previous Sabbath limit, he may return there and walk freely within that limit.<br>To apply these principles to the case at hand: When a person leaves his Sabbath limits voluntarily, the place at which he stops is considered to be his base for the remainder of the Sabbath. He is granted only four cubits in which to walk. Moreover, as indicated in the notes on Chapter 12, Halachah 15, the Rambam maintains that this does not mean that the person may walk four cubits in all directions, but that he may walk four cubits in one of the four directions. Once he walks four cubits to one side, however, he may not walk four cubits in the other direction.<br>In the case of a person who willfully departs from the Sabbath limits, he is considered to have chosen the four cubits in front of him. Therefore, it is only within these four cubits that he may walk; he may not turn back in the direction of his original place at all.<br>This is the explanation given by the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> for the Rambam's ruling. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> questions, however, the restriction imposed by the Rambam: Why must we say that the person is restricted to the four cubits in front of him? The person has the choice of four cubits in any direction. If he chooses the four cubits behind him, he will be able to reenter his previous Sabbath limits, and, based on the principle of הבלעת תחומים mentioned above, he would then be able to conduct himself as any other member of the city. Why prevent him from utilizing this option?<br>This objection - first mentioned by the Ra'avad - is echoed by Rav Yosef Karo in the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. In the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 405:1), however, Rav Karo quotes the Rambam's decision. Based on the above principles, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 405:1 allows a person to return to his previous Sabbath limits if he leaves the city's Sabbath limits unintentionally or because of forces beyond his control, provided the four cubits in which he is allowed to walk overlap his previous Sabbath limits. If, however, he intentionally leaves the city's Sabbath limits, no leniency is allowed, as the Rambam states.</i><br>Similarly, a person who is even one cubit outside a city's Sabbath limits when darkness falls should not enter the city.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the person is outside the city's Sabbath limits, he is more than two thousand cubits away. Thus, he cannot enter the city unless he transgresses and goes beyond his own Sabbath limits.</i> Instead, he may proceed only two thousand cubits from the place where he was standing when the Sabbath commenced. If a person's Sabbath limit ends in the midst of the city, he may proceed [no further] than the end of his Sabbath limit, as has been explained.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Halachot 5 and 7. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> raises an obvious question: Since the person is located more than two thousand cubits outside the city, how is it possible for his Sabbath limits to end within the city? [Significantly, when quoting this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:3) omits this clause.]<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> answers that this refers to a situation in which a person was traveling to a city when night fell on Friday, and consciously decided to be considered as an individual, rather than as a member of the city. (See the notes on Halachah 10.)<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam is speaking of a second location, a town other than the one that the person originally desired to enter. The <i>Or Sameach</i> offers a unique explanation, stating that this refers to a situation where the person was more than two thousand cubits outside the city, and thus beyond its Sabbath limits. Nevertheless, there was a large cave included within his two thousand cubits.

As the Rambam mentions in Halachah 6, our Sages required that this acknowledgement be recited over a cup of wine. Nevertheless, according to the Torah itself, it is sufficient to make these statements in the prayer service.</i> as [implied by Exodus 20:8]: \"Remember the Sabbath day to sanctify it\" - i.e., remember it with [words of] praise [that reflect its] holiness.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As the Rambam states in <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 12:3, this mitzvah is incumbent on women as well as on men. This concept is derived as follows: In the first mention of the Ten Commandments (Exodus, Chapter 20), we are commanded to \"remember\" (<i>zachor</i>) the Sabbath. In Moses' review of that event (Deuteronomy, Chapter 5), however, he uses the expression, <i>shamor</i>, \"observe.\"<br><i>Sh'vuot</i> 20b teaches that these two terms were related by God \"in a single breath\" - i.e., they are two complementary expressions of respect for the Sabbath. Accordingly, all the individuals obligated to keep the mitzvah of \"Observe\" must also keep the mitzvah of \"Remember.\" Since women are obligated to keep the mitzvah of \"Observe\" - i.e., to adhere to the prohibitions against forbidden labor - they are also obligated to \"Remember\" the Sabbath (<i>Berachot</i> 20b).</i><br>This remembrance must be made at the Sabbath's entrance and at its departure: at the [day's] entrance with the <i>kiddush</i> that sanctifies the day, and at its departure with <i>havdalah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As the Rambam clearly states in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), his intent is that the mitzvah of remembering the Sabbath encompasses both <i>kiddush</i> and <i>havdalah</i>. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> cites opinions that maintain that the mitzvah to \"remember the Sabbath\" applies only at the commencement of the Sabbath, but not at its conclusion. According to this view, the obligation to recite <i>havdalah</i> is Rabbinic in origin, without any connection to the Biblical commands, \"Remember\" and \"Observe.\"<br>Among the practical distinction between these two approaches is the conception of a woman's obligation to recite <i>havdalah</i>. According to the Rambam, there is no difference between a woman's obligation and that of a man. The other view, by contrast, allows for the conception that women are not obligated to recite the <i>havdalah</i> prayer.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 296:8) cites both opinions (but appears to favor the Rambam's view). The Ramah suggests that a woman should fulfill her obligation by listening to a man's recitation of this prayer. When this is not possible, a woman should recite the <i>havdalah</i> herself. A man who has fulfilled his obligation should not, however, recite the prayer for the sake of a woman (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 296:19; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 296:35-36).</i>",

By ceasing work every week, they recall God's kindness in delivering them.<br>The Ramban (in his Commentary on the Torah, Deuteronomy 5:15  offers a different explanation. The exodus from Egypt expresses God's infinite power.

With love and favor You have granted us Your holy Sabbath as an inheritance.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Herein, there is a unique homiletic point. God's choice of the Jewish people is expressed, not in granting them dominion over other nations or bestowing inordinate resources of wealth and prosperity upon them, but rather in granting them the Sabbath and its atmosphere of holiness and peace.<br>Rav Zerachiah HaLevi notes that the three times God's desire and favor are mentioned this passage refer to the three dimensions of the Jews' connection with the Sabbath: the Sabbath of creation, the Sabbath of the exodus, and \"the age that is all Sabbath and rest for life everlasting\" - i.e., the era of the Redemption.</i> Blessed are You, God, who sanctifies the Sabbath.<br>",

For grace is associated with the preceding meal, and <i>kiddush</i> with the Sabbath day that will follow. In contrast, in the present halachah, both <i>havdalah</i> and grace are associated with the previous time - the Sabbath - and the previous meal.

In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam also quotes Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi's view. In these halachot, however, he mentions this principle only in Halachah 27, appearing to indicate that the need for a candle to \"rest\" on the Sabbath applies only to candles lit by Jews. Since the gentiles are not bound by the Sabbath laws, this principle does not apply to them at all.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:5) quotes Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi's view and forbids using a candle that a gentile lit during the day.

Although long distance travel has been greatly facilitated in the present age, one should always plan to arrive several hours before the Sabbath, lest one be held back by forces beyond one's control.</i>",
            "It is forbidden to fast,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note the Radbaz (Vol. IV, Responsum 1266), who quotes the Rashba as stating that this prohibition has its source in the Torah itself.</i> to cry out [to God], to offer supplication, or to entreat [His] mercy on the Sabbath.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In one of the Rambam's responsa, he explains that although prayer and supplication are revered media of divine service, on the Sabbath our service of God is channeled through a higher medium: rest and spiritual pleasure. As such, prayer and supplication are not appropriate.</i> Even when [a community is beset] by a distressing circumstance that would ordinarily require the community to fast and sound the trumpets,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Hilchot Ta'aniot</i> 1:1, the Rambam writes that one of the Torah's commandments is to cry out to God and sound the trumpets at a time of communal distress. He continues in Halachah 4, stating that our Sages required the community to fast on such occasions. In addition to drought, the Rambam mentions several other situations in <i>Hilchot Ta'aniot</i>, Chapter 3, which are described as times of communal distress.</i>we do not fast or sound the trumpets on the Sabbath or holidays.<br>[There are, however, exceptions. They include] a city surrounded by gentiles or a [flooding] river, and a ship sinking at sea. We may sound the trumpets on the Sabbath to summon help for them, offer supplications on their behalf, and ask for mercy for them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a restatement of a law mentioned previously in Chapter 2, Halachah 24. Chapter 2 involves questions concerning <i>pikuach nefesh,</i> the threat to life, and that is the reason why exceptions are made in these instances.</i>",
            "We do not lay siege to gentile cities less than three days before the Sabbath, so that the minds of the warriors will become settled and they will not be agitated and preoccupied on the Sabbath.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the siege must begin no later than Tuesday. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 248:1.) Note, however, the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 248:4, which cites other views that count the three days as beginning on Thursday. Thus, the siege may begin on Wednesday.<br>Although the army will still be in a state of war, and agitation will thus not have been eliminated entirely, since three days will have passed since the siege began, we can assume that much of the initial confusion and strain will have passed, and the situation will have settled into a routine.<br>As mentioned in Chapter 2, Halachah 25, we may wage war against gentiles on the Sabbath. Generally, the commentaries mention two reasons why a siege should not be initiated less than three days before the Sabbath: the reason stated by the Rambam, and also that the three days before the Sabbath are considered to be days of preparation. Hence, at this time, one is forbidden to put oneself in a situation where it will inevitably be necessary to violate the Sabbath laws because of <i>pikuach nefesh</i>, a threat to life. When, however, the siege is begun earlier, the situation will have already become part of the soldiers' functional reality before the preparations for the Sabbath have begun, and they will be permitted to violate the Sabbath laws, if necessary.<br>By mentioning this law in this context, the Rambam emphasizes that the issue with which he is concerned is ensuring, to the fullest extent possible, the soldiers' peace of mind.</i><br>For this reason, we may not set sail on a ship less than three days before the Sabbath, so that one's mind will be settled before the Sabbath and one will not suffer excessive discomfort.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are many people who get sea-sick on the first days of a journey. After three days have passed, however, they are likely to have grown accustomed to conditions aboard ship.<br>According to the Rambam, this prohibition applies only to ocean vessels, and not to river-boat traffic. There are, however, different rationales for the requirement to leave three days before the Sabbath. Among them:<br>a) By traveling on a ship, one goes beyond the Sabbath limits. Although there is an opinion that the Sabbath limits do not apply when one is ten handbreadths above the ground - as a ship usually is above the ocean or river bed - there is, nevertheless, no definitive ruling about the matter. (See Chapter 27, Halachah 3; see Maharik, Responsum 45.)<br>b) One may be forced to perform forbidden labor on the ship or, at the very least, have a gentile perform forbidden labors on one's behalf. (See Rivash, Responsum 152.)<br>With regard to both these matters, these follow the alternate view mentioned above: that within three days of the Sabbath, since the Sabbath preparations have begun, one is not allowed to put oneself into a situation where one will inevitably break the Sabbath laws. If, however, one has put oneself into such a situation before the commencement of the Sabbath preparations, the status is different.<br>In two of his responsa, the Rambam explains that the question of whether or not the Sabbath limits apply above ten handbreadths is relevant on dry land, but does not apply to water travel at all. Hence, it does not present a difficulty in the case at hand. His view is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 248:2). Although the Ramah mentions objections, the later authorities (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 248:3-4) follow the Rambam's view.<br>With regard to the performance of work, the Radbaz writes that, according to the Rambam, one may never put oneself into a situation in which one knows that one will inevitably be forced to perform forbidden labors on the Sabbath. (See <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 248.) The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 248:2) and the subsequent Ashkenazic authorities definitely do not accept this position. Moreover. from the ruling of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:4), it appears that the Sephardic community also agrees with the other view.</i> For the sake of a mitzvah, however, one may set out on a sea journey even on Friday. One should enter into an agreement that [the ship] interrupt [its journey] on the Sabbath. [If, however,] this agreement is not kept [it is not of consequence].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 24, Halachah 6 and notes, where this law was originally stated and explained. It is repeated here to emphasize that because there is a mitzvah, the discomfort that will be caused by the journey is overlooked.</i><br>From Tyre to Sidon<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Two cities in Lebanon that are not far removed from each other.</i> and the like, one may set out on Friday, even if the journey concerns one's personal affairs.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For such a short journey is not likely to disturb one's ordinary functioning.</i> In places where it is customary not to set out on a journey on Friday at all, one should refrain from travelling.",
            "Sexual relations are considered a dimension of Sabbath pleasure.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This applies to all people, not merely Torah scholars.</i> Therefore, Torah scholars who are healthy<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And thus are not prevented from engaging in relations.</i> set aside Friday night as the night when they fulfill their conjugal duties.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ketubot</i> 62b interprets Psalms 1:3, \"who gives its fruit in its season,\" as referring to a person who engages in sexual relations on Friday night and not on other occasions. This is the practice of Torah scholars, who generally engage in relations only once a week (<i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 14:1).</i><br>At the outset, it is permitted to engage in sexual relations with a virgin on the Sabbath. It is not [forbidden because] one is creating a wound,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For the hymenal blood is considered to be a distinct entity enclosed in the membrane, and thus this situation differs from others in which bleeding is caused (Rashi, <i>Ketubot</i> 7a).<br>Note the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 339:11, which mentions that witnesses should observe the <i>yichud,</i> the entry into a private chamber, of the bride and groom before the commencement of the Sabbath, so that all the contractual aspects of the marriage will have been completed at that time.</i> nor because of the pain the woman [feels].",
            "[The observance of] the Sabbath and [the prohibition against] worshiping false deities are each equivalent to [the observance] of all the mitzvot of the Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Nedarim</i> 3:9) derives the equivalence between the Sabbath and the entire Torah from Nechemiah 9:13-14: \"On Mount Sinai You descended.... And You gave them straight judgments... and good statutes and commandments. And You informed them of Your holy Sabbath.\" The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Sabbath's central importance stems from the fact that it is a sign of God's constant renewal of creation.<br><i>Kinat Eliyahu</i> explains the equivalence between the Sabbath and all the other mitzvot as follows: The dynamic spiritual activity of the Sabbath, carried out against a backdrop of rest and material satisfaction, reflects the goal and purpose of the totality of our Torah observance. It is for this reason that our Sages called the Sabbath \"a microcosm of the world to come.\"</i> And the Sabbath is the eternal sign between the Holy One, blessed be He, and us.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam is borrowing the wording of Exodus 31:13,17.</i><br>For this reason, whoever transgresses the other mitzvot is considered to be one of the wicked of Israel, but a person who desecrates the Sabbath publicly is considered as an idolater. Both of them are considered to be equivalent to gentiles in all regards.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This ruling represents more than a moral condemnation. Not only is such a person not acceptable as a witness and ineligible to take an oath in court, but all the restrictions applied with regard to gentiles - e.g., the prohibitions against gentile wine, gentile milk, and gentile bread - are applied to him. Similarly, he may not be counted in a <i>minyan</i>, nor be given any honor in the synagogue. (See <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 72:2.)<br>Many halachic authorities of the recent era (see <i>Iggerot Moshe, Orach Chayim</i> I, Responsum 33, and other sources) explain that there is room for leniency with regard to certain of these restrictions at present. Nevertheless, the overall attitude must still be one of stringency.<br>It must, however, be emphasized that the offspring of such Jews have a full portion in their Jewish heritage. Instead of shunning them, we must make every effort to draw them close to their spiritual roots. (See <i>Hilchot Mamrim</i> 3:3.)</i> Therefore, our prophets praise [Sabbath observance], saying [Isaiah 56:2]: \"Happy is the man who does the following, and the mortal who holds fast to it, who keeps the Sabbath, without desecrating it....\"<br>It is explicitly stated in our prophetic tradition that whoever observes the Sabbath according to law and honors it and delights in it according to his ability will receive reward in this world in addition to the reward that is preserved for the world to come,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Which the Rambam considers to be the ultimate reward, as he writes in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i>, Chapter 8.</i> as [Isaiah 58:14]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is the observance of the Sabbath that is described in the preceding verse in Isaiah, \"And you shall call the Sabbath 'a delight...,' which makes one worthy of the rewards mentioned in this verse.</i> states: \"'You will then delight in God. I will cause you to ride on the high places of the earth, and I will nourish you with the heritage of Jacob your ancestor'; thus has the mouth of God spoken.\""
