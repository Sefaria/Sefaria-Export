Anyone who works on it negates a positive command while transgressing a negative command, for it is written: \"You shall do no work\" (Exodus 20:10). What penalty does he deserve for doing work? If he did it voluntarily, willfully, he deserves <i>kareth;</i> if he acted in the presence of witnesses who forewarned him, he is stoned; if he acted unintentionally, he must bring a standard sin-offering.",
