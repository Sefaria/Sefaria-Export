            "The foundation of foundations and firmest pillar of all wisdom is, To know that there is a First Being, that He caused all beings to be, and that all beings from heaven and earth, and from between them, could not be save for the truth of His Own Being.",
            "Thus, supposing that He is not, none else could have been called into existence.",
            "Conversely, supposing all other beings, save He alone, non-existent, His Being alone remains; for, He does not cease to be because of their non-existence, as all beings are dependent upon Him, but He, blessed is He! is not dependent upon them nor upon a single one of them; therefore, the truth of His Being is incomparable to the truth of any other individual being.",
            "This is as the prophet says: \"But the Lord God is the true God\" (Jer. 10.10); He alone is the Truth, and no other being possesses a truth similar to His Truth, even as the Torah says: \"There is none other like unto Him\" (Deut. 4.39), meaning, there is no other true being, besides Him, like unto Him.",
            "This Being is the God of the universe, Lord of the whole earth, who guides the sphere with an infinite force, a force of perpetual motion; for the sphere revolves continuously, which would be impossible without some one causing it to revolve; and it is He, blessed is He! Who causes it to revolve without hand and without body.",
            "To know this matter is a mandatory commandment, saying: \"I am the Lord thy God\" (Ex. 20,2); therefore, whosoever supposes that there is another god besides This One, (1) violates a prohibitive commandment, saying: \"Thou shalt have no other gods before me\" (Ibid. –3), and is an atheist, denying the great principle upon which everything depends.",
            "This God is One God; He is neither two nor more than two but One to whose Unity there is no comparison among the individual units in the universe; not like the unit of a genus which embraces many individual units, nor like the unit of a body which is divisible into parts and particles, but a Unit to Whose Unity no other unit in the universe is like. Supposing that there are many deities is equivalent to an admission that they are corporeal, because like individual beings do not differ save in chance traits characteristic of bodies and material things only. Thus supposing the Creator to be corporeal and material would force a conclusion that He is finite, for, it is impossible to imagine a body which does not end in dissolution; but our God, blessed is His Name! beholding that His power is infinite and uninterrupted, for lo, the universal sphere continues to revolve forever. His power is positively not a physical power. And, because He is Incorporeal, none of the chance traits, characteristic of bodies, so as to be divisible or an offshoot of another being, can be attributed to Him. Therefore, the impossibility for Him to be but One. And, the knowledge of this doctrine of Monotheism is a mandatory commandment, saying: \"The Lord our God is One God\" (Deut. 6.4).",
            "Behold, it is clearly indicated in the Torah and in the Prophets that the Holy One, blessed is He! is Incorporeal for it is said: \"That the Lord, He is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath\" (Deut. 4.39); a corporeal being is incapable of being in two places simultaneously; and it is also said: \"For ye saw no manner of form\" (Ibid.–15); and it is moreover said: \"To whom will ye liken me, that I should be equal?\" (Isa. 40,25); had He been corporeal He would be like other bodies.",
            "If so, wherefore is it written in the Torah, \"And there was under his feet\" (Ex. 24,10), \"Written with the finger of God\" (Ex. 31,18), \"The hand of the Lord\" (Ex. 9,3), \"The eyes of the Lord\" (Deut. 11, 12), \"The ears of the Lord\" (Num. 11,18) and more like expressions? All such terminology is in accordance with the conception of sons of man who cannot recognize aught but corporeal things, and the words of the Torah is like human speech, but they are all attributes; for example, it is said: \"If I whet My glittering sword,\" (Deut. 32. 41.); Hath He a sword, or doth He slay with a sword? But it is a metaphor, so is all metaphorical. As testimony thereto, one prophet says that he saw the Holy One, blessed is He! \"His raiment was as white snow\" (Dan. 7,9), and another saw Him \"With crimsoned garments from Bozrah\" (Isa. 63,1); Moses our Master himself saw Him at the Red Sea \"as a hero engaged in battle,\" (Ex. 15.3) and upon Sinai as \"a garbed minister of a congregation (Ex. 19.19.), to say: He hath neither form nor image, but all is a vision of prophecy and a mirage, the absolute truth of the matter no human mind comprehends or is able to fathom it or penetrate it. It is even this what it says in Scripture: \"Canst thou find out the deep things of God? Canst thou attain unto the purposes of the Almighty?\" (Job. 11,7).",
            "What was it then that Moses our Master sought to attain when he said: \"Show me, I pray Thee, Thy glory\" (Ex. 33,18)? He desired to know the truth of the existence of the Holy One, blessed is He! with a thorough knowledge within his heart, even as he would know a certain person whose countenance he saw and whose likeness was imprinted upon his heart, so that he could find him in his mind's vision separated from other persons; even so did Moses our Master seek to establish the existence of the Holy One, blessed is He! separated within his heart from other beings, until he would know the truth of His existence as it is. And He, blessed is He! answered him, that it is not within the intellectual power of the living man, who is a composite being of body and soul, to reach the pure truth of this matter; but He, blessed is He! imparted to him that which no man before him did nor no man after him shall know for, he fathomed the subject of the true existence of the Holy One, blessed is He! even so that He became separated in his mind's vision from other beings; as, for instance, he could separate in his mind a certain person, whose back and body and clothes he saw from bodies of other persons. And, concerning this matter the Passage points, saying: \"And thou shalt see My back; but My face shall not be seen\" (Ex. 33,23).",
            "Since it is clear that He is Incorporeal, it clearly follows that none of the corporeal changes happen to Him; no joining and no separation, no place and no measure, no ascent and no descent, no right and no left, no face and no back, no sitting and no standing; neither is His being dependent on time to attribute to Him either a beginning, or an end, or number of years; nor is He undergoing any change as there is naught to cause any change in Him; He is neither subject to death nor to life similar to the life of a living body; to Him cannot be attributed either folly or wisdom similar to the wisdom of a wise man; no sleep and no awakening, no anger and no laughter, no joy and no sadness, no silence and no speech similar to human speech; and likewise have the sages declared: \"Above there is neither sitting down nor standing up, no backward nor forward\".<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hagigah, 15a. C.</i>",
            "Now, since the matter is so, all such and other similar expressions in the Torah and in the words of the Prophets are merely proverbial and figurative; for example, it is said: \"He that sitteth in heaven laugheth\" (Ps. 2,4), \"They have provoked Me with their vanities\" (Deut. 32,21), \"As the Lord rejoiced\" (Ibid. 28, 63), and like verses. Concerning all these the wise men said<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Berakot, 31b. See also Hullin, 90b; and Tamid 29a. G.</i> \"The words of the Torah is like human speech\". It is, moreover said: \"Do they provoke Me\" (Jer.7,19), whereas it has been said: \"For I the Lord change not\" (Mal. 3,6 6); if He could sometimes be angry and sometimes mirthful, He would be subject to changes. Indeed, such and all kindred attributes are not present in any save in darkened, lowly bodies, inhabitants of houses of clay, whose origin is of dust; but He, blessed is He! in blessings is exalted above all this."
        ],
        [
            "It is mandatory to love and fear this Glorified and Awe-inspiring God, for it is said: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God\" (Deut. 6,5); and as it is said: \"The Lord thy God thou shalt fear.\" (Ibid. 6, 13).",
            "But how may one discover the way to love and fear Him? When man will reflect concerning His works, and His great and wonderful creatures,<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">But he must make thorough study. C.</i> and will behold through them His wonderful, matchless and infinite wisdom, he will spontaneously be filled with love, praise and exaltation and become possessed of a great longing to know the Great Name, even as David said: \"My soul thirsts for God, for the living God,\" (Ps. 42,2); and when he will think of all these matters,<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre, Deut. 6.5; Shabbat, 30–31. G.</i> he will be taken aback in a moment and stricken with awe, and realize that he is an infinitesimal creature, humble and dark, standing with an insignificant and slight knowledge in the presence of the All Wise, as David said: \"For when I see Thy heavens, the wonderful works of Thy fingers, of what use is man that Thou mayest remember him?\" (Ibid. 8,4). And, in harmony with these matters, I elucidate great, general principles of the works of the Lord of the universe, so that they might serve as an opening for one who understands by which to love the Name, as some sages said on the subject of love: \"Out of it thou wilt recognize the One who spoke, and the universe was called into existence.\"",
            "All that which the Holy One, blessed is He! created in His world, is divided into three types: (a) Composite creatures of matter and form; they are beings which undergo constant changes, as the bodies of man, beasts, plants and minerals; (b) Composite beings of matter and form which do not undergo changes of either body or form as the former, but their forms remain forever set in their body unchanged; they are: the planets and the stars around them; their matter is unlike other matter and their forms are unlike other forms; (c) Beings possessed of forms but of no matter whatever; they are the angels; for the angels are incorporeal but varied forms.",
            "And, what is this that the prophets say that they saw the angel as of fire and winged? This all is in prophetic vision and enigmatical, emphasizing that the being is incorporeal and has no gravity as other massive bodies, as, for instance it is said: \"For the Lord your God is a burning flame,\" (Deut. 4,24). Who is not of fire but it is merely a figure of speech; and, for further instance, it is said: \"He maketh His angels of winds.\" (Ps. 104, 4).",
            "Not being corporeal, in what do these forms vary one from the other? In that that they are not alike in their being, but each one of them functions in a lesser degree than the other, and each one derives his being from the power of the one above him; but all of them derive their being from the Power and Goodness of the Holy One, Blessed is He! and from His munificence, which is as Solomon in his wisdom pointed at and said: \"For One higher than the high watcheth.\" (Ecc. 5,7).",
            "What we said \"in a lesser degree than the other,\" does not mean a degree in place, as one man sits a degree higher than the other, but as it is said of two scholars that one is greater than the other in learning, who is of a degree higher than the other, and, as we speak of the cause as of a higher degree than the thing to which it gives being.",
            "The variation in the names of the angels is based upon their degrees; they are therefore called: Holy Living Creatures, which are above all others, Wheels, Valiant Ones, Electrum, Flying Serpent, Angels, Gods, Sons of Gods, Chariot Bearers, and Men. All these ten names by which the angels are called designate their respective ten degrees; the degree which has nothing higher than itself, save only the degree of God, blessed is He! is the degree of the form which is called Living Creatures; thus it is spoken of in prophecy as being beneath the Throne of Glory. And the tenth degree is the degree of the form known as Men, which are the angels who speak with the prophets and appear to them in the vision of prophecy. Therefore they are called Men, as their degree approaches the degree of the intellect of the sons of man.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hagigah, 11a-13a. G.</i>",
            "All of these Forms are alive and recognize the Creator, and know Him with an extreme power of intelligence, each Form according to its degree, not according to its size. But even the Form of the first degree cannot attain the truth of the Creator as He is, for, its intelligence falls short of such attainment and knowledge; nevertheless, it attains and knows more than the Form beneath itself knows and attains. Likewise are they all, from each and every degree, even till the tenth degree, which Form also knows the Creator with an understanding which is not within the power of the sons of man, who are composite beings of matter and form, to attain and know. And, all of them do not know the Creator as He Himself knows His Own Being.",
            "All beings, save only the Creator, from the First Form to the smallest moth which might be in the center of the earth, came into being by the power of His truth; and because He knows His Own Being, and recognizes His Own greatness, Glory and Truth, He is All-Knowing, and there is not a matter concealed from Him.",
            "The Holy One, blessed is He! recognizes His Own Truth and knows it as it really is; and He does not know with an intelligence which is apart from Himself, as we know, for, we and our intelligence are not one, but the Creator, may He be blessed! and His Intelligence and His Life are One from every lateral, angle and manner of Unity. Since but for this, He would live a life and understand with an intelligence apart from Himself, then there would be many gods, He, His life and His Intelligence; and it is not so, for He is One from every lateral, angle and manner of Unity. Consequently you must say that, what He knows, and that by which He is known, and the Intelligence itself are all One. But this matter the mouth has no power to express, nor the ear to perceive, neither is it within the heart of man to see it clearly. Therefore, it is spoken of, \"the life of Pharoh\" (Gen. 42,5) and \"the life of thy soul\" (Sam. 1.26), and it is not spoken of \"the life of God,\" but \"the living God,\" (Judg. 8.19) because the Creator and His life are not two, as are the lives of living bodies, or as the lives of angels. Wherefore, He does not recognize the creatures nor knows them because they are creatures as we know them, but by reason of knowing His Own Self does He know them. Therefore, because He knows His Own Self, He knows all; for, all depend upon Him in being.",
            "These matters we spoke of on this subject in these two chapters, are but a drop in the ocean of what it ought to be expounded in this subject; and the exposition of all the principles in these two chapters, are known as the Works of the Chariot. (Ezek. 1).",
            "The ancient sages have commanded not to sermonize concerning these matters;<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibid. C.</i> save only to one man at a time, if he be wise, possessed of an intelligence of his own, whenafter to him might be transmitted the headlines of the chapters and acquaint him with a fraction of the matter so that he be able to understand its conclusion by his own intelligence and fathom its depth. These matters are extremely deep matters indeed, and not each and every intelligence is prepared to suffer them. And concerning them Solomon in his wisdom metaphorically said: \"The lambs will be for thy clothing\" (Prov. 27,26); so have the sages interpreted this metaphor: \"matters which are covering the universe shall be for thy garment,\" meaning they are a garment for thee alone, but thou shalt not sermonize them before the multitude. And, concerning them he further said: \"Let it be for thee alone and for no strangers with thee,\" (Ibid. 5,17). And concerning them he, moreover, said: \"Milk and honey shall be beneath thy tongue;\" (Song of Songs, 4,11); so have the early sages interpreted it: \"Matters which are likened to honey and milk shall remain beneath thine own tongue\"."

            "The celestial spheres are called heaven,<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hagigah, 12b. G.</i> firmament, habitation and nebula, and there are nine such spheres; the sphere nearest to us is the Moon; the second above it is the sphere wherein is set the star Mercury; in the third sphere above it is Venus; in the fourth sphere is the Sun; in the fifth sphere is Mars; in the sixth sphere is the star Jupiter; in the seventh is Saturn; in the eighth sphere are set all the stars which are seen in the firmament; the ninth sphere is the sphere which traverses daily from east to west, and encompasses and encircles all. And, what you see all stars as if they all are in one sphere, although they are set one above the other, is because the spheres are pure and transparent as glass or sapphire, therefore the stars which are in the eighth sphere, seem to be beneath the first sphere.",
            "Each and every one of the eight spheres wherein are the stars is divided into many spheres one above the other, in the manner of onion-peelings. Some are spheres, revolving from west to east, and others are revolving from east to west, as is the ninth sphere, which traverses from east to west; but among them all there is no blank space.",
            "All the spheres are neither light nor heavy; they have not the color of red, and not the color of black, and not any other colors; and what we see them in the color of blue is only an optical illusion according to the height of the horizon. Likewise have they no flavor and no odor, as these characteristics are not found save only in bodies beneath them.",
            "All of these spheres which encircle the universe, are round as a globe, and the earth is suspended in the center. Some few of the stars have small spheres which are set stationary within them, and such spheres do not encircle the earth, for the small, fixed sphere which does not encircle, is set in the large sphere which does encircle.",
            "The number of all the spheres which encircle the universe is eighteen; and the number of the lesser spheres which do not encircle the universe is eight; and from the travel of the stars and the knowledge of the distance covered by their cycle each day and each hour, and from their deviation from south to north and from north to south, and from their distance from and nearness to the earth, the number of these spheres, the form of their travels and the way they circle is known. This is the science of cycles and constellations concerning which the Greek scholars wrote many books.",
            "The ninth sphere which encircles them all, the ancient scholars divided into twelve segments, for each and every segment they invented a name after the name of this image you see in it as a reflection of the stars beneath it, which are set immediately under it. They are the Zodiac: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces.",
            "The ninth sphere itself is not segmental and not of a form resembling any forms of these, and not a star. But, in conjunction with the stars of the eighth sphere, is that which can be seen in the large stars wherein appear the likeness of these forms, or the resemblance thereof. These twelve forms were not set directly opposite those segments save only during the ante-diluvian period, when these names were invented for them; but in these times they have long ago reclined a little, because all the stars in the eighth sphere revolve similar to that of the sun and the moon, only they revolve heavily; and the distance covered by the sun and the moon in one day, it will take each star of them to cover almost seventy years.",
            "Among all the visible stars there are some small stars than one of which the earth is bigger, and some large stars each of which is bigger than the earth manifold. The earth is bigger than the moon about forty times, and the sun is bigger than the earth one hundred and seventy times; consequently, the moon is approximately 1-6800 part of the sun. Among the stars there is no star bigger than the sun and none smaller than the star in the second sphere.",
            "All of the stars and spheres are beings, endowed with a soul, intelligence and understanding; they continue a purposeful life and are conscious of the existence of Him Who spoke and the universe sprang forth. Each and every one, according to his greatness and degree, extol and glorify the Creator as do the angels; and to the extent that they recognize the Holy One, blessed is He! they also know their own selves and the angels above them. But the intelligence of the stars and spheres is lesser than the intelligence of the angels, but greater than the intelligence of man.",
            "Beneath the sphere of the moon, God created a certain body which is not like the body of the spheres, and He created four forms for this body which are unlike the forms of the spheres; and each and every form was set in part of this body. The first form is the form of fire, which was coupled with part of this body and their issue is the body of fire; the second form is the form of air which was coupled with part of this body and their issue is the body of air; the third form is the form of water, which was coupled with part of this body and their issue is the body of water; the fourth form is the form of the earth, which was coupled with part of this matter, and their issue is the body of the earth. Consequently, beneath the expanse there are four dissimilar bodies, one above the other, and each of these encircles the one immediately beneath it on all sides, sphere-like. The first body nearest the sphere of the moon is the body of fire; beneath it the body of air; beneath it the body of water; beneath it the body of the earth, and in between there is no blank space whatever without a body.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Sepher Yezirah, ch. 4-5. R.</i>",
            "These four bodies are not endowed with a soul, they do not know and do not recognize but are dead bodies. And each and every one of them has a law which it knows not, and which it can not attain, and which it can not change. Of this David said: \"Praise the Lord from the earth, ye sea-monsters, and all deep, fire and hail, snow and vapor\" (Ps. 148. 7–8). The explanation of the subject of these words is: \"Sons of men, praise Him in His mightiness which ye behold in flame and in hail, and in other creatures which ye see beneath the expanse, for their power is perpetually manifest to small and big\"."
        ],
        [
            "These four elements, namely: fire, air, water and earth, are the elements of all the creatures beneath the expanse; all that be whether of man, beast, fowl, creeping thing, fish, vegetation, minerals, precious stones, pearls, structural stones, mountains and glaciers, the body of each and every one is the joint issue of these four elements. Consequently all bodies beneath the expanse, save only these four elements, are joint issue of matter and form; and the body of each is the joint issue of these four elements; but each of these four elements is not the composite of aught else save of body and form only.",
            "It is the nature of fire and air to go upwards, from the center of the earth upwards towards the expanse; and it is the nature of water and earth to direct their movements beneath the expanse toward its center, as the center of the expanse is the lowermost point, than which there is nothing lower. Their course is not due to their intelligence and not to their desire, but to a rule fixed in them, and to nature which was engendered in them. By nature fire is warm and dry and, therefore, lighter than all of them; and the air is warm and moist; and water is cool and moist; and the earth is dry and cool, and it is heavier than all of them; water is lighter than it, therefore is its place above the earth; the air is lighter than water; therefore is its place above the water; and fire is lighter than air. And because they are elements for all bodies beneath the expanse, it is found that each and every body, whether of man, beasts, animal, fowl and fish, or whether of plant, mineral and stone, its unformed matter is a fusion of fire, air, water and earth. The four elements, too, fuse together so that each one of them loses identity when such fusion takes place, so that the fused element of the four of them becomes unlike one of them when it is by itself. And, in such fused body there is not even one particle which is actual fire, or actual water, or actual earth, or actual air, for all were transformed and made into one body. And in each and every such fused body of the four there is coolness, heat, moisture and drought combined. Nevertheless, there are among them certain bodies in which the element of fire is strongest, as in living creatures, therefore the element of heat is more apparent in them; and there are among them bodies wherein the element of earth is strongest, as in stones, therefore the element of drought is most prominent in them; and there are among them bodies wherein the element of water is strongest, therefore the element of moisture is more apparent. In this manner it happens that one warm body is warmer than another warm body, and one dry body more dry than another dry body. So are found bodies wherein the cold alone appears, and bodies wherein the moisture alone appears, and bodies wherein the cold and the drought appear evenly balanced, or the cold and the moisture evenly balanced, or the heat and the drought evenly balanced, or the heat and the moisture evenly balanced, according to the size of the quantity which was the fundamental element for the fusion will the action of that element and its nature appear in the fused body.",
            "All things fused of the four elements terminate in dissolution. In some instances, the dissolution will be in but few days; in others, such dissolution will come to pass after many years; but all that which was fused by them can not avoid dissolution back into them. Even gold and platinum cannot avoid termination and a return to the elements. The process of such return is, part to fire, part to water, part to air and part to dust.",
            "Since all that must terminate dissolve into these elements, wherefore was it said to Adam: \"And into dust shalt thou return\" (Gen. 3.19)? Because the greatest part of his structure is dust. And, not all that undergo dissolution, when they dissolve return at once to the four elements; for they dissolve gradually, one thing will be turned into another, that other into still another one, and in the end those things return to the elements, and thus it is discovered that all things turn in a circle.",
            "The four elements perpetually change one into another, partially, and not bodily. How so? Part of the earth nearest the water breaks and changes and becomes water; so does part of the water nearest the air evaporate and change and become air; so does part of the air nearest fire shift and change and become fire; so does part of fire nearest air shift and change, solidify and become air; so does part of the air nearest the water change, solidify and become water; so does part of the water nearest earth change, clots and becomes earth. But the change is little by little, in proportion to the lapse of time. Neither does an element change completely so that all the water will become air, or all the air fire, because it is impossible that one of these four elements should be entirely nullified; but part of the fire does become air, part of the air does become fire, and so between each and the other, and thus the change will be found among the four, and so it turns in a circle forever.",
            "This change is made possible by the revolution of the sphere, and by the force of its revolution the four elements derive power of fusion, and out of them are other bodies, sons of man, living creature, plant, stone and mineral. To each and every body God gives a due form through the Angel of the tenth sphere, the Intelligence called Men.",
            "You never see a body without a form, or a form without a body; it is only the heart of man which divides a given body conceived in his mind and knows that it is fused of matter and form; he also knows that there are bodies whose unformed matter is fused of the four elements and bodies whose unformed matter is plain, unfused and of but one element. The forms which are not of matter are not visible to the eye, but are known to the heart's eye as we know the Lord of all without seeing Him with the eye.",
            "The soul of all flesh is the form which God gave unto him, and the high intelligence which is found in the soul of man is the form of the man who is perfectly intelligent. Concerning this form it is said in the Torah: \"Let us make man in our form after our image\" (Gen. 1.26), as if saying, that he should possess a form which knows and attains the Intelligences which have no body, as angels, which are forms without a body, thereby being like unto them. But this is not spoken of a given form which is recognized by the eyes, as the mouth, the nose, the cheek-bones, or any other description of the body, for such is the name of its shape; neither does it apply to the life of living creatures by which it can eat, drink, reproduce, feel and ponder; but it is concerning the Intelligence which is the form of the soul, for it is about the form of the soul that the Verse speaks—\"in our form after our image\". Often times this form is called soul and breath of life, and, therefore, it is necessary to take care in naming them, so that man will not err in such, but each and every name one will learn from the subject thereof.",
            "The form of this soul is not composed of the elements to be separated and become part of them, and it is not an offshoot of the power of the soul to be dependent upon a soul as well as the soul is dependent upon a body. But this form is from the Lord, from Heaven. Therefore, when the body which is composed of the four elements dissolves and the spirit of life is lost, because it is non-existing save only when in the body, and is dependent upon a body in all its functions, this form will not be cut off, for it is not dependent upon a soul in its functions, but doth know and attain all Intelligences which are independent of matter, and knows the Creator of all, and lives forever and throughout all worlds to be. This is what Solomon in his wisdom said: \"And the dust returneth to the earth as it was, and the spirit unto God Who gave it.\" (Ecc. 12.7).",
            "All these matters we spoke of on this subject are but a drop in the bucket, and they are very deep matters; but are not of the same depth as the subject in chapters I and II. The exposition of all these matters in chapters III and IV is called Cosmogony. Thus did the ancient sages charge not to sermonize on these matters before the multitude, but to impart them to one man and instruct him therein.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hagigah, 12b.

And they all, when they prophesy, tremble in all their limbs, the strength of their bodies gives way, their thinking power becomes unbalanced, the sense of understanding alone remains open to grasp what it will see, as it is said of Abraham: \"And behold, a great trembling and darkness befell upon him\" (Gen. 15.12); and as it is said of Daniel: \"For my comeliness was turned into corruption, and I retained no strength\" (Dan. 10.8).",

He, therefore, prophesied at all times, even as it is said: \"Stand ye and let me hear what God will command concerning you\" (Num. 9.8). Moreover, in this, Almighty assured him, saying: \"Go and say to them, 'Return ye to your tents' and, as for thee, remain standing with me here\"(Deut. 5.30–31). Herefrom we learn that all other prophets, when the spirit of prophecy departs from them, return to their tent for their bodily needs, they all, like unto the rest of the people. Therefore, do they not remain separated from their wives. But Moses our Master returned not again to his erstwhile abode, he therefore separated himself forever from his wife and from like matters; his intellect became apprenticed to the Rock of the Universe; glory never departed from him; his countenance became adorned with rays of light, and his saintliness was like that of Angels.",

Nevertheless, not every one who delivers a token or performs a miracle should be believed to be a prophet; for only such man whom we knew heretofore to be worthy of prophecy, both by his wisdom and by his conduct, in consequence whereof he was above all his associates, and walked in the requisite ways of prophecy, in its holiness and self-denial, if, thereafter, he came and delivered a token and performed a miracle and said that he is a messenger of God, it is a mandatory commandment to hearken unto him, for it is said: \"Unto him ye shall hearken\" (Deut. 18.15). And yet, it is even possible that one such will deliver a token and perform a miracle and not be a prophet; as for the token, it might contain some doubtful matter; notwithstanding this, it is mandatory to hearken unto him; for, seeing that he is a great man, wise and worthy of being a prophet, he must be sustained on the presumption that he is a prophet. In this we were commanded to do as we were commanded to base a legal decision upon the testimony of two proper witnesses, even though they may have testified falsely, yet, because we consider them to be proper, their testimony must stand upon their fitness, and concerning this and like matters it is said: \"The secret things belong unto the Lord our God; but the things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children\" (Deut. 29.28); and it is said: \"For man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart\" (I Sam. 16.7)."

But all the tokens delivered by Moses in the wilderness were responsive to necessities, and not as testimony for prophecy. When it became necessary to have the Egyptians sunk, he divided the sea and drowned them therein; when our need was food, he brought down for us Manna; when they became thirsty, he split open the rock for them; when the Korah confederacy denied him, the earth swallowed them up. Likewise came to pass all the other tokens. Wherein, then, did they believe in him? In being present at Mount Sinai; for our own eyes saw and not through a stranger's, and our own ears heard and not that of another; the flame, the thunder and lightning, and he drew near the thick cloud and the Voice speaking unto him, we listening, saying: \"Moses, Moses, go and tell them thus and such,\" for so he also said: \"The Lord spoke with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of fire\" (Deut. 5.4); and it is moreover said: \"The Lord made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us\" (Ibid. –31). Whencefrom do we know that the standing at Mount Sinai alone is the evidence which makes his prophecy true without a shadow of suspicion? Because it is said: \"Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak unto thee, and may also believe thee forever\" (Ex. 19.9).

Thus, Moses our Master, all Israel are his witnesses since their presence at Mount Sinai, and there was no need for him to deliver to them any token. This is what the Holy One, blessed is He! spoke unto him, when he commenced to prophesy, at the time He endowed him with the tokens to be delivered in Egypt, saying to him: \"And they shall hearken to thy voice\" (Ex. 3.18). Moses our Master knew that whosoever believes on the testimony of tokens retains in his heart suspicions and continues to think and reflect; and he endeavored not to go, saying: \"But, behold, they will not believe me\" (Ibid. 4.1). Then it was that the Holy One, blessed is He! made known to him that these tokens were of no need save until they go forth out of Egypt, but after they go forth, when they will stand upon this Mount the suspicious thoughts which they might be thinking after thee will disappear, for I am herewith investing thee with a token which they will know in truth that it was I Who sent thee from the very start, so that there be left no suspicion in their heart. And it is this what the Verse says: \"And this shall be the token unto thee, that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain\" (Ibid. 3. 12). Consequently, it must be said that in every prophet who rises up after Moses our Master, we do not believe because of the token alone, so as to say: \"If he deliver a token we will hearken to all of his prophesying\"; but because of the commandment which Moses commanded in the Torah and said, if he do give a token, \"Unto him ye shall hearken\" (Deut. 18.15). Even as he commanded us to render decision in a matter on the testimony of two witnesses, although we do not know whether they have testified truth or falsehood, so it is mandatory to hearken to such prophet, notwithstanding our lack of knowledge whether the token is true or whether it was delivered by witchcraft and enchantment.",
            "Therefore, if a prophet arose and performed great tokens and miracles, and thereby seeks to deny the prophecy of Moses our Master, we must not hearken unto him, for we know clearly that those tokens are of enchantment and witchcraft, because the prophecy of Moses our Master is not based upon the tokens so as to make a comparison between the tokens of this one and the tokens of that one; for with our own eyes we saw it, and with our own ears we heard it even as he himself heard. This is rather to be compared to witnesses who testify before a man concerning a matter which he saw with his own eyes that it is not as he saw it, who does not hearken to them, but certainly knows that they are false witnesses. Therefore it is said in the Torah, if even the sign or the wonder come to pass: \"Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet\" (Ibid. 13.3). Behold, this one comes to thee with token and wonder to deny that which thou didst see with thine own eyes; whereas we do not believe in a miracle save because of the commandments which Moses commanded us, how will we accept this token which is brought to deny the prophecy of Moses which we saw and heard?"

            "It is a clear and manifest principle concerning the Torah that as a Law it is permanently established forever and evermore; and that it is not subject to mutibility, nor to diminution, nor to amendment; for it is said: \"All this word which I command you, that shall ye observe to do; thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it\" (Ibid. 13.1); and it is further said: \"But the things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law\" (Ibid. 29.28). Herefrom we learn that according to all the words of the Torah we are commanded to do forever. It is, moreover, said: \"a statute forever throughout your generations\" (Num. 15.15); and again it is said:<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Baba Mezi’a 59. C.</i> \"It is not in heaven\" (Deut. 30.12); herefrom we learn that no prophet is thereafter permitted to make any innovation. Therefore, should a man rise up, whether he be from among the Gentiles or whether from among Israel, and deliver a token and perform a miracle saying, that God hath sent him to add a commandment, or to diminish a commandment, or to interpret a certain commandment of among the commandments with such interpretation as we have not heard by tradition from Moses; or he said, that these commandments with which Israel was charged are not forever and throughout all generations, but that they were commandments in keeping with those times only, behold him, he is a false prophet, seeing that he came to deny the prophecy of Moses; and his punishment is death by strangulation, because he wilfully spoke in the name of God concerning that which He did not charge him; for He, blessed is He! commanded Moses, saying, that this enactment was \"unto us and unto our children forever\" (Deut. 29.28); and, \"God is not a man that He should lie\" (Num. 23.19).",
            "If it be so, wherefore is it said in the Torah: \"I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee\" (Deut. 18.18)? Indeed, not to establish a religion is he to come, but to command concerning the words of the Torah and warn the people not to transgress it, as the last of among them said: \"Remember ye the Torah of Moses My servant\" (Mal. 3.22). Likewise if he command us concerning secular things, for example: Go ye to yon place, or do not go; join battle this day, or do not join, construct this fortress, or do not construct it, it is mandatory to hearken unto him, and whosoever deliberately disregards his words has forfeited his life to Heaven, for it is said: \"And it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto My words which he shall speak in my Name, I will require it of him\" (Deut. 18.19).<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin, 89. C.</i>",
            "Likewise, a prophet who violates his own words, or who witholds his prophecy forfeits his life to Heaven, and of the three it is said: \"I will require it of him\" (Ibid.). Moreover, should a prophet, who is known to us as a prophet, charge us to violate one of all the commandments spoken of in the Torah, or many commandments, whether minor or major, it is mandatory to hearken unto him, if it be a need of the time. Thus did we learn traditionally from the early sages: \"In all matters, if the prophet tell thee to forego the words of the Torah, even as Elijah on Mount Carmel did, hearken unto him, save only in idolatry\".<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yebamot, 90; Sifre, Deut. 18. C.</i> Provided, however, that the violation be temporary as, for example, Elijah on Mount Carmel, who sacrificed a burnt-offering without, whereas Jerusalem was chosen the only place therefor, and whosoever sacrifices without is guilty and suffers excision. And, because he is a prophet, it is mandatory to hearken unto him, for even in this it is said: \"Unto him ye shall hearken\" (Deut. 18.15). Had they at that time asked Elijah, and said unto him: How can we abolish that which it is written in the Torah: \"Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt-offerings in every place that thou seest\" (Ibid. 12.13)? He would have replied: \"This is not spoken of save against the one who sacrifices without continuously who is guilty and suffers excision, even as Moses hath commanded; but I am sacrificing this day without, because God wills it, so as to deny the prophets of Baal.\" In such manner, if all the prophets command to violate aught temporary, it is mandatory to hearken to them; but if they say that the matter be abolished forever, the one saying so is punished with death by strangulation, for the Torah said: \"Unto us and to our children forever\" (Ibid. 29.28).",
            "In like manner, if he abolish aught of the things which we did learn by tradition, or if he say concerning a given law of the laws of the Torah that God charged him to interpret the law thus, and that the law should be decided in favor of that man, behold, he is a false prophet, and shall be strangled, even though he delivered a token; for, lo, he came to refute the Torah wherein it is said: \"It is not in heaven\" (Ibid. 30.12). Nevertheless, if his charge be of a temporary nature, we must hearken unto him in everything.",
            "All these matters were said only concerning the rest of the commandments, but concerning idolatry he must not be listened to, even it be temporary, and even if he delivered great tokens and performed great miracles and said that God commanded him that idolatry should be worshipped this day only, or this hour only; for, lo, this one spoke perversion against God, and concerning such one Holy Writ commanded, saying: \"And the sign and the wonder come to pass…Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet…Because he hath spoken perversion against the Lord your God\" (Ibid. 13. 2.4.6); and, lo, he came to refute the prophecy of Moses, we therefore know of a certainty that he is a false prophet, and all that which he did was done by enchantment and witchcraft, and he shall be strangled."

            "Every prophet who will arise among us and say that he is the messenger of God, is not obliged to deliver a token like unto one of the tokens of Moses our Master, or Elijah, or Elisha, wherein there is a change in the natural laws of the universe. But his token should be by foretelling things which are to come to pass in the world, and his words come true; as it is said: \"And if thou wilt say in thy heart: 'How shall we know the word which the Lord hath not spoken?' When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously, thou shalt not be afraid of him\" (Deut.18.21–22). Therefore, if a man, fit for prophecy, come as a messenger of the Name, and he comes not to add to nor diminish from but to advocate the service of God according to the commandments of the Torah, it is not said to him: \"Divide the sea before us, or resurrect the dead, or perform like miracles, and then only shall we believe in thee\". But it shall be said unto him: \"If thou be a prophet, fortell things which are to come to pass\". If he, indeed, foretells, we wait to see whether his words will come to pass or whether they will not come to pass, when, if even a minute detail be wanting it is certain that he is a false prophet. But if all of his words come to pass, he must be in our eyes trustworthy.",
            "The examination must be continued many times; if all of his words be found true, lo, this is a true prophet, as it is said of Samuel: \"And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-Sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord\" (I Sam. 3.20).",
            "Are not the necromancers and astrologists foretelling what is to come to pass, what, then, is the difference between a prophet and such as they? Forsooth, necromancers, astrologists and their like, some of their words are established and some of their words are not established, as the subject is spoken of: \"Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from <i>some</i> of the things that shall come upon thee\" (Is. 47.13); —of <i>some</i> of the things are spoken, but not of <i>all</i> of the things, because they are not capable to foretell all of the things. Moreover, it is possible, too, that none of their words be established, for they may entirely be misled, as the subject is spoken of: \"That frustrateth the tokens of the imposters, and maketh diviners mad\" (Ibid. 44.25). But as for the prophet, all of his words are established, as it is said: \"Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the Lord\" (II Kings 10.10); again it is said: \"the prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath My word, let him speak My word faithfully, What hath the straw to do with the wheat? saith the Lord\" (Jer. 23.28), meaning that the words of astrologers and dreamers are likened to straw wherein there was mixed a few grains of wheat, but the word of the Lord is like unto wheat wherein there is no straw at all. Herein the Verse gave assurance saying, that as for the things that the necromancers and astrologers foretell falsely to the nations, the prophet will inform you in true words, and you have no need for necromancer, or astrologer, or his like, as it is said: \"There shall not be found among you anyone that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, one that useth divination, a soothsayer, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer, or a charmer, or one that consulteth a ghost, or a familiar spirit, or a necromancer . . For these nations, that thou art to dispossess, hearken unto sooth-sayers, and unto diviners\" (Deut. 18. 10. 11. 14); and it is then said: \"A prophet will the Lord thy God raise up unto thee\" (Ibid. 15). Herefrom you learn that the presence of a prophet among us is for no other purpose save that of foretelling things that are to come to pass in the world such as plenty, famine, war, peace and like matters. For, even of private matters he is informed. For instance, Saul when he sustained a loss he went to a prophet to inquire for its whereabouts.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel, 9.1-9. G.</i> Similar matters to these the prophet may tell, not to create another religion, or add a commandment, or diminish.",
            "Concerning a prophet's prediction of calamities, such one would die, or such year would be visited by famine, or war, or matters similar to these, even though his words be not established, it is not considered contradictory to his prophecy. It shall not be said: \"Behold, he spoke and it did not come to pass!\" For, the Holy One, blessed is He! is long-suffering and abundant in goodness, and repenteth Him of the evil, and it is possible that they repented and were forgiven, as did the inhabitants of Nineveh,<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jonah, 3. 5-8 G.</i> or that their fate was postponed, as was with Hezekiah.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isa. 38; 11 Kings, 20.6 G.</i> But if he assured that good would come to pass, saying that it would be thus and such, but the good he promised did not come to pass, it is certain that he is a false prophet, for every good thing God decides upon, even though it be contingent, He doth not repent. And, we find no instance when He repented from a good thing save only at the destruction of the First Temple, when he assured the righteous that they would not die together with the wicked and retracted it, as it appears in Tractat Shabbat<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shabbat, 55a. Because the wickedness was great, and the righteous did not sufficiently rebuke the evildoers. See Shabbat, 119b. G.</i>. Herefrom we learn that a prophet is tested solely by his prophecy concerning good tidings, which is in harmony with what Jeremiah said in his reply to Hananiah son of Azzur, when Jeremiah was prophesying evil tidings and Hananiah good, saying unto him: \"If my words will not be established, it would yet not be evidence that I am a false prophet; but if thy words be not established it will be proclaimed that thou art a false prophet\". For it is said: \"Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people: The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied against many countries, and against many kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence; the prophet that prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the Lord hath truly sent him\" (Jer. 28.7–9).",
            "A prophet of whom another prophet testified that he is a prophet, behold, he is an established prophet and he needs no further test; for, behold, Moses our Master vouched for Joshua and all Israel believed in him before he ever delivered a token, so must it be throughout the generations. A prophet whose prophecy had already been proclaimed, and whose words were believed time after time, or if another prophet gave testimony concerning him, and he continued to follow the paths of prophecy, must not be looked upon with suspicious thoughts, or question the truth of his prophecy. And it is forbidden to test him more than necessary, or go on testing him forever for, it is said: \"Ye shall not try the Lord your God, as ye tried Him in Massah\" (Deut. 6.16), when they said: \"Is the Lord among us, or not\" (Ex. 17.7). But, since a prophet is proclaimed they should believe and know that God is among them, and not suspect nor whisper behind his back, as it is said concerning the subject: \"Yet shall they know that there hath been a prophet among them\" (Eze.2.5)."
