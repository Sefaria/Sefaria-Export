            "The foundation of all foundations and the pillar of wisdom is to know that there is a Primary Being who brought into being all existence. All the beings of the heavens, the earth, and what is between them came into existence only from the truth of His being.",
            "If one would imagine that He does not exist, no other being could possibly exist.",
            "If one would imagine that none of the entities aside from Him exist, He alone would continue to exist, and the nullification of their [existence] would not nullify His existence, because all the [other] entities require Him and He, blessed be He, does not require them nor any one of them. Therefore, the truth of His [being] does not resemble the truth of any of their [beings].",
            "This is implied by the prophet's statement [Jeremiah 10:10]: \"And God, your Lord, is true\" - i.e., He alone is true and no other entity possesses truth that compares to His truth. This is what [is meant by] the Torah's statement [Deuteronomy 4:35]: \"There is nothing else aside from Him\" - i.e., aside from Him, there is no true existence like His.",
            "This entity is the God of the world and the Lord of the entire earth. He controls the sphere with infinite and unbounded power. This power [continues] without interruption, because the sphere is constantly revolving, and it is impossible for it to revolve without someone causing it to revolve. [That one is] He, blessed be He, who causes it to revolve without a hand or any [other] corporeal dimension.",
            "The knowledge of this concept is a positive commandment, as [implied by Exodus 20:2]: \"I am God, your Lord....\"<br>Anyone who presumes that there is another god transgresses a negative commandment, as [Exodus 20:3] states: \"You shall have no other gods before Me\" and denies a fundamental principle [of faith], because this is the great principle [of faith] upon which all depends.",
            "This God is one. He is not two or more, but one, unified in a manner which [surpasses] any unity that is found in the world; i.e., He is not one in the manner of a general category which includes many individual entities, nor one in the way that the body is divided into different portions and dimensions. Rather, He is unified, and there exists no unity similar to His in this world.<br>If there were many gods, they would have body and form, because like entities are separated from each other only through the circumstances associated with body and form.<br>Were the Creator to have body and form, He would have limitation and definition, because it is impossible for a body not to be limited. And any entity which itself is limited and defined [possesses] only limited and defined power. Since our God, blessed be His name, possesses unlimited power, as evidenced by the continuous revolution of the sphere, we see that His power is not the power of a body. Since He is not a body, the circumstances associated with bodies that produce division and separation are not relevant to Him. Therefore, it is impossible for Him to be anything other than one.<br>The knowledge of this concept fulfills a positive commandment, as [implied by Deuteronomy 6:4]: \"[Hear, Israel,] God is our Lord, God is one.\"",
            "Behold, it is explicitly stated in the Torah and [the works of] the prophets that the Holy One, blessed be He, is not [confined to] a body or physical form, as [Deuteronomy 4:39, Joshua 2:11] states: \"Because God, your Lord, is the Lord in the heavens above and the earth below,\" and a body cannot exist in two places [simultaneously].<br>Also, [Deuteronomy 4:15] states: \"For you did not see any image,\" and [Isaiah 40:25] states: \"To whom can you liken Me, with whom I will be equal.\" Were He [confined to] a body, He would resemble other bodies.",
            "If so, what is the meaning of the expressions employed by the Torah: \"Below His feet\" [Exodus 24:10], \"Written by the finger of God\" [ibid. 31:18], \"God's hand\" [ibid. 9:3], \"God's eyes\" [Genesis 38:7], \"God's ears\" [Numbers 11:1], and the like?<br>All these [expressions were used] to relate to human thought processes which know only corporeal imagery, for the Torah speaks in the language of man. They are only descriptive terms, as [apparent from Deuteronomy 32:41]: \"I will whet My lightning sword.\" Does He have a sword? Does He need a sword to kill? Rather, this is metaphoric imagery. [Similarly,] all [such expressions] are metaphoric imagery.<br>A proof of this concept: One prophet says that he saw the Holy One, blessed be He, \"clothed in snow white\" [Daniel 7:9], and another envisioned Him [coming] \"with crimson garments from Batzra\" [Isaiah 63:1]. Moses, our teacher, himself envisioned Him at the [Red] Sea as a mighty man, waging war, and, at Mount Sinai, [saw Him] as the leader of a congregation, wrapped [in a <i>tallit</i>].<br>This shows that He has no image or form. All these are merely expressions of prophetic vision and imagery and the truth of this concept cannot be grasped or comprehended by human thought. This is what the verse [Job 11:7] states: \"Can you find the comprehension of God? Can you find the ultimate bounds of the Almighty?\"",
            "[If so,] what did Moses, our teacher, want to comprehend when he requested: \"Please show me Your glory\" [Exodus 33:18]?<br>He asked to know the truth of the existence of the Holy One, blessed be He, to the extent that it could be internalized within his mind, as one knows a particular person whose face he saw and whose image has been engraved within one's heart. Thus, this person's [identity] is distinguished within one's mind from [that of] other men. Similarly, Moses, our teacher, asked that the existence of the Holy One, blessed be He, be distinguished in his mind from the existence of other entities, to the extent that he would know the truth of His existence as it is [in its own right].<br>He, blessed be He, replied to him that it is not within the potential of a living man, [a creature of] body and soul, to comprehend this matter in its entirety. [Nevertheless,] He, blessed be He, revealed to [Moses] matters which no other man had known before him - nor would ever know afterward - until he was able to comprehend [enough] from the truth of His existence, for the Holy One, blessed be He, to be distinguished in his mind from other entities, as a person is distinguished from other men when one sees his back and knows the structure of his body and [the manner in which] he is clothed.<br>This is alluded to by the verse [Exodus 33:23]: \"You shall see My back, but you shall not see My face.\"",
            "Since it has been clarified that He does not have a body or corporeal form, it is also clear that none of the functions of the body are appropriate to Him: neither connection nor separation, neither place nor measure, neither ascent nor descent, neither right nor left, neither front nor back, neither standing nor sitting.<br>He is not found within time, so that He would possess a beginning, an end, or age. He does not change, for there is nothing that can cause Him to change.<br>[The concept of] death is not applicable to Him, nor is [that of] life within the context of physical life. [The concept of] foolishness is not applicable to Him, nor is [that of] wisdom in terms of human wisdom.<br>Neither sleep nor waking, neither anger nor laughter, neither joy nor sadness, neither silence nor speech in the human understanding of speech [are appropriate terms with which to describe Him]. Our Sages declared: \"Above, there is no sitting or standing, separation or connection.\"",
            "Since this is so, all such [descriptions] and the like which are related in the Torah and the words of the Prophets - all these are metaphors and imagery. [For example,] \"He who sits in the heavens shall laugh\" [Psalms 2:4], \"They angered Me with their emptiness\" [Deuteronomy 32:21], and \"As God rejoiced\" [ibid. 28:63]. With regard to all such statements, our Sages said: \"The Torah speaks in the language of man.\"<br>This is [borne out by the rhetorical question (Jeremiah 7:19 :] \"Are they enraging Me?\" Behold, [Malachi 3:6] states: \"I, God, have not changed.\" Now were He to at times be enraged and at times be happy, He would change. Rather, all these matters are found only with regard to the dark and low bodies, those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is dust. In contrast, He, blessed be He, is elevated and exalted above all this."
        ],
        [
            "It is a mitzvah to love and fear this glorious and awesome God, as [Deuteronomy 6:5] states: \"And you shall love God, your Lord\" and, as [Deuteronomy 6:13] states: \"Fear God, your Lord.\"",
            "What is the path [to attain] love and fear of Him? When a person contemplates His wondrous and great deeds and creations and appreciates His infinite wisdom that surpasses all comparison, he will immediately love, praise, and glorify [Him], yearning with tremendous desire to know [God's] great name, as David stated: \"My soul thirsts for the Lord, for the living God\" [Psalms 42:3].<br>When he [continues] to reflect on these same matters, he will immediately recoil in awe and fear, appreciating how he is a tiny, lowly, and dark creature, standing with his flimsy, limited, wisdom before He who is of perfect knowledge, as David stated: \"When I see Your heavens, the work of Your fingers... [I wonder] what is man that You should recall Him\" [Psalms 8:4-5].<br>Based on these concepts, I will explain important principles regarding the deeds of the Master of the worlds to provide a foothold for a person of understanding to [develop] love for God, as our Sages said regarding love: \"In this manner, you will recognize He who spoke and [thus,] brought the world into being.\"",
            "Everything which the Holy One, blessed be He, created within His world is divided into three categories. They include:<br>a) Creations which are a combination of matter and form. They are constantly coming into existence and ceasing to exist; for example, the bodies of man and beasts, plants, and metals.<br>b) Creations which are [also] a combination of matter and form, but do not change from body to body and from form to form as those in the first category. Rather, their form is permanently fixed in their matter, and they do not change as the others do; for example, the spheres and the stars [which revolve] in them. The matter [from which] they [are composed] differs from [a simple conception of] matter, and their form differs from [a simple conception of] form.<br>c) Creations which have form, but no matter at all; for example, the angels, for the angels do not possess bodies or corporeal being, but rather are forms which are separate from each other.",
            "What is meant by the prophets' statements that they saw an angel of fire or with wings? All these are prophetic visions and parables, as [Deuteronomy 4:24] states: \"God, your Lord, is consuming fire,\" though He is not fire and [the description of Him in this manner] is only metaphoric. Similarly, [Psalms 104:4] states: \"He makes His angels as winds....\"",
            "Since they possess no body, what separates the form [of the angels] from each other? Their existence is not alike. Rather each one is below the level of the other and exists by virtue of its influence, [in a progression of levels,] one above the other.<br>Everything exists by virtue of the influence of the Holy One, blessed be He, and His goodness. Solomon alluded to this [concept] in his wisdom, saying (Ecclesiastes 5:7 : \"Because above the one who is high there is a watcher [and there are others higher than them].\"",
            "The expression \"below the level of the other\" does not refer to height in a spatial sense as [one might say], he is sitting higher than his colleague, [but rather, in regard to spiritual level]. For example, when speaking about two sages, one of whom is greater than the other, we say, \"one is above the level of the other.\" Similarly, a cause is referred to as \"above\" the effect [it produces].",
            "The different names with which the angels are called reflect their [spiritual] levels. Thus, they are called:<br>1) The holy <i>chayyot,</i> who are above all the others;<br><i>2)</i> the <i>ofanim; 7)</i> the <i>elohim;</i><br><i>3)</i> the <i>er'elim; 8)</i> the sons of the <i>elohim;</i><br><i>4)</i> the <i>chashmalim; 9)</i> the <i>keruvim;</i><br><i>5)</i> the <i>serafim;</i> 10) the <i>ishim.</i><br><i>6)</i> the <i>mal'achim;</i><br>These ten names which are used to refer to the angels reflect their ten [different spiritual] levels. The level above which there is no higher level except that of God, blessed be He, is that of the form called <i>chayyot.</i> Therefore, the prophets state that they are below God's throne of glory.<br>The tenth [and lowest] level is that of the form called <i>ishim.</i> They are the angels who communicate with the prophets and are perceived by them in prophetic visions. Therefore, they are called <i>ishim,</i> (“men”), because their level is close to the level of human knowledge.",
            "All these [spiritual] forms are alive. They recognize and know the Creator with very immense knowledge, each of the forms according to its level and not according to its greatness.<br>Even the highest level is unable to conceive of the true nature of the Creator as He [truly] is, since its intellectual capacity is too limited to know or to grasp [Him]. It does, however, comprehend and know more than the form which is below it.<br>This is true regarding each and every level, including the tenth level. This [level] also knows the Creator in a manner that surpasses the potential to know and comprehend [God possessed by] human beings made up of body and soul. None [of these levels] can know the Creator as He knows Himself.",
            "All existence, aside from the Creator - from the first form down to a small mosquito in the depths of the earth - came into being from the influence of His truth. Since He knows Himself and recognizes His greatness, beauty, and truth, He knows everything, and nothing is hidden from Him.",
            "The Holy One, blessed be He, recognizes His truth and knows it as it is. He does not know with a knowledge which is external to Him in the way that we know, for ourselves and our knowledge are not one. Rather, the Creator, may He be blessed, He, His knowledge, and His life are one from all sides and corners, in all manners of unity.<br>Were He to live as life is [usually conceived], or know with a knowledge that is external from Him, there would be many gods, Him, His life, and His knowledge. The matter is not so. Rather, He is one from all sides and corners, in all manners of unity. Thus, you could say, \"He is the Knower, He is the Subject of Knowledge, and He is the Knowledge itself.\" All is one.<br>This matter is beyond the ability of our mouths to relate, [or our] ears to hear, nor is there [the capacity] within the heart of man to grasp it in its entirety. [In expression of this concept, Genesis 42:15] states: \"<i>chay</i> (By the life) of Pharaoh\" and [I Samuel 25:26] states \"<i>chay,</i> (By the life) of your soul,\" but [I Samuel, <i>ibid.</i>] does not say: \"<i>chay,</i> (By the life) of God\" but <i>chai Adonai</i>, “As God lives.” [This shows] that the Creator and His life are not two, as are the lives of living beings or the lives of the angels.<br>Thus, He does not recognize and know the creations in terms of the creations as we know them, but rather He knows them in terms of Himself. Thus, since He knows Himself, He knows everything, for the existence of everything else is dependent on Him.",
            "The concepts that we have mentioned about the subject matter in these two chapters are like a drop from the sea [when compared to] what is necessary to explain this matter. The explanation of all the fundamental principles of these two chapters is referred to as <i>Ma'aseh Merkavah,</i> (lit. “the work of [G‑d’s] chariot.”)",
            "The Sages of the early generations commanded that these matters should not be explained except to a single individual [at a time]. He should be a wise man, who can reach understanding with his [powers of] knowledge. In such an instance, he is given fundamental points, and an outline of the concepts is made known to him. He [is expected to continue to contemplate] until he reaches understanding with his powers of knowledge and knows the ultimate meaning and depth of the concept.<br>These concepts are extremely deep, and not every [person has] the knowledge necessary to appreciate them. In his wisdom, Solomon described them with the metaphor [Proverbs 27:26]: \"Lambs for your clothing.\" [The root <i>kevas</i> - \"lamb\" - also has the meaning \"hide.\"] Thus, our Sages interpreted this metaphor [to mean]: Matters which are the secrets of the world will be your clothing - i.e., they will be for you alone, and you should not discuss them in public.<br>Concerning them, [Proverbs 5:17] teaches: \"They shall be for you and not for others with you.\" [Similarly, the Song of Songs 4:11] states: \"Honey and milk will be under your tongue.\" The Sages of the early generations interpreted this [as a metaphor]: Subjects that are like honey and milk should be [kept] under your tongue."

We are not relying on the person who states or teaches the concept, but on the proofs.</i>",
            "The ninth sphere, which encompasses all the others, was divided by the Sages of the early generations into twelve sections. They gave each of these sections a name, based on the shapes that appeared to be formed by the stars below it which correspond to it.<br>These are the <i>mazalot,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The term <i>mazal</i> literally means \"source of influence.\" In the Rambam's time, it was commonly felt that the position of the stars affected one's future. For this reason, the word <i>mazal</i> is often translated as \"fortune\" or \"luck.\" Many Torah Sages shared these ideas - albeit with the qualification that a Jew always has the potential to rise above these influences. (See the Ra'avad's comments to <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 5:5; Ramban, Responsum 282; and the Nimukei Yosef, Sanhedrin, Chapter 7).<br>The Rambam totally dismisses the influence of astrology.

However, at present, they have already moved slightly, because all the stars in the eighth sphere move, as the sun and the moon do. It is just that [these stars] move more slowly. It would take any of these stars approximately seventy years to move the [same] distance which the sun and the moon'' move in one day.",

Wind is warm and moist. Water is cold and moist, and earth is dry and cold. It is the heaviest of all [these fundamental elements].<br>Water is lighter than earth. Therefore, it is found above it. Wind is lighter than water. Therefore, it hovers above it. Fire is even lighter than wind.<br>Since these are the fundamental [elements] for all the bodies below the sky, the matter of every single body - man, animal, beast, fowl, fish, plant, metal, and stone - is a combination of fire, wind, water, and earth. [In the process of] the combination of these four, each one of them changes while they are being combined. Thus, the combination of the four [fundamental elements] does not resemble any one of the [elements] as it exists alone. [Similarly,] in any combination of them, there cannot be found even one portion of fire as it exists alone, wind as it exists alone, water as it exists alone, nor earth as it exists alone. Rather, they have all changed and become a single body.<br>Each and every body which is a combination of these four [fundamental elements] will have a combination of cold and warmth, moistness and dryness. There are some bodies which have a more powerful [concentration] of the fundamental [element] of fire - for example, creatures with living souls. Accordingly, they have a higher temperature. [Conversely,] there are some bodies with a more powerful concentration of the element of earth - for example, the stones. Accordingly, they are very dry. Similarly, some of them have bodies with a greater concentration of the element of water. Accordingly, they are moist.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From the above statements, it appears that the \"fundamental elements\" of fire, wind, water, and earth are different from the entities to which we generally refer with these names.</i><br>In this manner, one may find one body which is warmer than another body, which is itself warm, and one body drier than another body, which is itself dry. Similarly, there are bodies in which cold alone is noticeable, and other bodies in which moistness alone is noticeable. In some bodies, cold and dryness are equally noticeable; in others, cold and moistness are equally noticeable; in others, warmth and dryness are equally noticeable; and in others, warmth and moistness are equally noticeable.

His soul, however, is on a much higher level that the animal's life-force.</i> every [entity that] decomposes will not return to the four fundamental [elements] immediately.

A portion of the wind which is close to the fire changes, goes through a metamorphosis, and becomes fire.<br>Similarly, a portion of the fire close to the wind goes through a metamorphosis, changes, contracts and becomes wind. The wind which is close to the water changes, contracts, and becomes water; and the water which is close to the earth changes, contracts, and becomes earth.<br>This [cycle of] change [proceeds] little by little over the course of time.

This is referred to as <i>to'ar</i> (appearance).<br>It is not the soul found in all living flesh which allows it to eat, drink, reproduce, feel, and think. Rather, knowledge is the form of this [dimension of] soul and it is concerning this form of the soul, that the verse states: \"in our image and in our likeness.\" Frequently, this form is referred to as <i>nefesh</i> or <i>ruach.</i> Therefore, one must be careful regarding these names, lest another person err regarding them. Each name reveals its characteristics.",

He must [also] possess a very broad and accurate mental capacity.<br>A person who is full of all these qualities and is physically sound [is fit for prophecy]. When he enters the <i>Pardes</i> and is drawn into these great and sublime concepts, if he possesses an accurate mental capacity to comprehend and grasp [them], he will become holy. He will advance and separate himself from the masses who proceed in the darkness of the time. He must continue and diligently train himself not to have any thoughts whatsoever about fruitless things or the vanities and intrigues of the times.<br>Instead, his mind should constantly be directed upward, bound beneath [God's] throne [of Glory, striving] to comprehend the holy and pure forms and gazing at the wisdom of the Holy One, blessed be He, in its entirety, [in its manifold manifestations] from the most elevated [spiritual] form until the navel of the earth, appreciating His greatness from them. [After these preparations,] the divine spirit will immediately rest upon him.<br>When the spirit rests upon him, his soul becomes intermingled with the angels called <i>ishim,</i> and he will be transformed into a different person and will understand with a knowledge different from what it was previously. He will rise above the level of other wise men, as [the prophet, Samuel] told Saul [I Samuel 10:6]: \"[The spirit of God will descend upon you] and you shall prophesy with them. And you will be transformed into a different person.\"",
            "There are a number of levels among the prophets. Just as with regard to wisdom, one sage is greater than his colleague, so, too, with regard to prophecy, one prophet is greater than another. They all, [however, share certain commonalities]. They receive prophetic visions only in a visionary dream or during the day after slumber has overtaken them, as [Numbers 12:6] states: \"I make Myself known to him in a vision. I speak to him in a dream.\"<br>When any of them prophesy, their limbs tremble, their physical powers become weak, they lose control of their senses, and thus, their minds are free to comprehend what they see, as [Genesis 15:12] states concerning Abraham: \"and a great, dark dread fell over him.\" Similarly, Daniel [10:8] states: \"My appearance was horribly changed and I retained no strength.\"",
            "When a prophet is informed of a message in a vision, it is granted to him in metaphoric imagery. Immediately, the interpretation of the imagery is imprinted upon his heart, and he knows its meaning.<br>For example, the ladder with the angels ascending and descending envisioned by the patriarch, Jacob, was an allegory for the empires and their subjugation [of his descendants]. Similarly, the creatures Ezekiel saw, the boiling pot and the rod from an almond tree envisioned by Jeremiah, the scroll Ezekiel saw, and the measure seen by Zechariah [were all metaphoric images]. This is also true with regard to the other prophets.<br>Some would relate the allegory and its explanation as these did. Others would relate only the explanation. At times, they would relate only the imagery without explaining it, as can be seen in some of the prophecies of Ezekiel and Zechariah.<br>All of the prophecies come in the form of metaphoric imagery and allegories.",
            "All the prophets do not prophesy whenever they desire. Instead, they must concentrate their attention [upon spiritual concepts] and seclude themselves, [waiting] in a happy, joyous mood, because prophecy cannot rest upon a person when he is sad or languid, but only when he is happy.<br>Therefore, the prophets' disciples would always have a harp, drum, flute, and lyre [before them when] they were seeking prophecy. This is what is meant by the expression [I Samuel 10:5]: \"They were prophesying\" - i.e., following the path of prophecy until they would actually prophesy - as one might say, \"So and so aspires to greatness.\"",
            "Those who aspire to prophecy are called \"the disciples of the prophets.\" Even though they concentrate their attention, it is possible that the Divine Presence will rest upon them, and it is possible that it will not rest upon them.",
            "All the statements made above describe the path of prophecy of all the early and later prophets, with the exception of Moses, our teacher, the master of all prophets.<br>What is the difference between Moses' prophecy and that of all the other prophets? [Divine insight is bestowed upon] all the [other] prophets in a dream or vision. Moses, our teacher, would prophesy while standing awake, as [Numbers 7:89] states: \"When Moses came into the Tent of Meeting to speak to Him, he heard the Voice speaking to him.\"<br>[Divine insight is bestowed upon] all the [other] prophets through the medium of an angel. Therefore, they perceive only metaphoric imagery and allegories. Moses, our teacher, [would prophesy] without the medium of an angel, as [Numbers 12:8] states: \"Mouth to mouth I speak to him,\" and [Numbers 12:8] states: \"He gazes upon the image of God\" - i.e., there was no metaphor. Rather, he would perceive the matter in its fullness, without metaphor or allegory. The Torah testifies concerning him [Numbers 12:8]: [\"I speak to him...] manifestly, without allegory.\" His appreciation of prophecy would not be through metaphor, but through open revelation, appreciating the matter in its fullness. All the [other] prophets are overawed, terrified, and confounded [by the revelations they experience], but Moses, our teacher, would not [respond in this manner], as [Exodus 33:11] relates: \"[God spoke to Moses...] as a man speaks to a friend\" - i.e., just as a person will not be awe-struck from hearing his friend's words, so, too, Moses' mental power was sufficient to comprehend the words of prophecy while he was standing in a composed state.<br>All the [other] prophets cannot prophesy whenever they desire. Moses, our teacher, was different. Whenever he desired, the holy spirit would envelop him, and prophecy would rest upon him. He did not have to concentrate his attention to prepare himself [for prophecy], because his [mind] was always concentrated, prepared, and ready [to appreciate spiritual truth] as the angels [are]. Therefore, he would prophesy at all times, as [Numbers 9:8] states: \"Stand and hear what God will command you.\"<br>He was promised this by God, as [implied by Deuteronomy 5:27-28]: \"Go and tell them: `Return to your tents,' but you stand here together with Me.\" This should be interpreted to mean: When prophecy departs from all the [other] prophets, they return to their \"tents\" - i.e., the needs of the body like other people. Therefore, they do not separate themselves from their wives. Moses, our teacher, never returned to his original \"tent.\" Therefore, he separated himself from women and everything of that nature forever. He bound his mind to the Eternal Rock. [Accordingly,] the glory never left him forever. The flesh of his countenance shone, [for] he became holy like the angels.",
            "There is the possibility that a prophet will experience prophecy for his own sake alone - i.e., to expand his mental capacities and to increase his knowledge - [allowing him] to know more about the lofty concepts than he knew before.<br>It is also possible that he will be sent to one of the nations of the world, or to the inhabitants of a particular city or kingdom, to prepare them and to inform them what they should do or to prevent them [from continuing] the evil which they are doing.<br>When he is sent [on such a mission], he is given a sign or a wonder [to perform], so that the people will know that God has truly sent him.<br>Not everyone who performs signs or wonders should be accepted as a prophet: only a person who is known to be fit for prophecy beforehand; i.e., his wisdom and his [good] deeds surpass those of all his contemporaries. If he follows the paths of prophecy in holiness, separating himself from worldly matters, and afterwards performs a sign or wonder and states that he was sent by God, it is a mitzvah to listen to him, as [Deuteronomy 18:15] states: \"Listen to him.\"<br>It is possible that a person will perform a sign or wonder even though he is not a prophet - rather, the wonder will have [another cause] behind it. It is, nevertheless, a mitzvah to listen to him. Since he is a wise man of stature and fit for prophecy, we accept [his prophecy as true], for so have we been commanded.<br>[To give an example of a parallel:] We are commanded to render a [legal] judgment based on the testimony of two witnesses. Even though they may testify falsely, since we know them to be acceptable [as witnesses], we presume that they [are telling the truth].<br>Considering these matters and the like, [Deuteronomy 29:28] states: \"The hidden matters are for God, our Lord, but what is revealed is for us and our children,\" and [I Samuel 16:7] states: \"Man sees what is revealed to the eyes, but God sees into the heart.\""

            "The Jews did not believe in Moses, our teacher, because of the wonders that he performed. Whenever anyone's belief is based on wonders, [the commitment of] his heart has shortcomings, because it is possible to perform a wonder through magic or sorcery.<br>All the wonders performed by Moses in the desert were not intended to serve as proof [of the legitimacy] of his prophecy, but rather were performed for a purpose. It was necessary to drown the Egyptians, so he split the sea and sank them in it. We needed food, so he provided us with manna. We were thirsty, so he split the rock [providing us with water]. Korach's band mutinied against him, so the earth swallowed them up. The same applies to the other wonders.<br>What is the source of our belief in him? The [revelation] at Mount Sinai. Our eyes saw, and not a stranger's. Our ears heard, and not another's. There was fire, thunder, and lightning. He entered the thick clouds; the Voice spoke to him and we heard, \"Moses, Moses, go tell them the following:....\"<br>Thus, [Deuteronomy 5:4] relates: \"Face to face, God spoke to you,\" and [Deuteronomy 5:3] states: \"God did not make this covenant with our fathers, [but with us, who are all here alive today].\"<br>How is it known that the [revelation] at Mount Sinai alone is proof of the truth of Moses' prophecy that leaves no shortcoming? [Exodus 19:9] states: \"Behold, I will come to you in a thick cloud, so that the people will hear Me speaking to you, [so that] they will believe in you forever.\" It appears that before this happened, they did not believe in him with a faith that would last forever, but rather with a faith that allowed for suspicions and doubts.",
            "Thus, those to whom [Moses] was sent witnessed [his appointment] as a prophet, and it was not necessary to perform another wonder for them. He and they were witnesses, like two witnesses who observed the same event together. Each one serves as a witness to his colleague that he is telling the truth, and neither has to bring any other proof to his collegue.<br>Similarly, all Israel were witnesses to [the appointment of] Moses, our teacher, at the [revelation] at Mount Sinai, and it was unnecessary for him to perform any further wonders for them.<br>This concept [is alluded to in the interchange between God and Moses at the revelation of the burning bush]. At the beginning of his prophecy, the Holy One, blessed be He, gave him the signs [and wonders] to perform in Egypt and told him [Exodus 3:18], \"And they will listen to your voice.\"<br>Moses, our teacher, knew that one who believes [in another person] because of signs has apprehension in his heart; he has doubts and suspicions. Therefore, he sought to be released from the mission, saying: \"They will not believe me\" [Exodus 4:1], until the Holy One, blessed be He, informed him that these wonders [were intended only as a temporary measure,] until they left Egypt. After they would leave, they would stand on this mountain and all doubts which they had about him would be removed.<br>[God told him:] Here, I will give you a sign so that they will know that I truly sent you from the outset, and thus, no doubts will remain in their hearts. This is what is meant by [Exodus 3:12]: \"This will be your sign that I sent you: When you take the people out of Egypt, you will serve God on this mountain.\"<br>Thus, we do not believe in any prophet who arises after Moses, our teacher, because of the wonder [he performs] alone, as if to say: If he performs a wonder we will listen to everything he says. Rather, [we believe him] because it is a mitzvah which we were commanded by Moses who said: If he performs a wonder, listen to him.<br>Just as we are commanded to render a [legal] judgment based on the testimony of two witnesses, even though we do not know if they are testifying truthfully or falsely, similarly, it is a mitzvah to listen to this prophet even though we do not know whether the wonder is true or performed by magic or sorcery.",
            "Therefore, if a prophet arises and attempts to dispute Moses' prophecy by performing great signs and wonders, we should not listen to him. We know with certainty that he performed those signs through magic or sorcery. [This conclusion is reached] because the prophecy of Moses, our teacher, is not dependent on wonders, so that we could compare these wonders, one against the other. Rather we saw and heard with our own eyes and ears as he did.<br>To what can this be compared? To witnesses who gave testimony concerning a matter to a man who had observed the situation with his own eyes. He will never listen to them and will know for certain that they are false witnesses.<br>Therefore, the Torah states (Deuteronomy 13:3-4) that \"[Even] if [such] a sign or wonder will come, you should not listen to the words of that prophet.\" He comes to you with signs and wonders to deny what you saw with your own eyes. We believe in a wonder [as evidence of a prophet's reliability] only because of the mitzvah which Moses commanded us. Therefore, how can a wonder [cause us to] accept this [person] who comes to deny the prophecy of Moses which we saw and heard?"

            "It is clear and explicit in the Torah that it is [God's] commandment, remaining forever without change, addition, or diminishment, as [Deuteronomy 13:1] states: \"All these matters which I command to you, you shall be careful to perform. You may not add to it or diminish from it,\" and [Deuteronomy 29:28] states: \"What is revealed is for us and our children forever, to carry out all the words of this Torah.\" This teaches that we are commanded to fulfill all the Torah's directives forever.<br>It is also said: \"It is an everlasting statute for all your generations,\" and [Deuteronomy 30:12] states: \"It is not in the heavens.\" This teaches that a prophet can no longer add a new precept [to the Torah].<br>Therefore, if a person will arise, whether Jew or gentile, and perform a sign or wonder and say that God sent him to:<br>a) add a mitzvah,<br>b) withdraw a mitzvah<br>c) explain a mitzvah in a manner which differs from the tradition received from Moses, or<br>d) if he says that the mitzvot commanded to the Jews are not forever, but rather were given for a limited time,<br>he is a false prophet.

This applies when his command is temporary in nature.<br>For example, on Mount Carmel, Elijah offered a sacrifice outside [the Temple's premises], even though Jerusalem was chosen for such [service], and one who offers a sacrifice outside [the Temple's premises] is liable for <i>karet.</i> Since he was [already established as] a prophet, it was a mitzvah to listen to him. The commandment, \"Listen to him,\" applies in these circumstances as well.<br>If they would have asked Elijah: How can we violate the Torah's command [Deuteronomy 12:13]: \"[Be careful...] lest you offer your burnt offerings everywhere\"?, he would have told them: We should not say anything, but anyone who offers a sacrifice outside [the Temple premises] is liable for <i>karet,</i> as Moses said.

            "Behold, the diviners and sorcerers also predict the future. What differentiates between them and a prophet?<br>[Though] some of the prophecies made by diviners, sorcerers, and the like materialize, some do not [as implied by Isaiah 47:13]: \"Let the stargazers, the astrologers, and the diviners of what will happen in the months, come and save you from what will come upon you.\" [Our Sages note that the verse states] \"from what\" rather than \"from all that.\"<br>Also, it is possible that none of their predictions will come true and they will err completely, as [Isaiah 44:25] states: \"He frustrates the omens of imposters and drives diviners mad.\"<br>In contrast, all the words of a prophet come true, as [II Kings 10:10] states: \"God's word will not fall to the ground.\" Similarly, [Jeremiah 23:28] states: \"'The prophet who has a dream may relate his dream, but he who [receives] My word shall speak words of truth. What is the chaff to the grain?' declares God.\" This implies that the words of sorcerers and dreamers are like chaff that has been mixed with some grain, while the word of God is like grain without any chaff at all.<br>Concerning this, the Torah promises that a prophet will relate the truth about those matters for which the soothsayers and diviners give false predictions to the gentiles, so that [the Jews] will not need a sorcerer, a diviner, or the like, as [Deuteronomy 18:10, 14-15] states: \"Among you, there shall not be found anyone who passes his son through fire, [a sorcerer, a diviner...] For these nations... [listen to diviners and sorcerers, God has not given you this lot. God will] set up a prophet from your midst.\"<br>We see from this that a prophet will arise for the sole purpose of telling us the future events which will transpire in the world, whether there will be plenty or famine, war or peace, and the like. He even will inform a particular individual regarding his needs. Hence, when Saul lost an object, he went to the prophet to discover where it was. These are the types of things that a prophet will say. He will not come to found a new faith or add or withdraw a mitzvah.",

If his words do not come true, this does not nullify the validity of his prophecy, nor do we say [in condemnation of him]: \"Behold, he spoke and his words were not fulfilled.\"<br>[This is because] the Holy One, Blessed be He, is slow to anger, abundant in kindness, and forgiving of evil. Thus, it is possible that they will repent and [their sin] will be forgiven, as in the case of the people of Nineveh, or that [retribution] will be held in abeyance, as in the case of Hezekiah.<br>[This does not apply regarding prophecies for the good.] If [a prophet] promised that good would come and such and such will occur, and the good about which he prophesied did not materialize, he is surely a false prophet. Any good which God decrees - even if [the decree] is provisional - will never be nullified. {We find [God] nullifying a positive prophecy only during the destruction of the first Temple. He had promised the righteous that they would not die together with the wicked; however, He nullified this prophecy, as explained in the tractate of Shabbat.}<br>We can conclude from this that a prophet should be tested on the basis of his positive prophecies. This was what Jeremiah meant by his reply to Chananiah ben Azur, when he was prophesying doom and Chananiah was promising a [glorious future]. He told Chananiah: \"If my words are not fulfilled, this will not lead to the conclusion that I am a false prophet. If your promises are not fulfilled, however, it will be proven that you are a false prophet,\" as implied by [Jeremiah 28:7,9]: \"Hear, now, this word...

The same holds true for subsequent generations.<br>Once a prophet has made known his prophecy, and his words have proven true time after time, or another prophet has proclaimed him a prophet, if he continues in the path of prophecy, it is forbidden to doubt him or to question the truth of his prophecy.<br>[When establishing the authenticity of a prophet,] it is forbidden to test him more than necessary.
