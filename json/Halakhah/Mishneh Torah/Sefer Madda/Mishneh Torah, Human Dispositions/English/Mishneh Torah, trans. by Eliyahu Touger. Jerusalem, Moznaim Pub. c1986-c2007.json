            "Each and every man possesses many character traits. Each trait is very different and distant from the others.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Many commentaries assume that the Rambam is stating simply that there are many personality types, which he proceeds to describe: e.g., the angry man, the calm man, etc. They quote various sources in support of this viewpoint, among them <i>Berachot</i> 58a: \"Whoever sees a multitude of Jews recites the blessing: 'Blessed is...the wise who knows the hidden secrets,' because just as their natures are not similar, neither are their faces.\"<br>However, by stating that the many character traits are possessed by \"each and every man,\" it is possible that Rambam is implying more than that there are people with different traits. Though in <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (The Guide to the Perplexed) 2:40 the Rambam himself elaborates upon that idea, it can be said that here his intent is different. He is emphasizing the degree to which each individual's personality is a combination of different traits, which may be unrelated and even distant from each other. Anger, generosity, and modesty, for example, can be found together in the same person, much in the same way that tenants of all sorts - unrelated to each other - can be housed in a common building.<br>To illustrate these traits, the Rambam employs concrete examples of extreme personalities, so that the contrasts can be appreciated more easily.</i><br>One type of man is wrathful; he is constantly angry. [In contrast,] there is the calm individual who is never moved to anger,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Obviously, anger or passivity are not these individuals' only traits. Surely, they share the full spectrum of human emotions. However, in these individuals, these traits are most prominent.<br>See Halachah 2:3 for a further discussion of anger.</i> or, if at all, he will be slightly angry, [perhaps once] during a period of several years.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">or, if at all, he will be slightly angry, [perhaps once] during a period of several years.</i><br>There is the prideful man and the one who is exceptionally humble.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chapter 2, Halachah 3, also deals at length with the contrasts between pride and humility.</i> There is the man ruled by his appetites - he will never be satisfied from pursuing his desires,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Kohelet Rabbah</i> 1:34 states: \"No person will die having accomplished [even] half of what he desires.\" This statement is difficult to comprehend since there appear to be many successful individuals who achieve their desires. Nevertheless, their accomplishments do not necessitate that their desires will be satisfied. As the <i>Midrash</i> continues: \"A person who possesses 100 silver pieces desires 200. One who possesses 200 desires 400.\"<br>Desire itself is never satisfied. Instead, it puts the person on a constantly moving treadmill, with ever-increasing aims. As soon as one reaches one goal, he instinctively begins the pursuit of another.</i> and [conversely,] the very pure of heart, who does not desire even the little that the body needs.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This pair of contrasting personality types deal with a person's appetites which can be satisfied by sensual experience. For example, gluttony is stimulated and satisfied by taste. In contrast, the traits mentioned below - the desire for money or the lack of desire for it - do not involve the senses.</i><br>There is the greedy man, who cannot be satisfied<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, \"whose soul is not satisfied.\" Perhaps the Rambam uses \"soul,\" both here and with regard to the man ruled by his sensual appetites, because it is the desire that characterizes the man, not the performance of an action as such. A man may never indulge his passion for food, or actually amass money and yet, be gluttonous or greedy. Though, in practice, his ability to gratify his ambitions may be limited by external factors, the desires of his soul are, nonetheless, unlimited.</i> with all the money in the world, as [Ecclesiastes 5:9] states: \"A lover of money never has his fill of money.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here, the Rambam describes an example where the desire for money becomes a goal in itself. In contrast, a man who gathers money so that he can buy things or achieve power is not interested in money per se. Although he may be faulted for different reasons, he is not greedy for money. On the other hand, for the \"lover of money,\" money itself becomes his raison d'etre.</i> [In contrast,] there is the man who puts a check on himself;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">literally, he \"cuts himself short.\" II Kings 19:26 employs a similar usage of the root <i>ketzar</i>: \"And the inhabitants are broken, with shortened (i.e., weakened or useless) arms.\"</i> he is satisfied with even a little, which is not enough for his needs, and he does not bother to pursue and attain what he lacks.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to a lazy person, who will not bestir himself even for that which is necessary. In Chapter 2, Halachah 7, this type is described clearly as: \"lazy and an idler.\" This is the description, too, in the Rambam's Introduction to <i>Avot - Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4.</i><br>There is [the miser,]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In contrast to the \"lover of money\" mentioned above, the miser is not as bent on acquiring new wealth as much as hoarding the money and possessions he has.<br>who torments himself with hunger, gathering [his possessions] close to himself. - The terminology the Rambam uses emphasizes the miser's need to be close to his money and possessions. Similar, but not exactly correspondent, expressions are found in the Bible (Proverbs 13:11 and the Talmud (<i>Bava Kama</i> 80a).</i> who torments himself with hunger, gathering [his possessions] close to himself. Whenever he spends a penny of his own, he does so with great pain. [Conversely,] there is [the spendthrift,] who consciously wastes his entire fortune.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Chullin</i> 84b gives examples of such behavior: wearing linen clothing, using glass utensils, and hiring workers without supervising them.</i><br>All other traits follow the same pattern [of contrast]. For example: the overly elated and the depressed;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam is not referring to an average optimist and a pessimist. Rather, he describes personalities who do not have a grip on reality. <i>onain</i> is the term used for the bereaved who has not yet buried his dead. <i>mehulal</i>, the other extreme, is used by Jeremiah 51:7 to refer to a state of intoxication and delirious drunkenness.</i> the stingy and the freehanded;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our translation of <i>shua</i> is clearly evident from <i>Hilchot Matnot Ani'im</i> 7:11. It follows that <i>chili</i> represents the opposite extreme. (See also Ibn Ezra, Isaiah 32:5.)<br>The difference between this pair of traits and the miser-spendthrift pair mentioned above is that the latter refers to a person's conduct toward himself, while the former refers to his conduct with regard to others. The stingy man, unlike the miser, may spend money for his own needs, but is tightfisted when others are concerned. By the same token, a freehanded man need not necessarily indulge himself, though he is generous when giving charity. Though this may sound praiseworthy, when taken to extremes it can also prove dangerous, because a person may hurt himself in the process of giving excessively to another. (See <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>.)</i> the cruel and the softhearted; the coward and the rash. and the like.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We find a longer treatment of personal characteristics in the Rambam's <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4.</i>",
            "Between each trait and the [contrasting] trait at the other extreme, there are intermediate points, each distant from the other.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> understands this as follows: Let us imagine a line drawn from one extreme to another - between the stingy and the freehanded, for example. All who are neither stingy nor freehanded stand between them. They are all intermediate, whether they tend towards stinginess or freehandedness. Each point along this imaginary line stands apart - \"is distant\" - from the others on that line. In a diagram, this idea might be depicted as follows:<br>X-----*-------*------*-------*----------*---------*X<br>Stingy intermediate points freehanded.<br>However, it is highly unlikely that all the Rambam wishes to teach us is that there are many intermediate points of temperament between the extremes. After all, that is self-evident. Furthermore, in each set of associated temperaments - for example, stinginess and freehandedness - only three points on the line are of importance to the Rambam in clarifying his view of personality development: the two extremes and the midpoint. Why should he mention all the other intermediate possibilities?<br>Thus, it appears that the Rambam is telling us that there is a midpoint temperament between each pair of contrasting extremes. Given the entire range of human temperaments, there are a number of midpoints which are not necessarily related to each other. For example, the midpoint for generosity may be very different from the midpoint for humility. Thus, in Halachah 1, the Rambam stated that our personality traits are \"different and distant;\" in this halachah, he makes a parallel statement about the midpoints.</i><br>With regard to all the traits: a man has some from the beginning of his conception,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., the Rambam distinguishes between genetic traits and those that are acquired.</i> in accordance with his bodily nature.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here, we see an interrelation between body and soul. Certain temperaments are produced by or relate to particular physical characteristics.<br>[In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam states: \"From the outset of a person's [life], he has neither virtues nor vices....\" However, there is not necessarily a contradiction between <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> and this halachah. The possession of certain character traits does not determine whether one will use them for a vice or a virtue.]</i> Some are appropriate to a person's nature and will [therefore] be acquired more easily than other traits.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., these traits are not transferred genetically. However, a person is born with a tendency towards them.<br>In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam elaborates on this issue at length. He explains that some people are born with a brain whose internal chemistry is prone to intellectual achievement. However, if this person does not develop this tendency, he will not automatically become a thinker.<br>Similarly, others have leanings towards courage or cowardice. Nevertheless, these are merely tendencies, and they will not manifest themselves unless consciously developed. Also, these tendencies are, at all times, subject to man's control. We are granted free will, and choose our course of behavior.</i> Some traits he does not have from birth. He may have learned them from others,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam writes: \"From his youth, one becomes accustomed to acting in accordance with the accepted behavior of one's family and locale.\" In these few words, the Rambam includes all the people who might influence a person's character development: his parents, siblings, teachers, peers, and others. Also, note Chapter 6, Halachah 1.</i> or turned to them on his own.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are two ways of acquiring such traits</i> This may have come as a result of his own thoughts,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., an intuitive realization of the correctness of a certain course of behavior stemming from one's own creative thought.</i> or because he heard that this was a proper trait for him, which he ought to attain.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., through study a person understands the value of a certain character trait and sets out to acquire it.</i> [Therefore,] he accustomed himself to it until it became a part of himself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Unlike the inborn or easily acquired traits, these qualities must first be accepted intellectually. Then, through habitual actions, they become part of the personality. (See Halachah 7 for a detailed explanation of such a process of behavioral modification.)</i>",
            "The two extremes of each trait, which are at a distance from one another, do not reflect a proper path.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., the path described in this and the following halachot.</i> It is not fitting<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">except in certain cases, as explained in Chapter 2, Halachah 3.</i> that a man should behave in accordance with these extremes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">if that his nature</i> or teach them to himself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">and modify his behavior in this direction.<br>In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam elaborates on this concept, contrasting hedonism with asceticism, and pointing out how neither represents a healthy and mature approach to life.</i><br>If he finds that his nature leans towards one of the extremes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., a genetic trait, as mentioned in the previous halachah</i> or adapts itself easily to it,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">a trait which is easily acquired because of the individual's natural tendencies, as mentioned in the previous halachah.</i> or, if he has learned one of the extremes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">the third type of trait mentioned in the previous halachah.</i> and acts accordingly, he should bring himself back to what is proper<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 2, Halachah 2, for an extensive description of the process of correcting one's excesses of temperament.</i> and walk in the path of the good [men].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., the path that good men follow. This translation is based on the fact that the word \"path\" is in the singular, while the modifier \"good\" is in the plural.</i> This is the straight path.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Perhaps the Rambam is borrowing a biblical phrase here: \"That you walk in the path of the good, and guard the way of the righteous\" (Proverbs 2:20).<br>The nature of \"the straight path\" is explained in detail in the following halachah.</i>",
            "The straight path:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This expression is also used in <i>Avot</i> 2:1. In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam cites his explanation of the middle path in the fourth chapter of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>.</i> This [involves discovering] the midpoint temperament of each and every trait that man possesses [within his personality.]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., a path develops out of a series of midpoints.</i> This refers to the trait which is equidistant from either of the extremes, without being close to either of them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These statements echo the opening remarks of the fourth chapter of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>:<br>The good acts are those balanced ones midway between two extremes. Both of the extremes are bad - one reflects excess and the other, want. The virtues [good traits] are temperaments and habits which are midway between these two bad tendencies.<br>These actions [good actions] are produced as a result of these [the good] traits.<br>Despite the similarity between the Rambam's statements here and those quoted, there is a slight difference. Here, the Rambam focuses on good traits, while in <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, he emphasizes good actions.</i><br>Therefore, the early Sages instructed a man to evaluate his traits,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam appears to be referring to <i>Sotah</i> 5b: \"Whoever evaluates his paths in this world will merit and witness God's salvation.\"</i> to calculate them and to direct them along the middle path,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">At the conclusion of Chapter 4 of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, the Rambam writes:<br>When a man weighs his actions constantly and directs them towards their midpoints, he will be on the most elevated human plane possible. He will thereby approach God and grasp His will. This is the most perfect path in the service of God.<br>Constant introspection is a necessary element in any program of personal and spiritual growth. Even when a person has the highest goals, unless he frequently looks himself squarely in the mirror and examines his behavior, he may make gross errors.</i> so that he will be sound {of body}.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We have enclosed the words \"of body\" with brackets because they are not found in authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and are problematic. Though a properly balanced temperament may also lead to physical health, this does not appear to be the Rambam's intent.<br>If the Hebrew <i>bigufo</i> is omitted as suggested, the meaning of <i>shaleim</i> would be altered from \"sound\" to \"complete\" or \"perfect.\"</i><br>For example: he should not be wrathful, easily angered; nor be like the dead, without feeling, rather he should [adopt] an intermediate course; i.e., he should display anger<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our translation is based on Chapter 2, Halachah 3. (Note also the commentary of the <i>Knesset HaGedolah</i>.)</i> only when the matter is serious enough to warrant it,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam appears to be referring to matters which evoke personal feelings. Nevertheless, the <i>Misrat Moshe</i> interprets this passage as referring to an instance in which Torah law would require a display of anger - e.g., a colleague's transgression of Torah law.</i> in order to prevent the matter from recurring. Similarly, he should not desire<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to physical desire.</i> anything other than that which the body needs and cannot exist without, as [Proverbs 13:25] states:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam quotes supporting verses for only two of the \"intermediate traits;\" perhaps, because his description of the middle-of-the-road position for these traits might appear to veer toward one extreme. We might expect the intermediate point between gluttony and its opposite extreme to be eating to one's satisfaction. However, here we are told that we should desire only what is sufficient in order to exist.<br>However, the Rambam is not telling us to deny ourselves satisfaction. Deuteronomy 8:10 teaches: \"You shall eat and be satisfied, and bless God, your Lord.\" Based on that verse, <i>Berachot</i> 48b explains that we are obligated to recite grace only when we feel physically satisfied. (The Rambam quotes this concept in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 1:1.) In Chapter 3, Halachah 1, and in <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, he elaborates on the negative aspects of asceticism.<br>Thus, his intent cannot be that we deny our desires, but rather that we school ourselves to desire and feel satisfied with what we need, without excess. This is a dominant theme in the sections on diet in Chapter 4, and those describing the conduct of a Torah sage in Chapter 5.</i> \"The righteous man eats to satisfy his soul.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse continues: \"But the belly of the wicked will want.\" The commentaries note that the contrast between the two does not center on the quantity of food they eat, but on the attitude with which they eat it. Because the righteous are not given over to pursuit of gratification, they can be satisfied. Conversely, it is the gluttony of the wicked which actually causes their want.<br>Note also the Midrashic interpretations of this verse:<br>\"The righteous...\" This refers to Eliezer, who said to Rebecca: \"Let me sip a little water\" (Genesis 24:17) - a single sip.<br>\"And the belly of the wicked will want.\" This refers to Esau, who said to Jacob: \"Stuff me...\" (Genesis 25:30). Rabbi Yitzchak ben Zeira said: he opened his mouth agape like a camel and said: \"I will open my mouth and you put it in\" (<i>Tanchumah; Pinchas</i> 13; <i>BaMidbar Rabbah</i> 21:18).</i><br>Also, he shall not labor in his business except to gain what he needs for immediate use, as [Psalms 37:16] states:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here again, the Rambam quotes a Biblical verse, because his definition of an intermediate path may seem extreme. The verse also clarifies that the Rambam is not denigrating the idea of work, but excessive preoccupation with one's profession as a means of acquiring possessions.<br>It is highly unlikely that the Rambam would criticize work per se. Note Proverbs 6:6: \"Sluggard, go to the ant, see its ways and become wise;\" and <i>Berachot</i> 8a:<br>He who enjoys the toil of his hands is greater than one who fears God..., as it is stated: \"If you eat of the work of you hands, you are fortunate and will possess the good\" (Psalms 128:2).<br>\"You are fortunate\" - in this life, and \"will possess the good\" - in the world to come.<br>The Rambam, himself, quotes the latter passage in <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 3:11. Thus, the Rambam is not criticizing a person for working hard, but rather teaching us that work and its profits should not be our greatest priorities.</i> \"A little is good for the righteous man.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse in its entirety expresses a contrast: \"A little is better for the righteous man than the great wealth that many [of the] wicked possess.\" Note the commentary of ibn Ezra: \"The righteous man will be happier with his small lot than the wicked with their great wealth.\"</i><br>He should not be overly stingy<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The printed editions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> have <i>yikfotz</i> (close his hand). However, most manuscripts use the term: <i>yikabetz</i> (gather).<br><i>Yikfotz</i> recalls Deuteronomy 15:7: \"Do not close your hand from your needy brother.\" Thus, the contrasting extreme would be freehandedness. <i>Yikabetz</i>, like <i>vikubatz</i> in Halachah 1, reflects miserly behavior, the opposite of which is being a spendthrift. The variant texts might reflect a difference of opinion as to which opposing extremes the Rambam had in mind.</i> nor spread his money about, but he should give charity according to his capacity<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Arachin</i> 8:12-13, which places restrictions on the extent of one's generosity.</i> and lend to the needy as is fitting.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lending is also a form of charity. In <i>Hilchot Matnot Ani'im</i> 10:7, the Rambam lists eight degrees of charity. The highest is the support of a fellow Jew who has become poor by giving him loans or the like.</i> He should not be overly elated and laugh [excessively],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Such expressive \"happiness\" is often a sign of inner discontent and suffering.</i> nor be sad and depressed in spirit. Rather, he should be quietly happy at all times,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">his joy should be a composed sense of satisfaction.<br>[In this context, see the Ramah's conclusion of his notes to <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> (697:1) in which he quotes Proverbs 15:15: \"A good-hearted person is always celebrating.\"]</i> with a friendly countenance.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his commentary on <i>Avot</i> 1:14, the Rambam defines \"a friendly countenance\" as \"a spirit of will and gentility.\"</i> The same applies with regard to his other traits.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam mentions many other \"intermediate traits.\" Among them:<br>Courage is the midpoint between arrogance and fear. Humility is the intermediate between pride and meekness. Earnestness is the intermediate between boasting and lowliness....Patience is the intermediate between rashness and insensitivity...</i><br>This path is the path of the wise.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., those whose behavior is controlled by their intellect</i> Every man whose traits are intermediate and equally balanced can be called a \"wise man.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note the contrast to the \"pious\" of the following halachah. Though the published editions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> include this line as the final concept in our halachah, many of the authoritative manuscripts place it as the beginning of Halachah 5.</i>",
            "A person who carefully [examines] his [behavior],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">in an effort to achieve the desired intermediate path</i> and therefore deviates slightly from the mean<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">to compensate for a possible error in calculating that mean.</i> to either side is called pious.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam explains that one can refine and correct his behavior by balancing a tendency for excess in one direction by intentionally forcing oneself to adopt the opposite extreme. (See Chapter 2, Halachah 2.) He continues:<br>Therefore, the pious did not allow themselves to fix their traits at the midpoint, but would bend slightly to the side of excess or want as a hedge and a guard.<br>He goes on to explain that, even for the pious, these extremes are not ends in themselves, but means to help them overcome natural tendencies. Thus, both the pious and a person of underdeveloped character may act in an extreme manner. However, the difference between them is that the behavior of the pious is carefully calculated with the intent of refining his personality, while the underdeveloped person does so without thought, as a natural response to his whims and fancies.</i><br>What is implied?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., how is this concept exemplified?</i> One who shuns pride<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">At first glance, the choice of pride as an example is rather problematic, because in Chapter 2, Halachah 3, the Rambam states:<br>There are traits for which it is forbidden for a person to follow an intermediate path.... Such a trait is pride...The proper path is not that a person should merely be humble, but rather hold himself very lowly...Therefore, our Sages commanded: \"Be very, very humble of spirit.\"<br>It is possible to explain that because of the negative aspects of the quality of pride, the middle path that one should follow in regard to it does not resemble the middle paths of the other traits and may appear as an extreme. Pride represents one extreme, its converse being absolute lack of concern for self to the extent that one walks around in rags. Between these extremes are a number of intermediate points: modesty - which might normally be considered as the intermediate level; humility - which the Rambam considers as the true middle path; and extreme humility - which is pious behavior (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>). See also the commentary on the halachah cited above.<br>Possibly, it is the exaggerated contrasts in this set of traits that make it the most fitting example to demonstrate the principle of the middle path that the Rambam espouses. These gross differences allow for the possibility of clear distinctions.</i> and turns to the other extreme<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> emphasizes that one need not actually adopt the other extreme, but rather, he should tend his behavior in that direction.</i> and carries himself lowly is called pious. This is the quality of piety.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">which represents a deviation from the mean.</i> However, if he separates himself [from pride] only to the extent that he reaches the mean and displays humility, he is called wise. This is the quality of wisdom.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his commentary on <i>Avot</i> 5:6, the Rambam contrasts the wise and the pious:<br>A boor is one who lacks both intellectual and ethical development...A wise man possesses both these qualities in a complete way, as is fitting.<i>A pious man is a wise man</i> who increases his piety - i.e., his emotional development - until he tends toward one extreme, as explained in Chapter 4 [of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>], and his deeds exceed his wisdom.<br>Thus, the wise man is one whose ethical behavior has been developed to the point at which it reflects his intellectual sophistication. He is able to appreciate the mean of each trait and express it within the context of his daily life. The pious man also possesses this quality, but due to his desire for ultimate self-refinement, he is willing to sacrifice himself and tend slightly to the extreme in certain instances.<br>Although in this halachah, the Rambam differentiates between the middle path - the path of the wise - and \"beyond the measure of the law\" - the path of the pious, in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 5:11 he describes how, \"according to the greatness of the Sage, should be the care he takes to go beyond the measure of the law.\" Thus, it appears that a truly wise man will ultimately seek pious ways.</i> The same applies with regard to other character traits.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., there is a mean which is the path of wisdom, and a deviation from that course with a positive intent, which is the path of piety.</i><br>The pious of the early generations<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This expression is borrowed - out of context - from the Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 5:1.</i> would bend their temperaments from the intermediate path towards [either of] the two extremes. For some traits they would veer towards the final extreme,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">excess (<i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4)</i> for others, towards the first extreme.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">lack (ibid.). Depending on the circumstances involved, deviation to either extreme can produce positive results.</i> This is referred to<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">by our Sages...</i> as [behavior] beyond the measure of the law.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We find this expression used in a number of Talmudic passages. For example, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 30b relates that Rabbi Yishmael, Rabbi Yossi's son, was on a journey. A porter traveling the same road asked him to help lift a load of wood. Rabbi Yishmael was a distinguished scholar, and, therefore, this base task would have been demeaning for him. Nevertheless, rather than refuse the porter entirely, Rabbi Yishmael purchased his entire load from him. This was considered as behavior beyond the measure of the law.<br>See also <i>Berachot</i> 7a and 45b, <i>Bava Kama</i> 100a, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 24b. However, in these and other Talmudic passages where the term is used, the emphasis appears to be on the ethical or legal imperative involved, without stressing the aspect of character development. [Note <i>Hilchot Aveidah</i> 11:7, the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat</i> 259:3 and 263:3, and <i>Sefer Mitzvot Katan</i> (Positive Commandment 49), which mention our obligation to go beyond the measure of the law.]<br>Thus, the Rambam appears merely to be borrowing the term used by the Sages without referring to any specific instance. The path of behavior prescribed by one's intellect corresponds to law, and an intentional deviation from that course for the sake of piety is \"beyond the measure of the law.\"</i><br>We are commanded<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Sifre</i> (on Deuteronomy 13:5  states: 'You shall walk after God, your Lord' - this is a positive commandment.\" The <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Ki Tetze</i>, p. 270) also makes a similar statement. However, neither source elaborates.<br>Among the <i>Geonim</i>, the <i>Ba'al Halachot Gedolot</i> does list it as a commandment. Rav Sa'adiah Gaon does not include it as a specific commandment.<br><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive mitzvah 8) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 610) include this as one of the Torah's 613 mitzvot. However, the Rambam's inclusion of this commandment as one of the 613 mitzvot is somewhat problematic. In <i>Shoresh</i> 4 of his introduction to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, he states that he does not include any \"general mitzvah\" which does not involve a specific activity in his reckoning of the 613 mitzvot. For this reason, \"Observe My statutes\" (Leviticus 19:19) or \"Be holy\" (Leviticus 19:2) are not included in the 613 mitzvot. On the surface, the command the Rambam mentions here also seems to be an all encompassing charge to develop ourselves spiritually without any specific activity.<br>Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, was asked this question, and he explained that here the specific activity implied by this commandment is the development of our emotions and character traits. A somewhat deeper perspective can be gained from the Rambam's own description of the mitzvah. When listing the mitzvot at the beginning of these halachot, he states that the mitzvah is \"to imitate God's ways\" and in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, he defines the mitzvah as \"to imitate Him, blessed be He, according to our potential.\"<br>The implication of these statements is that man has a constant obligation to carry out all of his deeds and guide the progress of his emotional development with the intent of imitating God. (See <i>Likkutei Sichot, Tavo</i> 5748, and note the commentary on the following halachah.)</i> to walk in these intermediate paths<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Despite the Rambam's praise of piety, his very description of it as \"beyond the measure of the law\" implies that, though it is desirable, it cannot be considered as obligatory.<br><b>and they are good and straight paths - as [Deuteronomy 28:9] states: \"And you shall walk in His ways.\" -</b> The Rambam describes this mitzvah in the following halachah. Indeed, the authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> include the paragraph we have just explained as the beginning of Halachah 6. As emphasized in the introduction to this text, the Rambam has structured the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> with the intent of \"revealing all the laws to the great and to the small with regard to each and every mitzvah.\" He does not mention philosophical and ethical concepts unless they are halachot - i.e., practical directives for our behavior.<br>In this context, we can understand the structure of this chapter. The Rambam set out to describe the mitzvah of following God's ways. As stated in this halachah, he perceives this to mean developing our personalities by emulating the qualities which the Creator reveals. As he states in the following halachah, those qualities are identical with the middle path of human behavior. Therefore, in the initial halachot of this chapter, the Rambam sets out to describe the nature of human personality and the ideal temperaments - the middle path - that man should seek to achieve. Having laid down this foundation, he is able to define that mitzvah in this halachah and begin offering directives for its fulfillment in Halachah 7.<br><b>[Our Sages] taught [the following] explanation of this mitzvah -</b> The Rambam appears to be referring to the <i>Sifre, Ekev</i> 11:22, which he quotes in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (ibid.). That explanation is also paralleled in the <i>Mechiltah</i> (Exodus 14:2  and <i>Shabbat</i> 133b.<br>It must be noted that other Talmudic and Midrashic sources interpret the commandment to imitate God in a different light. Note <i>Sotah</i> 14a:<br>[Deuteronomy 13:5 states]: \"You shall walk after God, your Lord.\" Is it possible for man to walk after the Divine Presence? Has it not been stated: \"Behold, God, your Lord, is a consuming fire\" (Deuteronomy 4:24 ?Rather, [it means] one should follow the qualities of God.Just as He dresses the naked..., you, too, should dress the naked;God visited the sick...; you, too, should visit the sick;God comforted the bereaved...;you, too, should comfort the bereaved;God buried the dead...; you, too, should bury the dead.<br>In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam mentions emulating both God's deeds and His qualities. Similarly, <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, in its description of this mitzvah, and the <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> in his commentary - both here in <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> and also in <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> - mention both deeds and qualities.<br>There is not necessarily a contradiction between these two emphases. As mentioned above, our actions reflect our personalities. Therefore, it follows that developing our characters in the manner outlined by the Rambam in this halachah will ultimately produce the good deeds mentioned by our Sages in the passage from <i>Sotah</i>.<br>Nevertheless, deed is often not a reflection of character. A person with many severe character faults may still do good deeds. Hence, for the \"resemblance of God\" to be complete, it is not sufficient merely to perform positive deeds. Rather, a person must undergo internal change by developing his character. Therefore, the Rambam focuses more on this aspect of the commandment.<br><b>Just as He is called \"Gracious,\" you shall be gracious; Just as He is called \"Merciful,\" you shall be merciful; Just as He is called \"Holy,\" you shall be holy; -</b> Neither the <i>Sifre</i> nor the other sources quoted above mention the trait of holiness. Rather, the third trait mentioned is \"piety.\" Perhaps, since the Rambam gave a specific definition for piety in the previous halachah within his conception of personality development, he does not mention it in the present context to prevent any possible confusion.<br><b>In a similar manner, the prophets -</b> The Rambam's choice of words is somewhat surprising since many of these expressions are also found in the Torah as well as in the prophetic works. However, in the Torah these titles are mentioned by Moses or the other prophets. Perhaps this is the Rambam's intent.<br><b>called God by other titles: \"Slow to anger,\" \"Abundant in kindness,\" \"Righteous,\" \"Just,\" \"Perfect,\" \"Almighty,\" \"Powerful,\" and the like. -</b> In <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:11-12 and in detail in <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (Guide to the Perplexed), Vol. I, Chapters 53 and 54, the Rambam explains that these names are not descriptions of God, who cannot be defined by any specific quality. To do so would limit Him and detract from His infinite and transcendent state of being.<br>Rather, the use of these titles must be understood as follows: God brings about activities, which, had they been carried out by man, would have been motivated by these emotional states. For example, instead of utterly destroying the Jews after the sin of the Golden Calf, God allowed our people to continue. Were such a deed to have been performed by a human ruler, we would describe him as \"slow to anger.\" Though that term cannot serve as a description for God - for He cannot be described - the Torah and the prophets referred to Him by such terms with the following intent.<br><b>[They did so] to inform us that these are good and just paths. -</b> i.e., God acted in ways which we identify with these qualities - and the Torah and the prophets mention these actions - because these are attributes which man should strive to achieve.<br><b>A person is obligated to accustom himself to these paths and [to try to] resemble Him - <i>Likkutei Sichot</i> (ibid.) states that with the latter phrase, the Rambam is adding a new thought. As explained above, God cannot be described by any particular quality. If He manifests a quality, it is for a specific intent.<br></b><br><b>In <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (ibid., Chapter 54), the Rambam mentions that the leader of a country should act in a similar manner.<br></b><br><b>Sometimes he will be merciful and generous to some people - not because of his feelings and natural compassion, but because they are deserving of such treatment.Sometimes he will bear a grudge, seek revenge, and rage against certain people - not out of feelings of anger... - but in order to produce positive results....The ultimate ideal man can achieve is to imitate God according to his potential... i.e., to have our deeds resemble His deeds.<br></b><br>For this reason, human behavior should not be motivated by the spontaneous expression of emotion. Rather, man's emotions should arise as the result of a deliberate process of thought.<br>This reflects themes brought out in the previous halachot of this chapter: that a person must constantly evaluate and review his emotions (Halachah 4); that it is a wise man who is able to appreciate the middle path (Halachah 5).<br>This is what is meant by the imitation of God: that a person not be controlled by the unchecked expression of his emotions. Rather, he should control his feelings and, motivated by his desire to resemble God, search to find the correct and proper quality, the middle path, appropriate to the situation at hand.<br>to the extent of his ability. - for man is ultimately finite in nature, and no true resemblance to God is possible.<br><b>How can one train himself to follow these temperaments to the extent that they become a permanent fixture of his [personality]? -</b> Having established personality development as a mitzvah in the previous halachah, the Rambam begins his explanation of how this mitzvah is fulfilled.<br><b>He should perform - repeat - and perform a third time -</b> Thus, a person's deeds will shape his character traits.<br>In this process of personal change, the stress is on the repetition of an act, and not on its quantity or intensity. In his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Avot</i> 3:15, the Rambam writes that giving a thousand coins to one person at one time is not as effective in stimulating feelings of generosity as giving a single coin one thousand times.<br>As mentioned in Halachah 4, though the Rambam's explanations in this chapter parallel those of the fourth chapter of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, the texts differ in stressing actions (as the opening lines of that chapter imply), or on character development, which is the theme of our text.<br>For this reason, the two texts also perceive the process of causation differently. In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, the Rambam states: \"These actions [good actions] are produced as a result of these [the good] traits,\" while here he sees the traits being produced by the actions.<br>Nevertheless, the two texts do not actually contradict each other. Both statements are true. Our deeds reflect our personalities, and they also help shape those personalities. Generally, this means that a person's behavior will reinforce and strengthen the character traits that motivated those very deeds. However, this chapter - and more particularly, this halachah - deals with a person who has made a commitment to change and refine his character. Therefore - based on his intellect and the directives of the Torah, rather than his spontaneous feelings - he chooses to perform deeds that will bring about this process of inner change.<br><b>which conform to -</b> reflect and are motivated by...<br><b>the standards of the middle road temperaments -</b> described in Halachot 4 and 5.<br><b>He should do this constantly, until these acts are easy for him and do not present any difficulty. -</b> A trait possessed by a person produces activities naturally and spontaneously. However, if one has not acquired a trait as yet, certain actions will be foreign to his nature, and one must trouble himself to perform them.<br>For example, a liberal man gives charity naturally; the miser must force himself to give. The action for each is the same, but not the inner feelings.<br><b>Then, these temperaments will become a fixed part of his personality. -</b> If the miser continues to give frequently, he will find that he no longer feels like a miser, but has become liberal in heart as well as in hand.<br><b>Since the Creator -</b> The Rambam uses the term <i>yotzer</i> - literally \"the One who forms\" - (which appears only one other time in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>: <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:7).<br>The Rambam describes God as the Creator with reference to the Divine qualities he describes in these halachot. Before the existence of the world and man, there would be no purpose for God to reveal these qualities, for until man's creation, no one could learn from or emulate them.<br>[The word <i>yotzer</i> may also be used because of its connection to the word <i>yeitzer</i>, meaning drive or inclination.

Depending on how sick they are, they find it exceedingly burdensome.<br>Isaiah 5:20 speaks of such people in a like manner: \"Woe to those who call the bad good, and the good bad, who take darkness to be light and light to be darkness, who take bitter to be sweet and sweet to be bitter.\" Concerning them, Proverbs 2:13 states: \"Those who leave the upright paths to walk in the ways of darkness.\"<br>What is the remedy for the morally ill?

            "How are they to be healed? We tell the wrathful man to train himself to feel no reaction even if he is beaten or cursed.

If a man is only humble, he is not following a good path. Rather, he must hold himself lowly and his spirit very unassuming. That is why Numbers 12:3 describes our teacher Moses as \"<i>very</i> humble\" and not simply \"humble\".

Furthermore, they said: \"Whoever is arrogant should be placed under a ban of ostracism. This applies even if he is only somewhat arrogant.\"<br>Anger is also an exceptionally bad quality. It is fitting and proper that one move away from it and adopt the opposite extreme. He should school himself not to become angry even when it is fitting to be angry. If he should wish to arouse fear in his children and household - or within the community, if he is a communal leader - and wishes to be angry at them to motivate them to return to the proper path, he should present an angry front to them to punish them, but he should be inwardly calm. He should be like one who acts out the part of an angry man in his wrath, but is not himself angry.<br>The early Sages said: Anyone who becomes angry is like one who worships idols. They also said: Whenever one becomes angry, if he is a wise man, his wisdom leaves him; if he is a prophet, his prophecy leaves him. The life of the irate is not true life.<br>Therefore, they have directed that one distance himself from anger and accustom himself not to feel any reaction, even to things which provoke anger. This is the good path.<br>This is the way of the righteous: They accept humiliation, but do not humiliate others; they listen when they are shamed, but they do not answer; they do this with love and are joyous in their sufferings. Of them, Judges 5:31 states: \"And those who love Him are like the sun when it comes out in its strength.\"",
            "One should always cultivate silence and refrain from speaking, except with regard to matters of knowledge or things that are necessary for his physical welfare. It was said that Rav, the disciple of our saintly teacher, Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi, never uttered an idle word in all his days - which is what the conversation of most people consists of.<br>One should not speak at length even about matters involving one's physical needs. On this point, our Sages commanded us and said: \"Whoever speaks at length brings on sin.\" They also said: \"I have found nothing better for one's person than silence.\"<br>Similarly, when speaking about matters of Torah or knowledge, one's words should be brief, but rich in content. This is what the Sages commanded with their statement: \"One should always teach his students with brevity.\" In contrast, if one's words are many and the content scant, that is foolishness, of which Ecclesiastes 5:2 states: \"The dream comes with a multitude of subjects, and the voice of the fool with a multitude of words.\"",
            "Silence is a safeguard for wisdom.<br>Therefore, one should not hasten to answer, nor speak at length. He should teach his students in calm and tranquility without shouting or wordiness. This is what Solomon stated: \"The words of the wise are heard in tranquility\" (Ecclesiastes 9:17).",
            "A person is forbidden to act in a smooth-tongued and luring manner. He should not speak one thing outwardly and think otherwise in his heart. Rather, his inner self should be like the self which he shows to the world. What he feels in his heart should be the same as the words on his lips.<br>It is forbidden to deceive people, even a non-Jew. For example, one should not sell a gentile the meat of an animal which has not been ritually slaughtered as if it were ritually slaughtered meat, nor a shoe made from the hide of an animal which has died of natural causes as if it were made of the hide of a slaughtered animal. One should not press his colleague to share a meal with him when he knows that his colleague will not accept the invitation, nor should he press presents upon him when he knows that his colleague will not accept them. He should not open casks supposedly for his colleague which he must open for sale, in order to deceive him into thinking that they have been opened in his honor. The same applies with all matters of this sort.<br>It is forbidden to utter a single word of deception or fraud. Rather, one should have only truthful speech, a proper spirit and a heart pure from all deceit and trickery.",
            "One should neither be constantly laughing and a jester, nor sad and depressed, but happy. Our Sages declared: \"Jesting and lightheadedness accustom one to lewdness.\" They also directed that a man should not laugh without control, nor be sad and mournful, but receive everyone in a friendly manner.<br>Similarly, he should not be greedy, rushing for wealth and possessions, nor lazy and an idler from work. Rather, he should be of a goodly eye and limit his business endeavors so that he may occupy himself with Torah study. He should be happy with the little which is his lot.<br>He should not be quarrelsome, of envious temperament, full of desires, nor pursue honor. Our Sages have said: \"Envy, desire and honor remove a man from life in this world.\"<br>The general principle is that one should follow the midpoint quality of each temperament until all his traits are aligned at the midpoint. This is what is implied by Solomon's statement: \"Make even the turning of your foot and make all your ways firm\" (Proverbs 4:26)."

However, they never regarded such practices as a goal in their own right. Others observed their behavior and mistook asceticism for an end rather than a means to achieve the middle path.<br>From the Rambam's statements in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, it would appear that there are two drawbacks to asceticism:a) It might lead a person to poor health, illness, and a lack of strength which would prevent him from serving God as the Rambam states in Halachah 3. b) A person might err and feel that he has fulfilled his obligation to serve God through these ascetic practices. As a result, he may never feel the need to dedicate himself to the service of God as He prescribed in the Torah.<br>There is a third disadvantage that is stressed heavily by the teachings of Kabbalah and Chassidut and may be hinted at by the Rambam's statements in the following halachot.<br>The <i>Zohar</i> (Vol. II, p. 42b) states that God created the world \"in order to let Himself be known.\" Similarly, <i>Tanya</i> (Chapter 33) explains that God created the world because He desired to have a dwelling place in the lower worlds. Thus, a person who tends to otherworldliness and asceticism, defeats God's purpose in creation.</i> Whoever follows this path is called a sinner [as implied by Numbers 6:11's] statement concerning a nazarite: \"and he [the priest] shall make an atonement for him, for his having sinned regarding [his] soul.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A nazarite is forbidden to become impure through any contact with a dead body for the extent of his nazarite vow.

At the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> (13:23), the Rambam states: \"Whoever takes a vow in order to stabilize his temperaments and correct his deeds, is zealous and praiseworthy.\"<br>In <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i>, he gives examples of people who were excessively inclined to a particular quality who take vows to correct their faults (in a manner reminiscent of his advice in the beginning of Chapter 2 of these halachot).

He quotes the prophet, Zechariah, who questions the motives of the Jews' fasts (7:5): \"Was it for Me that you fasted?\" and exhorts them to \"Practice true justice, and show kindness and mercy every man to his brother\" as the proper service of God. To underscore this point, he concludes with the prophecy (<i>ibid.</i> 8:19) that even the public fasts will ultimately be transformed into festivals and days of rejoicing.</i> general statement also refers to those who fast constantly.

The Rambam (<i>Hilchot Ta'anit</i> 1:4; 1:9) himself mentions that the Sages commanded both the community and the individual to fast in times of distress.<br>The Rambam's statements have been questioned by the Rashba (Responsa 431 and 688) and by the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> based on <i>Nedarim</i> 10a. However, the commentaries note that Shmuel, the author of the statement in <i>Ta'anit</i>, also states (<i>Bava Kama</i> 91a) that one may fast. Here, the Rambam's statements are directed against self- mortification and asceticism and not against fasting per se.<br>Nevertheless, it must be noted that in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i>, when the Rambam describes \"the paths of Teshuvah\" (3:4), he makes no mention of fasting.</i> Of all the above, and their like, Solomon directed and said: \"Do not be overly righteous and do not be overly clever; why make yourself desolate?\" (Ecclesiastes 7:16)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrashic works have not interpreted this verse in the manner suggested here.

One might have expected it to appear in the previous chapter which deals with other excesses and deviations from the middle path. However, it is possible to explain that, in its present position, it serves as a preface to the following halachot which explain how our service of God and connection to Him can be established within the context of our material reality. Thus, when viewed as a totality, this chapter emphasizes how Judaism desires that religious fulfillment be found within the context of our day to day life, rather than in otherworldly \"spiritual\" activities.</i>.",
            "A person should direct his heart and the totality of his behavior to one goal,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, Chapter 5, the Rambam addresses himself to many of the concepts mentioned in this and the following halachah. He begins that chapter with the declaration:<br>A person must control all the powers of his soul with [his] intellect... and concentrate on a single goal at all times: To comprehend God, blessed be He, to the extent that man can know Him.All of his activities: what he does, the way he rests, and what he says should lead to this goal.</i> becoming aware of God, blessed be He.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, the term means \"The Name,\" but obviously, it refers to the Master of The Name.</i> The [way] he rests, rises, and speaks should all be directed to this end.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the previous Halachah, the Rambam condemned asceticism and otherworldliness. In this Halachah, he stresses the desired intent of our worldly involvement, to know God.<br>In Chapter 1, Halachah 6, the Rambam introduced a religious component into the development of an ethical personalty, pointing out that we must \"imitate\" God's qualities. In this halachah, he adds a further point. All of man's actions are to be taken in an atmosphere of God-awareness.<br>The concept of knowing God recalls the opening Halachah of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>:<br>The fundamental [principle] upon which all fundamental [principles are based] and the pillar of the wisdoms is to know that there is a Primary Being.<br>In both halachot, the Rambam emphasizes how the knowledge of God is not an abstract, intellectual past-time, but rather an all- encompassing commitment, embracing every aspect of our experience. Torah living does not confine God to the synagogue or the house of study, but provides us with a means to relate to Him within every dimension of our lives (<i>Al HaTeshuvah</i>).<br>For example: when involved in business dealings or while working for a wage, he should not think solely of gathering money. - i.e., he should not view the acquisition of money as an end in its own right.</i><br>For example: when involved in business dealings or while working for a wage, he should not think solely of gathering money.

Rather, it is also only a means for the service of God.<br>Similarly, when he eats, drinks and engages in intimate relations, he should not intend to do these things solely for pleasure - In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam also uses the expression \"solely for pleasure,\" indicating that the Rambam does not advocate a life without physical pleasure. (Note also the passage from the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7:4, quoted below.)<br>There is nothing wrong with enjoying food, for example, as long as one does so within the framework of maintaining health. Indeed, in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, the Rambam emphasizes how one may use pleasure to encourage himself to perform the acts necessary to maintain his health.</i> - food, drink, a home and a wife.<br>Similarly, when he eats, drinks and engages in intimate relations, he should not intend to do these things solely for pleasure to the point where he will eat and drink only that which is sweet to the palate and engage in intercourse for pleasure. Rather, he should take care to eat and drink only in order to be healthy in body and limb.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam has just laid down the principle that all of man's actions are to be carried out in a framework of awareness of God. Yet, to exemplify this principle, he speaks not of awareness of God, but of avoiding indulgence and maintaining one's health. The Rambam introduces the maintenance of health as an immediate - and intermediary - goal which will provide us with a program of concrete action.</i><br>Therefore, he should not eat all that the palate desires like a dog or a donkey.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam states: \"In such an activity, a person is just like an animal. It is not an action man undertakes because he is a man, but rather, one that he undertakes because he is an animal.\"</i> Rather, he should eat what is beneficial for the body, be it bitter or sweet. Conversely, he should not eat what is harmful to the body, even though it is sweet to the palate.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam gives a full list of proper eating habits in the following chapter. Here, he cites only selected examples:</i> For example: a person with a warm constitution should not eat meat or honey, nor drink wine,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">as Solomon has stated in a parable: The eating of much honey is not good (Proverbs 25:27). One should drink endive juice, even though it is bitter, - this is given as a remedy for a warm liver constitution (Maimonides' Medical Aphorisms).</i> as Solomon has stated in a parable: The eating of much honey is not good (Proverbs 25:27). One should drink endive juice, even though it is bitter, for then, he will be eating and drinking for medical reasons only, in order to become healthy and be whole<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">for a man cannot exist without eating and drinking.</i> - for a man cannot exist without eating and drinking.<br>Similarly, he should not have intercourse except to keep his body healthy<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 4, Halachah 19, for a discussion of this matter.</i> and to preserve the [human] race.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad mentions a third reason for intercourse - granting one's wife her conjugal rights The Rambam does not mention that issue here because, in these chapters he focuses on those behaviors in which a person engages voluntarily as an expression of his personal desires. He discusses a man's conjugal obligations later in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>, Chapter 14 (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> Therefore, he should not engage in intercourse whenever he feels desire,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See also Chapter 5, Halachah 4, which discusses the frequency of intimate relations.</i> but when he knows that he requires a seminal emission for medical reasons or in order to preserve the [human] race.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his commentary to the mishnah, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7:4, the Rambam writes:<br>The intent of intimate relations is the preservation of the species and not only pleasure. The aspect of pleasure was only introduced in order to arouse the creations toward that ultimate goal...The proof of this is that desire and pleasure cease after ejaculation for this was the entire goal for which our instincts were aroused. If the goal were pleasure, satisfaction would continue as long as man desired.</i>",
            "A person who accustoms himself to live by [the rules of] medicine does not follow a proper path if his sole intention is that his entire body and limbs be healthy<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam puts the maintenance of health mentioned in the previous halachah into proper perspective. It is not to be pursued as a goal in its own right. Rather, it should be appreciated as merely a means to enable one to reach an awareness of God. The Rambam develops this idea at length in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> Chapter 5. There, he states:<br>A person should have the intention while eating, drinking, having intercourse, sleeping, awakening, moving, and resting, [that he does so] for the purpose of his physical health alone.His intention in [seeking] physical health should be to prepare for the soul healthy and sound vessels to acquire wisdom and intellectual and emotional advantages until he reaches the goal of [knowing God].</i> and that he have children who will do his work and toil for him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., though procreation is a valid reason for intimate relations, one's intent in procreation should not be selfish.</i> Rather, he should have the intent that his body be whole and strong, in order for his inner soul to be upright so that [it will be able] to know God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam also elaborates on the interrelation between the attainment of physical health and spiritual achievement in the Guide to the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapter 27.<br>Heath is necessary as part of one's process of striving to know God...</i> For it is impossible to understand and become knowledgeable in the wisdoms when one is starving or sick, or when one of his limbs pains him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Maggid of Mezeritch would say: \"A small hole in the body creates a large hole in the soul.\"</i> [Similarly,] one should intend to have a son [with the hope that] perhaps he will be a wise and great man in Israel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the desired goal in procreation - to perpetuate the nation, not only physically, but also spiritually.<br>Thus, whoever walks in such a path all his days will be serving God constantly; even in the midst of his business dealings, even during intercourse for his intent in all matters is to fulfill his needs so that his body be whole to serve God. - In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam associates such behavior with Deuteronomy 6:5: \"Love God, your Lord, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might.\" The course of action described enables us to dedicate every aspect of our being toward the love of God as prescribed by this verse.<br>Even when he sleeps, if he retires with the intention that his mind and body rest, lest he take ill and be unable to serve God because he is sick, then his sleep is service to the Omnipresent, blessed be He. - Perhaps, the Rambam uses this name for God to convey the concept that just as God's presence pervades all existence, our service of Him must encompass all aspects of our lives.<br>On this matter, our Sages - <i>Avot</i> 2:15</i><br>Thus, whoever walks in such a path all his days will be serving God constantly; even in the midst of his business dealings, even during intercourse for his intent in all matters is to fulfill his needs so that his body be whole to serve God.<br>Even when he sleeps, if he retires with the intention that his mind and body rest, lest he take ill and be unable to serve God because he is sick, then his sleep is service to the Omnipresent, blessed be He.<br>On this matter, our Sages have directed and said: \"And all your deeds should be for the sake of Heaven.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam elaborates upon this statement as follows:<br>Our Sages included this entire concept in the most succinct expression possible... When one meditates on this concise statement, one wonders how they could describe in its entirety an idea so awesome that many books were written about it without encompassing it totally. Without a doubt, [the statement] was made with Divine inspiration.<br>The commentaries note that <i>Beitzah</i> 16a stated concerning Hillel: \"All of his deeds were for the sake of Heaven,\" and associates that with the following narrative in <i>VaYikra Rabbah</i> 34:3.<br>Hillel bid his students farewell. They asked him where he was going He told them that he was going to perform a mitzvah. They discovered that he was going to the bathhouse and asked him to explain his previous statements. He told them: Since the human body is created in the image of God, it is a mitzvah to wash oneself.</i> This is what Solomon declared in his wisdom: \"Know Him in all your ways<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Avot D'Rabbi Natan</i> 17:7 also associates the above statement with this Biblical quote. <i>Berachot</i> 63b describes this verse as: \"A small passage upon which all the fundamentals of Torah depend.\" Note also the Rambam's comments in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, <i>ibid.</i><br><i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. III, notes that the rules of Torah scholarship would have called for the quotation of the Biblical verse before the quote from our Sages. However, the Rambam chooses this sequence because it reflects a progression in the service of God.<br>\"All of your deeds should be for the Sake of Heaven\" implies that the deeds are not themselves holy, merely that they are directed toward a Godly intent. \"Know Him in all your ways\" implies that a bond with God can be established within the context of our physical activity itself.</i> and He will straighten your paths\" (Proverbs 3:6).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Iggerot HaKodesh</i>, the Ramban interprets the state described in this clause as a natural product of the elevated rung of service mentioned in the previous clause.

            "One should always avoid fruits. He should not eat of them in quantity even [when] dried and, it goes without saying [when they are] fresh. When they are not sufficiently ripe, they are like swords to the body. Carobs, too, are always harmful.<br>All pickled fruits are harmful and should be eaten only sparingly in summer weather and in hot climates. Figs, grapes and almonds are always beneficial, both fresh and dried. One may eat of them as much as he requires. However, he should not eat them constantly even though they are the most beneficial of fruits.",
            "Honey and wine are harmful to the young and wholesome for the old. Certainly, this applies in the rainy season. In summer, one should eat two-thirds of what he eats in the winter.",
            "A person should always try to have loose movements throughout his life, tending slightly towards diarrhea. This is a cardinal principle in medicine: Whenever one suffers from constipation or has difficulty moving his bowels, serious diseases will beset him.<br>How can he induce loose movements if he has mild constipation? If he is a young man, each morning, he should eat well-cooked halimi which have been seasoned in olive-oil, pickled fish oil, and salt without bread daily; or drink the boiled water of [cooked] spinach or cabbage, [seasoned] with olive oil, pickled fish oil and salt.<br>If he is an old man, he should drink honey diluted with hot water, in the morning, wait approximately four hours and then eat his meal.<br>He should do this for one day, or three, or four, if necessary, until he has loose bowels.",
            "They have given another principle with regard to physical well-being: As long as one exercises, exerts himself greatly, does not eat to the point of satiation and has loose bowels, he will not suffer sickness and he will grow in strength. [This applies] even if he eats harmful foods.",
            "[Conversely,] whoever is idle and does not exercise, or does not move his bowels when he has the need, or is constipated, even if he eats the proper foods and takes care to follow the rules of medicine, will be full of pain for all his days and his strength will fade away.<br>Overeating is like poison to anyone's body. It is the main source of all illness. Most illnesses which afflict a man are caused by harmful foods or by his filling his belly and overeating, even of healthful foods.<br>This was implied by Solomon in his wisdom: \"Whoever guards his mouth and his tongue, guards his soul from distress\" (Proverbs 21:23); i.e., \"guards his mouth\" from eating harmful food or eating his fill and \"his tongue\" from speaking [about things] other than his needs.",
            "The [proper] manner of bathing is that a person should go to the baths once every seven days. He should not enter [the bath soon after mealtime; nor when he is hungry, but when his food has begun to be digested.<br>He should bathe the entire body in hot - but not scalding water - and his head, only, in scalding water. Then, he should bathe his body in tepid water, followed by bathings in successively cooler water, until he has bathed in cold water. [However,] he should not use tepid or cold water for his head, nor should he bathe in cold water in the winter.<br>He should not bathe until after he is in a sweat and his whole body has been massaged. He should not linger in the bath. Rather, as soon as he is in a sweat and been massaged, he should rinse off and leave.<br>He should examine himself to see if he needs to move his bowels before entering the bath and after leaving it. Similarly, he should always examine himself before and after eating, before and after sexual intercourse, before and after exertion and exercise, before and after sleeping, all in all, on ten [different occasions].",
            "When one leaves the bath, he should dress and cover his head in the outer room [of the bathhouse], so that he not catch a chill. He should take this precaution even in the summer.<br>After leaving [the baths], he should wait until he regains his composure, and the warmth [from bathing] has receded, and then eat.<br>A nap before eating, after the bath, is very beneficial. One should not drink cold water on leaving the baths and it goes without saying, that he should not drink while bathing. If he should be thirsty upon leaving the bath and cannot refrain, he should mix the water with wine or honey, and drink.<br>It is beneficial for one to rub himself with oil at the baths, during the winter, after he has rinsed off.",
            "One should not accustom himself to constant bloodletting. He should not be bled unless there is an extreme necessity. He should not be bled in the summer or winter, but slightly in Nisan and slightly in Tishrei.<br>After the age of fifty, he should not be bled at all. He should not be bled and go to the baths on the same day, or leave on a journey after being bled; nor should he be bled on the day on which he returns from a trip.<br>He should eat less than usual on the day of a bloodletting. He should rest on that day, not exert himself, nor exercise, nor stroll.",

The wise of the doctors have said: One of a thousand dies from other illnesses and a thousand from excessive intercourse.<br>Therefore, a person must take care in this matter if he wishes to live in good [health]. He should not engage in intercourse except when the body is healthy and particularly strong, when he has many involuntary erections, the erection is still present even when he makes an effort to think of something else, he finds a heaviness from the loins and below, the tendons of the testicles seem to be stretched, and his flesh is warm. Such a person needs to engage in intercourse and it is medically advisable.<br>He should not engage in intercourse on a full or empty stomach, but after the food has been digested. He should examine himself to see if he needs to move his bowels before and after intercourse. He should not engage in intercourse while standing or sitting, nor in the bathhouse, nor on a day on which he goes to the bathhouse, nor on a day on which he lets blood, nor on the day he departs on a journey or arrives from a journey, nor [on the day] before or afterwards.",
            "Whoever conducts himself in the ways which we have drawn up, I will guarantee that he will not become ill throughout his life, until he reaches advanced age and dies. He will not need a doctor. His body will remain intact and healthy throughout his life.<br>[One may rely on this guarantee] unless [his body] was impaired from the birth, he was accustomed to one of the harmful habits from birth, or should there be a plague or a drought in the world.",
            "All of these beneficial habits which we have stated apply only to a healthy man. In contrast, a sick person, or one who has a single organ which is not healthy, or one who has followed a harmful way of life for many years, each of these must choose different patterns of behavior in accordance with his [particular] illness as it is explained in the medical literature.<br>Any change from the conduct which one normally follows is the beginning of sickness.",
            "Where there is no doctor available, neither the healthy nor the sick man should budge from all the directions given in this chapter for each of them ultimately brings to a beneficial result.",

            "When the wise man eats the little which is fitting for him, he should eat it only in his own home, at his table.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The previous halachah discussed the quantity of food and the attitude with which it was to be eaten. The present halachah concerns itself with the place and the company in which the wise should eat. It revolves around the principle that a person should be modest while eating and refrain from doing so in public. (See the Guide to the Perplexed, ibid.)</i> He should not eat in a store<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Kol Ya'akov</i> notes that this store may even be one specifically designated for eating, e.g., a restaurant, coffee-shop, or the like.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> (<i>Hilchot Edut</i>) differentiates between eating in a crowded place - which is forbidden for everyone - and eating in a quiet corner - which is deemed improper only for a Sage. The <i>Bach</i> (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 34) explains that a common person is censored only for eating while walking through the market place, while the wise man should not eat in public even while standing in one place.<br>Nevertheless, it must be noted that in this halachah, the Rambam uses the expression <i>chacham</i> (a wise man), his ideal for a person with a developed personality, and not <i>talmid chacham</i> (a Torah Sage). Apparently, he does not differentiate between a Torah Sage and a common person in this matter and requires a refined, highly developed standard in meeting our physical needs from everyone.</i> unless there is a very pressing need, lest he be viewed without respect by others.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">unless there is a very pressing need, lest he be viewed without respect by others.</i><br> He should not eat together with the unlearned,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 52b states that, at the outset, a common person will consider a Torah Sage to be like a vessel of gold.

There are specific prohibitions against drinking - e.g. a priest is not allowed to perform the priestly services while under the influence of alcohol (Leviticus 10:9-11). Similarly, numerous passages throughout the Prophets and Sacred Writings castigate drunkenness. These are also paralleled in the rabbinic literature, e.g. <i>Sanhedrin</i> 70a, <i>VaYikra Rabbah</i> 12.</i> If he becomes drunk before the common people, he desecrates God's Name.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note the Rambam's remarks in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 25:4:<br>When a person is given a position of authority over the community... most certainly [he is forbidden] to eat and drink and become drunk in public and in a gathering of the ignorant or at a repast of friends.Woe to those judges who act with such affront to the Torah of Moses, who disgrace its laws and reduce it to the earth, bring it down to the dust and cause evil to themselves and their descendants in this world and the next.<br>Most commentaries cite <i>Pesachim</i> 49a as the source for the Rambam's statement, however, that passage does not mention intoxication.

There is no more powerful expression of man's basic, instinctual nature than sex. Therefore, precisely in this area, a Jew must reveal that his nature is not only material, that he possesses a spiritual dimension that lies at the core of his being and seeks expression.<br>For this reason, the Jewish marriage bond is referred to as <i>Kiddushin</i>, emphasizing how <i>kedushah</i>, holiness, is a fundamental element in marriage. Similarly, Leviticus 20:7, proclaims \"Sanctify yourselves and be holy, for I am God, your Lord,\" as a preface to the laws proscribing forbidden intimate relations. <i>Sh'vuot</i> 18b interprets the above verse as also including a command to conduct oneself in a holy manner within permitted relationships.<br>The quality of holiness involves not only restraint, as mentioned in the ensuing statements, but also the manner in which relations are carried out.

The quiet of the hour prevents him from being disturbed by other thoughts and he is able to concentrate on his wife alone.<br>Despite the advantages of having relations at midnight, many contemporary authorities suggest that a couple not hold to this as a binding rule.

The converse is also true. If parents engage in intimate relations in a coarse manner or if there is friction and lack of harmony between them, the children born of their union will have undesirable character traits.<br>In particular, <i>Nedarim</i> 20b describes ten situations in which relations are forbidden and states that the children born of such unions are endowed with extremely negative tendencies.

See <i>Eiruvin</i> 100b.<br><b>Rather, [the relations should take place] amidst their mutual consent and joy.

            "Torah Sages conduct themselves with exceptional modesty.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With this statement, the Rambam establishes a connection with the previous halachah and sets the motif for what follows. Modesty is not simply a matter of dress, (this is discussed in halachah 9), but rather, an awareness of God which causes a person to cover head and body out of respect for the Divine Presence. The Rambam expands upon this concept in the <i>Guide for the Perplexed</i> (Vol. III, Chapter 52):<br>He is constantly with us, observing us, as [Jeremiah 23:24] proclaims: 'Can a man hide himself in the secret places and I not see him,' says God.\" Understand this well.Know that when perfect men comprehend this, they achieve such humility, such awe and fear of God and a sense of shame before Him... that their private behavior with their wives and in latrines is like their public conduct with other people.Know that they have forbidden a man to walk with an erect carriage, because: \"the entire world is filled with His glory\" (Isaiah 6:3)... We are always in His presence... Thus, the greatest among the Sages found it difficult to bare their heads because the Divine Presence constantly hovers over man.</i> They do not demean themselves and do not bare their heads<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Kiddushin</i> 30a relates that Rabbi Chiya bar Abba once saw Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi taking his son to school while wearing a makeshift hat. When Rabbi Chiya asked him the reason he was wearing such a head-covering, he explained that he was forced to leave his home in a hurry and was not able to arrange his turban. Nevertheless, he found it preferable to wear even a makeshift head-covering, rather than go out bareheaded.<br><i>Kiddushin</i> 31a quotes Rav Huna, the son of Rav Yeshoshua, as explaining that he would not walk four cubits bareheaded out of respect for \"the Divine Presence which is above my head.\" (See also <i>Zohar</i>, Vol. III, p. 245b.) Similarly, <i>Shabbat</i> 156b relates that an astrologer told Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak's mother that he was destined to be a thief. From his earliest childhood, she trained him to avoid this fate. She would constantly tell him to cover his head \"so that the fear of God will be upon you.\"</i> or their bodies.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (2:1) lays down the following general rule: Any portion of our bodies which is usually covered should not be revealed unless there is a specific reason for doing so.<br>Modesty, as understood in the present context, results from the awareness of the Divine Presence. The ordinary man experiences such awareness while at prayer when \"he is as if standing before the Divine Presence\" (<i>Hilchot Tefilah</i> 4:16) and then he is required not to bare his head (ibid. 5:5) or various parts of his body; e.g., his chest (ibid. 4:7) and his feet (ibid. 5:5). As emphasized in Chapter 3, Halachah 3, a wise man should try to be conscious of the Divine Presence at all times and places. As a result, he will constantly be modest.<br>Though in Talmudic times and in the Rambam's era, personal modesty and covering one's head were considered the signs of a Sage (<i>Kiddushin</i> 8a) and a unique and special merit (<i>Shabbat</i> 118b), at present, both practices have been accepted as ordinary behavior for all observant Jews.<br>Even when one enters a latrine, he should be modest and not uncover himself until he is seated. - <i>Tamid</i> 27b quotes Rav as giving his son the following advice: \"Sit and reveal yourself. Cover yourself and stand.\"</i><br>Even when one enters a latrine, he should be modest and not uncover himself until he is seated. He should not wipe himself clean with the right hand.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the right hand is used to tie <i>Tefillin</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 62a) and is given priority over the left hand regarding service in the Temple (<i>Zevachim</i> 24a), the installation ceremony of priests (Leviticus 8:23), and other ritual manners, it is not proper that it be used for this function.<br>Many authorities maintain that this restriction only applies when one is cleaning oneself with one's hand alone, but not when one uses toilet paper.</i> He should stay away from all others and enter a chamber beyond a chamber, a cave within a cave, and relieve himself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Berachot</i> 62b derives this law from I Samuel 24:3's description of the behavior of King Saul. Though it is forbidden to delay relieving oneself (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 17:31), our Sages did not give this prohibition precedence over the dictates of modesty (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 3:11).</i> If<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">no latrine is available and</i> he [must] relieve himself<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These restrictions only apply to defecation. The Sages feared that refraining from urination might be damaging (<i>Bechorot</i> 44b).</i> behind a fence, he should move far enough away that no one can hear the sound if he breaks wind.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., even though an observer might see that he is squatting and thus, conclude that he is defecating, since the fence covers his lower body, there is no difficulty (<i>Berachot</i> 62a).</i> If he [must] relieve himself in an open area,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">where such a barrier is not available</i> he should be far enough off so that no one can see him baring himself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., though the ultimate reason for modesty is the awareness of God's presence, there also is a dimension of modesty which implies respect for one's fellow man and restraint in revealing one's body and bodily functions in his presence.</i><br>One should not speak while relieving himself, even if there is great need.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Berachot</i> 62a states that \"modesty and silence are appropriate for the latrine.\" <i>Sanhedrin</i> 19a states that women are allowed to speak in the latrine to prevent men from entering.</i> Just as he conducts himself with modesty while in the latrine by day, he should [also] do so at night.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Berachot</i>, ibid. Since modesty is practiced out of an awareness of God's presence, there is no difference between day and night (The Guide to the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapter 52).</i><br>One should always train himself to relieve himself in the early morning and after dark only, so that he [need] not go far off.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">to avoid others seeing him (<i>Berachot</i>, ibid.).</i>",
            "A Torah Sage should not shout or shriek while speaking, like the cattle and wild beasts, nor should he raise his voice overly much. Instead, he should speak gently to all people. [In addition to] speaking gently, he should take care not to stand at a distance, lest [his speech] appear like the speech of the haughty.<br>He should greet all men [before they greet him], so that they be pleased with him. He should judge every one in a good light, speak favorably of his fellow man, [never mentioning] anything that is shameful to him, love peace and pursue it.<br>If he sees that his words will be effective, and will be given attention, he should speak; if not, he should keep silent. What is implied? He should not try to placate a man in the moment of his anger. He should not question a man about his vow at the time he is making his vow, [but wait] until he is tranquil of mind and calm. He should not comfort a man while his dead is lying before him because [the bereaved] is unsettled until he has buried [his dead]. The same applies in other similar cases. He should not look at his fellow man at the moment of his humiliation, but turn his attention away.<br>He should not distort facts, exaggerate a situation, or minimize it, except in the interests of peace and the like.<br>The guiding rule is that he should speak only words of wisdom or in connection with acts of kindness and the like. He should not speak to a woman in the marketplace, even if she be his wife, or his sister, or his daughter.",
            "A Torah Sage should not walk erect, with his head held high, as [Isaiah 3:16] states: \"And they walked with necks outstretched and flashing eyes.\" He should not walk with a [short-stepped,] toe-to-heel, stately [gait] like [that of] women and the proud, as [Isaiah, ibid.] states: \"walking and mincing as they go, tinkling with their feet.\"<br>Nor should he run in public like a madman, nor bend over like a hunchback. Rather, he should cast his eyes downward as he [does when he] stands during prayer. He should walk in the market-place like a person preoccupied with his business affairs.<br>From a man's carriage, too, one can recognize whether he is wise and a thoughtful person or mindless and a fool. Thus, Solomon said in his wisdom (Ecclesiastes 10:3): \"On the road, too, when the fool walks, his mind is empty and he proclaims to all that he is a fool\" - he informs everyone about himself, that he is a fool.",

He may do so in the rainy season, if he is poor.<br>He should not go out in the marketplace perfumed, or with perfumed clothes, nor should he put perfume on his hair. However, he is permitted to rub perfume on his body if he does so in order to remove filth. Similarly, he should not go out alone at night, unless he has a set time to go out for his studies.

            "There are certain matters which are considered \"the dust of <i>lashon horah</i>.\" What is implied? [For example, a person says:] \"Who will tell so and so to continue acting as he does now,\" or \"Do not talk about so and so; I do not want to say what happened,\" or the like.<br>Similarly, it is also considered the \"dust of <i>lashon horah</i>\" when someone speaks favorably about a colleague in the presence of his enemies, for this will surely prompt them to speak disparagingly about him. In this regard, King Solomon said [Proverbs 27:14]: \"One who greets his colleague early in the morning, in a loud voice, curses him,\" for his positive [act] will bring him negative [repercussions].<br>Similarly, [to be condemned is] a person who relates <i>lashon horah</i> in frivolity and jest, as if he were not speaking with hatred. This was also mentioned by Solomon in his wisdom [Proverbs 26:18-19]: \"As a madman who throws firebrands, arrows, and death and says: 'I am only joking.’”<br>[Also, to be condemned is] someone who speaks <i>lashon horah</i> about a colleague slyly, pretending to be innocently telling a story without knowing that it is harmful. When he is reproved, he excuses himself by saying: \"I did not know that the story was harmful or that so and so was involved.\"",
            "[There is no difference] whether one speaks <i>lashon horah</i> about a person in his presence or behind his back. [The statements] of people who relate matters which, when passed from one person to another, will cause harm to a man's person or to his property or will even [merely] annoy him or frighten him are considered as <i>lashon horah</i>.<br>If such statements were made in the presence of three people, [one may assume that the matter] has already become public knowledge. Thus, if one of the three relates the matter a second time, it is not considered <i>lashon horah</i>, provided his intention was not to spread the matter further and publicize it.",
            "All the above are people who speak <i>lashon horah</i> in whose neighborhood, one is forbidden to dwell. How much more so [is it forbidden] to sit [together] with them and hear their conversation.<br>The judgement against our ancestors in the desert was only sealed because of <i>lashon horah</i>.",
            "A person who takes revenge against a colleague transgresses a Torah prohibition, as [Leviticus 19:18] states: \"Do not take revenge.\"<br>Even though [revenge] is not punished by lashes, it is a very bad trait. Instead, a person should [train himself] to rise above his feelings about all worldly things, for men of understanding consider all these things as vanity and emptiness which are not worth seeking revenge for.<br>What is meant by taking revenge? A person's colleague asks him, \"Lend me your hatchet. He responds, \"I refuse to lend it to you.\" On the following day, the person [who refused] needs to borrow a hatchet from his colleague. He asks him: \"Lend me your hatchet.\" The latter responds, \"Just as you did not lend it to me, I will not lend it to you.\" This is considered as taking revenge. Instead, when he comes to ask him for it, he should give it to him with a full heart, without repaying him for what he did.<br>The same applies in other similar instances. Thus, King David proclaimed regarding his exemplary qualities [Psalms 7:5]: \"Have I repaid those who have done evil to me? Behold, I have rescued those who hated me without cause.\"",
            "Similarly, anyone who holds a grudge against another Jew violates a Torah prohibition, as [Leviticus 19:18] states: \"Do not bear a grudge against the children of your people.\"<br>What is meant by bearing a grudge? Reuven asked Shimon, \"Rent this house to me,\" or \"lend this ox to me,\" and Shimon was not willing [to do so]. A few days later, Shimon came to borrow or rent something from him. Reuven told him, \"Here, it is. I am lending it to you. I am not like you, nor am I paying you back for what you did.\"<br>A person who acts in this manner violates the prohibition against bearing a grudge. Instead [of doing so], he should wipe the matter from his heart and never bring it to mind. As long as he brings the matter to mind and remembers it, there is the possibility that he will seek revenge. Therefore, the Torah condemned holding a grudge, [requiring] one to wipe the wrong from his heart entirely, without remembering it at all.<br>This is a proper quality which permits a stable environment, trade, and commerce to be established among people."
