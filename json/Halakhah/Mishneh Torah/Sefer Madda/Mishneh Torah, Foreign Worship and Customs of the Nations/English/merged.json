            "In the days of Enosh, the sons of man erred exceedingly, the advice of the wise man of that generation was nullified, and even Enosh himself was among the victims of that folly. Their mistake was this: Seeing, said they, that God created these stars and planets to rule the world, that He placed them high above to share honors with them, for they are ministers who render service in his presence, it is proper that they be praised and glorified and honored, this is the will of God, to exalt and honor him whom He exalted and honored, even as a king desires to honor those who stand in his presence, for such is the honor of the king. As soon as this matter was rooted in their heart, they commenced to erect temples in honor of the stars, to offer sacrifices to them, to praise and glorify them in words, and bow down to them in order to reach the will of God by this evil idea. This was the groundwork for the worship of stars. Thus was the statement of its adherents who knew the principles thereof; not that they asserted that there was no God save a particular star. This is as Jeremiah says: \"Who would not fear Thee, O King of the nations? For it befitted Thee; Forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royalty, there is none like unto Thee. But they are altogether brutish and foolish; the vanities by which they are instructed are but a stock\" (Jer. 10.7–8). As if saying: All know that Thou art Alone; but their mistake and foolishness is in supposing that this vanity is Thy will.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Maimonides bases his contention on Gen. 4.26. G.</i>",
            "In the long process of time, there arose among the sons of man false prophets, who asserted that God commanded them saying: \"Worship yon star, or all of the stars, and offer sacrifices to it, and compound for it thus and such, and erect a temple for it, and hew its image so that all of the people, women and children and the rest of the populace included, bow down to it\". He, moreover, describes for them a form which he invented and tells them that this was the image of yon star which was pointed out to him in his prophecy. In this manner they commenced to draw images in temples, beneath trees, upon mountain-tops and elevated places, where they congregated to bow down to them and sermonize to the people, saying: \"This image has it in its power to do good and evil, and it is proper to worship it, and be in awe of it.\" Their priests, moreover, say unto them: \"By this worship you will increase and succeed; do thus and such, but not that and this\". Then still other frauds rose up to assert that the star itself, or the planet, or the angel spoke to them and instructed saying: \"Worship me thus and such\", and thereat made known to them the way to worship them, instructing them, \"Do so but do not do so\". In this manner this thing spread throughout the world, and the worship of images with varied ceremonies, to sacrifice to them and to bow down to them was inaugurated. After the lapse of a long time the Glorified and Awful Name was forgotten to be mentioned by the mouth of all substance and blotted out from their consciousness, so that they gave Him no recognition, as a consequence whereof all the people of the earth as well as women and little children knew not save the image of wood and stone, the stony temple wherein they were brought up from their infancy to bow down to it, to worship it and to swear by its name. As for their wise man, for example, their priests and their like, they supposed that there was no God save the stars and planets for whose sake, and in whose likeness, those images were made; but the Rock of Ages not a man was there to recognize Him or know Him, save some individuals in the whole world, for example, Enoch, Methuselah, Noah, Shem, and Eber. And, on this path the world continued its course of circuity until the birth of the firmest pillar of the world, Abraham our father.",
            "As soon as this giant was weaned he commenced to busy his mind, in his infancy he commenced to think by day and by night, and would encounter this enigma: How is it possible that this planet should continuously be in motion and have no leader—and who, indeed, causes it to revolve, it being impossible that it should revolve itself? Moreover, he neither had a teacher nor one to impart aught to him, for he was sunk in Ur of the Chaldeans among the foolish worshipers of stars, and his father, and his mother, like all the people, worshiped stars, and he, although following them in their worship, busies his heart and reflects until he attains the path of truth, and, by his correct thinking, he understood when he finally saw the line of righteousness. He knew that there is One God; He leads the planet; He created everything; and in all that is there is no god save He. He knew that the whole world was in error, and that the thing which caused them to err was, that their worshiping the stars and the images brought about the loss of the truth from their consciousness. And, when Abraham was forty years old he recognized his Creator. After he came to this comprehension and knowledge he started to confute the sons of Ur of the Chaldeans, and to organize disputations with them, cautioning them, saying: \"This is not the true path that you are following\", and he destroyed the images, and commenced preaching to the people warning them that it is not right to worship any save the God of the universe, and unto Him alone it is right to bow down, to offer sacrifices, and compound offerings, so that the creatures of the future shall recognize Him. Moreover, it is right to destroy and break in pieces all of the images, so that the whole population of the future be not led to an error like unto these who imagine that there is no God save these images. When he had them subdued by his well supported contentions, the king tried to put him to death, but he was saved by a miracle, and went hence to Haran. There he stood up anew and called out in a great voice to the whole world, to let them know that there is One God for the whole universe, and unto Him it is proper to render service. And thus he went onward with his proclamations from city to city, and from government to government, until he attained the land of Canaan amidst his outcry, even as it is said: \"And called there on the name of the Lord, the Everlasting God\" (Gen. 21.33). When the people who congregated about him asked him concerning his preachments, he replied by imparting knowledge to each and every one according to his mentality, to the end that he was able to turn him to the path of truth, until there congregated about him thousands, even tens of thousands, and they became the people of Abraham's household, in whose heart he implanted this great cause, concerning which he compiled books, and which he imparted to his son Isaac.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nedarim, 32a. C.</i> Isaac, from his seat of learning, gave instructions and admonitions. And Isaac, in turn, imparted it to Jacob and appointed him head master, who, at his seat of learning, gave instructions and supported all who flocked to him. And Jacob our father instructed all his sons, but separated Levi and appointed him head master, and established him in a seat of learning where to instruct in the path of the Name and in the observance of the charges of Abraham. He, moreover, commanded his sons not to interrupt the succession of the sons of Levi to the presidency of the school so that the learning be not forgotten. So did the movement advance intensely among the sons of Jacob and their followers that the world saw a God-knowing nation called into existence, until Israel spent a long time in Egypt, when they turned to be instructed in their practice and to worship the stars as they did, save only the tribe of Levi, which remained faithful to their ancestorial charge; for the tribe of Levi at no time worshiped stars. Verily, in but a short space of time, the root which Abraham had planted would have been uprooted, and the sons of Jacob would have turned to the universal error and wandering; save because of the Lord's love for us, and because He observes the oath of covenant with Abraham our father, He appointed Moses our Master lord of all prophets, and made him His messenger. After Moses our Master was endowed with prophecy and the Lord chose Israel as an inheritance, He crowned them with commandments, and made known to them the way to serve Him, and what will be the judgment rendered against idolatry and all its erring devotees.<sup>3</sup>"

            "The primary warning concerning worship of stars is, not to reverence any among all creatures, no angel, no planet, no star, none of the four elements nor any of their offspring, though the worshiper be conscious that the Lord is God and, he be worshiping a given being as at the inception of the worship of Enosh and the people of his generation, behold him, he worships idolatry. It is respecting this very subject that the warning in the Torah was given, saying: \"And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the host of heaven, thou be drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which, the Lord thy God hath alloted unto all the peoples under the whole heaven\" (Deut. 4.19.), that is to say, lest thou spread out in thy mind's vision, beholding that these are guiding the universe, and that God portioned them out to all the world to live in perpetuity and not wane as the course of the universe is, and then say that to such it is right to bow down and to worship; even on this very subject He commanded and said: \"Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived\" (Ibid. 11.16.), that is to say, do not fall in error by the thought of your heart to worship these, to make of them a mediator between yourselves and the Creator.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sukkah, 45b; Sanhedrin, 63a. G.</i>",
            "The idolaters compiled many books of worship, defining its principle manner of service, its works and its laws; but the Holy One, blessed be He! charged us not to read those books at all, not to think of idolatry generally nor of aught of its details. Moreover, to look at it is forbidden, as it is said: \"Turn ye not unto idols\" (Lev. 19.4.); and of thinking on this subject it is said: \"And that thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their god\"? (Ibid.), which is a warning that thou shalt not inquire concerning its manner of practice, though thou art not worshiping it, for this very inquiry causes a turning after it and to imitate their practice, as it is further said: \"Even so will I do likewise\" (Ibid.).<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shabbat, 149a; Sifra, Lev. 19; Sanhedrin, 100b. C. G.</i>",
            "All of these prohibitive commandments are concentrated on one subject, namely: Not to turn after idolatry, and whosoever does turn after it by doing aught resembling its practice is guilty of an offense punishable by lashes. And, yet, not turning after idolatry alone in one's thoughts is forbidden, for even concerning all thought which causes man to delete a principle of the fundamentals of the Torah are we charged not to offer it to our heart, not to concentrate our mind thereon and reason it out and be drawn after the swerving fancies of the heart. Preceding all, behold, the short-coming of man's intelligence, more particularly that not all minds can attain the purity of truth. Now, if every man be drawn away after his heart's fancies, he will be discovered demolishing the world to fit in the shortsightedness of his intelligence. For example: some of the time he will search after idolatry, and some of the time he will meditate about the Unity of the Creator, perhaps He is, and perhaps He is not, what of above and what of below, what of the beginning and what of the end; some of the time he will meditate concerning prophecy, perhaps there is, and perhaps there is not, and some of the time about the Torah, perhaps it is from heaven and perhaps it is not. Whereas, he knows not the standard of thinking wherewith to discover the knowledge of pure truth, as a consequence whereof he goes without to atheism. Even on, this subject there is a warning in the Torah, for it says therein: \"And that ye go not about after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go astray\" (Num. 15. 39.), as if saying: \"Let not any of you be drawn after his short-sighted intelligence and imagine that his fancy attains the truth\". Thus did the wise men say: \"After your own heart\", is a warning against atheism; and \"After your own eyes\", is a warning against prostitution (Berakot, 13a). But the violation of this prohibitive commandment, although it causes man's disability to share in the World to Come, is not punishable by lashes.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hagigah, 11a; Abodah Zarah, 17a. C. G.</i>",
            "The precept concerning idolatry balances all other commandments, for it is said: \"And when ye shall err, and not observe all these commandments, which the Lord hath spoken unto Moses\" (Num. 15.22), which was traditionally instructed that the Verse speaks of idolatry. Herefrom you deduct that whosoever admits idolatry denies the whole Torah, all of the prophets, and all in that which the prophets were instructed since Adam even till the end of time, as it is said: \"From the day that the Lord gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations\" (Ibid. 15.23). But whosoever denies idolatry admits the whole Torah, all of the prophets, and all in that which the prophets were instructed since Adam even till the end of time. Thus it is the outstanding commandment of them all.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Horayot, 8b; Sifre, Num. 15; Nedarim, 25a. C. G.</i>",
            "An Israelite who worshiped idolatry, behold him, he is in everything to be judged as an idolater, and not as an Israelite who violates a prohibitive commandment punishable by stoning. A convert to idolatry, behold him, he is rebellious against the whole scope of the Torah. Likewise are infidels of among Israel not to be judged in aught as Israelites, nor should they ever be received as penitents, for it is said: \"None that go unto her return, neither do they attain unto the paths of life\" (Prov. 2.19). The infidels are they that absorb themselves in the swerving fancies of their heart about the brutish matters hereinabove spoken of, as a consequence whereof they transgress by stepping upon the vitals of the Torah with spite, soul-sickening and high-handedness, and proclaim that therein lies no iniquity. It is forbidden to converse with them, and to answer any argument concerning them, as it is said: \"And come not nigh the door of her house\" (Ibid. 5.8). As a rule the thought of an infidel drifts toward idolatry.<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hullin, 4b; Abodah Zarah, 17a; Sanhedrin, 38; Ibid. 100b. C. G.</i>",
            "Whosoever admits idolatry as truth, although he be not a worshiper thereof, behold him, he is shaming and blaspheming the Glorified and Awful Name. The idolater's corpse is, therefore hung, even as that of the blasphemer's, and both offenses are punishable by stoning. It is even for this reason that I included the law of the blasphemer in the treatise concerning idolatry, for both of them deny the source of everything.<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Keritot, 3b; Sanhedrin, 45b.</i>",
            "And, these are the laws concerning the blasphemer: The guilt punishable by stoning is not pronounced against a blasphemer unless he actually pronounces the Particular Name of four letters, Aleph, Dallat, Nun, Yod, and blaspheme Him in a Name of the Names which are forbidden to erase, even as it is said: \"And he that blasphemed the name of the Lord\" (Lev. 24. 16). By naming the Particular Name he is guilty of an offense punishable by stoning, but by naming all other Attributes he is guilty of an offense punishable by stripes. There is some authority who asserts that he is not guilty save on pronouncing the Name Yod, Hei, Vov, Hei. But I maintain that he is guilty of an offense punishable by stoning in pronouncing either of the Particular Names.<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin, 55b–56a; Sifre, Lev. 24. C. G.</i>",
            "Whence do we derive a prohibitive commandment against the blasphemer? It is said: \"Thou shalt not revile God\" (Ex. 22.27). Each and every day, during a trial for blasphemy, the witnesses are examined and they give testimony not repeating the Name pronounced and words used by the defendant, but an alias, such as \"Let Jesse smite Jesse\", indicative that four letters were pronounced and that the words were abusive. When the enquette is concluded, the public is ordered out of court, and the elder of the witnesses is examined, saying: \"Now, repeat what you have heard in identical language\"; he repeats, while the judges remain standing on their feet, and when they hear the actual blasphemy repeated, they rent their garments which they never mend. Their second witness merely states: \"Even I heard identically as he repeated\". If there were many witnesses it is necessary for each and every one of them to repeat identically as had heard it from the blasphemer.<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin, 66a; Ibid. 56a; Mekilta, Ex. 22. C. G.</i>",
            "A blasphemer who repented his statement the moment he made it, can not put it up as a defense, but having blasphemed in the presence of witnesses the punishment of stoning is inflicted upon him. He who blasphemed the Name by pretending that he reviles idolatry, jealous people may challenge him and be put to them by them; but if jealous people did not put him to death and he was brought to justice before a tribunal, he is not stoned, for such sentence is pronounced only when he blasphemed by a name of the Particular Names.<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nedarim, 86b; Sanhedrin, 8a; Ibid. 81b; Baba Batra, 129b; Shebu’ot, 36a. C. G.</i>",
            "Whosoever hears the Name being blasphemed is obliged to rend his garments; even when an alias is used in blaspheming, if the reviler be an Israelite, he is obliged to rend his garments. He who hears the blasphemy direct or he who hears it from a witness, both, are obliged to rend their garments. But he who hears it from an idolater is not obliged to rend his garments. As for Eliakim and Shebnah<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Second Kings, 18. 13-19.9; Isa. 36.1-37.37. G.</i>, they rent not their garment save because Rab-shakeh was a converted Israelite. All the judges and witnesses in a blasphemy case, successively put their hand upon the head of the blasphemer, each one saying to him: \"Thy blood be upon thy head, thou alone hast brought it upon thyself\". Of all upon whom a tribunal pronounces the sentence of death there is none upon whose head the hands of the judges and witnesses are put, save upon the blasphemer, even as it is said: \"And let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head\" (Lev. 24.14).<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin, 60a; Sifra, Lev. 24. C.</i>"

        [
            "Whosoever worships idolatry, of his own free will, wantonly, is guilty of an offense punishable by excision; but if the worship took place in the presence of witnesses, and he was duly warned, he is sentenced to be stoned. If the worship was committed in ignorance, he should bring a standard sin-offering.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Keritot, 1; Sanhedrin, 60b—61a.C.</i>",
            "The idolaters fixed many kinds of service for each and every image and form, and the service of one is unlike the service of the other; for example, Peor, whose mode of worship it is for one to have himself exposed before it, or Mercury, which is worshiped by having stones thrown at it or from it, and many more like services were inaugurated to images. Therefore, if one reverses the service by exposing himself to Mercury or by throwing stones at Peor, he is not guilty, for he must worship it after the manner of its service, as it is said: \"How used these nations to serve their gods? even so will I do likewise\" (Deut. 12.30). The subject being such, and because thereof, a tribunal, judging cases of idolatry should know the modes of its worship, seeing that no punishment of stoning is pronounced on idolaters unless they know that the mode of worship is identical with the testimony presented at the trial.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibid. C.</i>",
            "The prohibitive commandment concerning such worship is deducted from what Holy Writ says: \"Nor serve them\" (Ex. 20.5; Deut. 5.9). Whereat are these words directed? At all other manner of worship, save bowing down, slaughtering sacrifice, burning incense, and compounding drink offering; for whosoever employs any of these kinds of worship to revive any form of idolatry, is guilty, although it be not the particular manner of its worship. For example? If one offered a drink offering to Peor, or slaughtered a sacrifice to Mercury, he is guilty, as it is said: \"He that sacrificeth unto the gods, save unto the Lord only, shall be utterly destroyed\" (Ex. 22.19.). Inasmuch as slaughtering sacrifices was included in worship generally, why was it singled out and separated from other modes of service? To teach you, even as slaughtering sacrifices is a particular manner of service dedicated to the Name, and whosoever offers sacrifices to another god is guilty of an offense punishable by stoning, whether its mode of worship was to slaughter sacrifices for it or whether it was not, even so every service which is dedicated to the Name, if he employed it in his service to another god, whether its manner of worship be so or not, is guilty. Even because thereof it is, moreover, said: \"For thou shalt bow down to no other god\" (Ex. 34.14), to prescribe guilt for bowing down to idolatry even if its mode of service be not so. So is also the law pertaining to offering incense and drink-offering, forsooth, stone-casting and pouring drink offering is one and the same thing.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibid. C.</i>",
            "One who smears feces over it, or who compounded urine as a drink-offering for it, is guilty; if he slaughtered a locust as a sacrifice to it, he is not guilty, unless its manner of service be so. Likewise, if he slaughtered a crippled animal as a sacrifice to it, he is not guilty, unless its manner of service be so. An idol which is worshiped by a rod, if he broke the rod by striking at it, he is guilty, and if it be the first service offered to such idol it becomes forbidden property; if he cast the rod at it, he is guilty, but it does not become forbidden property, for casting the rod is unlike sprinkling of blood because the rod remains whole as it was whereas blood is spread in drops. He who proclaims one of all kinds of idolatry as his god, is guilty of an offense punishable by stoning; even if he lift up a brick and said to it: \"Thou art my god\", or to all like in such expression. is guilty, although he repent and the moment he was through proclaiming he said: \"No, this is not my god\", his repentence is null and he is stoned.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin, 60b; Baba Batra, 129b; Nedarim, 87a. C.G.</i>",
            "He who worships idolatry in its usual mood of worship, even in a manner to disgrace it, is guilty. For example? One who exposes himself to Peor in order to show his contempt for it, or casts a stone upon Mercury so as to shame it, is guilty, because such act is its real mode of worship. If he commits an act of this kind in error, he should bring a sin-offering.<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin, 60b; Ibid, 64a C.</i>",
            "One who worships idolatry out of love, for instance, he coveted a given image because it was made superbly beautiful, or he worshiped it out of fear lest it perpetrates harm against him, as its devotees imagine that it can do good and evil, if he accepted it as a god he is guilty of an offense punishable by stoning; but if he worshiped it after its mode or worship, or with one of the four kinds of worship<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The admonition is, “Nor serve them”. This is a general rule for all kind of practices which may be included under the term “Serve”. A prohibitive covering a general rule (Laav She’biclolot) carries no punishment of lashes.

He embraces an idol, or kisses it, or who prostrates himself before it, who washes it, anoints it, puts shoes on it, or does any other like service of honor violates a prohibitive commandment, for it says: \"Nor serve them\" (Ex. 23.24.), and, of course, such attention is included in service. Nevertheless, no lashes is inflicted upon him for doing any of these, seeing that none of them are mentioned in detail.<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bowing down, slaughtering sacrifices, compounding drink offerings, and sprinkling of blood.

Even so, if one makes by his own hand an idol for others is striped, though he made it for an idolater; because it is said: \"Nor make to yourselves molten gods\" (Lev. 19.4). Therefore, he who makes an idol for himself, by his own hand, is lashed twice.<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Abodah Zarah, 43b. G.</i>",

But the admonition against it is not applicable to any save to form the image of man. Therefore, the image of man should not be formed in wood, nor in lime, nor in stone, provided, however, that the image be protruding, as for instance, the figure or the laver in a palace; but if the image was homaloid, or a delineated form, such as the forms upon boards and tablets, or the forms woven in a rug, behold, such is permitted.<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rosh ha-Shanah, 24b; Abodah Zarah, 43b.

It is likewise forbidden to sketch the image of the sun, of the moon, of the stars, of the planets, and of angels; for, it is said: \"Ye shall not make with me\", that is to say: ye shall not make images like unto My ministers, who minister before Me Above, not even upon a tablet.

Each one against whom two witnesses testified that he worshiped idolatry after he received a warning, is separated. If all those who did worship constitute but a minority of the citizens, they are stoned and the rest of the citizens escape punishment. If it be found that a majority worshiped idolatry, they are all taken before the Great Tribunal, where their trial is finished, and all those who are found guilty of having worshiped idolatry are put to death by the sword. If the whole population of the city worshiped idolatry, all of them, women and children included, are put to death by the edge of the sword. Whether the entire city was seduced, or whether only a majority thereof, its seducers are stoned, and its entire booty is gathered in its main street. If it has no such street, it is mandatory to construct such street. If its street was without its boundary-line, a wall should be constructed beyond it, so as to incorporate it within its boundary-line, even as it is said: \"Into the midst of the broad place thereof\" (Deut. 13.17). Then, everything that liveth should be put to death, and all of its spoil, together with the property of the whole district should be burned in fire.

Samuel, 11.1) to their contention. Knowing what punishment there is in store for them and their children, the possibility of a city becoming a seduced city was very remote, and the fact that almost fourteen centuries of national life in Palestine did not produce a single instance where the necessity of making this law operative is in itself evidence that the prescribed severity, as interpreted by Maimonides had a great deal to do with it.
