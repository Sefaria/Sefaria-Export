            "During the times of Enosh,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">the grandson of Adam. See Genesis 4:26, 5:6-11. Enosh lived from the year 235 after creation to the year 1140 (3525 to 2620 B.C.E.).</i> mankind made a great mistake, and the wise men of that generation gave thoughtless counsel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Interestingly, the Rambam does not attribute the rise of paganism to simple commoners, but to the \"wise\" of the generation.</i> Enosh himself was one of those who erred.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our text of <i>Shabbat</i> 118b mentions that \"the generation of Enosh\" were idol worshipers. However, certain versions of that text omit the words \"generation of.\" (See <i>She'iltot D'Rabbi Achai Gaon, Bereshit</i>.)</i><br>Their mistake was as follows: They said God created stars and spheres<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i>, Chapter 3, for a description of the stars and the spheres, and their place within the Rambam's conception of the cosmos.</i> with which to control the world. He placed them on high and treated them with honor, making them servants who minister before Him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., mediums of Divine influence</i> Accordingly, it is fitting to praise and glorify them and to treat them with honor.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi finds an allusion to the worship of false gods in Enosh's times in Genesis 4:26: which he renders, \"It was then that they called profanely upon the name of God.\"</i> [They perceived] this to be the will of God, blessed be He, that they magnify and honor those whom He magnified and honored, just as a king desires that the servants who stand before him be honored. Indeed, doing so is an expression of honor to the king.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Hilchot Yesodei Torah</i>, ibid., and in several places in the Guide for the Perplexed, the Rambam explains that the stars and the spheres are on a higher plane than the creations of our world. Though they influence our world, they are also God's creations and have no free will of their own. Thus, they are no more than an axe in the hands of a wood-chopper, and should not worshiped or served.</i><br>After conceiving of this notion, they began to construct temples to the stars<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note the Rambam's comments on astrology in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 4:7), which are quoted in the commentary on Chapter 11, Halachah 16.</i> and offer sacrifices to them. They would praise and glorify them with words, and prostrate themselves before them, because by doing so, they would<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">according to their false conception - It is questionable if such worship is forbidden to gentiles or not. Based on Deuteronomy 4:19, certain authorities maintain that the gentiles may worship other gods, provided they have the awareness that God is the ultimate power (שיתוף).<br>The Rambam, however, does not mention this perspective in these halachot, nor in <i>Hilchot Melachim</i>, Chapter 9, where he discusses the prohibition against the worship of false gods as it affects gentiles. [In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 2), however, he states \"Israel is commanded regarding the unification of God\"; from which it could be inferred that gentiles need not believe in this concept and can combine their worship of God with other powers.] All authorities agree that such worship is forbidden for Jews.</i> - according to their false conception - be fulfilling the will of God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is unclear from the Rambam's statements here whether, originally, they would worship the stars without any self-interest - merely with the intent of honoring those whom God honors - or whether their service was self-oriented - i.e., they worshiped the stars because they considered them as mediums of Divine influence and hoped to derive benefit from of their service. In the following halachah and in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 4:7), the Rambam mentions the second view. It is, however, unclear if this was the original intent of the star-worshipers or whether this was a later development.</i><br>This was the essence of the worship of false gods,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 2, Halachah 1.</i> and this was the rationale of those who worshiped them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">at the outset.</i> They would not say that there is no other god except for this star.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">as the pagans mentioned in Halachah 2 later did. The first generations of star worshipers were aware of God's existence and conceived of the stars as no more than intermediaries between ourselves and Him.</i><br>This message was conveyed by Jeremiah, who declared<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See also the Guide for the Perplexed (Vol. I, Chapter 36) where the Rambam explains a similar idea using the same Biblical proof-text.</i> (10:7-8): \"Who will not fear You, King of the nations, for to You it is fitting. Among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You. They have one foolish and senseless [notion. They conceive of their] empty teachings as wood;\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., as an entity of substance</i> i.e., all know that You alone are God. Their foolish error consists of conceiving of this emptiness<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">the worship of the stars<br><b>as Your will. -</b> This and the following two halachot are somewhat problematic. The Rambam conceived of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> as a book of law. He included philosophical and historical points only when they are halachot, directives for our behavior. In this light, this entire chapter seems unnecessary.<br>This difficulty can be resolved based on Chapter 2, Halachah 3, which states that it is forbidden to entertain thoughts of idol worship. Hence, in order to know which thoughts are forbidden, the Rambam feels it necessary to describe the entire thought process which led people to worship idols (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 20).<br>The phenomenon described by the Rambam does not belong entirely to the past. Although, at present, bowing down to the \"stars and spheres\" is not very common - although it has been renewed by some cultists - the theoretical premise that motivated the ancients to serve the stars is still followed by many. Is it all that uncommon to find people who compromise their service of God in expectation of receiving benefits by following what they perceive as the natural order?</i> as Your will.",
            "After many years passed, there arose people<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">false prophets - Note <i>Hilchot Yesodei Torah</i> 9:5, which states that anyone who states that God told him in a prophetic vision to worship idols should automatically be considered a false prophet.<br>See also the Guide for the Perplexed (Vol. II, Chapter 36) where the Rambam describes how people can be overcome by their powers of imagination to the extent that they - as do others who see them in such a trance - think of themselves as prophets, although, in fact, they received no Divine influence.</i> - false prophets - who told [their nations] that God had commanded them to say:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, this represents a second stage in the spread of idol worship. At first - as explained in Halachah 1 - star worship was not institutionalized, but was practiced by individuals because of their mistaken conceptions.<br>The second phase involved the development of religious institutions and set modes of worship. The leaders, however, still recognized God and attributed the instructions to worship the stars to Him. In the third stage - as the latter portion of this halachah states - people would worship the stars and idols without any awareness of God.</i> Serve this star<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">or all the stars - sacrifice to it, offer libations to it, build a temple for it and make an image of it so that all people - including the women, the children, and the common people - could bow to it. - See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 4:7) and his statements in Chapter 11, Halachah 16, where he explains that idol worship was instituted by the leaders of the nations to unite the people of a particular land, give them a sense of national identity, and establish a hierarchy of leaders.</i> - or all the stars - sacrifice to it, offer libations to it, build a temple for it and make an image of it so that all people - including the women, the children, and the common people - could bow to it.<br>He would inform them of a form that he had conceived, and tell them that this is the image of the particular star, claiming that this was revealed to him in a prophetic vision.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With these statements, the Rambam explains how people began to worship statues and idols. Since the star was far away and could not be perceived as more than a twinkling dot in the sky, the people wanted a more tangible image which they could relate to. The \"prophets\" obliged and devised forms for statues to serve as talismans to bring down influence from these stars.</i> In this manner, the people began to make images in temples, under trees, and on the tops of mountains and hills.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note Deuteronomy 12:2, which commands the Jews to destroy \"all the places where the nations... would worship their gods, on the high mountains, on the hills, or under any luxuriant tree.\" Note the Guide for the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapter 45, where the Rambam mentions the gentile practice of building temples on hills and mountaintops.</i><br>People would gather together and bow down to them<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">the images</i> and the [false prophets] would say: This image is the source of benefit or harm. It is appropriate to serve it and fear it. Their priests would tell them: This service will enable you to multiply and be successful. Do this and this, or do not do this or this.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">At this stage, their service was clearly self-oriented. They wanted to derive benefit or prevent harm to themselves through this service.</i><br>Subsequently, other deceivers arose and declared that a specific star, sphere, or angel<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i>, Chapter 2, for a description of the angels.</i> had spoken to them and commanded them: Serve me in this manner. He would then relate a mode of service [telling them:] Do this, do not do this.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This represented a further descent. Rather than prophesy in the name of God, these imposters would speak in the names of the idols themselves. (See also Chapter 5, Halachot 6-7.)</i><br>Thus, these practices spread throughout the world. People would serve images with strange practices<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">one more distorted than the other - Note Chapter 3, Halachah 2, which describes the service of Ba'al Pe'or. The people would defecate before the idol as an act of worship.</i> - one more distorted than the other - offer sacrifices to them, and bow down to them. As the years passed, [God's] glorious and awesome name was forgotten by the entire population. [It was no longer part of] their speech or thought, and they no longer knew Him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is not clear at which point in the history of the world this change took place. The period between Enosh's birth and Abraham's lasted slightly more than one thousand years, with the flood taking place approximately 750 years after Enosh's birth.</i> Thus, all the common people, the women, and the children would know<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Chulin</i> 1:1), where he also differentiates between the people who believe in the spiritual service intended to draw down spiritual energy from these celestial bodies and practice it, and the common people who worship the idols blindly, on faith.</i> only the image of wood or stone and the temples of stone to which they were trained from their childhood to bow down and serve, and in whose name they swore.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., they conceived of the images as gods. Such worship represented more than a mere conceptual error. Six of the seven mitzvot commanded to Noach and his descendants were also given to Adam, the first man. Among them was the prohibition against serving other gods (<i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 9:1). Thus, by worshiping these images, they were breaking an explicit Divine commandment.</i><br>The wise men among them would<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">not worship the images as gods in their own right, but they would</i> think that there is no God other than the stars and spheres for whose sake, and in resemblance of which, they had made these images. The Eternal Rock<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">the true God</i> was not recognized or known by anyone in the world, with the exception of a [few] individuals:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our Sages speak critically of these individuals, who were themselves righteous, but did nothing to influence the people around them.<br><b>for example -</b> See also the Guide for the Perplexed, Vol. II, Chapter 39, where the Rambam cites these individuals as prophets.<br><b>Chanoch -</b> Note Genesis 5:22: \"And Chanoch walked with God.\"<br><b>Metushelach -</b> Though his righteousness is not mentioned explicitly in the Torah, it is mentioned by our Sages in a number of places - e.g., <i>Yalkut Shimeoni, Bereshit</i> 42, which states: \"Metushelach was a completely righteous man.\"<br><b>Noach -</b> See Genesis 6:9: \"And Noach was a righteous man, perfect in his generation.\"<br><b>Shem -</b> Noach's second son.<br><b>and Ever. -</b> Shem and Ever are frequently mentioned by our Rabbis as righteous sages. See <i>Bereishit Rabbah</i> 63:6, which explains that when Rivkah went \"to seek out God\" (Genesis 25:22 , she went to the house of study of Shem and Ever.<br><b>The world continued in this fashion until the pillar of the world - the Patriarch Abraham - was born. -</b> Abraham was born in the year 1948 (1812 B.C.E.).</i> for example, Chanoch, Metushelach, Noach, Shem, and Ever. The world continued in this fashion until the pillar of the world - the Patriarch Abraham - was born.",
            "After this mighty man<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In several places - e.g., <i>Bava Batra</i> 15a and <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 11a - our Sages referred to Abraham with this expression.</i> was weaned,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Nedarim</i> 32a states: \"Abraham was three when he recognized his Creator.\" Although the Rambam states that it was not until Abraham was forty that he gained true awareness of God, his process of search began at age three.</i> he began to explore and think. Though he was a child, he began to think [incessantly] throughout the day and night, wondering: How is it possible for the sphere to continue to revolve without having anyone controlling it?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note the <i>Midrash HaGadol</i> (<i>Parashat Lech Lecha</i>), which explains that Abraham questioned: Why should we bow down to idols, gods that we ourselves make? We should bow to the earth, for it produces crops that sustain us.<br>Therefore, he began to worship the earth. Then he saw that the earth needs rain, and began to worship the sky. Later, he saw that the most brilliant creation in the sky was the sun, and began to worship it. Afterwards, when the sun set and the moon rose, he began to worship the moon. When the sun rose the next morning, he did not know what to do. He did not see which was stronger: the sun or the moon. So Abraham continued in a quandary, questioning who was the true God.</i> Who is causing it to revolve? Surely, it does not cause itself to revolve.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Interestingly, in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:5, the Rambam uses the same concept as a proof for the existence of God.<br>He had no teacher, nor was there anyone to inform him. -<i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 61:1 elaborates on the lack of instruction that was available to Abraham.<br>Note the Ra'avad and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, who question why Noach, Shem, and Ever (all of whom were alive at this time) did not try to nullify the worship of idols and why they did not instruct Abraham. They offer two explanations. The first is that they were afraid and hid from the idolaters. (See <i>Midrash Tehillim</i> 118. Note, however, teachings which state that these righteous men also protested the worship of false gods, <i>Tanna Devei Eliyahu Rabba</i>, Chapters 20 and 25.)<br>Alternatively, Shem and Ever lived in the land of Canaan, while Abraham lived in Babylon. The question remains, however, why did Abraham not seek out these righteous men (<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>).</i><br>He had no teacher, nor was there anyone to inform him. Rather, he was mired in Ur Kasdim among the foolish idolaters. His father, mother, and all the people [around him] were idol worshipers,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Indeed, our Sages relate that his father had a shop where idols were sold.</i> and he would worship with them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 39:8, which states that Abraham was always worried that God would not absolve him from his sin of worshiping idols.</i> [However,] his heart was exploring and [gaining] understanding.<br>Ultimately, he appreciated the way of truth<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">an awareness of God</i> and understood the path of righteousness<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">an ethical approach to behavior, which reflected his spiritual awareness</i> through his accurate comprehension. He realized that there was one God who controlled the sphere, that He created everything, and that there is no other God among all the other entities.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These are the fundamental principles of the Jewish faith, as explained in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:1-6.</i> He knew that the entire world was making a mistake. What caused them to err was their service of the stars and images, which made them lose awareness of the truth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Their worship of idols dulled their sensitivity to spirituality to the point where they lost all awareness of God.</i><br>Abraham was forty years old when he became aware of his Creator.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 64:4, which mentions two opinions regarding when Abraham became aware of God: one when he was three and one when he was forty eight. It is possible that the Rambam's text of the Midrash read \"forty\" instead of \"forty eight.\"<br>As explained above, the opinions are not necessarily contradictory. Abraham's process of inquiry could have begun at age three, while at forty he gained greater understanding, and at forty eight, he achieved an even higher level of awareness.<br><i>Avot</i> 5:21 states: \"At forty, one achieves understanding.\" By associating Abraham's apreciation of the Creator with this age, the Rambam implies that this awareness can come as a product of our own thought and meditation.</i> When he recognized and knew Him,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 39:1 explains Abraham's process of thought with a parable. A person saw a brightly lit palace. He wondered: Could this palace exist without an owner? Immediately, the owner revealed himself to him. Similarly, Abraham wondered: Is it possible for the world to exist without one who controls? Immediately, God revealed himself to him.</i> he began to formulate replies to the inhabitants of Ur Kasdim and debate with them, telling them that they were not following a proper path.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">by serving the stars and idols.</i><br>He broke their idols and began to teach the people that it is fitting to serve only the God of the world.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our Sages relate that after breaking his father's idols, he put a stick in the hands of the largest idol. When his father asked him why he destroyed the idols, he replied that he didn't do it; the idol holding the stick did.<br>His father curtly dismissed his reply: \"That idol is only metal. It cannot do anything,\" he roared at his son.<br>\"If so, why do you worship it?\" Abraham replied.</i> To Him [alone] is it fitting to bow down, sacrifice, and offer libations, so that the people of future [generations] would recognize Him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's words imply that the value of offering sacrifices at this time (before the Torah commanded that they be offered) was not as the acts of service of God, but in the educational effect they had on the people and the awareness of God they inspired.</i> [Conversely,] it is fitting to destroy and break all the images, lest all the people err concerning them, like those people who thought that there are no other gods besides these [images].<br>When he overcame them through the strength of his arguments, the king<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nimrod (<i>Pesachim</i> 118a)<br><b>desired to kill him -</b> by tossing him into a burning furnace.<br><b>He was [saved through] a miracle -</b> Interestingly, when the Rambam lists the ten trials that Abraham endured in his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Avot</i> 5:3, he does not mention this episode at all.<br><b>and left for Charan. -</b> See Genesis 11:31. In his Commentary on the Mishnah (ibid.), the Rambam mentions Abraham's exile from his native land as the first of his ten trials.<br><b>[There,] -</b> he did not encounter any of the formal opposition he had faced in Babylonia and<br><b>he began to call in a loud voice to all people and inform them that there is one God in the entire world. He would go out and call to the people, gathering them in city after city and country after country -</b> On the phrase, Genesis 12:5, \"the people they had gathered in Charan,\" <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 39:21 comments, \"These are the converts they made. Abraham would convert the men and Sarah would convert the women.\"<br><b>until he came to the land of Canaan -</b> See Genesis, Chapter 12, which describes Abraham's journeys within the land of Canaan.<br><b>proclaiming [God's existence the entire time] - as [Genesis 21:33] states: \"And He called there in the name of the Lord, the eternal God.\" -</b> <i>Sotah</i> 10a states: \"Do not read 'And he called.' Read 'And he had others call' - i.e., Abraham motivated others to become aware of God and call out to Him.<br><b>When the people would gather around him and ask him about his statements, he would explain [them] to each one of them according to their understanding, until they turned to the path of truth. Ultimately, thousands and myriads gathered around him. These are the men of the house of Abraham. -</b> The Rabbis question the fate of all these people. We do not find any mention of the perpetuation of their faith in God. Perhaps the cultural influences of the surrounding environment were too powerful. If the children of Israel themselves turned to idol worship after two generations in Egypt, could any more be expected from these individuals?<br><b>He planted in their hearts this great fundamental principle, composed texts about it -</b> Most commentaries point to <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 14b, which relates that Abraham composed a four-hundred-chapter text against the worship of false gods. <i>Kinat Eliyahu</i> notes that here, the Rambam is not referring to the negation of idol worship, but to the propagation of the faith in one God. Therefore, he suggests that the reference is to the Kabbalistic tradition (<i>Zohar</i>, Vol. II, 275b) that <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i> was composed by Abraham. (See also <i>Kiryat Melech</i>.)<br><b>and taught it to Isaac, his son. -</b> Note Genesis 18:19: \"I have known him that he will command his children and household after him, and they will keep the way of God....\"<br><b>Isaac also taught others and turned [their hearts to God]. He also taught Jacob -</b> Jacob also studied under Shem and Ever (See Rashi, Genesis 25:27, <i>Bereishit Rabbah</i> 25:16).<br><b>and appointed him as a teacher -</b> i.e., he and not Esau would convey the spiritual heritage of Abraham.<br><b>[Jacob] taught others and turned [the hearts] of all those who gathered around him [to God]. He also taught all of his children. -</b> In contrast to Abraham and Isaac, all of Jacob's children were righteous. (See <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 1:4.)<br><b>He selected Levi and appointed him as the leader. -</b> The Torah itself does not mention Jacob's selection of Levi as a leader. A number of sources in the oral tradition (<i>Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezer</i>, Chapter 39; <i>Shemot Rabbah</i> 15:27), however, reveal this concept.<br><b>He established him [as the head of] the academy -</b> The <i>Midrash Tanchuma</i> (<i>Vayigash</i>) interprets Genesis 46:28: \"And Jacob sent Judah before him,\" to mean that he charged him with founding a yeshiva. Similarly, <i>Yoma</i> 28b states that this Talmudic academy continued throughout the Egyptian exile.<br><b>to teach them the way of God -</b> Note <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 1:7, which explains that the expression, \"the way of God,\" refers to ethics, emulating the qualities of spirit which God has revealed.<br><b>and observe the mitzvot of Abraham. -</b> In this context, note the Rambam's statements in <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 9:1. After relating the seven universal laws given to Noach and his descendants, the Rambam states:<br>In addition to these, Abraham was commanded regarding circumcision. He instituted the morning prayer. Isaac separated tithes and added another prayer service towards evening. Jacob added the prohibition against eating the <i>gid hanasheh</i>, the \"displaced nerve,\" and instituted the evening prayers.<br><b>[Jacob] commanded his sons that the leadership should not depart from the descendants of Levi -</b> Thus, the mantle of leadership passed to Kehat and then to Amram, Moses' father.<br><b>so that the teachings would not be forgotten. This concept proceeded and gathered strength among the descendants of Jacob and those who collected around them, until there became a nation within the world which knew God. -</b> This describes the initial period of the Jews' stay in Egypt, when they prospered both spiritually and materially.<br><b>When the Jews extended their stay in Egypt -</b> The entire period of the Egyptian exile lasted 210 years. As long as Jacob's sons were living, the Jews preserved the heritage of their fathers and were treated with honor by the Egyptians.<br>The last of Jacob's sons to die was Levi. After his death, the spiritual level of the Jews descended. Levi lived 127 years. He was 44 when he entered Egypt. Thus, this spiritual descent occurred 83 years after the Jews entered Egypt.<br><b>however, they learned from the [Egyptians'] deeds and began worshiping the stars as they did -</b> When the Jews adopted Egyptian values - as a reflection of their spiritual state - they were enslaved by the Egyptians.<br><b>with the exception of the tribe of Levi, who clung to the mitzvot of the patriarchs - the tribe of Levi never served false gods. -</b> The tribe of Levi was also the only tribe which perpetuated the mitzvah of circumcision (<i>Sifre, Berachah</i>). As a result of their spiritual fortitude, the tribe of Levi was never enslaved.<br><b>Within a short time, the fundamental principle that Abraham had planted would have been uprooted and the descendants of Jacob would have returned to the errors of the world and their crookedness. -</b> Our Sages relate that, in the Egyptian exile, the Jews had descended to the forty-ninth degree of impurity. Had they descended another level, it would have been impossible for us ever to be redeemed.<br><b>Because of God's love for us, and to uphold the oath He made to Abraham, our patriarch -</b> This is a reference to Deuteronomy 7:7-8: \"It is not because of your greatness over all the other nations that God desired you and chose you..., but it was because of God's love for you and because He kept the oath He swore to your fathers.\"<br><b>He brought forth Moses, our teacher -</b> Rav David Arameah notes that the word עשה, rendered as \"brought forth,\" literally means \"made.\" He explains that from Moses' birth, God granted him the potential to develop unique spiritual awareness. Although the Rambam also accepts this concept (see the Guide for the Perplexed, Vol. II, Chapter 32), it is more likely that he chose this expression as a reference to I Samuel 12:6 (Rav Kapach).<br><b>the master of all prophets -</b> See <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 7:6, where the Rambam elaborates on the advantages Moses had over all the other prophets. Indeed, in his Commentary on the Mishnah (Introduction to Chapter 10 of <i>Sanhedrin</i>), he includes belief in the supremacy of Moses' prophecy as the seventh of his Thirteen Principles of Faith.<br><b>and sent him [to redeem the Jews] -</b> after 117 years of idol worship and slavery.<br><b>After Moses, our teacher, prophesied, and God chose Israel as His inheritance, He crowned them with mitzvot and informed them of the path to serve Him -</b> by<br><b>[teaching them] -</b> the Torah which reveals<br><b>the judgement prescribed for idol-worship and all those who stray after it -</b> as will be explained in the subsequent chapters. The Rambam's elaboration on the negative experience of our people in Egypt and the giving of the Torah has the following implication. Although man can appreciate the futile nature of idol worship and the greatness of God with his own intellect, because man is fallable, it is necessary to have these principles institutionalized in an objective, unchanging religious code (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 20).</i> desired to kill him. He was [saved through] a miracle and left for Charan. [There,] he began to call in a loud voice to all people and inform them that there is one God in the entire world and it is proper to serve Him. He would go out and call to the people, gathering them in city after city and country after country, until he came to the land of Canaan - proclaiming [God's existence the entire time] - as [Genesis 21:33] states: \"And He called there in the name of the Lord, the eternal God.\"<br>When the people would gather around him and ask him about his statements, he would explain [them] to each one of them according to their understanding, until they turned to the path of truth. Ultimately, thousands and myriads gathered around him. These are the men of the house of Abraham.<br>He planted in their hearts this great fundamental principle, composed texts about it, and taught it to Isaac, his son. Isaac also taught others and turned [their hearts to God]. He also taught Jacob and appointed him as a teacher.<br>[Jacob] taught others and turned [the hearts] of all those who gathered around him [to God]. He also taught all of his children. He selected Levi and appointed him as the leader. He established him [as the head of] the academy to teach them the way of God and observe the mitzvot of Abraham.<br>[Jacob] commanded his sons that the leadership should not depart from the descendants of Levi, so that the teachings would not be forgotten. This concept proceeded and gathered strength among the descendants of Jacob and those who collected around them, until there became a nation within the world which knew God.<br>When the Jews extended their stay in Egypt, however, they learned from the [Egyptians'] deeds and began worshiping the stars as they did, with the exception of the tribe of Levi, who clung to the mitzvot of the patriarchs - the tribe of Levi never served false gods.<br>Within a short time, the fundamental principle that Abraham had planted would have been uprooted, and the descendants of Jacob would have returned to the errors of the world and their crookedness. Because of God's love for us, and to uphold the oath He made to Abraham, our patriarch, He brought forth Moses, our teacher, the master of all prophets, and sent him [to redeem the Jews]. After Moses, our teacher, prophesied, and God chose Israel as His inheritance, He crowned them with mitzvot and informed them of the path to serve Him, [teaching them] the judgement prescribed for idol worshiper and all those who stray after it."

On a deeper level, it can be seen as a reference to his statements in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:4 that a person should always \"see himself and the entire world as equally balanced between merit and sin. If he commits one sin, he tips his balance and that of the entire world to guilt and brings on destruction.\"<br>Today, we can appreciate the Rambam's words in a very literal sense.

Even though the Sages referred to these as \"a small matter\" - since our Sages said: \"'A great matter,' this is <i>Ma'aseh Merkavah</i>. 'A small matter,' this is the debates of Abbaye and Ravva\" - nevertheless, it is fitting for them to be given precedence, because they settle a person's mind.<br>Thus, the Rambam teaches that a person should not embark on the study of deep spiritual questions until he has gained the intellectual maturity which comes from Torah study. Even after a person gains such maturity, there is no need for him to concern himself with the study of idol worship because there is no value which he can derive from such study.<br><b>The Torah has warned about this matter, saying [Numbers 15:39]: \"Do not stray after your hearts and eyes, which have led you to immorality\" -</b> <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 47) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 387) counts this as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.<br><b>i.e., each one of you should not follow his limited powers of understanding and think that he has comprehended the truth. -</b> Instead, he should follow a structured pattern for intellectual growth and development prescribed by a Torah master.<br><b>Our Sages -</b> <i>Sifre, Sh'lach</i>.

The transgression of both of the prohibitions mentioned in this halachah involves thought and can also involve deed. Just as the commentaries suggested several deeds which violate the first prohibition, similar acts could be performed which violate the latter prohibition. The Rambam, however, appears to imply that there is no way that the latter prohibition could be transgressed in a manner warranting punishment.</i> The Torah has warned about this matter, saying [Numbers 15:39]: \"Do not stray after your hearts and eyes, which have led you to immorality\" - i.e., each one of you should not follow his limited powers of understanding and think that he has comprehended the truth.<br>Our Sages [interpreted this warning]: \"After your hearts,\" this refers to heresy; \"after your eyes,\" this refers to immorality.

If throwing the staff is not comparable to sprinkling blood, why is one held liable for it? Accordingly, some commentaries have explained that this decision applies only when the deity is worshiped by throwing staffs. The <i>Pri Chadash</i>, however, differentiates between the liability of the worshiper (for which a sprinkling that spatters is not required) and the prohibition of the worship of the deity (for which it is).</i> because throwing a staff is not considered equivalent to sprinkling blood. The staff remains as it was,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">a single whole entity</i> while the blood spatters [in different directions].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the reason that these services are considered significant even though the deity is not normally worshiped in this manner is that these services were performed in the Temple, the analogy must be complete. Thus, the entity poured or thrown before the deity must spatter, as blood spatters when sprinkled on the altar (<i>Avodah Zarah</i>, ibid.).<br>A person who accepts any one of the various false gods - which already exist</i><br>A person who accepts any one of the various false gods as a deity<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">even though he does not perform a deed of worship<br><b>is liable for [execution by] stoning. -</b> The Rambam mentions that one is liable for stoning specifically.

Since he, nevertheless, did perform an act of worship to these gods, he must bring a sacrifice for atonement.<br>The above represents the <i>Kessef Mishneh's</i> interpretation of this halachah. Many other authorities (see <i>Tosafot, Sanhedrin</i> 64a) disagree, and maintain that even in such circumstances, one could be held liable for capital punishment. For example, two witnesses who knew the law were present and warned the person against repudiating the idol in this fashion. He ignored their warning and performed the derisive act of worship. Although his intent was not to serve the deity, since he performed an act of worship despite the warning he was given, he is liable for execution.<br>Rav Kapach brings support for the <i>Kessef Mishneh's</i> view from the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7:6. There, the Rambam discusses a similar situation and states that a person who performs such service \"is liable for a sin offering.\" In the original texts of that commentary, the Rambam stated that the person \"is liable.\" The addition of the words \"for a sin offering\" appear to indicate that he is liable only for an offering, but not for punishment by the court.

Most idolaters do not worship their images out of a genuine conviction that they are the true god, but rather for the benefit they feel this service will bring them.

This halachah is based on <i>Sanhedrin</i> 61b. That passage is also quoted in <i>Shabbat</i> 72b. Rabbenu Chanan'el, one of the foremost commentators in the generations between the Geonim and the Rambam, interprets the latter passage using the same concepts _ and almost the same phraseology _ as employed by the Rambam here.<br>The Ra'avad and others challenge the Rambam's interpretation and explain that \"out of love\" and \"out of fear\" mean: motivated by the love or fear of the person who tries to influence one to worship the false deity. The Rambam cannot accept this interpretation, because in <i>Hilchot Yesodei Torah</i> 5:4, he states that a person who is forced to serve false gods is not held liable for his deeds (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>The fact that a person is not held liable for such service does not at all minimize the seriousness of the prohibition involved. In no way is one allowed to serve false gods for such reasons. Even with regard to the Ra'avad's interpretation \"out of fear\" - i.e., out of fear of a person - the Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 150:3) prohibits performing any act that might be interpreted as idol worship - e.g., bowing to a ruler who is wearing an image.</i><br>One who embraces a false deity, kisses it, sweeps before it, mops before it, washes it, anoints it, dresses it, places shoes upon it, or performs any similar act of deference violates a negative commandment, as [implied by Exodus 20:5]: \"Do not serve them.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This commandment is described in Halachot 2 and 3.</i> Such acts are also \"service.\" The offender is, nevertheless, not<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">executed, as is one who worships a false deity, nor is he</i> liable for lashes, because [these services] are not [mentioned] explicitly [by the Torah].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that punishment is not given because this prohibition is a לאו שבכללות - i.e., it includes many different forbidden acts. Lashes are not given for the violation of such a prohibition, as stated in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 18:2-3.<br>To explain: The prohibition, \"Do not serve them,\" is twofold in nature. It prohibits the worship of a false deity through its accepted modes of service, as stated in Halachah 2. This is a sin punishable by death. The same prohibition also forbids these expressions of affection or reverence. These deeds are not, however, punishable by death because they are not acts of worship.<br>Since violation of this prohibition incurs a penalty of execution, it is not associated with the punishment of lashes. Since, in essence, this prohibition is not associated with lashes, even the many transgressions of a lesser nature which are also included within this prohibition are also not punishable in this manner (Rav Kapach).</i><br>If one of the above services<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">kissing, and the like</i> was the accepted mode of worship [of a particular deity] and a person performed this service as an act of worship,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">and not merely as an expression of emotion. The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> questions the addition of the words \"as an act of worship,\" noting that in Halachah 5, the Rambam holds one liable for performing the service with which Pe'or or Marculis was worshiped, even though one's intent was to repudiate the idols. Thus, it appears that once a person performs a service which is the accepted mode of worship, his intent is no longer significant.<br>The <i>Pri Chadash</i> resolves this difficulty, explaining that the extent of liability is different.

He resolves that difficulty, explaining that in Halachah 5, the person intended to throw the stone at the idol. Since that act constitutes worship of this deity, he is held liable. In contrast, in our halachah the person did not bow down to the idol at all. The only reason the bowing is prohibited is that a mistaken impression might be created.</i> Instead, he should sit down, and then pick it up.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Avodah Zarah</i> (ibid.) mentions a third prohibition, that a person should not bow down to drink from a spring that flows in front of an idol.

Therefore, the one who commissioned him is held responsible for his deed.<br>The commentaries question this explanation, noting that - with the exception of a few specific instances - the Torah never holds a person who commissions another individual to commit a sin liable, since the person who actually committed the sin is responsible for his actions. Also, the Rambam's phraseology here implies that one is held liable regardless whether the craftsman is a Jew or gentile, and a gentile is never given the halachic status of an agent.<br>The following are among the resolutions offered to this difficulty:a) A hired worker's actions - whether positive or negative - are always attributed to his employer (<i>Machaneh Efrayim, Hilchot Shutafim</i> 8).b) The verse prohibiting this act reveals that this is one of the few exceptions to the general rule mentioned above, and in this case, the person who commissioned the agent is held liable (<i>Darchei HaMelech</i>).c) Commenting on <i>Hilchot Sechirut</i> 13:2, the <i>Mishneh LaMelech</i> explains that if it is possible to violate a particular prohibition by committing a deed, one is punished by lashes even when one violates it without committing a deed. The same concept can be applied here (<i>S'deh Chemed</i>).d) The deed for which one is punished is not the command to make the idol, but rather its purchase or acquisition (<i>Merchevat HaMishneh</i>, Alfandari).</i> as [Exodus 20:5] states: \"Do not make for yourself an idol or any representation.\"<br>Similarly,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The grammatical structure of this verse allows it to be interpreted, \"Do not have an idol... made for you.\" <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 2) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 27) consider this to be one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> a person who actually fashions a false god for others, even for<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">gentile</i> idolaters,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">even when he merely acts as a craftsman and does not worship or believe in the idol himself.</i> is [punished by] lashing, as [Leviticus 19:4] states: \"Do not make molten gods for yourselves.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 3) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 214) consider this to be one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> Accordingly, a person who actually fashions a false god for himself<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">violates both of the above prohibitions.

Wax would be poured on the document and the ring pressed into the wax, producing an imprint which is a reverse image of that on the ring.</i> which bears a human image: If the image is protruding, it is forbidden to wear it,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">on one's finger, because a protruding image is forbidden, as stated in the previous halachah.</i> but it is permitted to use it as a seal. If the image is an impression, it is permitted to wear it,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">because there is not prohibition against such a human image</i> but it is forbidden to use it as a seal,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">for the human image it produces is sunken into the wax.</i> because it will create an image which protrudes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">which is forbidden.</i><br>Similarly, it is forbidden to make an image of the sun, the moon, the stars, the constellations,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our understanding of the Rambam's statements here can be enhanced by referring to his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 3:3:<br>This does not mean a sphere which represents the sun or a hemisphere which represents the moon, but rather the images which the astrologers [i.e., those following Greek mythology] attribute to the stars,... e.g., Saturn is represented as an old dark man of venerable age, Venus is represented as a a beautiful maiden adorned with gold, and the sun is represented as a king with a diadem sitting in a chariot.[These are forbidden because] they are falsehoods and the nature of falsehood is that it will surely spread.<br>Rav Kapach supports this interpretation by quoting <i>BeMidbar Rabbah</i> 2:6, which describes the pennant of the tribe of Issachar as having a picture of the sun and the moon. Were these images forbidden, it would be unlikely that Moshe would have told the tribe to depict them. Even if the decree was instituted in the later generations, it is not probable that the Rabbis would forbid images that had previously been used for a Torah purpose.<br>The Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 141:3) quotes the Rambam's opinion. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 141:13 and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 141:8, however, note that the Rambam's statements which were quoted above (and the Ramah's statements) refer to a question whether one is allowed to keep images of the sun or moon that he finds. Here, the question is whether one is allowed to make such images oneself. From the discussion of the question in <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 43b, where the Sages question how Rabban Gamliel possessed forms of the moon, it would appear that there is a prohibition against making images of the sun and the moon themselves.<br>This interpretation, however, is also somewhat problematic, because the Rambam writes that there is no prohibition against making images of animals, and some of the constellations of the Zodiac are represented and referred to as animals. For example, one of the Zodiac constellations is a fish and <i>Gittin</i> 36a describes Rav as making a drawing of a fish. Another is a lion, which is one of the most popular images found in Jewish art.</i> or the angels,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As the Rambam writes in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 2:3-5, the angels have no body or form. Hence, here, he is obviously referring to a form which a man has conceived of as appropriate for a particular angel. Alternatively, it could refer to the metaphoric imagery used by the prophets.</i> as [implied by Exodus, ibid.]: \"Do not make with Me [gods of silver...]\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam (quoting <i>Avodah Zarah</i>, ibid.) mentions the above Biblical proof-text in connection with this prohibition. It would appear, however, from the fact that making such images is not punishable by lashes, that the prohibition is only Rabbinic in nature. The reference to the verse must be understood as an <i>asmachta</i> (use of the Biblical verse as a support for a Rabbinic decree).</i> - i.e., do not make images of<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">those who are \"with Me\" - i.e.,</i> My servants, those who serve before Me<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to the celestial beings and the angels. (See Chapter 1, Halachah 1, and <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 2:3.)</i> on high. This [prohibition]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">is more severe than the prohibition against making human images, and</i> applies even [to pictures] on tablets.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Rambam's statements in his Commentary on the Mishnah, the difference between the prohibition against making these images and those of humans can be explained as follows: The prohibition against making human statues is Biblical in origin and is defined by the Torah itself. In contrast, the prohibition of making images of the celestial beings was a safeguard instituted by the Rabbis against Greek and Roman culture. It, therefore, applies to all images, whether pictures or statues, because both could influence people to stray from the Torah's ways.<br>According to the simple interpretation of the terms \"sun\" and \"moon,\" the difference can be explained as follows: The sun and the moon, as we perceive them, appear against the background of the sky. Therefore, for a representation of them to be forbidden, it also need not protrude (<i>Tosafot, 14Avodah Zarah</i>, ibid.).</i><br>The images of animals and other living beings<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">with the exception of men - <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 42b also mentions a prohibition against making the image of a <i>d'rakon</i> which Rashi and others interpret as an animal similar to a serpent.<br>In his Commentary on the Mishnah (ibid.), the Rambam describes this image as a fishlike man with fins and many scales, probably referring to the Greek god Neptune.</i> - with the exception of men - and similarly, the images of trees, grasses, and the like may be fashioned. This<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">leniency</i> applies even to images which protrude.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From these two halachot, particularly according to the Rambam's understanding as reflected in his Commentary on the Mishnah, we see that there is no conflict between Torah law and aesthetics. There are only two restrictions: realistic human statues (and according to some authorities, these must be complete, full-bodied statues) and depictions of pagan gods. Even according to the other opinions which forbid depictions of the sun, the moon, and the like, there is no prohibition against abstract portrayals of these entities. No other restrictions apply at all.<br>There is definitely a divergence between the approach to life that spawned much of the art forms of Western culture and a Torah lifestyle. Perhaps for that reason, many religious Jews have traditionally shunned participation in and patronage of the arts. In the present generation, however, a number of our Torah leaders have urged religious artists to dedicate themselves to expressing Torah ideas and values in a variety of art forms, explaining that:a) Through these media, it is possible to reach many Jews who might never enter a synagogue or Torah center;b) Everything in the world was created to be used by the Jews for a Torah purpose (Rashi, Genesis 1:1 . This also applies to art. Using these art forms for Torah purposes expresses the true intent for their creation and endows them with a depth of meaning and inspiration - and in its deepest sense, a new wellspring of creativity.<br>According to Kabbalah, God's presence is more manifest in the <i>sefirah</i> of <i>Tiferet</i> (\"Beauty\") than in any other <i>sefirah</i>. Thus, the challenge confronting a Torah artist today is to use beauty as a medium to express Godly truth.</i>"

Indeed, in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 16:10, when discussing the prohibitions of a דבר חשוב (a forbidden substance whose importance prevents it from ever being nullified in a mixture), the Rambam himself appears to follow this view, stating:<br>If one pomegranate from a mixture [containing a forbidden pomegranate] falls together with two other pomegranates... and from these three, one pomegranate falls together with other pomegranates, the latter [mixture] is permitted.<br>Indeed, on the basis of the statements in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i>, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 140) deviates from the Rambam's opinion and requires three mixtures.<br>This approach, however, is not followed by all commentaries. Rashi and <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Zevachim</i>, ibid.) explain that even with regard to a דבר חשוב, only two mixtures are necessary. These views are quoted as halachah by the <i>Turei Zahav</i> and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> in their glosses on the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 110:8).<br>Among the suggestions made by the commentaries to resolve the difference between the Rambam's statements here and those in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> are the following:a) Most people are careful regarding the prohibition against benefiting from any object connected with idol worship. Therefore, there is no need to reinforce the prohibition. In contrast, the prohibition against benefiting from a דבר חשוב is far less known. Hence, the Rabbis added severe safeguards to make sure that it be observed (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).b) Here, the Rambam is speaking about a prohibition against benefiting from a forbidden object (איסור הנאה). In contrast, <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> is concerned with partaking of forbidden foods, where the prohibition is more severe (<i>Siftei Cohen</i>, <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 110:52).<br>Even the authorities who permit the second mixture to be used do not allow a single individual to partake of the entire mixture at one time. In such an instance, there would be only a single doubt whether he used the forbidden object or not.<br>The Rabbis (<i>Zevachim</i>, 74b) mentioned another example of a mixture which is permitted because of circumstances which create a doubt whether our original suspicion continues to apply:<br><b>Should a ring [used to adorn] an idol become mixed together with one hundred other rings, and -</b> they would thus all be forbidden according to the above principles. However, if<br><b>then two of them fall -</b> accidentally. If one intentionally throws one into the sea, the leniency does not apply (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 110:7).<br><b>into the Mediterranean Sea -</b> and are thus lost.

(Note the <i>Kessef Mishneh's</i> comments that here, the Dead Sea is intended.)<br><b>it is permissible to use all of them. -</b> i.e., all the rings that remain. The prohibition does not continue to apply, because<br><b>We presume that the [forbidden] ring was among the two -</b> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that when stating a similar law in <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 15:2, the Rambam required only a single barrel of wine to be lost. The difference between these two laws can be resolved by taking into account the nature of the prohibited substances: Rings are small, and the loss of a single ring does not make a substantial difference to the entire group. In contrast, barrels of wine are large, and the loss of even one will attract attention.<br>[which fell]. - The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 140) limits this leniency, stating that it is forbidden to use a single ring alone, nor may one person benefit from the entire group of rings at once.<br>The Rabbis (<i>Zevachim</i>, ibid.) mentioned a third example of a mixture which is permitted because of circumstances which create a doubt whether our original suspicion continues to apply:<br><b>Should [a forbidden ring] become mixed together with a hundred others and -</b> they would thus be forbidden according to the above principles. However, if<br><b>then [the group] becomes divided, forty -</b> i.e., the minority<br><b>being separated in one group, and sixty -</b> i.e., the majority<br><b>in another, and then the entire [group of] forty fall into another group of rings, it is permissible to use all of them -</b> the second mixture.<br><b>We presume that the forbidden ring remained among the majority. -</b> There is a doubt whether the forbidden ring was among the forty.

There, the Rambam specifically writes that when taking the nest - as stated in the final clause of this halachah - it permissible to climb up the tree in the normal manner. Therefore, it appears that one should knock down the chicks to see if they are capable of flying on their own or not. This explanation also clarifies why the Rambam does not mention in this halachah the need to knock down the chicks.

            "When a false deity was abandoned by its worshipers in a time of peace, it is apparent that they nullified it. Hence, benefit may be derived from it.

The only reason they abandoned it was the war.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note the <i>Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh De'ah</i> 146:10) which states that if the gentiles could return to the idol but do not, it is considered to have been nullified.<br>When a false deity becomes broken in the course of nature, it is forbidden to benefit from its broken pieces until they have been nullified. - <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 41b quotes a difference of opinion on this matter between Resh Lakish and Rabbi Yochanan. Resh Lakish maintains that we can assume that the gentiles nullified their worship of the idol. If it could not save itself, surely it cannot save them.<br>Rabbi Yochanan does not accept this opinion and maintains that even when an idol is broken it is revered. <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 49b states that the gentiles would even worship the broken pieces of an idol. (See also the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 3:3.)</i><br>When a false deity becomes broken in the course of nature, it is forbidden to benefit from its broken pieces until they have been nullified.

Since it is recognized as an idol, the prohibition against using it becomes an established fact, which cannot be changed until we are certain that it has been nullified as an object of worship. (Note also our commentary on Chapter 7, Halachah 7.)</i><br>[The following principles apply to an idol] which comes in pieces: If it could be reassembled by an ordinary person,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">the fact that it is broken is not of consequence.

In contrast to the Ra'avad and some other authorities, the Rambam does require that at least this minimal nullification be carried out.

Thus, we are forced to say that this law is speaking about an instance where the stone is presently being used as a platform. It can be interpreted as applying when the damage happens as a matter of course. The Rambam is teaching us that even though the stone is being used as a platform at present, since it will soon be replaced, it is permitted. Alternatively, it is speaking about a stone which was originally hewn out to be used as a platform. In such an instance, the damage must be purposely caused by a gentile with the intention of nullifying the platform.</i><br>What is considered a platform, and what, an altar? A platform consists of a single stone; an altar, of many stones.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rather than differentiate between them because of the functions they serve, explaining that a platform is used to place idols upon, and an altar, to bring sacrifices, the Rambam (based on <i>Avodah Zarah</i>, <i>ibid.</i>,) considers size the determinant.</i><br>How are the stones of Marculis nullified?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned, a shrine to Marculis consists of three stones placed one on top of the other.</i> When one constructs a building from them or uses them to pave the roads or the like, it is permitted to benefit from them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Avodah Zarah</i> 50a relates that even Rabbi Menachem b'Rabbi Simai, who was called the son of the holy because he would not look at the image of a coin, lest it carry the form of an idol, would walk on such roads.</i><br>How is an <i>asherah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A tree which is worshiped or one which offers shade for an idol</i> nullified?

The Yemenite manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> read יגלה, \"reveal,\" instead of יגלח, \"cut.\" According to that version, the Rambam is saying that when a woman goes out without covering her head, in addition to violating the basic laws of modesty (see <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 24:11-12; <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 21:17), she is also transgressing this Torah prohibition.</i><br>A man should not adorn himself as a woman does<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 40) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 543) consider this prohibition to be one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.<br>In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam mentions two rationales for this and the previous prohibition:a) Such behavior would lead to licentiousness;b) The pagans would often dress in this manner for their rituals.</i> - e.g., he should not wear colored garments or golden bracelets in a place where such garments and such bracelets are worn only by women. Everything follows local custom.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Accordingly, the definition of the pertinent rulings changes according to the norms of the society. Garments which might have been forbidden for men or women in one era may be permitted in another, depending on the standards set by the particular society.<br>A man who adorns himself as a woman does, and a woman who adorns herself as a man does, are [liable for] lashes. - Note the Ramah's statements, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 696:8, which state that on Purim or at a wedding, this prohibition may be waived for the sake of adding to the festive mood of the celebration. The <i>Bayit Chadash</i> and others, however, do not accept this leniency.</i><br>A man who adorns himself as a woman does, and a woman who adorns herself as a man does, are [liable for] lashes.

The Ra'avad (see also <i>Sho'el UMeshiv</i>, Vol. I, Responsum 210) differs, and maintains that such an act violates only a Rabbinic prohibition.

The Rambam's expression implies that although the person is not lashed, both of these acts are forbidden.<br>The <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) explains that the prohibition against writing on one's flesh applies only when the imprint left by the ink or dye is permanent. If it is removable, it is not forbidden. In this manner, he justifies the acts of people who jot down notes on their flesh when they have no paper available.</i> [Punishment is administered] only when he writes and dyes, as [Leviticus 19:28] states: \"[Do not make] a dyed inscription [on yourselves].\"<br>To<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The two words \"dyed inscription\" imply that both activities must be performed for the person to be held liable.<br>To whom does this apply?

There are opinions (see <i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 180:7), however, which allow one to beat one's flesh in grief until blood flows.</i> Just as the pagans would gouge their flesh in grief over their dead, they would mutilate themselves for their idols,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The<i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that this mutilation was not part of the rites used to worship the false deity - for if so, a violator would be executed - but rather a voluntary act, intended to attract the deity's attention.</i> as [I Kings 18:28] states:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">regarding the prophets of the Baal who engaged in the confrontation with the prophet Elijah at Mount Carmel:</i> \"And they mutilated themselves according to their custom.\"<br>This<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This implies that this was not an isolated occurrence, but rather the routine followed by the Baal's priests.<br>This is also forbidden by the Torah, as [Deuteronomy 14:1] states: \"Do not mutilate yourselves.\" - This injunction is not considered to be a separate commandment, but rather a further explanation of the mitzvah stated previously.<br>[The difference between the two is that if one gouges himself in grief over] the dead, whether he did so with his bare hands or with an instrument, he is [liable for] lashes; - Since the verse from Deuteronomy also concludes \"for the dead,\" it appears that both gashing and gouging are forbidden essentially as mourning rites.

            "This commandment also includes [a prohibition]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 45), the Rambam explains that the interpretation which follows is an allegory, and the simple meaning of the verse is to prohibit gashing oneself in grief. Nevertheless, it is significant that the Rambam includes this \"allegory\" in a text which is, as he states in his introduction, \"halachot, halachot.\" Thus, he emphasizes how important unity is to the Jewish people.<br>There is an important halachic dimension to the Rambam's explanation in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>. One of the principles of Torah law is that punishment is never administered for the violation of a לאו שבכללות (\"a prohibition which includes within it several different injunctions;\" see <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 18:2-3). If this allegorical interpretation of the mitzvah were considered to be included in the simple meaning of the mitzvah, this principle would also apply regarding this mitzvah, and lashes might not be administered when one gashed oneself in mourning (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> against there being two courts which follow different customs in a single city, since this can cause great strife.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This decision has been the subject of much discussion among the Rabbis, because it appears to run contrary to one of the accepted principles of halachah.<br>The Rabbis concluded that whenever there is a difference in opinion between Abbaye and Ravva, the halachah follows Ravva, with the exception of six specific instances (יעל קגם). In the present case, the Rambam quotes Abbaye's opinion even though Ravva differs, stating that the prohibition applies only when one follows a divergent opinion without the support of a formal Rabbinical court (<i>Yevamot</i> 14a). When, however, there is a Rabbinical court which advocates each of the differing opinions - e.g., the differences of opinion between the School of Shammai and the School of Hillel - there is no prohibition against following either view until the halachah is determined by the supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i>.<br>Many authorities have advanced different explanations for the Rambam's decision. The most straightforward is that of the Radbaz (Vol. V, Responsum 1384), who explains that the Rambam favored Abbaye's view because of the emphasis on unity. Furthermore, selecting it over Ravva's in this instance does not represent a break with the accepted tradition, since the difference of opinion here does not center on positions adopted by Abbaye and Ravva independently, but rather on their interpretation of Resh Lakish's statements.</i> [Because of the similarity in the Hebrew roots,]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew גדד means both \"gash\" and \"group.\"</i> the prohibition against gashing ourselves [can be interpreted] to mean: \"Do not separate into various different groupings.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It must be noted that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> does not quote this halachah as law. It would appear that while many of the subsequent Rabbis appreciate the ideal of unity this halachah espouses, they felt that compelling people to conform to a uniform standard would create more strife than would result from the existence of different views.<br>One of the practical applications of the issues under discussion is the issue of differences between Sephardic and Ashkenazic religious practices (and similarly, the variety of different approaches that exist within these two major groupings). All of the contemporary authorities agree that it is desirable for each group to adhere to its native customs without change. This plurality of halachic perspectives is an expression - and not a negation - of the all-encompassing unity that permeates Torah Judaism. (See <i>Ezrat Cohen</i>, Responsum 103.)</i>",
