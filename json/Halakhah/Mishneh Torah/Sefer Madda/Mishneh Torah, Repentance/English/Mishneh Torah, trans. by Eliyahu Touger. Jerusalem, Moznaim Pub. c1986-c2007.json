            "If a person transgresses any of the mitzvot of the Torah, whether a positive command or a negative command - whether willingly or inadvertently - when he repents, and returns from his sin, he must confess before God, blessed be He, as [Numbers 5:6-7] states: \"If a man or a woman commit any of the sins of man... they must confess the sin that they committed.\"<br>This refers to a verbal confession. This confession is a positive command.<br>How does one confess: He states: \"I implore You, God, I sinned, I transgressed, I committed iniquity before You by doing the following. Behold, I regret and am embarrassed for my deeds. I promise never to repeat this act again.\"<br>These are the essential elements of the confessional prayer. Whoever confesses profusely and elaborates on these matters is worthy of praise.<br>Those who bring sin offerings or guilt offerings must also [confess their sins] when they bring their sacrifices for their inadvertent or willful transgressions. Their sacrifices will not atone for their sins until they repent and make a verbal confession as [Leviticus 5:5] states: \"He shall confess the sin he has committed upon it.\"<br>Similarly, those obligated to be executed or lashed by the court do not attain atonement through their death or lashing unless they repent and confess. Similarly, someone who injures a colleague or damages his property, does not attain atonement, even though he pays him what he owes until he confesses and makes a commitment never to do such a thing again as implied by the phrase [Numbers, <i>loc. cit..</i>], \"any of the sins of man.\"",
            "Since the goat sent [to Azazel] atones for all of Israel, the High Priest confesses upon it as a spokesman for all of Israel as [Leviticus 16:21] states: \"He shall confess upon it all the sins of the children of Israel.\"<br>The goat sent to Azazel atones for all the transgressions in the Torah, the severe and the lighter [sins]; those violated intentionally and those transgressed inadvertently; those which [the transgressor] became conscious of and those which he was not conscious of. All are atoned for by the goat sent [to Azazel].<br>This applies only if one repents. If one does not repent, the goat only atones for the light [sins].<br>Which are light sins and which are severe ones? The severe sins are those for which one is liable for execution by the court or <i>karet.</i> False and unnecessary oaths are also considered severe sins even though they are not [punished by] <i>karet.</i> [The violation of] the other prohibitions and [the failure to perform] positive commandments that are not punishable by <i>karet</i> are considered light [sins].",
            "At present, when the Temple does not exist and there is no altar of atonement, there remains nothing else aside from Teshuvah.<br>Teshuvah atones for all sins. Even a person who was wicked his whole life and repented in his final moments will not be reminded of any aspect of his wickedness as [Ezekiel 33:12] states \"the wickedness of the evil one will not cause him to stumble on the day he repents his wickedness.\"<br>The essence of Yom Kippur atones for those who repent as [Leviticus 16:30] states: \"This day will atone for you.\"",
            "Even though Teshuvah atones for all [sins] and the essence of Yom Kippur brings atonement, [there are different levels of sin and hence, differences in the degree of atonement.] There are sins that can be atoned for immediately and other sins which can only be atoned for over the course of time. What is implied?<br>If a person violates a positive command which is not punishable by <i>karet</i> and repents, he will not leave that place before he is forgiven. Concerning these sins, [Jeremiah 3:22] states: \"Return, faithless children! I will heal your rebellious acts.\"<br>If a person violates a prohibition that is not punishable by <i>karet</i> or execution by the court and repents, Teshuvah has a tentative effect and Yom Kippur brings atonement as [Leviticus, <i>loc. cit.</i> states \"This day will atone for you.\"<br>If a person violates [sins punishable by] <i>karet</i> or execution by the court and repents, Teshuvah and Yom Kippur have a tentative effect and the sufferings which come upon him complete the atonement. He will never achieve complete atonement until he endures suffering for concerning these [sins, Psalms 89:33] states: \"I will punish their transgression with a rod.\"<br>When does the above apply: When the desecration of God's name is not involved in the transgression. However, a person who desecrated God's name, even though he repented, Yom Kippur arrived while he continued his repentance, and he experienced suffering, will not be granted complete atonement until he dies. The three: repentance, Yom Kippur, and suffering have a tentative effect and death atones as [Isaiah 22:14] states: \"It was revealed in my ears [by] the Lord of Hosts, surely this iniquity will not be atoned for until you die.\""

            "[Who has reached] complete Teshuvah? A person who confronts the same situation in which he sinned when he has the potential to commit [the sin again], and, nevertheless, abstains and does not commit it because of his Teshuvah alone and not because of fear or a lack of strength.<br>For example, a person engaged in illicit sexual relations with a woman. Afterwards, they met in privacy, in the same country, while his love for her and physical power still persisted, and nevertheless, he abstained and did not transgress. This is a complete Baal-Teshuvah. This was implied by King Solomon in his statement [Ecclesiastes 12:1] \"Remember your Creator in the days of your youth, [before the bad days come and the years draw near when you will say: `I have no desire for them.'\"]<br>If he does not repent until his old age, at a time when he is incapable of doing what he did before, even though this is not a high level of repentance, he is a Baal-Teshuvah.<br>Even if he transgressed throughout his entire life and repented on the day of his death and died in repentance, all his sins are forgiven as [Ecclesiastes, <i>op. cit.</i>:2] continues: \"Before the sun, the light, the moon, or the stars are darkened and the clouds return after the rain...\" - This refers to the day of death. Thus, we can infer that if one remembers his Creator and repents before he dies, he is forgiven.",
            "What constitutes Teshuvah? That a sinner should abandon his sins and remove them from his thoughts, resolving in his heart, never to commit them again as [Isaiah 55:7] states \"May the wicked abandon his ways....\" Similarly, he must regret the past as [Jeremiah 31:19] states: \"After I returned, I regretted.\"<br>[He must reach the level where] He who knows the hidden will testify concerning him that he will never return to this sin again as [Hoshea 14:4] states: \"We will no longer say to the work of our hands: `You are our gods.'\"<br>He must verbally confess and state these matters which he resolved in his heart.",
            "Anyone who verbalizes his confession without resolving in his heart to abandon [sin] can be compared to [a person] who immerses himself [in a <i>mikvah</i>] while [holding the carcass of] a lizard in his hand. His immersion will not be of avail until he casts away the carcass.<br>This principle is implied by the statement, [Proverbs 28:13], \"He who confesses and forsakes [his sins] will be treated with mercy.\"<br>It is necessary to mention particularly one's sins as evidenced by [Moses' confession, Exodus 32:31]: \"I appeal to You. The people have committed a terrible sin by making a golden idol.\"",
            "Among the paths of repentance is for the penitent to<br>a) constantly call out before God, crying and entreating;<br>b) to perform charity according to his potential;<br>c) to separate himself far from the object of his sin;<br>d) to change his name, as if to say \"I am a different person and not the same one who sinned;\"<br>e) to change his behavior in its entirety to the good and the path of righteousness; and f) to travel in exile from his home. Exile atones for sin because it causes a person to be submissive, humble, and meek of spirit.",
            "It is very praiseworthy for a person who repents to confess in public and to make his sins known to others, revealing the transgressions he committed against his colleagues.<br>He should tell them: \"Though I sinned against so and so, committing the following misdeeds.... Behold, I repent and express my regret.\" Anyone who, out of pride, conceals his sins and does not reveal them will not achieve complete repentance as [Proverbs 28:13] states: \"He who conceals his sins will not succeed.\"<br>When does the above apply? In regard to sins between man and man. However, in regard to sins between man and God, it is not necessary to publicize one's [transgressions]. Indeed, revealing them is arrogant. Rather, a person should repent before God, blessed be He, and specifically mention his sins before Him. In public, he should make a general confession. It is to his benefit not to reveal his sins as [Psalms 32:1] states: \"Happy is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.\"",
            "Even though repentance and calling out [to God] are desirable at all times, during the ten days between Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur, they are even more desirable and will be accepted immediately as [Isaiah 55:6] states: \"Seek God when He is to be found.\"<br>When does the above apply? To an individual. However, in regard to a community, whenever they repent and cry out wholeheartedly, they are answered immediately as [Deuteronomy 4:7] states: \"[What nation is so great that they have God close to them,] as God, our Lord, is whenever we call Him.\"",
            "Yom Kippur is the time of Teshuvah for all, both individuals and the community at large. It is the apex of forgiveness and pardon for Israel. Accordingly, everyone is obligated to repent and confess on Yom Kippur.<br>The mitzvah of the confession of Yom Kippur begins on the day's eve, before one eats [the final meal], lest one choke to death in the meal before confessing.<br>Although a person confessed before eating, he should confess again in the evening service, Yom Kippur night, and similarly, repeat the confession in the morning, <i>Musaf,</i> afternoon, and <i>Ne'ilah</i> services.<br>At which point [in the service] should one confess? An individual confesses after the <i>Amidah</i> and the <i>Chazan</i> confesses in the midst of the <i>Amidah,</i> in the fourth blessing.",
            "The confessional prayer customarily recited by all Israel is: \"For we have all sinned....\" This is the essence of the confessional prayer.<br>Sins which were confessed on one Yom Kippur should be confessed on another Yom Kippur even though one remains steadfast in his repentance, as [Psalms 51:5] states: \"I acknowledge my transgressions and my sins are always before me.\"",
            "Teshuvah and Yom Kippur only atone for sins between man and God; for example, a person who ate a forbidden food or engaged in forbidden sexual relations, and the like. However, sins between man and man; for example, someone who injures a colleague, curses a colleague, steals from him, or the like will never be forgiven until he gives his colleague what he owes him and appeases him.<br>[It must be emphasized that] even if a person restores the money that he owes [the person he wronged], he must appease him and ask him to forgive him.<br>Even if a person only upset a colleague by saying [certain] things, he must appease him and approach him [repeatedly] until he forgives him.<br>If his colleague does not desire to forgive him, he should bring a group of three of his friends and approach him with them and request [forgiveness]. If [the wronged party] is not appeased, he should repeat the process a second and third time. If he [still] does not want [to forgive him], he may let him alone and need not pursue [the matter further]. On the contrary, the person who refuses to grant forgiveness is the one considered as the sinner.<br>[The above does not apply] if [the wronged party] was one's teacher. [In that instance,] a person should continue seeking his forgiveness, even a thousand times, until he forgives him.",
            "It is forbidden for a person to be cruel and refuse to be appeased. Rather, he should be easily pacified, but hard to anger. When the person who wronged him asks for forgiveness, he should forgive him with a complete heart and a willing spirit. Even if he aggravated and wronged him severely, he should not seek revenge or bear a grudge.<br>This is the path of the seed of Israel and their upright spirit. In contrast, the insensitive gentiles do not act in this manner. Rather, their wrath is preserved forever. Similarly, because the Gibeonites did not forgive and refused to be appeased, [II Samuel 21:2] describes them, as follows: \"The Gibeonites are not among the children of Israel.\"",
            "If a person wronged a colleague and the latter died before he could ask him for forgiveness, he should take ten people and say the following while they are standing before the colleague's grave: \"I sinned against God, the Lord of Israel, and against this person by doing the following to him....\"<br>If he owed him money, he should return it to his heirs. If he is unaware of the identity of his heirs, he should place [the sum] in [the hands of] the court and confess."

            "Each and every person has merits and sins. A person whose merits exceed his sins is [termed] righteous. A person whose sins exceed his merits is [termed] wicked. If [his sins and merits] are equal, he is termed <i>a</i> <i>Beinoni.</i><br>The same applies to an entire country. If the merits of all its inhabitants exceed their sins, it is [termed] righteous. If their sins are greater, it is [termed] wicked. The same applies to the entire world.",
            "If a person's sins exceed his merits, he will immediately die because of his wickedness as [Jeremiah 30:14] states: \"[I have smitten you...] for the multitude of your transgressions.\"<br>Similarly, a country whose sins are great will immediately be obliterated as implied by [Genesis 18:20]: \"The outcry of Sodom and Amorah is great....<br>In regard to the entire world as well, were its [inhabitants'] sins to be greater than their merits, they would immediately be destroyed as [Genesis 6:5] relates: \"God saw the evil of man was great... [and God said: `I will destroy man....']\"<br>This reckoning is not calculated [only] on the basis of the number of merits and sins, but also [takes into account] their magnitude. There are some merits which outweigh many sins as implied by [I Kings 14:13]: \"Because in him, there was found a good quality.\" In contrast, a sin may outweigh many merits as [Ecclesiastes 9:18] states: \"One sin may obscure much good.\"<br>The weighing [of sins and merits] is carried out according to the wisdom of the Knowing God. He knows how to measure merits against sins.",
            "Anyone who changes his mind about the mitzvot he has performed and regrets the merits [he has earned], saying in his heart: \"What value was there in doing them? I wish I hadn't performed them\" - loses them all and no merit is preserved for him at all as [Ezekiel 33:12] states \"The righteousness of the upright will not save him on the day of his transgression.\" This only applies to one who regrets his previous [deeds].<br>Just as a person's merits and sins are weighed at the time of his death, so, too, the sins of every inhabitant of the world together with his merits are weighed on the festival of Rosh HaShanah. If one is found righteous, his [verdict] is sealed for life. If one is found wicked, his [verdict] is sealed for death. <i>A Beinoni's</i> verdict remains tentative until Yom Kippur. If he repents, his [verdict] is sealed for life. If not, his [verdict] is sealed for death.",
            "Even though the sounding of the shofar on Rosh HaShanah is a decree, it contains an allusion. It is as if [the shofar's call] is saying:<br>Wake up you sleepy ones from your sleep and you who slumber, arise. Inspect your deeds, repent, remember your Creator. Those who forget the truth in the vanities of time and throughout the entire year, devote their energies to vanity and emptiness which will not benefit or save: Look to your souls. Improve your ways and your deeds and let every one of you abandon his evil path and thoughts.<br>Accordingly, throughout the entire year, a person should always look at himself as equally balanced between merit and sin and the world as equally balanced between merit and sin. If he performs one sin, he tips his balance and that of the entire world to the side of guilt and brings destruction upon himself.<br>[On the other hand,] if he performs one mitzvah, he tips his balance and that of the entire world to the side of merit and brings deliverance and salvation to himself and others. This is implied by [Proverbs 10:25] \"A righteous man is the foundation of the world,\" i.e., he who acted righteously, tipped the balance of the entire world to merit and saved it.<br>For these reasons, it is customary for all of Israel to give profusely to charity, perform many good deeds, and be occupied with mitzvot from Rosh HaShanah until Yom Kippur to a greater extent than during the remainder of the year.<br>During these ten days, the custom is for everyone to rise [while it is still] night and pray in the synagogues with heart-rending words of supplication until daybreak.",
            "When a person's sins are being weighed against his merits, [God] does not count a sin that was committed only once or twice. [A sin] is only [counted] if it was committed three times or more.<br>Should it be found that [even] those sins committed more than three times outweigh a person's merits, the sins that were committed twice [or less] are also added and he is judged for all of his sins.<br>If his merits are equal to [or greater than the amount of] his sins committed which were committed more than three times, [God] forgives his sins one after the other, i.e., the third sin [is forgiven because] it is considered as a first sin, for the two previous sins were already forgiven. Similarly, after the third sin is forgiven, the fourth sin is considered as a \"first\" [sin and is forgiven according to the same principle].<br>The same [pattern is continued] until [all his sins] are concluded.<br>When does the above apply? In regard to an individual as can be inferred from [Job 33:29] \"All these things, God will do twice or three times with a man.\" However, in regard to a community, [retribution for] the first, second, and third sins is held in abeyance as implied by [Amos 2:6] \"For three sins of Israel, [I will withhold retribution,] but for the fourth, I will not withhold it.\" When a reckoning [of their merits and sins] is made according to the above pattern, the reckoning begins with the fourth [sin].<br>[As mentioned above,] <i>a Beinoni</i> [is one whose scale is equally balanced between merit and sin]. However, if among his sins is [the<br>neglect of the mitzvah of] <i>tefillin</i> [to the extent that] he never wore them even once, he is judged according to his sins. He will, nevertheless, be granted a portion in the world to come.<br>Similarly, all the wicked whose sins are greater [than their merits] are judged according to their sins, but they are granted a portion in the world to come for all Israel have a share in the world to come as [Isaiah 60:21] states \"Your people are all righteous, they shall inherit the land forever.\" \"The land\" is an analogy alluding to \"the land of life,\" i.e., the world to come. Similarly, the \"pious of the nations of the world\" have a portion in the world to come.",
            "The following individuals do not have a portion in the world to come. Rather, their [souls] are cut off and they are judged for their great wickedness and sins, forever:<br>the <i>Minim,</i><br>the <i>Epicursim,</i><br>those who deny the Torah,<br>those who deny the resurrection of the dead and the coming of the [Messianic] redeemer,<br>those who rebel [against God],<br>those who cause the many to sin,<br>those who separate themselves from the community,<br>those who proudly commit sins in public as Jehoyakim did,<br>those who betray Jews to gentile authorities,<br>those who cast fear upon the people for reasons other than the service of God,<br>murderers,<br>slanderers,<br>one who extends his foreskin [so as not to appear circumcised].",
            "Five individuals are described as <i>Minim:</i><br>a) one who says there is no God nor ruler of the world;<br>b) one who accepts the concept of a ruler, but maintains that there are two or more;<br>c) one who accepts that there is one Master [of the world], but maintains that He has a body or form;<br>d) one who maintains that He was not the sole First Being and Creator of all existence;<br>e) one who serves a star, constellation, or other entity so that it will serve as an intermediary between him and the eternal Lord.<br>Each of these five individuals is a <i>Min.</i>",
            "Three individuals are described as <i>Epicursim:</i><br>a) one who denies the existence of prophecy and maintains that there is no knowledge communicated from God to the hearts of men;<br>b) one who disputes the prophecy of Moses, our teacher;<sup>'</sup><br>c) one who maintains that the Creator is not aware of the deeds of men.<br>Each of these three individuals is an <i>Epicurus.</i><br>There are three individuals who are considered as one \"who denies the Torah\":<br>a) one who says Torah, even one verse or one word, is not from God.

            "Among Israel, there are two categories of apostates: an apostate in regard to a single mitzvah and an apostate in regard to the entire Torah.<br>An apostate in regard to a single mitzvah is someone who has made a practice of willfully committing a particular sin [to the point where] he is accustomed to committing it and his deeds are public knowledge. [This applies] even though [the sin] is one of the minor ones. For example, someone who has made a practice of constantly wearing <i>sha'atnez</i> or cutting off his sideburns so that it appears that, in regard to him, it is as if this mitzvah has been nullified entirely. Such a person is considered an apostate in regard to that matter. This applies [only] if he [commits the sin] with the intent of angering God.<br>An example of an apostate in regard to the entire Torah is one who turn to the faith of the gentiles when they enact [harsh] decrees [against the Jews] and clings to them, saying: \"What value do I have in clinging to Israel while they are debased and pursued. It's better to cling to those who have the upper hand.\" Such an individual is an apostate in regard to the entire Torah.",
            "[The category of] \"those who cause the many to sin\" includes those who cause them to commit a severe sin like Jeroboam, Tzadok, or Beitus; and also, those who cause them to commit a slight sin, even the nullification of a positive command.<br>It includes [both] those who force others to sin like Menasheh who would kill the Jews if they did not worship idols and those who entice others and lead them astray.",
            "A person who separates himself from the community [may be placed in this category] even though he has not transgressed any sins. A person who separates himself from the congregation of Israel and does not fulfill mitzvot together with them, does not take part in their hardships, or join in their [communal] fasts, but rather goes on his own individual path as if he is from another nation and not [Israel], does not have a portion in the world to come.<br>\"Those who proudly commit sins in public as Jehoyakim did,\" whether they commit slight sins or severe ones, have no portion in the world to come. Such behavior is referred to as \"acting brazen-facedly against the Torah,\" for he acted insolently, in open [defiance], without feeling any shame despite the Torah's words.",
            "There are two categories of \"those who betray Jews to gentiles:\" one who betrays a colleague to the gentiles so that they may kill him or beat him; and one who gives over a colleague's money to gentiles or to a person who commandeers property and is, therefore, considered like a gentile.<br>Neither of the two has a portion in the world to come.",
            "\"Those who cast fear upon the people for reasons other than the service of God\" - This refers to one who rules the community with a strong hand and [causes] them to revere and fear him. His intent is only for his own honor and none of his desires are for God's honor; for example, the gentile kings.",
            "All the twenty four individuals listed above will not receive a portion in the world to come even though they are Jewish.<br>There are other sins which are less severe than those mentioned. Nevertheless, our Sages said that a person who frequently commits them will not receive a portion in the world to come and [counseled] that these [sins] be avoided and care be taken in regard to them. They are:<br>one who invents a [disparaging] nickname for a colleague; one who calls a colleague by a [disparaging] nickname;<br>one who embarrasses a colleague in public;<br>one who takes pride in his colleague's shame;<br>one who disgraces Torah Sages;<br>one who disgraces his teachers;<br>one who degrades the festivals; and<br>one who profanes sacred things.<br>When does the statement that these individuals do not have a portion in the world to come apply? When they die without having repented. However, if such a person repents from his wicked deeds and dies as a Baal-Teshuvah, he will merit the world to come, for nothing can stand in the way of Teshuvah.<br>Even if he denies God's existence throughout his life and repents in his final moments, he merits a portion in the world to come as implied by [Isaiah 57:19] \"`Peace, peace, to the distant and the near,' declares God. `I will heal him.'\"<br>Any wicked person, apostate, or the like, who repents, whether in an open, revealed manner or in private, will be accepted as implied by [Jeremiah 3:22] \"Return, faithless children.\" [We may infer] that even if one is still faithless, as obvious from the fact that he repents in private and not in public, his Teshuvah will be accepted."

            "There are 24 deeds which hold back Teshuvah: Four are the commission of severe sins. God will not grant the person who commits such deeds to repent because of the gravity of his transgressions.<br>They are:<br>a) One who causes the masses to sin, included in this category is one who holds back the many from performing a positive command;<br>b) One who leads his colleague astray from the path of good to that of bad; for example, one who proselytizes or serves as a missionary [for idol worship];<br>c) One who sees his son becoming associated with evil influences and refrains from rebuking him. Since his son is under his authority, were he to rebuke him, he would have separated himself [from these influences]. Hence, [by refraining from admonishing him, it is considered] as if he caused him to sin.<br>Included in this sin are also all those who have the potential to rebuke others, whether an individual or a group, and refrain from doing so, leaving them to their shortcomings.<br>d) One who says: \"I will sin and then, repent.\" Included in this category is one who says: \"I will sin and Yom Kippur will atone [for me].\"",
            "Among [the 24] are five deeds which cause the paths of Teshuvah to be locked before those who commit them. They are:<br>a) One who separates himself from the community; when they repent, he will not be together with them and he will not merit to share in their merit.<br>b) One who contradicts the words of the Sages; the controversy he provokes will cause him to cut himself off from them and, thus, he will never know the ways of repentance.<br>c) One who scoffs at the mitzvoth; since he considers them as degrading, he will not pursue them or fulfill them. If he does not fulfill mitzvot, how can he merit [to repent]?<br>d) One who demeans his teachers; this will cause them to reject and dismiss him as [Elishah did to] Gechazi. In this period of rejection, he will not find a teacher or guide to show him the path of truth.<br>e) One who hates admonishment; this will not leave him a path for repentance. Admonishment leads to Teshuvah. When a person is informed about his sins and shamed because of them, he will repent. Accordingly, [rebukes are] included in the Torah, [for example]:<br>”Remember, do not forget, that you provoked [God, your Lord, in the desert. From the day you left Egypt until here,] you have been rebelling....”(Deuteronomy 9:7 .<br>”[Until this day,] God did not give you a heart to know....” (Deuteronomy 29:3 .<br>”[Is this the way you repay God,] you ungrateful, unwise nation” (Deuteronomy 2:6 .<br>Similarly, Isaiah rebuked Israel, declaring: “Woe, sinful nation, [people laden with iniquity...]” (Isaiah 1:4 ,<br>”The ox knows its owner, [and the ass, his master's crib. Israel does not know...]” (<i>ibid.</i>: 1:3),<br>I know you are obstinate...

Therefore, it is proper for each and every congregation in Israel to appoint a great sage of venerable age, with [a reputation of] fear of heaven from his youth, beloved by the community, to admonish the masses and motivate them to Teshuvah.<br>This person who hates admonishment will not come to the preacher's [lecture] or hear his words. Accordingly, he will continue his sinful [paths], which he regards as good.",
            "Among these [24] are five [transgressions] for which it is impossible for the person who commits them to repent completely. They are sins between man and man, concerning which it is impossible to know the person whom one sinned against in order to return [what is owed him] or ask for his forgiveness. They are:<br>a) One who curses the many without cursing a specific individual from whom he can request forgiveness;<br>b) One who takes a share of a thief's [gain], for he does not know to whom the stolen article belongs. The thief steals from many, brings him [his share], and he takes it. Furthermore, he reinforces the thief and causes him to sin;<br>c) One who finds a lost object and does not announce it [immediately] in order to return it to its owners. Afterwards, when he desires to repent, he will not know to whom to return the article;<br>d) One who eats an ox belonging to the poor, orphans, or widows. These are unfortunate people, who are not well-known or recognized by the public. They wander from city to city and thus, there is no one who can identify them and know to whom the ox belonged in order that it may be returned to him.<br>e) One who takes a bribe to pervert judgment. He does not know the extent of the perversion or the power [of its implications] in order to pay the [people whom he wronged], for his judgment had a basis. Furthermore, [by taking a bribe], he reinforces the person [who gave it] and causes him to sin.",
            "Also among the [24] are five [transgressions] for which it is unlikely that the person who commits them will repent. Most people regard these matters lightly. Hence, [by committing such a transgression,] a person will sin without realizing that he has. They are:<br>a) One who eats from a meal which is not sufficient for its owners. This is a \"shade of theft.\" However, the person who [partook from this meal] will not realize that he has sinned, for he will rationalize: \"I only ate with his permission.\"<br>b) One who makes use of a pledge taken from a poor person. The pledge taken from a poor person would be his axe or plow. He rationalizes: \"Their value will not depreciate and, hence, I haven't stolen anything from him.\"<br>c) One who looks at women forbidden to him. He considers the matter of little consequence, rationalizing: \"Did I engage in relations with her? Was I intimate with her?\" He fails to realize how looking [at such sights] is a great sin, for it motivates a person to actually take part in illicit sexual relations as implied by [Numbers 15:39] \"Do not follow after your heart and your eyes.\"<br>d) One who takes pride in his colleague's shame. He tells himself that he has not sinned, for his colleague was not present. Thus, no shame came [directly] to his colleague, nor did he humiliate him. He merely contrasted his good deeds and wisdom against the deeds or wisdom of his colleague in order that, out of that comparison, he would appear honorable, and his colleague, shameful.<br>e) One who suspects worthy people. He will also say to himself \"I haven't sinned,\" for he will rationalize: \"What have I done to him? All I did was raise a doubt whether he committed the wrong or not.\" He does not realize that this is a sin, for he has considered a worthy person as a transgressor.",

Therefore, a person should be very careful lest he become attached to them, for they are very bad attributes. They are:<br>a) gossip;<br>b) slander;<br>c) quick-temperedness;<br>d) a person preoccupied with sinister thoughts;<br>e) a person who becomes friendly with a wicked person, for he learns from his deeds and they are imprinted on his heart.

This surely holds true for a Baal-Teshuvah.",

            "Free will is granted to all men. If one desires to turn himself to the path of good and be righteous, the choice is his. Should he desire to turn to the path of evil and be wicked, the choice is his.<br>This is [the intent of] the Torah's statement (Genesis 3:22 : \"Behold, man has become unique as ourselves, knowing good and evil,\" i.e., the human species became singular in the world with no other species resembling it in the following quality: that man can, on his own initiative, with his knowledge and thought, know good and evil, and do what he desires. There is no one who can prevent him from doing good or bad. Accordingly, [there was a need to drive him from the Garden of Eden,] \"lest he stretch out his hand [and take from the tree of life].\"",
            "A person should not entertain the thesis held by the fools among the gentiles and the majority of the undeveloped among Israel that, at the time of a man's creation, The Holy One, blessed be He, decrees whether he will be righteous or wicked.<br>This is untrue. Each person is fit to be righteous like Moses, our teacher, or wicked, like Jeroboam. [Similarly,] he may be wise or foolish, merciful or cruel, miserly or generous, or [acquire] any other character traits. There is no one who compels him, sentences him, or leads him towards either of these two paths. Rather, he, on his own initiative and decision, tends to the path he chooses.<br>This was [implied by the prophet,] Jeremiah who stated [Eichah 3:38: \"From the mouth of the Most High, neither evil or good come forth.\" The Creator does not decree that a person should be good and refrain from being evil. Accordingly, it is the sinner, himself, who causes his own loss.<br>Therefore, it is proper for a person to cry and mourn for his sins and for what he has done to his soul, the evil consequences, he brought upon it. This is implied by the following verse [<i>ibid.</i>:39]: \"Of what should a living man be aggrieved? [A man of his sins.]\"<br>[The prophet] continues explaining, since free choice is in our hands and our own decision [is what prompts us to] commit all these wrongs, it is proper for us to repent and abandon our wickedness, for this choice is presently in our hand. This is implied by the following verse [<i>ibid.</i>:40]: \"Let us search and examine our ways and return [to God].\"",
            "This principle is a fundamental concept and a pillar [on which rests the totality] of the Torah and mitzvot as [Deuteronomy 30:15] states: \"Behold, I have set before you today life [and good, death and evil].\" Similarly, [Deuteronomy 11:26] states, \"Behold, I have set before you today [the blessing and the curse],\" implying that the choice is in your hands.<br>Any one of the deeds of men which a person desires to do, he may, whether good or evil. Therefore, [Deuteronomy 5:26] states:<br>\"If only their hearts would always remain this way.\" From this, we can infer that the Creator does not compel or decree that people should do either good or bad. Rather, everything is left to their [own choice].",
            "Were God to decree that an individual would be righteous or wicked or that there would be a quality which draws a person by his essential nature to any particular path [of behavior], way of thinking, attributes, or deeds, as imagined by many of the fools [who believe] in astrology - how could He command us through [the words of] the prophets: \"Do this,\" \"Do not do this,\" \"Improve your behavior,\" or \"Do not follow after your wickedness?\"<br>[According to their mistaken conception,] from the beginning of man's creation, it would be decreed upon him, or his nature would draw him, to a particular quality and he could not depart from it.<br>What place would there be for the entire Torah? According to which judgement or sense of justice would retribution be administered to the wicked or reward to the righteous? Shall the whole world's Judge not act justly!<br>A person should not wonder: How is it possible for one to do whatever he wants and be responsible for his own deeds? - Is it possible for anything to happen in this world without the permission and desire of its Creator as [Psalms 135:6] states: \"Whatever God wishes, He has done in the heavens and in the earth?\"<br>One must know that everything is done in accord with His will and, nevertheless, we are responsible for our deeds.<br>How is this [apparent contradiction] resolved? Just as the Creator desired that [the elements of] fire and wind rise upward and [those of] water and earth descend downward, that the heavenly spheres revolve in a circular orbit, and all the other creations of the world follow the nature which He desired for them, so too, He desired that man have free choice and be responsible for his deeds, without being pulled or forced. Rather, he, on his own initiative, with the knowledge which God has granted him, will do anything that man is able to do.<br>Therefore, he is judged according to his deeds. If he does good, he is treated with beneficence. If he does bad, he is treated harshly. This is implied by the prophets' statements: \"This has been the doing of your hands” [Malachi 1:9]; \"They also have chosen their own paths” [Isaiah 66:3].<br>This concept was also implied by Solomon in his statement [Ecclesiastes 11:9]: \"Young man, rejoice in your youth... but, know that for all these things God will bring you to judgment,\" i.e., know that you have the potential to do, but in the future, you will have to account for your deeds.",

However, if one would say that despite His knowledge that he would be righteous, it is possible for him to be wicked, then His knowledge would be incomplete.<br>Know that the resolution to this question [can be described as]: \"Its measure is longer than the earth and broader than the sea.\" Many great and fundamental principles and lofty concepts are dependent upon it. However, the statements that I will make must be known and understood [as a basis for the comprehension of this matter].<br>As explained in the second chapter of <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah,</i> The Holy One, blessed be He, does not know with a knowledge that is external from Him as do men, whose knowledge and selves are two [different entities]. Rather, He, may His name be praised, and His knowledge are one.<br>Human knowledge cannot comprehend this concept in its entirety for just as it is beyond the potential of man to comprehend and conceive the essential nature of the Creator, as [Exodus 33:20] states: \"No man will perceive, Me and live,\" so, too, it is beyond man's potential to comprehend and conceive the Creator's knowledge. This was the intent of the prophet's [Isaiah 55:8] statements: \"For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor your ways, My ways.\"<br>Accordingly, we do not have the potential to conceive how The Holy One, blessed be He, knows all the creations and their deeds. However, this is known without any doubt: That man's actions are in his [own] hands and The Holy One, blessed be He, does not lead him [in a particular direction] or decree that he do anything.<br>This matter is known, not only as a tradition of faith, but also, through clear proofs from the words of wisdom. Consequently, the prophets taught that a person is judged for his deeds, according to his deeds - whether good or bad. This is a fundamental principle on which is dependent all the words of prophecy."

        [
            "There are many verses in the Torah and the words of the prophets which appear to contradict this fundamental principle. [Thus,] the majorities of the people err because of them and think that the Holy One, blessed be He, does decree that a person commit evil or good and that a person's heart is not given over to him to direct it towards any path he desires.<br>Behold, I will explain a great and fundamental principle [of faith] on the basis of which the interpretation of those verses can be understood. [As a preface,] when an individual or the people of a country sin, the sinner consciously and willfully committing that sin, it is proper to exact retribution from him as explained. The Holy One, blessed be He, knows how to exact punishment: There are certain sins for which justice determines that retribution be exacted in this world; on the sinner's person, on his possessions, or on his small children.<br>[Retribution is exacted upon a person's] small children who do not possess intellectual maturity and have not reached the age where they are obligated to perform mitzvot [because these children] are considered as his property. [This concept is alluded to] by the verse [Deuteronomy 24:16]: \"A man will die because of his own sins.\" [We may infer: This rule only applies] after one has become \"a man.<sup>\"</sup><br>There are other sins for which justice determines that retribution be exacted in the world to come with no damages coming to the transgressor in this world. There are [other] sins for which retribution is taken in this world and in the world to come.",
            "When does the above apply? When [the transgressor] does not repent. However, if he repents, his Teshuvah is a shield against retribution. Just as a person may sin consciously and willfully, he may repent consciously and willfully.",
            "A person may commit a great sin or many sins causing the judgment rendered before the True Judge to be that the retribution [administered to] this transgressor for these sins which he willfully and consciously committed is that his Teshuvah will be held back. He will not be allowed the chance to repent from his wickedness so that he will die and be wiped out because of the sin he committed.<br>This is implied by the Holy One, blessed be He's statement [related] by Isaiah [6:10]: “Make the heart of this people fat [and make their ears heavy. Smear over their eyes, lest they see with their eyes... understand with their hearts, repent and be healed].”<br>Similarly, [II Chronicles 36:16] states “ They mocked the messengers of God, scorned His words, scoffed at His prophets until the anger of God mounted up against His people until there was no remedy.”<br>Implied [by these verses] is that they willingly sinned, multiplying their iniquity until it was obliged to hold back their Teshuvah, [which is referred to as] the \"remedy.\"<br>For these reasons, it is written in the Torah [Exodus 4:21], \"I will harden Pharaoh's heart.\" Since, he began to sin on his own initiative and caused hardships to the Israelites who dwelled in his land as [Exodus 1:10] states: \"Come, let us deal wisely with them,\" judgment obligated that he be prevented from repenting so that he would suffer retribution. Therefore, The Holy One, blessed be He, hardened his heart.<br>Why did [God] send Moses to [Pharaoh], telling him: “Send [forth the people], repent”? The Holy One, blessed be He, had already told Moses that he would not release [the people], as [Exodus 9:30] states: “I realize that you and your subjects [still do not fear God].”<br>[The reason is stated in Exodus 9:16:] “For this alone, I have preserved you… so that My name will be spoken about throughout the earth],” i.e., to make known to all the inhabitants of the world that when the Holy One, blessed be He, withholds repentance from a sinner, he cannot repent, but he will die in the wickedness that he initially committed willfully.<br>Similarly, Sichon was held liable for repentance to be withheld from him, because of the sins he committed, as [Deuteronomy 2:30] states: “God, your Lord, hardened his spirit and strengthened his heart.”<br>Also, the Canaanites held back from repenting, because of their abominable acts, so that they would wage war against Israel as [Joshua 11:20] states: \"This was inspired by God, to harden their hearts so that they should come against Israel in battle in order to utterly destroy them.\"<br>Similarly, the Israelites during the era of Elijah committed many iniquities. Repentance was held back from those who committed these many sins, as [I Kings 18:37] states: \"You have turned their heart backwards,\" i.e., held repentance back from them.<br>In conclusion, the Almighty did not decree that Pharaoh should harm the Israelites that Sichon should sin in his land, that the Canaanites should perform abominable acts, or that the Israelites should worship idols. They all sinned on their own initiative and they were obligated to have Teshuvah held back from them.",
            "This is what is implied in the requests of the righteous and the prophets in their prayers, [asking] God to help them on the path of truth, as David pleaded [Psalms 86:11]: \"God, show me Your way that I may walk in Your truth;\" i.e., do not let my sins prevent me from [reaching] the path of truth which will lead me to appreciate Your way and the oneness of Your name.<br>A similar intent [is conveyed] by the request [Psalms 51:14]: \"Support me with a spirit of magnanimity;\" i.e., let my spirit [be willing] to do Your will and do not cause my sins to prevent me from repenting. Rather, let the choice remain in my hand until I repent and comprehend and appreciate the path of truth. In a similar way, [one must interpret] all the [verses] which resemble these.",

He guides the humble [in the path of justice and] teaches the humble His way]\"? That He sends them prophets to inform them of the path of God and to encourage them to repent.<br>Furthermore, it implies that He granted them the power to learn and to understand. This attribute is present in all men: As long as a person follows the ways of wisdom and righteousness, he will desire them and pursue them. This [may be inferred from] the statement of our Sages of blessed memory: \"One who comes to purify [himself] is helped;\" i.e., he finds himself assisted in this matter.<br>[A question may still arise, for] behold, it is written in the Torah [Genesis 15:13]: \"They shall enslave them and oppress them,\" [seemingly implying that] He decreed that the Egyptians would commit evil.<br>Similarly, it is written [Deuteronomy 31:16]: \"And this nation will arise and stray after the alien gods of the land,\" [seemingly implying that] He decreed that Israel would serve idols. If so, why did He punish them?<br>Because He did not decree that a particular person would be the one who strayed. Rather, each and every one of those who strayed to idol-worship [could have chosen] not to serve idols if he did not desire to serve them. The Creator merely informed [Moses] of the pattern of the world.<br>To what can this be compared? To someone who says, there will be righteous and wicked people in this nation. [Thus,] a wicked person cannot say that because God told Moses that there will be wicked people in Israel, it is decreed that he will be wicked. A similar concept applies regarding the statement [Deuteronomy 15:11]: \"The poor will never cease to exist in the land.\"<br>Similarly, in regard to the Egyptians, each and every one of the Egyptians who caused hardship and difficulty for Israel had the choice to refrain from harming them, if he so desired, for there was no decree on a particular person. Rather, [God merely] informed [Abraham] that, in the future, his descendants would be enslaved in a land which did not belong to them.<br>We have already explained that it is beyond the potential of man to know how God knows what will be in the future."

            "How many metaphoric terms have been used to refer to [the world to come]! \"The mountain of God\" [Psalms 24:3], \"His holy place\" [<i>ibid.</i>], \"the holy path\" [Isaiah 35:8], \"the courtyards of God” [Psalms 65:5, 92:14], \"the pleasantness of God\" [<i>ibid.</i> 27:4], \"the tent of God\" [<i>ibid.</i> 15:1], \"the palace of God\" [<i>ibid.</i> 5:8], \"the house of God\" [<i>ibid.</i> 27:4], \"the gate of God\" [<i>ibid.</i> 118:20].<br>The Sages referred to this good which is prepared for the righteous with the metaphor: \"the feast.\" Generally, it is referred to with the term \"the world to come.\"",

All the synonyms for nullification and destruction are used to refer to it for it is the [ultimate] nullification after which there is no renewal and the [ultimate] loss which can never be recovered.",
            "Lest you think lightly of this good, [the world to come], imagining that the reward for the mitzvot and for a person [following] completely the paths of truth is for him to eat and drink good foods, have intercourse with beautiful forms, wear garments of linen and lace, dwell in ivory palaces, use utensils of gold and silver, or other similar ideas, as conceived by the foolish, decadent Arabs, who are flooded with lewdness.<br>In contrast, the sages and men of knowledge know that all these matters are vain and empty things, without any purpose. They are only considered of great benefit to us in this world because we possess a body and a physical form. All these matters are the needs of the body. The soul only desires them and lusts for them because of the needs of the body, so that its desires will be fulfilled and its health maintained. In a situation, where there is no body, all of these matters will be nullified.<br>There is no way in this world to grasp and comprehend the ultimate good which the soul will experience in the world to come.<br>We only know bodily good and that is what we desire. However, that [ultimate] good is overwhelmingly great and cannot be compared to the good of this world except in a metaphoric sense.<br>In truth, there is no way to compare the good of the soul in the world to come to the bodily goods of this world. Rather, that good is infinitely great, with no comparison or likeness. This is alluded to by David's statement [Psalms 31:20]: \"How great is the good that You have hidden for those who fear You.\"",
            "How very much did David desire the life of the world to come as implied by [Psalms 27:13]: \"Had I not believed that I would see the goodness of God in the land of the living!\"<br>The Sages of the previous generations have already informed us that man does not have the potential to appreciate the good of the world to come in a full sense nor can anyone know its greatness, beauty, and power except God, alone.<br>All the beneficence which the prophets promised Israel in their visions are only physical concerns which Israel will appreciate in the Messianic age when dominion [over the world] will return to Israel. However, the good of the life of the world to come has no comparison or likeness, nor was it described by the prophets, lest with such a description, they diminish it.<br>This [was implied] by [Isaiah's (64:3)] statement: \"No eye has ever seen, O God, except for You, what You will do for those who wait for You;\" i.e. the good which was not perceived by the vision of a prophet and is perceived by God alone, this was created by God for those who wait for Him.<br>The Sages declared: \"All the prophets only prophesied about the Messianic Age. However, regarding the world to come - `No eye has ever seen, O God, except for You.'",

Rather, [the world to come] exists and is present as implied by [Psalms 31:20: \"How great is the good] that You have hidden... which You have made....\" It is only called the world to come because that life comes to a man after life in this world in which we exist, as souls [enclothed] in bodies. This [realm of existence] is presented to all men at first."

            "[A question arises:] As explained, the reward for the mitzvot and the good which we will merit if we observe the path of God as prescribed by the Torah is the world to come as [Deuteronomy 2:7] states: \"So that good will be granted you and you will live long.”<br>[Also,] the retribution which is exacted from the wicked who abandon the paths of righteous prescribed by the Torah is <i>karet</i> as [Numbers 15:31] states: \"This soul shall surely be cut off. His sin shall remain upon him.\"<br>[If so,] what is the meaning of the [statements] made throughout the entire Torah: \"If you observe [the Torah's laws], you will acquire such and such;\" \"If you do not observe [the Torah's laws], such and such will happen to you?\" All [of the benefits and difficulties that are promised] are matters of this [material] world, for example, plenty and famine, war and peace, sovereignty [over other nations] or a humble [national standing], the settlement of the land or exile, success in one's deeds or loss and all the other points mentioned in the covenant.<br>[In resolution, it must be stated that] all those statements are true. They have been realized in the past and will be realized in the future. When we fulfill all the mitzvot in the Torah, we will acquire all the benefits of this world. [Conversely,] when we transgress them, the evils written [in the Torah] will occur.<br>Nevertheless, those benefits are not the ultimate reward for the mitzvot, nor are those evils the ultimate retribution to be exacted from someone who transgresses all the mitzvot.<br>Rather, the resolution of the matter is as follows: God gave us this Torah which is a tree of life. Whoever fulfills what is written within it and comprehends it with complete and proper knowledge will merit the life of the world to come. A person merits [a portion of the world to come] according to the magnitude of his deeds and the extent of his knowledge.<br>[In addition,] we are promised by the Torah that if we fulfill it with joy and good spirit and meditate on its wisdom at all times, [God] will remove all the' obstacles which prevent us from fulfilling it, for example, sickness, war, famine, and the like.<br>Similarly, He will grant us all the good which will reinforce our performance of the Torah, such as plenty, peace, an abundance of silver and gold in order that we not be involved throughout all our days in matters required by the body, but rather, will sit unburdened and [thus, have the opportunity to] study wisdom and perform mitzvot in order that we will merit the life of the world to come.<br>This [principle is expressed] by the Torah. After [Deuteronomy 6:11-12] promises us all the benefits of this world, it concludes [<i>ibid.</i>:25]: \"And charity will remain for us if we take care to perform [all these commandments].\"<br>Similarly, the Torah has informed us that if we consciously abandon the Torah and involve ourselves in the vanities of the time in a manner similar to that stated [by Deuteronomy 32:15]: \"Jeshurun became fat and rebelled,\" then, the True Judge will remove from all the benefits of this world which reinforce their rebellion those who abandoned [the Torah].<br>He will bring upon them all the evils which prevent them from acquiring [a portion in] the world to come so that they will be destroyed in their wickedness. This was implied by the Torah's statement [Deuteronomy 28:47-48]: \"Because you did not serve God, [your Lord, with happiness,]... you will serve your enemies whom God sends against you.\"<br>Thus, these blessings and curses can be interpreted as follows: If you serve God with happiness and observe His way, He will grant you these blessings and remove these curses from you in order that you may be free to gain wisdom from the Torah and involve yourselves in it so that you will merit the life of the world to come. \"Good will be granted you\" - in the world that is entirely good; \"and you will live long\" - in the world which is endlessly long, [the world to come].<br>Thus, you will merit two worlds, a good life in this world, which, in turn, will bring you to the life of the world to come. For if a person will not acquire wisdom in this world and he does not possess good deeds, with what will he merit [a portion in the world to come]? [Thus, Ecclesiastes 9:10] states: \"There is no work, no accounting, no knowledge, and no wisdom in the grave.\"<br>[Conversely,] if you have abandoned God and become obsessed with food, drink, lewdness, and the like, He will bring all these curses upon you and remove all blessing until you will conclude all your days in confusion and fear. You will not have a free heart or a complete body to fulfill the mitzvot in order that you forfeit the life of the world to come.<br>Thus, you will forfeit two worlds for when a person is occupied in this world with sickness, war, and hunger, he cannot involve himself with either wisdom or mitzvot which allow him to merit the life of the world to come.",
            "For these reasons, all Israel, [in particular,] their prophets and their Sages, have yearned for the Messianic age so they can rest from the [oppression of] the gentile kingdoms who do not allow them to occupy themselves with Torah and mitzvot properly. They will find rest and increase their knowledge in order to merit the world to come.<br>In that era, knowledge, wisdom, and truth will become abundant. [Isaiah 11:9] states, \"The earth will be full of the knowledge of God.\" [Jeremiah 31:33] states: \"One man will no longer teach his brother, nor a man his colleague... [for all will know Me].\" And [Ezekiel 36:26] states: \"I will take away the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.\"<br>[These changes will come about] because the king who will arise from David's descendants will be a greater master of knowledge than Solomon and a great prophet, close to the level of Moses, our teacher. Therefore, he will teach the entire nation and instruct them in the path of God.<br>All the gentile nations will come to hear him as [Isaiah 2:2] states: \"And it shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of God's house shall be established at the peak of the mountains... [and all the nations shall flow to it].\"<br>[Nevertheless,] the ultimate of all reward and the final good which will have no end or decrease is the life of the world to come. In contrast, the Messianic age will be [life within the context of] this world, with the world following its natural pattern except that sovereignty will return to Israel.<br>The Sages of the previous generations have already declared: \"There is no difference between the present age and the Messianic era except [the emancipation] from our subjugation to the [gentile] kingdoms.\""

It is the level of our Patriarch, Abraham, whom God described as, \"he who loved Me,\" for his service was only motivated by love.<br>God commanded us [to seek] this rung [of service] as conveyed by Moses as [Deuteronomy 6:5] states: \"Love God, your Lord.''

He is always obsessed with her; when he sits down, when he gets up, when he eats and drinks. With an even greater [love], the love for God should be [implanted] in the hearts of those who love Him and are obsessed with Him at all times as we are commanded [Deuteronomy 6:5: \"Love God...] with all your heart and with all soul.\"<br>This concept was implied by Solomon [Song of Songs 2:5] when he stated, as a metaphor: \"I am lovesick.\" [Indeed,] the totality of the Song of Songs is a parable describing [this love].",

            "Anyone who occupies himself with the Torah in order to receive reward or in order to protect himself from retribution is considered as one who is not occupied for the God's sake.<br>[In contrast,] anyone who occupies himself with it, not because of fear, nor to receive a reward, but rather because of his love for the Lord of the entire earth who commanded it, is one who occupies himself for God's sake.<br>Nevertheless, our Sages declared: A person should always occupy himself with the Torah even when it is not for God's sake for out of [service which is not intended] for God's sake will come service that is intended for God's sake.<br>Therefore, when one teaches children, women, and most of the common people, one should teach them to serve out of fear and in order to receive a reward.
