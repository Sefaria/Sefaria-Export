            "If a person has transgressed any one of the Torah precepts, affirmative or negative, willfully or unintentionally, he must confess before God, blessed be he, when repenting and turning away from his sin; for it is written: \"If a man or woman commits any of the sins into which men fall … they must confess their sinful act\" (Numbers 5:6-7); this means verbal confession.— — How does one confess? He says: \"O Lord, I have sinned, I have done evil, I have rebelled against thee and have done this… I regret now and am ashamed of my acts; I will never do it again.\" This represents the essential part of confession. The more anyone confesses the more praise he deserves. Similarly, those who have to bring sin-offerings, or guilt-offerings, are not forgiven through those offerings for sins committed unintentionally or willfully unless they repent and confess, as it is written: \"He must confess the sin he has committed\" (Leviticus 5:5). So too, those sentenced to death by the court and those sentenced to lashes are not forgiven through death or lashes unless they repent and confess. Furthermore, one who has injured a person or damaged his property, even though he pays what he owes him, is not pardoned unless he confesses and resolves never to commit such an offense again, as it is written: \"If a man or woman commits any of the sins…\" (Numbers 5:6).",
            "",
            "At this time, when the Temple no longer exists, and we have no atonement altar, there is nothing left but repentance. Repentance atones for all transgressions. Even if a man was wicked throughout his life and repented at the end, we must not mention anything about his wickedness to him, as it is written: \"A wicked man's wickedness shall not bring about his downfall when he gives up his wickedness\" (Ezekiel 33:12). <i>Yom Kippur</i> itself atones for those who repent, as it is written: \"Atonement shall be made for you on this day\" (Leviticus 16:30)."
        ],
        [
            "Perfect repentance is where an opportunity presents itself to the offender for repeating the offense and he refrains from committing it because of his repentance and not out of fear or physical inability.— — If, however, one repents only in his old age, when he is no longer able to do what he used to do, his repentance, though not the best, will nevertheless do him some good. Even if a person transgressed all his life and repented on the day of his death and died during his repentance, all his sins are pardoned, as it is written: \"Before the sun grows dark, and the light goes from moon and stars, and the clouds gather after rain\" (Ecclesiastes 12:2), that is, the day of death. This implies that if he remembers his Creator and repents before death, he is forgiven.",

Even though he has made the compensation, the wrongdoer must appease the injured person and ask his pardon. Even if he only annoyed him with words he must apologize and beg his forgiveness.— —",
            "One must not show himself cruel by not accepting an apology; he should be easily pacified, and provoked with difficulty. When an offender asks his forgiveness, he should forgive wholeheartedly and with a willing spirit. Even if he has caused him much trouble wrongfully, he must not avenge himself, he must not bear a grudge. This is the way of the stock of Israel and their upright hearts.— — Concerning the Gibeonites who refused to forgive and be appeased, it is written: \"The Gibeonites did not belong to the people of Israel\" (II Samuel 21:2)."

            "Every human being has virtues and sins. One whose merits exceed his sins is a good man; one whose sins exceed his merits is an evil man. If they are fifty-fifty in a person, he is intermediate [between the good and the bad]. So it is with a city. If the merits of all its citizens exceed their iniquities, it is good; if their iniquities exceed their merits, it is bad. And so it is with the entire world.",

            "Anyone who has regretted his good deeds and merits, saying to himself: \"What have I accomplished by practising them? I wish I had not performed them,\" has forfeited all of them, and none of his merits is recalled in his favor, as it is written: \"A good man's goodness shall not save him on the day of his rebellion\" (Ezekiel 33:12)—this verse refers to one who is sorry for his good deeds in the past. Just as a man's good and bad deeds are balanced when he is dying, so are the good and bad deeds of all individuals weighed annually during the festival of <i>Rosh Hashanah:</i> whoever is found innocent is marked for life; whoever is found guilty is marked for death; the intermediate individual [neither very good nor very bad] is held in suspense till <i>Yom Kippur</i>. If he repents he is marked for life; if not, he is marked for death.",
            "Even though the sounding of the <i>shofar</i> on <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> is a biblical decree, it has an intimation, as if to say: \"Arise from your slumber, you who are asleep; wake up from your deep sleep, you who are fast asleep; search your deeds and repent; remember your Creator. Those of you who forget the truth because of passing vanities, indulging throughout the year in the useless things that cannot profit you nor save you, look into your souls, amend your ways and deeds. Let everyone give up his evil way and his bad purpose.\" Everybody should, therefore, regard himself throughout the year as half innocent and half guilty; so too, he should consider the entire world as half innocent and half guilty. If then he commits one additional sin he presses down the scale of guilt against himself and the entire world, and causes his destruction; if, on the other hand, he performs a good deed he presses down the scale of merit in his favor and that of the entire world, and causes salvation and deliverance to reach him and his fellow men, as it is written: \"The just man is the foundation of the world\" (Proverbs 10:25); that is, he who acts justly presses down the scale of merit in favor of the world and saves it. For this reason, the whole house of Israel has formed a custom to engage in the performance of charity and good deeds between <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> and <i>Yom Kippur</i> to a much larger extent than during the entire year. Besides, during these ten days, they are all accustomed to rise in the night and to pray and supplicate in the synagogue until daylight.",

Offenders of this type are: 1) he who leads the people to sin; this includes one who prevents them from doing a good deed; 2) he who diverts another from the good to the evil, such as a seducer or enticer; 3) he who sees that his son is falling into bad ways and does not stop him; being under his control, the son would desist if checked by the father; hence, it is as if he actually led him to sin;— — 4) he who says: \"I will sin and then repent.\" This includes one who says: \"I will sin and <i>Yom Kippur</i> will atone.\"",
            "Five of the twenty-four misdeeds shut the ways of repentance to those who commit them. They are: 1) he who stands aloof from the community; since he is not among them when they repent, he does not share the merit they attain; 2) he who opposes the rulings of the sages; since his opposition induces him to stand away from them, he remains ignorant of the ways of repentance; 3) he who makes a mockery of the divine precepts; since they are held in contempt by him, he does not eagerly obey them, and if he does not obey how can he attain merit? 4) he who insults his teachers;— — 5) he who hates rebukes, because he leaves himself no way of repentance; for it is reproof that induces repentance.— — All the prophets rebuked Israel until they repented. It is therefore necessary to engage in every Jewish community a great elderly scholar, God-fearing from his youth and well-liked by the people, to preach to them and lead them to repentance. But he who hates reproof does not come to listen to the preacher; hence he persists in his faults which seem good to him.",
            "Five of the twenty-four misdeeds are of such nature that anyone who commits them cannot attain complete repentance, because they are sins against a fellow man without knowing who it is in order to compensate him and ask his pardon. Offenders of this category are: 1) he who curses the people and not an individual, of whom he might ask to forgive him; 2) he who shares with a thief;— — 3) he who finds lost property and does not announce it, that he may restore it to its owner; when he repents after some time, he does not know to whom he should restore it; 4) he who despoils the poor, orphans and widows; these people are wretched and not well known, they migrate from town to town and have no acquaintance, whereby to ascertain how to refund what he has robbed; 5) he who takes bribes to tamper with justice,— — thus encouraging the bribing litigant and leading him to sin.",
            "Five of the twenty-four offenses are such that the person who commits them is not likely to repent, because they are regarded by most people as trivial, with the result that the sinner imagines that it is no sin. Offenders of this class are: 1) he who shares a meal that is insufficient for its owner; since this is a tinge of robbery, he imagines that he has not done any wrong, saying: \"I did not eat without his consent\"; 2) he who makes use of a poor man's pledge; since a poor man's pledge happens to be only an axe or a plow, and the user says to himself: \"The articles have not depreciated, and I have not robbed him\"; 3) he who gazes at women lustfully supposes that there is nothing wrong in it,— — and does not realize that the lustful look is a grave sin, as it is written: \"You shall not follow the desires of your heart and your eyes\" (Numbers 15:39); 4) he who elevates himself at the expense of another's degradation thinks to himself that this is no sin, since the other person is absent and has not endured shame; nor has he actually shamed him by comparing his own good deeds and wisdom with the other man's deeds or wisdom, implying that he is honorable while the other is contemptible; 5) he who suspects honest men says to himself that it is no sin. \"What have I done to him?\" he says; \"is there anything more in it than a mere suspicion that maybe he has done it and maybe not?\" He does not realize that it is sinful to regard a worthy person as a transgressor.",
            "Five of the twenty-four misdeeds are such that anyone who commits them will always be attracted to them, and they are hard to be given up. One should therefore be careful lest he become addicted to them, for they are all extremely obnoxious traits. Here they are: gossip, slander, wrath, evil thought, keeping bad company.— — In the rules concerning ethical behavior we have explained the traits that all men should ever cultivate, and so much the more one who repents.",
            "All these and similar misdeeds do not prevent repentance, even though they hinder it. If a person is sincerely remorseful over them and repents, he is a repentant indeed and has a share in the world to come."

            "Free will is granted to every human being.

It is written: \"Indeed, man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil\" (Genesis 3:22). That is to say, the human species is unique in the world, there being no other species like it in this respect, namely that man by himself, using his own intelligence and reason, knows what is good and what is evil, without anyone preventing him from doing good or evil as he pleases; in view of this, \"he will perhaps put forth his hand and take also from the tree of life…\"",

This is what Jeremiah means when he says: \"It is not from the mouth of the Most High that good and evil comes\" (Lamentations 3:38); that is to say, the Creator does not decree that a man shall be either good or evil.
