It is, however, the father's duty to teach his young son Torah, as it is written: \"You shall teach them to your children, speaking of them\" (Deuteronomy 11:19). A woman is under no obligation to teach her son, since the duty of teaching applies only to one whose duty it is to learn.",
            "Just as it is a man's duty to teach his son, so it is his duty to teach his grandson, as it is written: \"Make them known to your children and your children's children\" (4:9). This obligation does not refer only to one's son and grandson, but it is a duty resting upon every Jewish scholar to teach all those who seek to be his students, even though they are not hisown children, for it is written: \"You shall teach them diligently to your children\" (6:7). On traditional authority, the term \"your children\" in this verse has been interpreted to mean <i>your pupils</i>, since pupils are likewise called <i>children</i>, for it is written: \"And the sons of the prophets came out\" (II Kings 2:3). But if so, why then has a man's duty been specifically stated in the Torah with regard to his own son and grandson? To indicate that his son has priority over his grandson, and his grandson over the son of another person.",

As soon as the child begins to talk, he should teach him the biblical verses: \"The Torah which Moses handed down to us\" (Deuteronomy 33:4) and \"Hear, O Israel\" (6:4). Later on, he should teach him gradually more and more verses at a time, till he reaches the age of six or seven; it all depends on the health condition of the child; he should then take him to a teacher of young children.",
            "If it is the custom of the country for a children's teacher to receive a fee, the father should pay the fee. He is under an obligation to teach his son even when he has to pay for his tuition till he has learned to read the entire written Torah. Where it is customary to charge a fee for teaching the written Torah, it is permissible to charge a fee for such instruction. It is forbidden, however, to teach the Oral Torah for payment, for it is written: \"Behold, I have taught you laws and rules as the Lord my God has commanded me\" (4:5). Moses, in other words, said: \"Just as I received instruction from God freely, you have received instruction from me freely. And you, too, when teaching in future generations, give instruction freely, as you have learned from me.\" If, however, he cannot find someone to teach him freely, he should get instruction for a fee, as it is written: \"Buy truth\" (Proverbs 23:23). One might suppose that he, in turn, will be permitted to teach others for a fee, but the same biblical text adds: \"Do not sell it.\" Hence you infer that he is not permitted to teach for a fee even though his teacher taught <i>him</i> for a fee.",

Aaron acquired the crown of priesthood, as it is written: \"It shall be to him, and to his descendants after him, the covenant of a perpetual priesthood\" (Numbers 25:13). David acquired the crown of royalty, as it is written: \"His line shall endure forever, his throne lasting like the sun before me\" (Psalm 89:37).

This means to say that just as water does not accumulate on a slope but flows away and gathers in a pond, so the words of the Torah are not to be found in the arrogant and the haughty but only in one who is contrite and humble, who sits at the feet of the wise in the dust and removes from his heart lusts and temporal pleasures, doing some work daily, enough to provide for his needs—if he would otherwise have nothing to eat—and devotes the rest of the day and night to the study of Torah.",
            "Anyone, however, who makes up his mind to study Torah and not work but live on charity profanes the name of God, disgraces the Torah, obscures the light of religion, causes harm to himself, and deprives himself of life in the future world; for it is forbidden to derive temporal advantage from the words of the Torah. The sages said: \"Whoever makes selfish use of the teachings of the Torah takes his own life.\" They further told us: \"Do not make of them a crown wherewith to magnify yourself, nor a spade wherewith to dig.\" They urged us strongly moreover: \"Love work, and hate arrogance. All Torah study which is not combined with some work must at length fail and occasion sin\" (Ethics of the Fathers). The end of such a person will be that he will rob his fellow men.",

For this reason, the early sages declared: \"The bashful cannot learn, nor can the quick-tempered teach\" (Ethics of the Fathers 2:5). This applies only to a case where the students have failed to understand a subject because of its depth or because of their limited capacity. If, however, the teacher is convinced that they are too lazy to study Torah, and that they have not grasped the subject on account of their indolence, he must show his anger, shaming them with words, in order to rouse them. With regard to this, the sages have declared: \"Rebuke and overawe the students.\" Accordingly, it is improper for a teacher to act frivolously in front of his pupils; he should not jest in their presence, nor eat and drink with them, so that they should revere him and learn from him speedily.",
