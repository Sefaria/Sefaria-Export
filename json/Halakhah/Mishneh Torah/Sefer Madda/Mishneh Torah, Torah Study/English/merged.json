            "Women, slaves, and infants are absolved from the study of the Torah; but the father is obliged to instruct his infant son in the Torah, for it is said: \"And ye shall teach them your children, talking of them\" (Deut. 11.19); but a woman is not charged to teach her son, for only one obliged to study is obliged to instruct.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sukkah, 42a; Kiddushin, 29; Ketubot, 28. G. C.</i>",
            "Even as man is obliged to instruct his son, so is he obliged to teach his son's son, for it is said: \"But make them known to thy sons and thy sons' sons\" (Ibid. 4.9); and, not alone to his son and his son's son, but each and every scholar in Israel is commanded to instruct all who desire to be his disciples, even though they be not his sons, for it is said: \"And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children\" (Ibid. 6.7.), which is traditionally interpreted<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifre, Deut. 11. C. G.</i> to include one's disciples; for disciples, too, are called children, as it is said: \"And the sons of the prophets came forth\" (Second Kings, 2.3.). If it be so, why then was one commanded to teach his son and his son's son? To permit the precedence of one's son to one's son's son, and his son's son to the son of his fellow.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sukkah, 30b; Kiddushin, 30. G.</i>",
            "One is obliged to engage a teacher for the instruction of his son; but his fellow's son he is not obliged to teach, save when there is no expense to himself.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Baba Batra, 21a. G.</i> He whose father failed to instruct him, when he becomes conscious thereof, is obliged to educate himself, as it is said: \"That ye may learn them, and observe to do them\" (Deut. 5.1). Thus, you will find it a universal rule, that study precedes conduct, because study brings about proper conduct but conduct does not bring about study.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kiddushin, 29a; Ibid. 33b. C. G.</i>",
            "One who was ambitious to pursue learning, and, at the same time, has a son whom he is obliged to instruct, his own study comes first; if his son be diligent and intellectually more capable to grasp his studies than himself, his son comes first. Nevertheless, he shall not completely abandon his own study, his son's precedence notwithstanding; for, even as he is commanded to teach his son, so is he under command to study himself.<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibid. C.</i>",
            "Let man ever study the Torah and thereafter take a wife unto himself; for, if he takes a wife first, his mind will not be as clear to study. If the urge of marriage will over-burden him, even finding his heart not free to understand his studies, he should marry first and thereafter study the Torah.<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibid. 33a. G.</i>",
            "Whenceonward is his father obliged to teach him the Torah? When he commences to speak, he should teach him the Verses of, \"Moses commanded us a law\" (Deut. 34.4), and of the Shema (Ibid. 6.4); thereafter he imparts to him little by little other Verses till he be six or seven years old, all, of course, depending upon his physical condition; thereafter he brings him under the care of a beginner's instructor.<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sukkah, 43a; Ketubot, 50a. C. G.</i>",
            "Where the custom of the state is to pay a beginner's teacher, he should give him his wages, and the obligation to pay for his son's education continues until he is through reading all of the Holy Writ. In a place where the prevailing custom is to teach the written Torah for pay, one may instruct for pay; but to instruct the Oral Torah for wages, is forbidden, as it is said: \"Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as the Lord my God commanded me, etc.\" (Deut. 4.5.), which means; \"Even as I was instructed free so have you received instruction from me free; likewise when you will give instruction throughout the generations, instruct free even as you were instructed by me.\" (Nedarim, 37a; Bekorot, 29a). If he find not one who is so willing to teach him gratuitously, he may hire one for wages to be instructed by him, as it says: \"Buy the truth\" (Prov. 23.23.) Peradventure, one will deduct herefrom that he may instruct others for wages? The Verse, therefore, teaches us, saying: \"But sell it not\" (Ibid.) Herefrom you learn that one is forbidden to instruct others for hire although his master taught him for hire.",
            "Every man in Israel is obliged to study the Torah, whether he be poor or rich, whether he be physically healthy or ailing, whether he be in full vigor of youth or of great age and weakened vitality; even if he be dependent upon alms for his livelihood, or going around from door to door begging his daily bread, yea, even he who has a wife and children to support is obliged to have an appointed time for the study of the Torah, both during the day and at night, for it is said: \"But thou shalt meditate therein day and night\" (Joshua, 1.8.).<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yoma, 35a; Menahot, 99b. G. G.</i>",
            "Some of the great scholars in Israel were hewers of wood, some of them drawers of water, and some of them blind: nevertheless they engaged themselves in the study of the Torah by day and by night. Moreover, they are included among those who translated the tradition as it was transmitted from mouth of man to mouth of man, even from the mouth of Moses our Master.",
            "Until what age in life is one obliged to study the Torah? Even until the day of one's demise; for it is said: \"And lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life\" (Deut. 4.9.) Forsooth, as long as one will not occupy himself with study he forgets what he did study.<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kiddushin, 29b. G.</i>",
            "One is obligated to divide his time of study by three; one third for the study of Holy Writ, one third for the study of the Oral Torah, and one third for thinking and reflecting so that he may understand the end of a thing from its beginning, and deduct one matter from another, and compare one matter to another, and reason out by the hermeneutical rules in which the Torah is expounded to the end that he may know which are the principal rules and how to deduct therefrom that which is forbidden and that which is permitted, and other like matters which he studied from oral tradition. This subject of study is called Gemara.<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibid. 30a; Abodah Zarah, 19b. C.</i>",
            "For instance? If one was a craftsman and engaged himself three hours daily to his work and to Torah nine hours, of those nine hours he should devote three hours to the study of Holy Writ, and three hours to the Oral Torah and the last three hours to mental reasoning, to deduct one matter from another. Matters pertaining to tradition are included in Holy Writ, but their oral explanation is included in Oral Torah. The subjects designated as Pardas<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Vineyard, Works of the Chariot, Cosmogony, Metaphysics etc. G.</i> are included in the Gemara. These rules are spoken of man's beginning of study, but when he matures in wisdom and has no need either for further study of Holy Writ or for continuous devotion to the study of Oral Torah, he should read Holy Writ and traditional matters at appointed times merely so as not to forget any matter pertaining to the laws of the Torah, and turn his attention to a continuous study of Gemara, of course, in proportion to the broadness of his heart and peacefulness of his mind.<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Abodah Zarah, 19b. G.</i>",
            "A woman who studied the Torah has a reward coming to her but it is incomparable to the reward of a man because she was not commanded to do so, and whosoever does something which is not mandatory upon him to perform receives not a hire equal to the hire of him who is commanded to perform it but less than he. And, although she has a reward coming the sages commanded that a man shall not instruct his daughter in the Torah, because most women have no set mind to be instructed therein, but, on the contrary, are apt to divert matters of the Torah to nonsensical matters, of course, in proportion to the inferiority of their mind. The sages said: \"Whosoever instructs his daughter in Torah does no better than if he instructed her in matters of profanity.\" (Sotah, 21b). These matters are thus spoken of only concerning the Oral Torah, but respecting Holy Writ it is best not to begin to instruct her therein but if he did instruct her it is not as if he instruct her in profanity.<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Abodah Zarah, 3b; Kiddushin, 31a.

            "It is mandatory to appoint school teachers for small children in each and every state, in each and every province, and in each and every city. Any city wherein there are no children flocking to a master's house, the inhabitants thereof should be excommunicated until they do appoint teachers for the school children, if they then make no such appointment an excommunication should be pronounced against the city itself; for the world cannot endure save only by the fervent recitation of school children in the house of their master.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Batra, 21b; Shabbat, 119a. C. Maimonides considers excommunication equivalent to destruction. G.</i>",
            "Children should be enrolled for instruction at the age of six or seven years, in proportion to the strength of the child and his physique. A child under six years should not be sent to school. The teacher may inflict punishment upon the school children that they may fear him; but he must not smite them with hatred and cruelty; he should, therefore, not strike them with rods or sticks but with a small strap. He should instruct them during the entire day and part of the evening, so that they be brought up to study by day and by night. Children should not stop school at all save on the eves of Sabbaths and holidays, and during holidays. On the Sabbath no new lessons should be given but lessons may be repeated. School children should not be rendered idle even for the sake of building the Holy Temple.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Batra, 21b; Ketubot, 50a; Nedarim, 37a. C. See Ta’anit 3b. G.</i>",
            "A teacher of school children who leaves the children and departs from the school, or who engages himself in another kind of work while he is with them, or who is negligent in teaching them, behold, he is included among those of whom it is said: \"Cursed be he that doeth the work of the Lord with a slack hand\" (Jer. 48.10). It is, therefore, improper to appoint any teacher save one who is God fearing, diligent in reading and grammar.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Batra, 21b. C.</i>",
            "He who has no wife shall not instruct small children on account of the mothers who come to visit their children; and a woman shall not instruct small children on account of the fathers who come to visit their children.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kiddushin, 82a. C.</i>",
            "Twenty-five children should be the maximum number for one teacher to instruct. If there be more than twenty-five children but not exceeding forty, an assistant should be appointed to help him in giving them instructions; if the number exceeds forty children, two teachers should be appointed.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Baba Batra, 21b. C.</i>",
            "A school child may be transferred from one teacher to another one who is more diligent than he either in reading or in grammar. This rule is given when both teachers live in one city and there was no river between them, but from one city to another or from one side of the river to the other even in the same city, a child should not be transferred save where there was a strong bridge constructed across the river, a bridge which will not easily topple over",
            "One of a given neighborhood who desires to become a teacher, even one sharing a common courtyard with others, cannot be prevented by neighbors from doing so; likewise, if a teacher comes and establishes a school to instruct small children alongside the school of another teacher, whether his intentions are to get pupils from others, or whether his intentions are to get pupils from that very school, such teacher cannot prevent him from opening such a school, for it is said: \"The Lord was pleased for his righteousness' sake, to make the Torah great and glorious\" (Is. 42.21)."

            "The people of Israel were crowned with three crowns: the crown of Torah, the crown of priesthood and the crown of sovereignty. The crown of priesthood was acquired by Aaron, even as it is said: \"And it shall be unto him, and to his seed after him, the covenant of everlasting priesthood\" (Num. 25.13); the crown of sovereignty was acquired by David, even as it is said: \"His seed shall endure forever, and his throne as the sun before Me\" (Psalms 89.37); but the crown of the Torah, behold it, there it lies ready within the grasp of all Israel, even as it is said: \"Moses commanded us a Law, an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob\" (Deut. 33.4), Whosoever wants it may come and take it. Peradventure, you will say that those other two crowns are greater than the crown of the Torah, behold, it is said: \"By Me kings reign, and princes decree justice; by Me princes rule\" (Prov. 8. 13–14), herefrom be instructed that the crown of the Torah is greater than both of the others.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yoma, 72a; Gittin, 62a.

            "You have not a single commandment among all the precepts to balance the one concerning the study of the Torah, but the precept to study the Torah stands out against all the rest of the commandments, because study leads to practice. Therefore, in every instance study precedes practice.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pe’ah, 1. 1; Kiddushin, 40a; Megillah, 3b; Baba Kamma, 17b. C. G.</i>",
            "One confronted with both the performance of a commandment and the study of the Torah, if the commandment can be performed by proxy he should not interrupt his study; if not, he should perform the commandment and go back to his study.<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kiddushin, 40a.

            "The judgment of man in the world to come commences with no other than the question of the study of the Torah, whereafter concerning the rest of his deeds.<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibid.; Sanhedrin, 7b. C.</i> Therefore the wise men said: \"Let man ever pursue the study of the Torah, whether for its own divine purpose, or not for its own divine purpose, because studying it for non-divine purpose he will attain its own divine purpose.\" (Pesahim, 50b; Sotah, 22a; Nazir, 23b).",
            "Whosoever is ambitious to establish this commandment properly and to become adorned with the crown of the Torah must not divert his thoughts to other matters, nor set his heart to acquire the knowledge of the Torah and wealth and honor simultaneously. The way leading to the knowledge of the Torah is such: \"a morsel of bread with salt thou shalt eat, and water by measure thou shalt drink, upon the ground thou shalt sleep, and a burdensome life thou shalt live while thou toilest in the Torah.\" (Pirke Abot, 6.4; 21). Nevertheless, it is not obligatory upon thee to complete it, nor art thou free to exclude thyself from its study, for if thou hast increased thy study of the Torah thou also hast increased thy reward, as the reward is equal to the pain.",
            "Peradventure, one will say, I will interrupt my study of the Torah until I will accumulate wealth when I will again return to it, or until I will acquire sufficient substance to supply all my needs when I will retire and return back to it; if such a thought will penetrate thy heart you will never acquire the crown of the Torah. But make thy study of the Torah paramount and thy secular work incidental, and do not say, when I will be unoccupied then I will study, lest you will never be unoccupied.<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pir.

The sages, therefore said: \"Not he who engages himself over-much in commerce is wise.\" (Pirke Abot, 2.6). The sages, moreover, commanded: \"Engage thyself but little in worldly pursuits and pursue the study of the Torah\" (Pirke Abot, 4.12).",
            "The words of the Torah are likened unto water, even as it is said: \"Ho, everyone that thirsteth, come ye for water\" (Is. 55.1), which is to teach you, even as waters do not gather in steep places, but flow by gravity and gather in a well, so are the words of the Torah, they are not found among the high spirited nor in the heart of all haughty but in the humble and meek spirited who embraces the dust of the feet of the wise and removes the passions and the pleasures of the age from his heart and does a little work daily for his living, if he happens to be unprovided with food, and the rest of his days and his nights he pursues the study of the Torah.<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ta’anit, 7a; Erubin, 55a.

            "Nevertheless, whosoever sets his heart to pursue the study of the Torah but do no secular work at all, and permits himself to be supported by charity, behold him, he blasphemed the Name, and degraded the Torah, and shadowed the light of religion, and caused evil to be brought upon himself, and deprived his own life from its share in the world to come; because it is forbidden to enjoy aught in this world in return of the study of the words of the Torah. The sages said: \"Whosoever enjoys aught in return of the study of the words of the Torah takes his own life away from the world\" (Pirke Abot, 4.7). They have, moreover, commanded and said: \"Thou shalt not make them a garland by which to be considered great nor a spade to dig with them\" (Ibid.). Again they have commanded and said: \"Love manual labor and hate rank\". (Pirke Abot, 1.10); whosoever studies the Torah and does not acquire at the same time a manual trade his knowledge of the Torah will be nullified and bring about sin\" (Ibid. 2.2.). The end of this will be that he will rob people for his living.<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The text is clear enough to absolve Maimonides from forbidding scholars to accept renumeration. It can not be construed to include priests, teachers, Rabbis and other scholars who render services to the public. He only includes such scholars as are doing nothing in return for gifts received by them. This would be enjoying fruit of the Torah in this world. Cairo strenously objects to this law, and supports his objections by authority from Yoma, 35a; Berakot, 17a; Ta’anit 25a; Ketubot, 105a; Gittin 67b; Baba Mezi’a, 84b; Sotah, 21a; Hullin, 134a; Nedarim, 62a.

            "He who supports himself by the labor of his own hands attains a high degree. It is an ethical conduct of the pious man of yore. Therewith one acquires all honor and good that is in this world and in the world to come, even as it is said: \"When thou eatest the labor of thy hands happy shalt thou be and the good shall be with thee\" (Ps. 1.28); happy shalt thou be in this world, and the good shall be with thee in the world to come, which is entirely good.<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gittin, 67a; Berakot, 8a.

            "The words of the Torah do not remain permanently with one who is indolent in acquiring them, nor with such who study the Torah in an environment of luxury and amidst eating and drinking, but with one who sacrifices his life for them and constantly suffers his body and does not yield sleep to his eyes nor dozing to his eyelids. Said the wise men symbolically: \"This is the Law, when a man dieth in a tent\" (Num. 19.14); the Torah does not remain with any save with him who sacrifices his life in the tents of the wise. And so did Solomon in his wisdom say: \"If thou fall in the day of adversity thy strength is small indeed\" (Prov. 24.10); and he, moreover, said: \"Also my wisdom stood me in stead<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word Aph in the Hebrew text is usually translated to mean “also”, also means wrath or trouble. G.</i> (Ecc. 2.9); only the wisdom which I studied in trouble stood me in stead\" (Shabbat, 83a). The sages said: \"There is an established covenant that he who endures hardship in studying the Torah in the Beth Hamedrash will not easily forget it; but he who endures the hardship of his studies privately by himself becomes wise, even as it is said: \"But with the lowly is wisdom\" (Prov. 11.2). He who during his study reads the words audibly, his study remains with him; but he who whispers out his words speedily forgets them.<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ketubot, 111b; Berakot, 65a; Menahot, 54a; Yer. Berakot, 41. C. G.</i>",
            "Although it is mandatory to study by day and by night, no man acquires most of his wisdom at any but during night-time. Therefore, whosoever desires to attain the crown of the Torah should take care of all of his nights, not to spend even one of them in sleeping, eating, drinking, conversation, or in like matters, but in study of the Torah and in matters of wisdom. The sages said: \"The voice of the Torah cannot be heard save at night, as it is said 'Arise and speak loud in the night'\" (Midrash Raba, Song of Songs, 5.11; Erubin, 65a; Lam. 2.19. Whosoever pursues the study of the Torah by night has a thread of God's lovingkindness drawn upon himself by day, as it is said: \"By day the Lord will command His lovingkindness and in the night His song shall be with a prayer unto the God of my life\" (Abodah Zarah, 3b; Ps. 42.9). Any house wherein the words of the Torah are not heard by night, fire consumes it, even as it is said: \"All darkness is laid up for his treasures, a fire not blown by man shall consume him\" (Sanhedrin, 92; Job. 20. 26). \"Because he had despised the word of the Lord, is one who hath not at all observed the words of the Torah\" (Num. 15. 31; Sanhedrin, 99a). Likewise, he who has the means to pursue the Torah and does not pursue it, or he who studied and became proficient in the Torah but separated himself from it for the sake of the vanities of the world and abandoned his studies and deserted them is included among those who \"had despised the word of the Lord.\" The sages said: \"he who abandons the Torah because of wealth will end up by abandoning it because of poverty, but whosoever continues to study the Torah in poverty will in the end continue its study in wealth\" (Pirke Abot, 4.11.). This subject is, moreover, defined in the Torah, for, it says: \"Because thou didst not serve the Lord thy God with joyfulness and with greatness of heart by reason of the abundance of all things: therefore shalt thou serve thine enemy\" (Deut. 28.47–48); and it is furthermore said: \"That He might afflict thee to do thee good at thy latter end\" (Deut. 8.16).<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hagigah, 9.

            "No instructions in the Torah should be given to any but a fit student of proper conduct, or to one indifferently known; but if one followed a way which is not good, we first must bring him back to goodness and lead him in the path of righteousness and scrutinize him, after which we may admit him to the Beth Hamedrash and give him instructions. The sages said: \"He who instructs an unfit disciple is likened unto one who serves Mercury by casting a stone upon him, as it is said: \"As a small stone in a heap of stones, so is he that giveth honor to a fool'\" (Prov. 26.8; Hullin, 133a). There is no honor save in the Torah as it is said: \"The wise shall inherit honor\" (Prov. 3.35). Likewise, a Rabbi who does not follow the good way, though he be a great scholar and all of the people stand in need of him no instruction should be received from him until his return to goodness, as it is said: \"For the priests' lips should keep knowledge and they should seek the Law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of the Lord of Hosts\" (Mal. 2.7).

The master shall not raise his voice above the voice of the interpreter, nor shall the interpreter raise his voice when he repeats the question to the master, above the master's voice. The interpreter is not permitted to diminish from or add to, or change, aught in the master's lesson unless the interpreter be either the father of the master, or the master's master. The master says to the interpreter: \"so was I instructed by my master or so was I instructed by the master, my father,\" and when the interpreter repeats these words to the audience, he speaks in the name of the master and mentions the name of the master's father or of the master's master, and he says, \"thus was said by the master named so and so\", although the master himself did not pronounce the name of the master of whom he heard it, as it is forbidden to call by name either one's master or one's father.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kiddushin, 31b.

The sages, therefore, said: \"He who is bashful cannot be instructed and he who is in an angry mood cannot instruct.\" (Pirke Abot, 2.6). Whereof are such things said? In instances when the disciples did not understand a subject because of its depth or because their mind is short; but if it appears to the master that they are indolent to study the words of the Torah, and sluggish in acquiring them, because of which they did not understand, he is obliged to rebuke them and shame them with words in order to make them energetic. And on this subject the sages said: \"Cast gall amongst the disciples.\" (Ketubot, 103b). It is, therefore, unbecoming for a master to conduct himself light-headedly in the presence of the disciples, not to amuse himself in their presence, nor eat or drink with them, so that they will stand in awe before him and receive instructions from him diligently.<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pesahim, 55a.

            "One ignorant as to who imposed the sentence upon him, should go to the president who may release him.",
            "If a conditional sentence was imposed upon him, even on his own evidence, he must receive release. A disciple of the wise who imposed a sentence of separation upon himself; even the sentence was based upon the opinion of another, and even if it be on account of a matter which carries the punishment of separation, he may release the bond by himself.<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Makkot, 11a. C.</i>",
            "He who dreamt that a sentence of excommunication was pronounced upon him, although he remembers the one who made the pronouncement, must have ten men who are capable of studying treatises to release him. If he finds them not, he should walk a mile to find them; if such can not be found, even ten who study Mishnah may release him; if such can not be found, ten who can read the Torah may release him; if such can not be found, even ten who can not read at all may release him; if there be no ten adults in his place, even three can release him.<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nedarim, 8b; Berakot 29b. C.</i>",
            "One against whom a pronouncement of excommunication was made in his presence, is not released save when he is present. If the pronouncement was made in absenta, the release may be given, both in his presence and in his absence. There is no interval necessary between pronouncement and release; a bond of separation may be imposed, and, if the offender doth repent himself, he may be released the same minute. Yet, if the tribunal see fit to leave one under ban many years, he may be so left, all depending upon his wickedness. Likewise, if the tribunal see fit to first exclude one and then exclude whomsoever that will eat with him, drink with him, or stand within four ells of him, such exclusion should stand so as to punish him, and so as to make a guard around the Torah which the sinners will be unable to break. Although a scholar is vested with authority to excommunicate to preserve his honor, it is not good taste for a disciple of the wise to accustom himself to do such thing, but conceal his ears from the gossip of the ignorant people, and pay no attention to them, as the subject was spoken of in Solomon's wisdom: \"Also take not heed unto all words that are spoken\" (Ecc. 7.21). So was the way of the pious of yore: they heard themselves maligned, but made no reply; moreover, they pardoned the traducer and condoned him. Great scholars prided themselves in their becoming conduct and related that they have ever declined to pronounce an excommunication of separation or exclusion against a man for the sake of their honor. Such way of disciples of the wise is proper to follow. Whereat are these words directed? When one abused him maligned him secretly; but a disciple of the wise, who was abused or maligned by a man publicly, is forbidden to pardon an offense against his honor, and if he does pardon it he is punished in the end, for it is disgraceful to the Torah; he must avenge it and beat it in his heart serpent-like until the traducer will beg his pardon, when he should forgive him.<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nedarim, 7b; Megillah, 28a; Yer. Mo’ed Katan, 10b; Yoma, 22b-23a; Kiddushin, 32a. C. G.</i>"
