            "The carcass of a dead animal is a primary source of impurity. An olive-sized portion of its meat imparts impurity to a person and <i>keilim</i> when touched and to an earthenware container when it enters its inner space. And it imparts impurity to a person when being carried to the extent that his clothes become impure, as is the law regarding a surface on which one rides that contracted impurity from a <i>zav</i>.<br>What is implied? When a person touches the carcass of a dead animal, he is considered as a primary derivative of impurity. If he touches <i>keilim</i> - even at the same time that he is touching the carcass - they are pure. Similarly, the clothes that he is wearing are pure, for he is a derivative of impurity and a derivative does not impart impurity to <i>keilim</i>.<br>When, by contrast, one carries the carcass of a dead animal, he imparts impurity to <i>keilim</i> while he is carrying it, as Leviticus 11:28 states: \"One who carries their carcasses must launder his garments.\" Those garments are considered as primary derivatives of impurity. He does not impart impurity to another person or to earthenware containers even when he is carrying the carcass, as we explained in <i>Hilchot Metamei Mishkav UMoshav</i>.",
            "These laws apply regarding both the carcasses of a domesticated animal and a wild animal, whether of a species permitted to be eaten or one forbidden to be eaten. If any of these types of animals die, an olive-sized portion of their meat imparts impurity. The ritual slaughter of a kosher domesticated animal or a kosher wild animal purifies it in all circumstances. Even if one slaughtered an ordinary animal in the Temple Courtyard or a consecrated animal outside the Temple Courtyard, they are pure. If a disqualifying factor occurs in the process of ritual slaughter, the carcass is considered like that of an animal that died. It imparts impurity when carried, as stated in <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i>.",
            "Ritual slaughter has no effect on the status of a non-kosher domesticated animal or a non-kosher wild animal. Whether one slaughters such an animal, stabs it in the throat, strangles it, or it dies naturally, it is considered as an animal carcass. Flesh from all carcasses - both from kosher species and from non-kosher species can be combined to reach the minimum measure of an olive-sized portion that imparts ritual impurity.",
            "The marrow of a bone is considered like flesh. The blood of an animal carcass does not impart impurity like an animal carcass. Instead, it is considered as an impure liquid which does not impart impurity to a person or to utensils according to Scriptural Law.",
            "The fat of a kosher animal that died without ritual slaughter is ritually pure, as implied by Leviticus 7:24: \"The fat of a domesticated animal that died or the fat of a domesticated animal that was torn to death may be used for any purpose.\" The license granted by this verse applies to an entity forbidden only because the animal had died or was torn to death. If such fat was made fit to contract impurity due to contact with liquids that convey that status, it is considered as impure food and not as the meat of a dead animal.<br>Nevertheless, when one touches the fat the surrounds the kidney of a kosher domesticated animal that died without ritual slaughter before it was separated from the kidney, he is impure like one who touches the kidney itself. The rationale is that several strands of flesh from the kidney itself extend into the fat.<br>With regard to a non-kosher domesticated animal and a wild animal, whether kosher or non-kosher, the same laws apply to both its meat and its fat with regard to ritual impurity. An olive-sized portion imparts impurity to a person and to <i>keilim</i> like the meat of a dead animal.",
            "The fat of a <i>ko'i</i> imparts impurity like its meat does, but this impurity is of doubtful status. Therefore <i>terumah</i> and sacrificial foods are not burnt because of it, nor is one liable for <i>karet</i> for entering the Temple or partaking of sacrificial foods after touching it.",
            "These are the parts of a carcass that do not impart impurity: the bones, the horns, and the hoofs; this includes even their soft portions that if cut off from a living animal would cause bleeding, the hide, even if has not been processed to use for other purposes, the pieces of flesh that remain attached to the hide when an animal is skinned, the sinews, sauce, and spices cooked with such meat.<br>When does the above apply? When they were separated from an animal's carcass. If, however, one touches any of these entities while they are still attached to the meat of a carcass, he contracts impurity, provided there is an olive-sized portion of meat. For none of these can be included as part of that required olive-sized portion.",
            "The pieces of flesh that remain attached to the hide when an animal is skinned whether separated by a wild beast or by a knife should not be considered as part of an olive-sized portion. If the different pieces of flesh were collected and they comprised an olive-sized portion, they impart impurity.",
            "These are the parts of animals for which the hide is considered as their meat: the hide of a domesticated pig, the soft hide of a camel hump, the skin of the genital area, the skin of a fetus, and the skin below the fat-tail. Such portions of an animal carcass impart impurity. If one processed them or trod upon them to the extent necessary to process them, they are pure. If one performed a deed that negated their use as meat, they are pure even though he did not trod upon them to the extent necessary to process them.<br>What is implied? If one used the ear of a donkey as the handle for his basket, it is pure. For how long must one tread on a hide in order to process it? For as long as it takes to walk four <i>millin</i>. What is meant by a soft camel hump? One that was never used for a burden. If a camel reached the age when it was fit to carry burdens, but one did not use it for that purpose or one used it for that purpose before it reached the appropriate age, it is questionable whether its status changes.",
            "The following laws apply when one skins the carcass of a domesticated or a wild animal, whether from a kosher species or a non-kosher one, whether it is a small animal or a large animal. If he skins it to use as a mat, as soon as he skins a portion of the hide sufficient to hold onto, i.e., two handbreadths, one who touches the hide that was skinned is pure. Before it is skinned two handbreadths, one who touches the hide is like one who touches meat.<br>If one skins the animal in order to use its hide for a flask, the hide is considered as connected to the carcass until one skins the entire breast. If one skins an animal from its feet alone, the entire hide is considered as connected. One who touches the hide is like one who touches the meat until the hide is entirely separated from the meat. Similarly, when one skins the hide of crawling animals, the hide is considered as connected until it is skinned in its entirety. Similarly, the hide that is around an animal's neck is considered as connected until it is removed in its entirety.<br>Any hide that is considered as connected with regard to imparting ritual impurity is also considered as connected with regard to contracting ritual impurity, i.e., if an animal was slaughtered and impurity touched this hide that was connected to the meat, the meat contracts impurity.",
            "When there is a hide that has an olive-sized portion of meat from a carcass on it, if one touches a strand of the hide that extends outward from the meat or the hair on the other side of the hide that is opposite the meat, he contracts impurity. The rationale is that the hide and its hair are considered as \"protecting\" the meat.<br>When does the above apply? When the meat was left over by an animal. When it was left over by a knife, it is considered insignificant with regard to the hide if it was thin.",
            "When there are two pieces of meat, each half the size of an olive-sized portion on a hide, the hide causes them to be considered as insignificant. They do not impart impurity, neither when touched, nor when carried. The rationale is that any portion of a carcass that does not impart impurity when touched does not impart impurity when carried.<br>If, however, one skewered two pieces, each half the size of an olive-sized portion, one who carries them is impure because he carried an olive-sized portion of meat from a carcass. One who touches them, by contrast, is pure, because something joined by man is not considered as joined. The liability for carrying the pieces of meat applies provided both pieces are flattened and stuck together so that they are picked up together. If, however, the two half olive-sized portion were separate entities, but held on the same skewer, the person is pure even if he carries them back and forth the entire day.",
            "When the meat of a carcass decomposes, becomes spoiled, and is no longer fit for a dog to eat, it is pure. Accordingly, there is an unresolved doubt whether the <i>netzal</i> of an animal carcass imparts impurity or not.<br>The following laws apply when the meat from a carcass dries out. If it would return to a moist state and be fit for a dog to eat when left to soak in lukewarm water for an entire day, it imparts impurity. If not, it is pure. It does not even impart impurity like impure foods do.",
            "When the meat of an animal carcass was decomposed at the outset and was not fit for human consumption, it is pure, as can be inferred from Deuteronomy 14:21: \"Give it to the stranger in your gate and he will eat it.\" At the outset, it must be fit for a stranger to eat.",
            "A placenta found in an animal carcass is considered as waste matter and feces. It does not impart impurity like a carcass. If the person had in mind to eat it, it is susceptible to the impurity associated with food. The dried milk in the stomach and the liquid milk in the stomach of a carcass are entirely pure.",
            "When an animal discharges coagulated blood, even though such a discharge makes it exempt from the laws of the firstborn, it does not impart impurity, neither when touched, nor when carried unless there is the form of a fetus recognizable. The rationale is that it is nullified because there is a majority of other substances that are discharged with it. Therefore, it is pure even though it was initially fit for a stranger to eat together with its mother.",
            "The following laws apply when the carcass of an animal that was not slaughtered became intermingled with that of a slaughtered animal. If the majority of the meat is from the ritually slaughtered animal, the meat from the carcass is considered as insignificant and none of the mixture imparts impurity when touched. If, however, one carries the entire mixture, he contracts impurity.<br>The reason why the meat of the carcass can be considered insignificant is that it is impossible for the ritually slaughtered meat to be considered as a carcass, but the carcass can become pure if it becomes putrefied. Therefore it can become nullified."

            "When a non-kosher domesticated animal or wild animal was slaughtered, it does not impart the impurity of a carcass as long as it is in its death-throes unless its head is cut off. Instead, it is considered as impure food. If it is killed by being stabbed in the throat and it is in its death throes, as long as it makes convulsive movements, it is not even considered as impure food.<br>A limb that is separated from an animal that is making convulsive movements is forbidden to a Noachide, as if it were separated from a living animal. And meat that is separated from it is considered as having been separated from a living animal. Similarly, when a kosher animal is slaughtered in an unacceptable manner and it is still making convulsive movements or one of its signs or the majority of one was slit, it is not considered impure at all until it dies.<br>If one divides an animal in half or one removes its thigh and its inner cavity, it is considered as a carcass and it imparts impurity when carried and when touched, even though it shows signs of life. Similarly, if it was ripped apart from its back or its back bone was broken and the majority of the meat around it severed, it is considered as a carcass in all contexts.",
            "When the fetus of an animal dies within its womb and a shepherd inserts his hand and touches it - whether it is a non-kosher species or a kosher species - the shepherd who touches it is considered pure until he removes the stillborn animal from the womb.",
            "Meat that is separated from a domesticated or wild animal - whether from a kosher species or a non-kosher species - in their lifetime is ritually pure and does not impart impurity as a carcass does. When, however, an entire limb is separated from a living animal, it does impart impurity as a carcass does. This applies to a limb from a living animal itself or from a fetus in its womb.<br>There is no minimum measure to the size of a limb. Even if it is the size of a barley-corn or smaller, it imparts impurity provided it was intact as when it came into being with flesh, sinews, and bones. It must have enough flesh to regenerate and return to a state of wholeness. If the limb did not have enough flesh to return to a state of wholeness or the bone was lacking, it is pure.",
            "A kidney, the tongue, the lips, and like - even though they are organs and will not regenerate - are considered as meat in this context, because they do not have bones.",
            "The flesh or a limb of a domesticated or wild animal that could not regain its vitality and reconnect with the remainder of the body does not impart impurity as a carcass does as long as the animal is alive. Instead, they are considered as like other edible substances. If they were made fit to contract impurity, they can contract impurity while attached to the animal.<br>If the animal was slaughtered, the slaughter causes the flesh or the limb that had been maimed to be considered fit to contract impurity, but they do not impart impurity as a carcass does. For the slaughter of the animal does not cause them to be considered as if they were separated from the animal during its lifetime. If, by contrast, the animal died, the flesh that was hanging loosely from it during its lifetime must be made fit to contract ritual impurity and a limb that had been hanging loosely imparts impurity as a limb from a living animal and not as a limb from a carcass.<br>What is the difference between a limb from a living animal and a limb from a carcass? Meat that was cut from a limb separated from a living animal is pure, while meat cut from a carcass imparts impurity when touched or carried if an olive-sized portion is present. The same measure applies in both instances.",
            "When an animal that was <i>tereifah</i> was slaughtered in a proper manner, even though it is forbidden to be eaten, it is pure. Similarly, when a person slaughters an animal and discovers a dead fetus, the slaughter of its mother purifies it from imparting the impurity associated with a carcass.<br>If one discovers a fetus that is in its eighth month and is alive, it is considered as a <i>tereifah</i>. Even if it is slaughtered after it was deemed <i>tereifah</i>, the slaughter does not prevent it from imparting the impurity associated with a carcass. The rationale is that there is no concept of ritual slaughter for an animal of this type.<br>Based on this logic, when the offspring of an animal was not kept for seven full days before it was slaughtered, the slaughter does not prevent it from imparting the impurity associated with a carcass, because such an animal is considered like a non-viable offspring.",
            "As explained, when a person slaughters an animal and finds a living fetus that has been carried for nine months, ritual slaughter is not required before it steps on the ground, because the slaughter of its mother causes it to be considered as pure. Nevertheless, if its mother becomes impure before the fetus was removed, the fetus does not contract impurity. If the slaughter of its mother was not performed successfully and the mother became considered as a carcass, the living fetus remains pure. The rationale is that a living being does not contract impurity at all, not the impurity associated with foods, nor the impurity associated with a carcass, even though it is considered as one of the limbs of the mother. If it dies before it steps on the ground, it is pure, because the slaughter of its mother causes it to be deemed pure.",
            "When an animal that is <i>tereifah</i> was slaughtered, even though its meat is pure according to Scriptural Law, if meat from a sacrificial animal touches it, the sacrificial meat contracts impurity according to Rabbinic Law. This is an added stringency applied with regard to consecrated foods.",
            "The following laws apply when an animal had difficulty birthing its offspring. If, after the fetus stuck out its foot and it was cut off, the mother was then slaughtered, the limb that was cut off is considered as if it was from a carcass, but the remainder of the meat of the fetus is pure.<br>If the mother was slaughtered and then the limb was cut off, the limb is considered as the meat of a <i>tereifah</i> animal that was slaughtered. The remainder of the meat of the fetus is considered as meat that touched a <i>tereifah</i> animal that was slaughtered which imparts impurity to consecrated foods, but not to <i>terumah</i>.<br>If the fetus stuck out its foot between the slaughter of one sign and the other and it was cut off, the slitting of the second sign is joined to the slitting of the first to purify the limb from imparting impurity as a carcass does.",
            "When a non-Jew slaughters an animal, it is considered as a carcass and imparts impurity when carried. This applies even when a Jew is supervising him and even if he slaughtered it properly with an acceptable knife. Whether the slaughterer is a gentile, a Samaritan, or a resident alien, his slaughter causes the animal to be considered as a carcass.<br>According to my estimation, this is also a Rabbinical decree, for the impurity imparted by false deities and objects offered to them is a Rabbinical decree, as will be explained. And it is because of their worship of false deities that the Samaritans were distanced and their slaughter forbidden. If you will ask: According to Scriptural Law, it is forbidden to partake of an animal which they slaughtered? In resolution, it can be said that not everything that is forbidden to be eaten imparts impurity. For an animal that is <i>tereifah</i>, but which was slaughtered properly, is forbidden to be eaten, but is ritually pure. It is impossible to obligate a person for <i>karet</i> for such impurity for entering the Temple or for partaking of sacrificial foods unless one can clearly prove his assertion that he contracted impurity.",
            "When a person touches or carries the thigh bone of a dead animal, he is pure. The rationale is that any portion of an animal's carcass that does not impart impurity when touched, does not impart impurity when carried. If, however, it was perforated to the slightest degree, one who touches it or carries it contracts impurity.<br>When does the above apply? When the marrow in it rattles, for, in that state, it would not regenerate flesh were the animal to be alive. If, however, it is in its natural place and it has sufficient marrow that it could regenerate flesh on the outside of the bone, it imparts impurity when touched or carried like other limbs. We have already explained that a thigh-bone is closed on all sides.",
            "When a person thought of perforating a thigh bone, but had not done so as of yet, one who touches it contracts impurity of a doubtful status. For there is an unresolved question whether the fact that he has not perforated the bone as of yet is considered as not having carried out a significant deed or not."

            "The carcass of a kosher fowl that was not ritually slaughtered imparts impurity according to Scriptural Law. According to the Oral Tradition, it is taught that Leviticus 17:15: \"Any soul that will partake of the carcass of a fowl or one that is <i>tereifah</i> - whether a native or a convert - shall launder his garments and bathe in water\" is speaking only about one who partakes of the carcass of a fowl from a kosher species that is forbidden because it is a carcass or <i>tereifah</i>.<br>How is its impurity defined? It does not impart impurity when touched or when carried or when it is in one's mouth, only in one's gullet. This is implied by the phrase: \"Any soul that will partake...,\" i.e., it imparts impurity only when it has been ingested in \"the chamber of the soul.\" It uses the term \"partake\" to define that the minimum measure that imparts impurity is the measure to which the prohibition against eating applies, i.e., an olive-sized portion. Moreover, it is written: \"shall launder his garments;\" this teaches that one who contracts impurity from such a carcass imparts impurity to his garments until he separates himself from the object that imparted impurity to him, as we explained.<br>What is implied? When one swallows an olive-sized portion of the carcass of a fowl from a kosher species and touched <i>keilim</i> while swallowing it, they become impure and are considered a primary derivative of impurity. If he was touching a person or earthenware containers while swallowing it, he does not impart impurity to them, as we stated with regard to other primary categories of impurity. After he has ingested the meat from the fowl, he does not impart impurity to other <i>keilim</i>. He is like a <i>k'li</i> that is a primary derivative of impurity that has been separated from the substance that imparted impurity to him. For even though he must immerse himself and wait for nightfall to regain ritual purity, he does not impart impurity to <i>keilim</i>.",
            "It is not necessary for one to have the intent to consider the carcass of a fowl from a kosher species as food to impart this severe type of impurity. Instead, whenever one swallows an olive-size portion of such a carcass, it imparts impurity when in the person's gullet.<br>If one thought to partake of it, it imparts the impurity of foods. It is considered as a primary derivative of impurity even though it did not touch another source of impurity, nor must it be made fit to contract impurity.",
            "The above does not apply to a red heifer and goats that are to be burned. Even though they impart impurity to those involved in offering them, if one considers partaking of them, it is necessary for them to come in contact with a source of impurity. Only then, do they contract the impurity associated with food.",
            "When a person skewered an olive-size portion of an animal carcass with a weaving needle and inserted it into the inner organs of a woman from below or inserted it into the gullet of a colleague in a place where the carcass of a fowl from a kosher species would impart impurity, the person contracts impurity, because he or she is carrying the impurity, not because he touches it, as we explained in the beginning of this book.",
            "If a person wound an olive-sized portion of the carcass of a fowl from a kosher species in lettuce or the like and swallowed it, he is impure, even if it did not touch his throat. If he wound it with tree bast and swallowed it, he is pure.",
            "If a person swallowed an olive-sized portion of the carcass of a fowl from a kosher species and, after swallowing it, vomited it before it was digested, he does not impart impurity to his garments when it passes his throat when vomiting it. For it imparts impurity in the gullet only when it is swallowed, but not when it is vomited.",
            "The following rules apply when a person swallowed part of an intestine of a kosher species of fowl, part of it was in his gullet, and part was in his mouth. If there is an olive-sized portion in his gullet at one time, he is impure. If not, he remains pure.",
            "When a person swallows an entire limb that is not as large as an olive-sized portion from such a carcass, it does not impart impurity. Even if he took an entire fowl and swallowed it, if it is as large as an olive, he becomes impure. If not, he remains pure.",
            "Although the thin feathers and the wooly hairs on the carcass of a fowl are considered as food and contract and impart the impurity associated with food, they are not included when reckoning an olive-sized portion of the carcass of a kosher species of fowl.<br>In contrast, the soft portions of the beak and the nails that are close to the flesh are considered like meat and are included in the reckoning of an olive-sized portion. The tips of the wings, the tip of the tail, and the bones, even those which are soft, are not included.",
            "When a person partakes of the soft bones, the sinews, underdeveloped eggs while in the mother's body, or the blood of the carcass of a fowl from a kosher species or meat cut from such a fowl while it was alive, he is pure. If, however, one partook of the meat to which the underdeveloped eggs were attached, the gizzard, or the intestines of such a fowl after it died, or he liquefied the fat in fire and drank it, he is impure like one who partakes of its meat. One who drinks is like who eats. If he liquefied it in the sun and partook of it, he is pure, for he has caused it to become rancid.",
            "When the carcass of a fowl of a kosher species has decomposed to the extent that it is unfit to be eaten by a dog, it is pure. Similarly, if it becomes dry like a shard and would not return to its original state if left in lukewarm water for an entire day, it is pure. One who partakes of the <i>netzel</i> of the carcass of a fowl of a kosher species is pure.",
            "When a fowl from a kosher species becomes <i>tereifah</i>, but was slaughtered in a kosher manner, the slaughter causes it to be considered pure. This applies even if it was slaughtered in the Temple Courtyard. If its head was snipped off through <i>melikah</i> and it was discovered to be <i>tereifah</i>, the <i>melikah</i> does not cause it to be considered as pure. Thus it can be inferred that when one slaughters a fowl from a kosher species, whether outside the Temple Courtyard or inside of it, whether the fowl is consecrated or not, it is pure. Whether one performs <i>melikah</i> on ordinary fowl within the Temple Courtyard or consecrated fowl outside the Temple Courtyard, they impart impurity to a person and his garments when in the gullet.",
            "When one performs <i>melikah</i> on consecrated fowl in the Temple Courtyard, if they are fit for a sacrifice and do not have disqualifying blemishes, as explained in its place, they are pure. Similarly, when a calf that has its neck broken as required by law, it is pure, for \"atonement\" is mentioned with regard to it, as with regard to sacrificial offerings. Similarly, if it was slaughtered after it was taken down to the wadi, even though it is forbidden to benefit from it, the slaughter prevents it from being considered as an impure carcass.",
            "The carcass of a fowl from a non-kosher species is pure and does not impart impurity in the gullet. If one thought to partake of it and it was made fit to contract impurity, it is considered as an impure food which is a primary derivative of impurity. The thin feathers, the wooly hairs, and the soft portions of its beak and its nails are considered as its meat.",
            "When a limb is separated from a living fowl - whether from a kosher species or a non-kosher species - it is pure and does not impart impurity at all, as can be inferred from Leviticus 11:24-26: \"Because of these, you will contract impurity... because of all the animals.\" This excludes fowl, because it does not have a hoof. According to the Oral Tradition, it was taught that the verse comes solely to teach that a limb from a living domesticated or wild animal is impure.",

If it was from the carcass of a kosher fowl, an olive-sized portion of it imparts severe impurity in the gullet. If one thought of partaking of it, it contracts the impurity associated with impure foods. If the carcass was from a non-kosher fowl, it contracts the impurity associated with impure foods if one thought of partaking of it and it was made fit to contract impurity. It does not impart impurity to other foods unless it is the size of an egg. This is the measure required for all foods to contract impurity, as will be explained."

Therefore, they would immerse themselves carelessly, without attention to details. Accordingly, our Sages decreed that when a person immerses his head and the majority of his body in drawn water or three <i>lugim</i> of drawn water fall on his head and the majority of his body, he becomes a secondary derivative of impurity.

Only afterwards may he touch consecrated food.<br>With regard to <i>terumah</i>, by contrast, if one of his hands contracts impurity, the other does not, even if he touched it, provided the first was dry.

For a person in a state of acute mourning and one who is lacking atonement may partake of <i>terumah</i>.<br>Why did the Sages require immersion before partaking of consecrated food? Because until this time, such individuals were forbidden to partake of consecrated food.

            "Our Sages established five categories with regard to the ritual purity of clothes. They are the following:<br>a) The clothes of an unlearned person are considered as a <i>midras</i>, an article on which a <i>zav</i> had been supported, for people who partake of ordinary food in a state of purity. Similarly, the unlearned people themselves are considered as <i>zavvim</i> with regard to pure substances, as we explained.<br>b) The clothes of people who partake of ordinary food in a state of purity are considered as a <i>midras</i> for those who partake of the second tithe. The people who partake of ordinary food in a state of purity themselves - they are called <i>perushim</i> - are not considered as <i>zavvim</i>. Even with regard to <i>terumah</i>, a <i>perush</i> is considered pure, even if he touches <i>terumah</i> with his hands.<br>c) The clothes of people who partake of the second tithe are considered as a <i>midras</i> for those who partake of <i>terumah</i>.<br>d) The clothes of people who partake of <i>terumah</i> are considered as a <i>midras</i> for those who partake of consecrated food. The people who partake of <i>terumah</i> themselves are, however, not considered as <i>zavvim</i> with regard to consecrated articles.<br>e) The clothes of those who partake of consecrated foods are considered as a <i>midras</i> with regard to the offering of the red heifer, as explained in <i>Hilchot Parah Adumah</i>. A person who is pure with regard to consecrated foods is not considered as a <i>zav</i> with regard to the offering of the red heifer.",
            "Similarly, our Sages established categories with regard to ritual immersion:<br>What is implied? If someone immersed himself without any intent, he is pure with regard to ordinary food, but he is forbidden to partake of the second tithe until he had the intent to immerse for the sake of the second tithe. If he immersed for the second tithe, he is assumed to be pure for the second tithe, but forbidden to partake of <i>terumah</i>. If he immersed for <i>terumah</i>, he is assumed to be pure for <i>terumah</i>, but forbidden to partake of consecrated foods. If he immersed for consecrated food, he is assumed to be pure for consecrated food, but forbidden to participate in the offering of the red heifer. If he immersed with the intent of participating in the offering of the red heifer, he is assumed to be pure for everything, for one who immerses for the sake of a more stringent circumstance is considered acceptable for a more lenient one.<br>If a person immersed without any intent, i.e., without thinking of any of these situations, he is pure only with regard to ordinary food and is considered impure as he was previously, even for the second tithe. Similarly, when a person washes his hands or immerses them, he must focus his attention, even if he desires only to partake of the second tithe. From that tithe and any level of sanctity higher, one must focus his intent. For ordinary food, however, it is not necessary for him to focus his intent.<br>All of these stringencies originate in Rabbinic Law. According to Scriptural Law, since the person immersed himself, he is pure with regard to all matters.",
            "When a person who was pure with regard to <i>terumah</i> diverted his attention from partaking of it, the diversion of attention causes him to contract impurity. He is forbidden to partake of <i>terumah</i> until he immerses himself a second time. He need not, however, wait until nightfall.<br>If his hands were pure for <i>terumah</i>, but he diverted his attention from eating, even though he says: \"I know that my hands did not contract impurity,\" his hands are impure because of his diversion of attention, for hands are busy. If this applies with regard to <i>terumah</i>, it can be inferred that the same principles apply with regard to consecrated food. Anyone who diverts his attention must immerse himself.<br>When a person did not guard himself from the impurity associated with a human corpse, if he is not certain that he did not contract impurity, he must have the ashes of the red heifer sprinkled on him on the third and seventh days after the doubt arouse, because of his diversion of attention. If he is certain that he did not contract the impurity associated with a corpse, but diverted his attention from other forms of impurity, he must immerse himself and wait until nightfall even for <i>terumah</i>. It is clear that all these immersions are Rabbinic safeguards.",

This was instituted because of the severity involving sacrificial animals.<br>When does the above stringency apply? To knives found in Jerusalem throughout the year. If, however, one finds a knife in Jerusalem on the fourteenth of Nisan, one may slaughter sacrificial animals with it immediately. This applies even if the fourteenth of Nisan fell on the Sabbath, for no decree was made with regard to knives found on that day. Similarly, if a knife was found on a festival, one may slaughter with it immediately. For it is assumed that all <i>keilim</i> are pure on the festivals.",

During the festivals, the converse is true. Saliva in the middle of the road is pure, for all Israel are pure during the festivals. At the side of the road, it is impure.

The rationale is that a) the fundamental dimension of their impurity is doubtful, perhaps it is impure, perhaps it is pure; and<br>b) even if you say they are impure, it is possible that there was contact with the <i>terumah</i>, but it is possible that there was no contact.
