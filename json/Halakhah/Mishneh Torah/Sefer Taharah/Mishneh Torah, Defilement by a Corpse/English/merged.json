            "Wherever uncleanness by contact is spoken of, whether the reference is to a corpse or other things that defile, it is understood that the person has touched the unclean thing itself with his flesh. Whether he has touched it with his hand or foot or with any other part of his flesh, or even with his tongue, he has become unclean. — —",

            "All that becomes unclean because of a corpse is unclean seven days, whether human beings or utensils. If, for example, a person or an object touched any of the things that transmit corpse uncleanness by contact, or became unclean by the overshadowing of the things which transmit uncleanness by overshadowing; so too, if a man carried any of the things that transmit uncleanness by carrying—they all are unclean seven days, as it is written: \"Whoever enters the tent and whatever is in the tent shall be unclean seven days\" (Numbers 19:14).",
            "If a person has become unclean by a corpse, the objects he touches incur the seven-day uncleanness, as it is written: \"On the seventh day you shall wash your clothes and be clean\" (31:24). But if a man has touched a person who has become unclean by a corpse — — he is unclean until evening, as it is written: \"And the person who touches him shall be unclean until evening\" (19:21).",
            "If utensils became unclean by a corpse, whether by contact or by overshadowing, they are like the corpse itself to whatever touches them: just as the corpse transmits seven-day uncleanness to what touches it, whether it is a human being or utensils, so do utensils which became unclean by a corpse: the utensils or persons that touch them contract seven-day uncleanness.— —",
            "",
            "",
            "If pottery touched a corpse or was with it in a tent, it is unclean; but it transmits uncleanness neither to persons nor to other utensils, because pottery never becomes a cause of defilement, whether on account of a corpse or any other unclean object. This law, though a tradition, is as good as a law specified in the Torah.",
            "This is an important general rule concerning unclean objects: Every principal cause of defilement transmits uncleanness to human beings and to garments and utensils — — and whatever transmits uncleanness by contact to persons and to utensils is a principal cause of defilement. Every secondary cause of defilement transmits uncleanness to foodstuffs and liquids, but does not transmit uncleanness to persons and objects, whether pottery or any other utensils or clothing.",
            "Anything that touches a principal cause of defilement is called first-grade uncleanness; if it touches first-grade uncleanness, it is referred to as second-grade uncleanness; if it touches second-grade uncleanness, it is referred to as third-grade uncleanness; and if it touches third-grade uncleanness, it is referred to as fourth-grade uncleanness. First-grade uncleanness and the uncleanness of lesser degrees are referred to as derivative uncleanness."
