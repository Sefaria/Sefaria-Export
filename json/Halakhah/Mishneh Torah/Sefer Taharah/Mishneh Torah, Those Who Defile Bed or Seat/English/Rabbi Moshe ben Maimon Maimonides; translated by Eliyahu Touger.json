            "A zav, a zavah, a woman in the nidah state, and a woman after childbirth: all these four types of individuals are primary sources of impurity. They impart impurity to implements through touching them and impart impurity to other persons by touching them or carrying them. They impart impurity to the objects on which they lie, sit, or ride and cause them to also be considered as a primary source of impurity. And they impart impurity to the objects above them."
