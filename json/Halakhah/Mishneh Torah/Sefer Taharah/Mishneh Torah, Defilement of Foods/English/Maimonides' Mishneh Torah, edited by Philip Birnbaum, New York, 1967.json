            "Any food designed for man, such as bread, meat, grapes, olives and the like, is susceptible to uncleanness; whatever is not used as food by man is clean, and is not susceptible to uncleanness unless one has assigned it as food for man. In either case it can contract uncleanness only if it is first mixed with one of seven liquids; this is what is called <i>hekhsher</i> (defilement fitness), as it is written: \"If water is put on the seed and such a carcass falls upon it, it shall be unclean for you\" (Leviticus 12:38).",
            "The seven liquids which render foodstuffs susceptible to uncleanness are: water, dew, oil, wine, milk, blood, and honey.— —",

            "No liquid other than the seven liquids which we have enumerated contracts uncleanness; but other fruit juices do not contract any uncleanness at all, just as they do not render foodstuffs susceptible to uncleanness."

            "Whatever is written in the Torah and in traditional lore about the rules relating to things unclean or clean is only in connection with the Temple and its sacred objects, heave-offerings and second tithe. The Torah warns those who are unclean against entering the Temple or eating anything that is hallowed, or <i>terumah</i> or tithe, while in a state of uncleanness. But no such prohibition applies to common food; it is permissible to eat common food that is unclean and to drink liquids that are unclean. It is written in the Torah: \"Meat that touches anything unclean shall not be eaten\" (7:19), implying thereby that common food is permissible; the Torah speaks there only of the meat of sacred offerings. — —",

            "Although it is permissible to eat defiled food and to drink defiled liquids, the saintly men of early times used to eat their common food in a state of purity, and were cautious of any uncleanness throughout their lifetime. Hence they were called <i>Perushim</i> [the separated Pharisees]. This is extreme holiness and a way of saintliness, when a man separates himself from the rest of the people without either touching them or eating and drinking with them. Abstinence leads to physical purity from evil doings; physical purity leads to spiritual holiness; and spiritual holiness leads to being godlike, as it is written: \"You shall sanctify yourselves and be holy… I the Lord make you holy\" (20:7-8)."
