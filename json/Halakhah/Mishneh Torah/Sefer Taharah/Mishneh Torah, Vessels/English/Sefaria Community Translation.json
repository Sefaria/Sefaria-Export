For it says (Lev. 11:32), \" be it any article of wood, or a cloth, or a skin, or a sack.\"  And regarding metal vessels, it says (Num. 31:22), \"even the gold and the silver.\"  And regarding ceramic vessels, it says (Lev. 11:33), \"if any of those falls into an earthen vessel, everything inside it shall be unclean and [the vessel] itself you shall break.\""
