            "There are seven types of <i>keilim</i> that are susceptible to impurity according to Scriptural Law. They are: clothes, <i>keilim</i> from sackcloth, leather <i>keilim</i>, <i>keilim</i> made from bone, metal <i>keilim</i>, wooden <i>keilim</i>, and earthenware <i>keilim</i>. For Leviticus 11:32 states: \"From all wooden implements, garments, leather articles, or sackcloth.\" And with regard to metal utensils, Numbers 31:22 states: \"But the gold and the silver....\" And with regard to earthenware utensils, Leviticus 11:33 states: \"And every earthenware container into whose inner space one of them will fall, everything inside of it will contract impurity and the container should be broken.\"",
            "According to the Oral Tradition, it was taught that the Torah's statement Numbers 31:20: \"And anything made from goats\" includes <i>keilim</i> made from the horns, hooves, and bones of goats. The same applies to <i>keilim</i> made from the body parts of other domesticated and undomesticated animals. <i>keilim</i> made from the bones of fowl, by contrast, are not susceptible to impurity with the sole exception of <i>keilim</i> made from the wings of an osprey and an ostrich egg that was coated. Since they resemble bones, they are susceptible to ritual impurity as a bone implement is. It appears to me that their impurity is of Rabbinic origin.",
            "<i>keilim</i> that are fashioned from the bones or the hide of sea-animals are pure. Everything from the sea is pure and is not susceptible to any form of impurity, including the impurity stemming from articles that contracted impurity from a <i>zav</i>. Even if one weaves a garment with \"wool\" growing in the sea, it is not susceptible to impurity.<br>This is implied by the phrase: \"garments or leather articles.\" According to the Oral Tradition, it was taught \"Just as it is only a garment that comes from plants that grow on the earth that is susceptible to ritual impurity, so too, only leather <i>keilim</i> that come from plants that grow on the earth are susceptible to ritual impurity.<br>The following law applies if one connected fabric from plants that grow in the sea with fabric from plants that grow on the earth, even if only by a thread or a fringe. If they were connected in a way that they are considered a single entity with regard to ritual impurity, i.e., if one became impure, the other became impure, the entire entity becomes susceptible to impurity.",
            "It appears to me that utensils made from the skin of a fowl are not susceptible to impurity like its bones. One might object, saying: Such skin is acceptable to have <i>tefillin</i> written upon it like the hide of a domesticated or undomesticated animal. [That objection can be refuted as follows:] The skin of a fish is not susceptible to ritual impurity. [Nevertheless,] were it not for its filth which never ceases, it would be acceptable to be used for <i>tefillin</i>. Thus it is derived that even an entity that is not susceptible to ritual impurity is acceptable to be used for <i>tefillin</i> if it is not characterized by filth.",
            "Glass <i>keilim</i> are not susceptible to ritual impurity according to Scriptural Law. Our Sages decreed that they would be susceptible to impurity. The rationale is that since, at the outset, they are made from sand like earthenware utensils, they are considered as earthenware utensils. Since their inside can be seen like their outside, the Sages did not decree that they would contract impurity from their inner space. Instead, the impurity must touch them, whether on the inside or the outside, as is true with regard to metal utensils. They did not establish this decree with regard to flat glass <i>keilim</i>, only those that serve as containers. Once such containers contract impurity, they cannot be purified in a <i>mikveh</i>. <i>Terumah</i> and sacrificial food is not burnt after contact with them, for it was decreed only that their state would be held in abeyance.",
            "Utensils made from animal turds, stone, or earth are always pure. They are not susceptible to any form of impurity, nor to the impurity that stems from articles that contracted impurity from a <i>zav</i>, neither according to Scriptural Law, nor according to Rabbinic Law, neither flat <i>keilim</i>, nor containers.",
            "When an elephant swallows thin branches and then excretes them as feces, if one fashions utensils from them, their status is unresolved. It was not determined whether they are considered as utensils made from feces or utensils made from wood as they would have been had they not been swallowed. When, however, a basket that had contracted impurity was swallowed by an elephant and was excreted as feces, it remains impure.",
            "Flat earthenware utensils, e.g., a lamp, a chair, a table, or the like made of earthenware are not susceptible to any of the types of impurity, nor to the impurity that stems from articles that contracted impurity from a <i>zav</i>, neither according to Scriptural Law, nor according to Rabbinic Law, as implied by the phrase, Leviticus 11:33: \"Into whose inner space one of them will fall.\" One can infer that any earthenware utensil that has a receptacle is susceptible to impurity. If it does not have a receptacle, it is pure.",
            "Metal <i>keilim</i>, whether flat, like knives or scissors, or containers like pots or kettles, are all susceptible to ritual impurity, as implied by Numbers 31:23: \"Any entity that will pass through fire,\" i.e., whether a container or a flat implement. Even a chest or a drawer, or the like that are made from metal and which contain 40 <i>se'ah</i> of liquid measure or more are susceptible to ritual impurity, as implied by the phrase: \"Any entity that will pass through fire.\"",
            "Containers made from wood, leather, or bone, e.g., a kneading trough, a drinking pouch, or the like, are susceptible to ritual impurity according to Scriptural Law. <i>Keilim</i> made from wood, leather, or bone that are flat, e.g., tablets, a chair, a leather mat on which one eats, and the like, by contrast, are susceptible to ritual impurity only according to Rabbinic Law, as implied by the phrase: \"From all wooden <i>keilim</i>... or sackcloth.\" According to the Oral Tradition, it was taught: \"Just as the sackcloth which is susceptible to ritual impurity has a receptacle, so too, <i>keilim</i> made from all the other substances mentioned must have a receptacle. <i>keilim</i> made from bone are governed by the same laws as those made from wood in all matters.<br>When does the statement that flat utensils made from these substances are susceptible to impurity only according to Rabbinic Law apply? With regard to all impurities other than the impurity contracted from a support that contracted impurity from a <i>zav</i>. With regard to the impurity resulting from a support that contracted impurity from a <i>zav</i> or others like him, they contract impurity according to Scriptural Law, as implied by Leviticus 15:4: \"Any surface on which one lies upon which a <i>zav</i> will lie.\" This includes everything made to lie upon or ride upon, as we explained. Similarly, glass <i>keilim</i> made to lie upon contract impurity according to Rabbinic Law.",
            "Any article that is woven, whether from wool, from linen, hemp, silk, or other fabrics that grow on land, is called a garment with regard to impurity. Felt is like a garment with regard to all matters.",
            "Sackcloth refers to threads of hair that are braided like a chain or woven like garments, whether they are made from goats' hair, camels' wool, the hairs of a tail of a horse or cow or the like. This applies whether they are woven like sacks or braided like a band for donkeys or the like. Ropes or strands, whether they are spun from goats' hair or from wool or linen are not susceptible to ritual impurity on their own accord.",
            "All utensils that are fashioned from reeds, from willow-branches, from bulrushes, from date branches, from leaves and branches, the bark of the tree, and grasses, e.g., small baskets, large baskets, rugs, or mats are all considered as wooden utensils, for anything that grows from the earth is considered as wood.<br>The same laws that govern earthenware utensils govern sandstone utensils. Any utensil that is made from earth or sand and is then burnt in a kiln is considered as an earthenware utensil. An oven, a range, a stove or the like, i.e., structures in which food is baked or cooked, all are susceptible to ritual impurity according to Scriptural Law. The laws governing their impurity are the same as those governing that of an earthenware utensil."

            "Whenever a person makes a receptacle, it is susceptible to impurity according to Scriptural Law regardless of its size. There is no minimum measure for a receptacle, provided it is made from a lasting substance that will be maintained.<br>What is implied? When a person makes a utensil from a hide that was not processed at all, from paper, even though the paper itself is not susceptible to impurity, or from the shells of pomegranates, nuts, or acorns, even if children hollowed out the shells to measure earth or they were prepared to be used for scales, the utensils are susceptible to ritual impurity. The rationale is that the deeds of a child, a deafmute, a mentally or emotionally compromised person and a minor are halachically significant, although their intent is not halachically significant.<br>If, however, one makes a utensil from a dried turnip, <i>esrog</i>, or squash, hollowing them out to measure with them or the like, they are pure, for it is impossible that they will last longer than a short while.",
            "All of the following - the horizontal rod of a scale and a leveling rod that have a receptacle where metal can be place, a peddler's pole that has a receptacle where coins can be stored, a wooden pole that has a place where water is stored, a staff that has a receptacle for a <i>mezuzah</i> or a place for a pearl, a wooden sharpener that has a receptacle for oil, a wooden writing tablet that has a receptacle for wax - are susceptible to ritual impurity according to Scriptural Law, because they have a receptacle, even though it may be of the smallest size.<br>According to Scriptural Law, it is only the receptacle that these <i>keilim</i> contain and the part of the <i>k'li</i> that serves the receptacle and that the receptacle requires that is susceptible to impurity. The remainder of a flat <i>k'li</i> that is not necessary for the receptacle, is pure according to Scriptural Law. It is susceptible to impurity according to Rabbinic Law, as we explained.",
            "When a receptacle is intended to be filled, it is not considered as a receptacle. What is implied? When a receptacle is hollowed out from a block of wood and then a metal anvil is inserted into it, if it is a blacksmith's, it is not susceptible to ritual impurity. Although it has a receptacle, it was made to be filled. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.<br>If the anvil was for jewelers, the <i>k'li</i> is susceptible to ritual impurity, because whenever they desire, they lift up the iron and collect the filings of gold and silver that collect there, under the anvil. Thus the hollow is meant to serve as a receptacle. Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.",
            "When a cup is carved below the legs of beds, chests, and the like, even though it is a receptacle, it is pure. It is considered as if it does not have a receptacle, because it is not intended to collect anything, but rather to support furniture.<br>A hollow piece of straw is susceptible to impurity like any wooden <i>k'li</i> that is susceptible to impurity even if it can only take in one drop. A hollow reed is not susceptible to impurity until all the white sap in it is removed. If it was not cut for the sake of taking in other substances, it is considered like other flat wooden <i>keilim</i>. The hollow stems of gall and the like are not considered as <i>keilim</i>, but rather as foods.",
            "When one cuts a straw, inserted a <i>mezuzah</i> inside of it, and then placed it inside a wall, it is susceptible to impurity even if he placed it in the wall with its open part pointed downward. If he affixed it to the wall, affixing it with its open part pointed upward, it is susceptible to impurity. If the open part is pointed downward, it is pure.<br>Should one place the straw in the wall and then insert the <i>mezuzah</i> inside, if the open part was pointing upward, it is susceptible to impurity. If the open part is pointing downward, it is pure. If he affixed it to the wall, even if its open part is pointing upward, it is pure.",

If it was made like a beehive that has no base, it is pure. if it has an opening where a covering can be placed, it is susceptible to impurity.",
            "A metal foot-covering for an animal is impure. If it is made from <i>sh'am</i>, it is pure, because that is not considered as a receptacle.",
            "When a person bundles a pearl in a hide and, after he removes it, a hollow is left, it is susceptible to impurity until it is smoothed out. For any container is considered a receptacle if it can hold even the slightest amount and, in the above instance, something resembling a small pocket is left. If, however, one bundles coins in a hide, it is not susceptible to impurity, because such a bundle does not have the form of container at all."

Conversely, any wooden <i>k'li</i> that is intended to be carried whether full or empty like a sack - even if it holds 100 <i>se'ah</i> and it has a base, since it is not intended to remain in one place - it is susceptible to ritual impurity according to Scriptural Law like other receptacles.<br>Whenever a <i>k'li's</i> use is undefined, if it has a base to rest upon on the ground so that it is not easily rolled and it could hold 40 <i>se'ah</i> of liquid measure which equals two <i>kor</i> in dry measure, it is not susceptible to impurity at all, neither according to Scriptural Law nor Rabbinic Law, because it can be assumed that it is not intended to be moved.<br>These principles are part of our received tradition. According to the Oral Tradition, it was taught that just as a sack is carried whether full or empty, so too, a wooden implement is not susceptible to impurity unless it would be carried full or empty. This excludes a wooden implement that is intended to remain in one place.",

Even though all of these five types of wooden <i>keilim</i> contain more than 40 <i>se'ah</i>, they are susceptible to impurity, because initially they were made to be carried while full.<br>It can be assumed that all other wooden containers that are made to hold 40 <i>se'ah</i> and that have a base are not meant to be carried when full. Therefore they are not susceptible to ritual impurity. Similarly, containers made of bone or leather that hold 40 <i>se'ah</i> of liquid measure are not susceptible to impurity unless they were initially made to be carried when they were full.",

When the container is measured, it is measured from the outside. If it is one cubit by one cubit with a height of three cubits, it is pure even though its inner space is less than that. For the thickness of the walls does not reduce its size. The breadth of its legs and the breadth of its border, if it has one, is not included in its measure.",

            "There are three categories of wooden implements that are not intended to serve as containers:<br>a) Any wooden implement that is made solely for human use, e.g., a ladder. It is pure. It is not susceptible to impurity at all, nor did our Sages decree that it should be included among the implements susceptible to impurity.<br>b) Any wooden implement that is made to be used for other implements and by a human, e.g., a table, a counter-top, a bed and the like. They are susceptible to ritual impurity. How is it known that they serve both a person and his accessories? Because one places plates on the table, cups on the counter-top, and spreads on the bed.<br>c) Any wooden implement that is made solely for the use of implements; thus it serves entities that serve man. If it only serves other implements during the time work is being performed with them, it is entirely pure, e.g., a wooden candelabrum that serves a lamp while it burns.<br>Similar laws apply to an implement placed under an implement while it is being used and all molds. If, however, it serves implements during the time work is being performed with them and when work is not being performed with them, they are susceptible to ritual impurity. Examples of such implements are: the covering for a box and the like; a sheath for a sword, a knife, a spear, scissors, a razor, a spoon used for blue eye paint, or a stylus used to write; a well used to store blue eye paint; a case for a writing tablet or a leather placemat, a carrier for arrows, a case for wide arrows, and a case for flutes. All of these and anything like them are susceptible to impurity even though they are only used to serve other implements.

If it was placed on two of the bedposts, and thus it is higher than the bed, even though the headboard is tied to the bed with cords, since it does not have feet, it is pure. The rationale is that the headboard only serves other implements at the time work is being performed with them, like the hanging boards of the Levites, upon which they would hang their harps and their instruments, which are pure.",

If it was intended to hold liquids, the measure is: enough for liquids to seep in when the container is placed in them.
