            "When there is a <i>tzara'at</i> affliction of human skin, the skin turns white, becoming as white as the membrane of an egg or whiter. Whiteness that is not as white as this membrane is not deemed <i>tzara'at</i>, but is instead a <i>bohak</i>.",
            "There are four shades of white that appear on human skin that cause a person to be deemed afflicted by <i>tzara'at</i>:<br>a) very intense white that resembles snow on human skin; it is called <i>baheret</i>.<br>b) a white that is slightly darker than that; it resembles the cleaned wool of a newborn sheep; it is called <i>si'ait</i>;<br>c) a white that is slightly darker than <i>si'ait</i>; it resembles the lime of the Temple building; it is a derivative of the <i>baheret</i> and is called <i>sapachat</i>;<br>d) a white that is slightly darker than the lime of the Temple building and which resembles the membrane of an egg; it is a derivative of the <i>si'ait</i> and is also called <i>sapachat</i>.<br>Thus one has learnt that the shade that is like the lime of the Temple building is a <i>sapachat</i> of the <i>baheret</i> and the shade that is like the membrane of an egg is a <i>sapachat</i> of the <i>si'ait</i>. For the meaning of the term <i>sapachat</i> is subsidiary. Based on the above, our Sages said: \"The shades of <i>tzara'at</i> blemishes are two which are four:\" <i>baheret</i> and its subsidiary and <i>si'ait</i> and its subsidiary.",
            "These four shades of <i>tzara'at</i> blemishes can all be joined with each other and are considered as a single blemish, whether this produces a more lenient ruling or a more stringent ruling, whether at the beginning of the observation of the blemish or at the conclusion of the seven days, whether after the person afflicted with <i>tzara'at</i> was released from impurity or definitely categorized as afflicted.<br>What is implied? Whether a blemish is entirely white like snow or like the lime of the Temple building or like clean wool or like the membrane of an egg or a blemish was varied in appearance, part of its whiteness was the shade of <i>baheret</i> and part was like the shade of <i>si'ait</i>, and part like the shade of <i>sapachat</i>, they are all considered as one appearance.<br>If so, why did the Sages count them and say, \"The shades of <i>tzara'at</i> blemishes are two which are four?\" So that one will understand the different appearances. For any priest who does not recognize the different appearances and their names when he is taught and informed, should not assess a blemish until he understands them and recognizes them and can say: \"This is <i>baheret</i> and this is its subsidiary. This is <i>si'ait</i> and this is its subsidiary.\"",
            "If in one of these four shades of a white hue there is a slight redness mixed in, it is also considered as a <i>tzara'at</i> blemish, as Leviticus 13:19 states: \"a white <i>baheret</i> with redness.\" This also applies to <i>si'ait</i> and to the subsidiary of <i>si'ait</i> and to the subsidiary of <i>baheret</i>. This hue that is a mixture of whiteness with a little redness is called <i>petuch</i>.<br>What is the appearance of <i>petuch</i> in these four shades? It is as if there are four cups filled with milk. In the first was mixed two drops of blood; in the second, there were four drops; in the third, eight drops; and in the fourth, sixteen drops. The <i>petuch</i> of a <i>baheret</i> is the fourth shade; the <i>petuch</i> of <i>si'ait</i> is the shade of the third cup; the <i>petuch</i> of the <i>sapachat</i> of a <i>baheret</i> is the shade of the second cup, and the <i>petuch</i> of the <i>sapachat</i> of <i>si'ait</i> is the shade of the first cup.",
            "All of these shades - whether the white or the <i>petuch</i> - can be joined with each other and are considered as a single appearance. This applies whether the blemish was entirely white or part of it was white and part with redness, it is all considered as a single blemish whether this leads to a more lenient ruling or a more stringent one.",
            "Any appearance of <i>tzara'at</i> on the skin of human flesh is not considered as a blemish and does not impart impurity unless the appearance of the blemish is deep, under the surface of the skin of the flesh. The intent is not only a blemish that can be felt as deep in the flesh, but also one that appears such; it appears like the sun's light that appears to the eye to be deeper than a shadow. If, however, the white shade or the <i>petuch</i> is on the same level as the remainder of the flesh or raised above the flesh, it is not a <i>tzara'at</i> blemish, but rather a rash like other rashes that erupt on the body.",
            "The minimum measure for all blemishes of <i>tzara'at</i>, whether <i>tzara'at</i> of humans or <i>tzara'at</i> of garments, is the size of a Cilikian <i>gris</i>, which is square. This is a square place on the skin of the flesh where 36 hairs could grow, i.e., six hairs in length and six hairs in width. Anything smaller than this is not considered as a <i>tzara'at</i> blemish.",
            "When the width of a blemish is only a place to grow five hairs, it is pure and it is not considered as a <i>tzara'at</i> blemish, even if it was a cubit in length. It must be at least a square <i>gris</i> in size. All of the minimum measures are halachot transmitted to Moses at Sinai.",
            "Whenever a <i>baheret</i> is spoken of, the same laws apply to the remainder of the four shades of white or those of a <i>petuch</i>, provided the blemish is a <i>gris</i> in size and is deeper than the surface of the skin of the flesh. This is what we refer to as a <i>baheret</i> without further explanation.<br>A <i>baheret</i> that is very intense white, like snow appears dark on the flesh of an albino. And one that is dark appears intensely white on a black man. Therefore we consider the shade as it would appear on a person of average complexion, neither an albino or a black man.",
            "There are three signs that indicate ritual impurity with regard to <i>tzara'at</i> on the skin of human flesh: white hair, healthy flesh in the midst of a blemish, and expansion. All three are explicitly mentioned in the Torah.<br>What is implied? If a <i>baheret</i> erupts on a person's skin and in its midst there is white hair or a portion of healthy flesh, when the priest sees it, he will rule definitely, saying: \"He is impure.\" If it does not have either white hairs or healthy flesh, he should be isolated for seven days. On the seventh day, the priest sees him again. If the <i>baheret</i> grew white hair or healthy flesh or if it expanded and increased, he is definitively categorized as impure. If neither white hair nor healthy flesh grew, nor did the <i>baheret</i> expand on his skin, he should be isolated for a second week. If any of the three signs occur, he is definitively categorized as impure. If not, he is pure and he is sent away. The rationale is that blemishes on the skin of human flesh do not require isolation for more than two weeks. If the blemish expands - or white hair or healthy flesh grows in it - after he was sent away and deemed pure, he is definitively categorized as impure.",
            "When a <i>baheret</i> was originally intensely white like snow and, after isolation, it appeared only as the membrane of an egg, or, originally, it appeared like the membrane of an egg and its intensity increased and it appeared as snow, it is considered in its original state, for an increase in the intensity of the appearance of a blemish is not a sign of impurity, nor is a darkening of it a sign of purity unless it becomes darker than the four shades described above, i.e., darker than the membrane of an egg. In such an instance, it is classified as a <i>bohak</i> and he is pure. If so, what is meant by the Torah's statement: \"The blemish became darker and did not expand on the flesh, the priest should declare him pure?\" That if it became darker than the four shades, he is pure, Similarly, if it did not become darker, but did not expand, nor grew white hair or healthy flesh, he is pure."

            "The white hair that is a sign of impurity for <i>tzara'at</i> is not less than two hairs. How long must they be? Long enough to be pulled out by tweezers. If one was long and the other was shorter than this measure or one was black and one white, or one was whole below but split in two above and so it appeared as two, or its base was black, but its top was white, the person is pure. If its base was white and its top dark, even though only the slightest amount was white, he is impure.",
            "When there are two white hairs in a blemish, even though there is black hair between them and they are scattered, one in this portion and one in another portion, they serve as a sign of impurity. Even if the blemish was exactly the size of a <i>gris</i>, the space of the black hair does not reduce its size.<br>Whether the two hairs are in the midst of the <i>baheret</i> and it surrounds them or they are at its edge, the person is impure. If, however, they are at its side, outside of it, he is pure. The skin from which the two white hairs grow must be white in order to impart impurity.<br>If the two hairs originate in the midst of the blemish, but lie out of it, he is impure. If they originate outside of it, but lie within it, they are not a sign of impurity.",
            "Any shade of whiteness in the hair causes the person to be deemed impure, whether they were white as snow or a very weak shade of whiteness. Since they appear white, he is impure.",
            "White hair is not a sign of impurity unless it is inside the <i>baheret</i> itself.<br>What is implied? If there is a <i>baheret</i> and in its midst there is a boil, burnt skin, a <i>bohak</i>, a boil that has healed, a burn that has healed and there were two white hairs in the boil, the burnt flesh, or the <i>bohak</i> that is in the midst of the blemish, they are not signs of impurity. It is like a <i>baheret</i> that does not have white hair, in which instance, the person should be isolated. This ruling is rendered even though the <i>baheret</i> surrounds the boil, the burnt flesh, the healed boil or burnt flesh or the <i>bohak</i> in which the two hairs were located.<br>Similarly, if the boil, the burnt flesh, the healed boil or burnt flesh or the <i>bohak</i> surround the two hairs, they are not a sign of impurity. The <i>baheret</i> is like a <i>baheret</i> that does not have white hair and the person should be isolated.",
            "If the boil, the <i>bohak</i>, or the burnt flesh that surround, are next to, or divide the white hairs disappear and thus the two hairs are found in the <i>baheret</i> itself at the end of the first week or the end of the second week of the isolation period, the person is declared as definitively impure. If these abnormal skin features do not disappear, he should be released from the process of inspection.",
            "White hair is not a sign of impurity unless the <i>baheret</i> precedes the white hair. This can be inferred from Leviticus 13:10: \"And it turned hair to white.\" Implied is that the <i>baheret</i> caused it to turn white. If, however, the white hair existed before the <i>baheret</i>, it is like a <i>baheret</i> that does not have a sign and the person should be isolated.",
            "The following rule applies when a person had a <i>baheret</i> which contained white hair which caused him to be deemed definitively impure, and afterwards, the <i>baheret</i> disappeared and left the white hair in its place. He was then deemed pure. Afterwards, another <i>baheret</i> returned to the place of the first <i>baheret</i> and thus there was white hair in its midst. This hair is called \"entrusted hair.\" It is not a sign of impurity. The phrase \"And it turned hair to white\" implies that the <i>baheret</i> in question must cause the color of the hair to change and not another <i>baheret</i>.",
            "The following rules apply if a person had a <i>baheret</i> the size of a <i>gris</i>, it contained two white hairs, and therefore he was deemed definitively impure. A portion half the size of a <i>gris</i> disappeared and he was deemed pure. The two hairs were located in the portion half the size of a <i>gris</i> that remained. Afterwards, half a <i>gris</i> returned to the place where the half that disappeared was. Thus there were two white hairs in a <i>baheret</i> the size of a <i>gris</i>. This is not considered a sign of impurity, for one entire <i>baheret</i> must cause the color of the two hairs to change.",
            "When a person had a <i>baheret</i> that was half the size of a <i>gris</i> without any white hair inside of it and then another <i>baheret</i> that was half the size of a <i>gris</i> which contained one white hair erupted at its side, the person should be isolated. If a person had a <i>baheret</i> that was half the size of a <i>gris</i> with one white hair inside of it and then another <i>baheret</i> that was half the size of a <i>gris</i> which contained one white hair erupted at its side, the person should be isolated. When a person had a <i>baheret</i> that was half the size of a <i>gris</i> which contained two white hairs and then another <i>baheret</i> that was half the size of a <i>gris</i> which contained one white hair erupted at its side, this person should be isolated.

The rationale is that a <i>baheret</i> preceded the two white hairs.<br>When there is a doubt whether the white hair came first or the <i>baheret</i> came first, the person is deemed impure. It appears to me that this impurity is of a questionable nature."

            "Flesh that heals is not considered as a sign of impurity unless it is the size of a lentil when a square is imposed upon it or more. How large is that? Enough for four hairs to grow, two lengthwise and two widthwise. The flesh that heals must be in the center of the <i>baheret</i> and the <i>baheret</i> must surround it on all sides with there being a margin of the size of two hairs or more between the healthy flesh and the edge of the <i>baheret</i>. If, however, the healthy flesh is at the side of the <i>baheret</i>, it is not a sign of impurity.<br>If the healthy flesh was scattered in different places in the <i>baheret</i>, e.g., there was healthy flesh the size of a mustard seed in one place and healthy flesh the size of a mustard seed in another place, they are not combined to be considered as the size of a lentil even though they are both in the midst of the same <i>baheret</i>. Instead, there must be healthy flesh the size of a lentil when a square is imposed upon it or more in one place in the midst of the <i>baheret</i>.",

Even though the healthy flesh is in the midst of the <i>baheret</i>, it is not a sign of impurity, because it is within the boil, the burnt flesh, the <i>bohak</i>, or their healed flesh.

Instead, each one independently is a sign of impurity. They were mentioned together only to identify the measure of healthy flesh that imparts impurity: enough to contain enough white hair to cause a person to be deemed impure, i.e., two hairs.",

If the size of the <i>baheret</i> or the size of the healthy flesh was diminished, he is pure. Similarly, if the size of the healthy flesh in this <i>baheret</i> increased, he is pure. The rationale is that a <i>baheret</i> does not impart impurity because of healthy flesh until it has a margin of afflicted flesh the width of two hairs on every side.<br>If the healthy flesh was less than a lentil and then it increased until it reached the size of a lentil, the afflicted person should be deemed definitively impure.

The pronouncement must be made by a priest, because Deuteronomy 21:5 states: \"Their statements will determine every quarrel and every blemish.\" Even if a priest is a minor or intellectually or emotionally incapable, the sage instructs him and he declares the person definitively impure, releases him from the inspection process, or isolates him.<br>When does the above apply? When the priest relies on the words of the sage. If, however, the priest assesses the blemish and relies on his own understanding, it is forbidden for him to assess any blemish unless he is instructed by a master and is thoroughly versed in all the blemishes and their names, including the blemishes that affect a person and those that affect clothes and houses.",
            "A priest who declared a person who was pure as impure or a person who was impure as pure does not affect his status, as can be inferred from Leviticus 13:44: \"He is impure and the priest shall deem him impure\" and <i>ibid.</i>:37: \"He is pure and the priest shall declare him pure.\" When a person who contacted <i>tzara'at</i> is healed, either after isolation or after having been deemed definitively impure, he remains impure even for several years,until a priest tells him: \"You are pure.\"",

The priest who inspected a blemish initially should be the one who inspects it at the end of the first week and at the end of the second week. He is the one who places the person in isolation, deems him definitively impure, or releases him from the inspection process.<br>If the priest who initially inspected the blemish dies or becomes sick, another priest should inspect it. The second priest cannot deem it impure because its size increased, because only the first priest can tell whether it increased or not.<br>A priest's word is accepted if he says: \"This blemish increased in size\" or \"This blemish did not increase in size,\" \"This white hair preceded the blemish,\" or \"This blemish preceded the white hair.\"",

Nor should it be inspected at noon, because then a brighter hue of white will look darker.<br>When should it be inspected? In the fourth hour after sunrise, in the fifth hour, in the eighth hour, and in the ninth hour. This applies to blemishes on a person's body, those on garments, and those on buildings.",

If the seventh day of a person's isolation falls on the Sabbath or a holiday, the inspection is postponed. This leads to both leniencies and stringencies. For it is possible that the blemish would have been deemed impure on the Sabbath and, on the following day, the signs of impurity will have disappeared. Conversely, it is possible that, on the Sabbath, the blemish would have been deemed pure and on the following day, signs of impurity will appear. The determination of one's status is made only at the time of the inspection after the Sabbath.",

Similarly, if a blemish appears on his garments or his home, it is not inspected until after the seven days of his celebration. Similarly, during a festival, he is given all the days of the festival before an inspection is made, as indicated by Leviticus 14:36: \"And the priest shall give a command and they will empty the home.\" Now if the Torah postponed the matter for the sake of concerns that are merely permitted, i.e., so that one's utensils not be deemed impure, the inference can certainly be made, that judgment should be postponed for a mitzvah.",

If male, he is inspected while naked, standing like one who is hoeing and like one who is harvesting olives. If female, she is inspected while naked, sitting on the ground like one who is kneading dough, like one who nurses her child, or like one who weaves with a standing loom, in which instance she raises her right hand until she reveals her underarm.<br>If a blemish can be detected when a man or a woman is in these positions, he or she is impure. If it cannot be detected in such a position, no attention is paid to it. Just as a person appears for the inspection of his blemish, so must he appear for his shaving. If hair could be found on any portion of his flesh when a man is standing naked like one who is hoeing or like one who is harvesting olives or a woman is sitting in the position described, the shaving is acceptable.

A fourth of a <i>log</i> of \"living water\" that is fit to be sanctified as water for the sprinkling of the ashes of the red heifer is placed in it. This measure is a Rabbinic institution.<br>Two sparrows that are kosher must be brought for the sake of purifying a <i>tzara'at</i> affliction, as Leviticus 14:4 states: \"For the one who is to be purified will be taken....\" He should slaughter the healthier of the two over the water in the earthenware vessel and squeeze out the blood until it is apparent over the water. He then digs a hole and buries the slaughtered bird in the presence of the afflicted person. This is one of the points received through the Oral Tradition.<br>He takes a cedar branch - the mitzvah is that it be a cubit long and a fourth the thickness of a bedpost. And he takes a hyssop whose name is not described by an additional term, as we explained, that is not less than a handbreadth long, and a crimson strand weighing a <i>shekel</i>. If one used the dye for another purpose, it is disqualified, as is the rule regarding dyeing wool with blue dye to use for <i>tzitzit</i>. All of these measures are laws transmitted to Moses at Sinai.<br>A priest takes the three items mentioned above together with the living fowl. All these four items are fundamental requirements. When the cedar branch and the hyssop have been peeled, they are invalid. The hyssop should be bound together with the cedar branch with the crimson thread. The tips of the wings and the tips of the tail of the living bird should be held close to them and the four should be dipped in the water in the container and the blood floating on top of it.

He stands in the town and casts it outside the wall.

How does he shave him? He passes a razor over all his skin that is visible including his underarms and pubic region until his entire flesh is smooth like a squash, as <i>ibid.</i>:9 states: \"He shall shave all of his hair.\" If so, why does the verse mention his beard and his eye-brows? To include everything like them and to exclude the hair in the nose, because it is not visible.<br>Afterwards, he \"launders\" his garments, immerses himself, and becomes pure with regard to conveying impurity when he enters a building or to the article on which he lies or sits. He may enter within the town's wall. He counts seven days. During them, he is forbidden to engage in physical intimacy, as alluded to by <i>ibid.</i>:8: \"outside his tent.\" This teaches that he is forbidden physical intimacy. A woman afflicted by <i>tzara'at</i>, by contrast, is permitted physical intimacy.",
            "For the duration of these seven days, he is still considered as a primary source of impurity and imparts impurity to people and to utensils when touching them, but not when being carried by them. This is indicated by Leviticus 14:9 which states: \"And it shall be on the seventh day,... he shall launder his garments....\" This teaches that before then, he imparted impurity to his garments. Just as he would impart impurity to his garments by touching them, so too, he would impart impurity to a person when touching him, for any source of impurity that imparts impurity to garments, imparts impurity to humans.<br>On the seventh day, the priests shaves him a second time like the first. He \"launders\" and immerses himself, thus becoming pure with regarding to imparting impurity to others. He is like all those who immersed and will become pure in the evening.

From the time that it was slaughtered.<br>When it was slaughtered, but there was no hyssop, cedar branch, or scarlet cord, it is nevertheless, forbidden to benefit from the slaughtered fowl. The rationale is that slaughter which is not befitting is still considered as slaughter. A person who partakes of an olive-sized portion of the slaughtered fowl violates a positive commandment and a negative commandment. For Deuteronomy 14:12 states: \"These are what you may not eat from them.\" According to the Oral Tradition, it was taught that the wording also includes the fowl that was slaughtered in this purification process. And it is written <i>ibid.</i>:11: \"You shall eat all pure fowl.\" This is a positive commandment. From it, however, one can infer a prohibition: that other species may not be eaten.

These two signs can be combined with each other.<br>When an affliction is intense green or red, the garment is placed in isolation. If this sign remains for two consecutive weeks, the garment is deemed impure and burnt. Similarly, if the size of the affliction increases, the garment is deemed impure and burnt.<br>What is implied?

Instead it is a sign and a wonder prevalent among the Jewish people to warn them against <i>lashon hora</i>, \"undesirable speech.\" When a person speaks <i>lashon hora</i>, the walls of his house change color. If he repents, the house will be purified. If, however, he persists in his wickedness until the house is destroyed, the leather implements in his house upon which he sits and lies change color. If he repents, they will be purified. If persists in his wickedness until they are burnt, the clothes he wears change color. If he repents, they will be purified.

Remember what God your Lord did to Miriam.\" Now, this is what the Torah is implying: Contemplate what happened to the prophetess Miriam. She spoke against her brother. She was older than he was; she had raised him; and she had endangered herself to save him from the sea. She did not speak pejoratively of him; she merely erred in equating him with the other prophets. Moses did not object to any of this, as Numbers 12:3 relates: \"And the man Moses was exceedingly humble.\" Nevertheless, she was immediately punished with <i>tzara'at</i>. Certainly, an inference can be made with regard to the wicked and foolish men who speak extensively about great and wondrous matters. Therefore a person who seeks to structure his course of conduct should distance himself from their gatherings and from speaking to them so that he will not become caught up in the web of their wickedness and foolishness.<br>This is the path followed by the gathering of wicked fools: In the beginning, they speak excessively about empty matters, as Ecclesiastes 5:2 states: \"The talk of a fool is characterized by a multitude of words.\" As a result of this, they come to speak negatively of the righteous, as reflected by the verse Psalms 31:19: \"May the lying lips be silenced; those which speak falsehood about a righteous man.\" As a consequence, they will become accustomed to speaking against the prophets and casting aspersions on their words, as reflected by the verse II Chronicles 36:16: \"They would abuse the messengers of God, scorn His words, and mock His prophets.\" And this would lead them to deny God's existence entirely, as reflected in the verse II Kings 17:9: \"And the children of Israel spoke in secret things that were not true against God, their Lord.\"<br>In this vein, Psalms 73:9 states: \"They set their mouths against Heaven and their tongues strut on earth.\" What caused them to \"set their mouths against Heaven\"? Their tongues which previously were given free reign on earth. This is the speech of the wicked that is caused by loitering on the streetcorners, frequenting the assemblies of commoners, and spending time at the parties of drunkards.<br>In contrast, the speech of proper Jewish people only concerns words of Torah and wisdom. Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, assists them and grants them merit because of it, as Malachi 3:16 states: \"Then those who fear God conversed, each person with his fellow and God listened and paid heed. And a book of remembrance was composed before Him for those who fear God and contemplate His name.\""
