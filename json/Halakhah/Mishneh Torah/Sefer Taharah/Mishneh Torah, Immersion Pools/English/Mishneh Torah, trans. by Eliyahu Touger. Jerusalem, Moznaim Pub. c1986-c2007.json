            "All impure entities - whether humans or <i>keilim</i>, whether they contracted a severe impurity of Scriptural origin or whether they contracted Rabbinic impurity - regain purity only through immersion in water that is collected in a pool in the ground.",
            "Whenever the Torah mentions washing one's flesh or laundering one's garments from impurity, the intent is solely the immersion of the entire body or article in a <i>mikveh</i>. The phrase, Leviticus 15:11: \"And he did not wash his hands in water,\" also refers to the immersion of the entire body. This also applies to other impure people. If one immersed himself entirely with the exception of the tip of his little finger, he is still ritually impure.<br>Although all of these matters have their source in the Oral Tradition, Leviticus 11:32 does state: \"He shall enter water; he remains impure until the evening and then he becomes pure.\" This rule is then applied with regard to all those impure: They must enter water.",
            "All <i>keilim</i> that contract impurity can be purified through immersion in a <i>mikveh</i> with the exception of an earthenware container, a glass <i>k'li</i>, and a reed mat.<br>With regard to an earthenware container, Leviticus 11:33 states: \"You shall break it,\" implying that its purification comes only through breaking it. Even if it was joined to the earth, even affixed to it with a nail, and even if it was filled with lime or gypsum, it retains its impurity until it is broken. Our Sages considered glass <i>keilim</i> like earthenware containers in this respect.",
            "A reed mat is not included among the <i>keilim</i> that are susceptible to other types of impurity. Since it does not have a receptacle, it is not in the category of the wooden <i>keilim</i> mentioned by the Torah. Nevertheless, since it is fit to lie upon, it was included among the <i>keilim</i> susceptible to <i>midras</i> impurity according to Scriptural Law. Now since there is no explicit mention of its association with purity and impurity in the Torah and yet, it was included among the articles that contract impurity, it was not included with regard to purification through immersion in a <i>mikveh</i>. For only <i>keilim</i> mentioned in the Torah can be purified in a <i>mikveh</i>. A reed mat can be purified only by being torn to the extent that there remain less than six handbreadths by six handbreadths.",
            "A <i>zav</i> can be purified only through immersion in a stream, for Leviticus 15:13 states that he must immerse \"in living water.\" A <i>zavah</i> and other persons and <i>keilim</i> that are impure may immerse or be immersed in a <i>mikveh</i>.",
            "All those obligated to immerse may immerse during the day with the exception of a <i>nidah</i> and a woman after childbirth. They must immerse at night, as we explained with regard to the laws of <i>nidah</i>. One who has a seminal emission may immerse throughout the entire day from the beginning of the night. This is derived from Deuteronomy 23:12 which states: \"And it shall be that toward evening, he shall immerse in water.\" This teaches that he may immerse and continue in his state from the beginning of the night until the night falls the following day.",
            "All those who immerse should immerse their entire bodies while naked at one time. If the person has hair, all of his hair must be immersed; it is considered as part of his body according to Scriptural Law.<br>Whenever impure individuals immersed while wearing clothes, the immersion is acceptable, because the water passes through the clothes and they do not intervene. Similarly, if a <i>nidah</i> immerses in her clothes, she is permitted to resume relations with her husband.",
            "All those who immerse must have the intent to purify themselves through immersion. If one did not have such an intent, the immersion is acceptable with regard to ordinary foods. Even a <i>nidah</i> who immerses without intent, e.g., she fell into water or descended into water to cool off, is permitted to her husband. Nevertheless, with regard to <i>terumah</i> and sacrificial food, she is not considered pure until she immerses with the proper intent.",
            "When a person ties his hands and feet and is seated in an irrigation canal, if the water covers his body entirely, he is pure.<br>When a person jumps into a <i>mikveh</i>, it is reprehensible. When one immerses in a <i>mikveh</i> twice, it is reprehensible. When one tells a friend: \"Place your hand upon me in the <i>mikveh</i>,\" it is reprehensible.",
            "Water from the <i>mikveh</i> need not seep into the non-visible portions or the creases of a person's body, as implied by the verse: \"And he did not wash his hands in water.\" It can be inferred that it is necessary only that visible portions of the body be in contact with the water. Nevertheless, the non-visible portions must be fit for water to reach them without there being any intervening substances upon them. Therefore, our Sages instructed: At home, a person should always teach that a woman should rinse between the folds of her body and then immerse.<br>A woman should immerse as she stands normally when weaving or when nursing her child.",
            "A woman should not immerse in a harbor, because she will be embarrassed because of the inhabitants of the city and will not immerse properly. If mats were erected as a screen for the purpose of modesty, she may immerse in a harbor. A woman should not immerse while standing on an earthenware container, on a basket, or the like, because she will be afraid of falling and the immersion will not be acceptable.",
            "When either a human or a <i>k'li</i> is immersed, there should not be any intervening substance between them and the water. If there is an any intervening substance between them and the water - for example, there was dough or mud clinging to the flesh of a person or the substance of a <i>k'li</i> - the person or the <i>k'li</i> is impure as it was originally and the immersion is invaild.<br>According to Scriptural Law, if there is an intervening substance covering the larger portion of the person's body or the larger portion of the <i>k'li</i>, the immersion is invalid, provided he objects to the intervening substance and would like to remove it. If, however, he does not object to it and does not pay attention whether it would be removed or not, it is not considered an intervening substance, even if it covers the major portion of the person or the <i>k'li</i>. Similarly, if it covers less than half a person's body, it is not considered as an intervening substance even if he objects to it. According to Rabbinic decree, any intervening substance that one objects to invalidates an immersion even if it covers only the lesser portion of the person's body. This is a decree, lest such a substance cover the greater portion of the person's body. And any intervening substance that covers the larger portion of the person's body disqualifies the immersion even if he does not object to it. This is a decree, lest a substance that one objects to cover the greater portion of his body.<br>Thus if even a drop the size of a mustard seed of an intervening substance, e.g., dough, tar, or the like, was on a person's flesh or on the substance of a <i>k'li</i>, and he objects to it, his immersion is disqualified. If he does not object to it, the immersion is acceptable unless the intervening substance covers the major portion of the <i>k'li</i> or the person, as explained."

            "These are the substances that intervene for a person: the secretion outside the eye, the fluid outside a wound that crusts, dried blood over a wound, a bandage over a wound, crusts of filth on one's flesh, dough or mud under one's nails, particles of mud or dough that collect on one's flesh, thick mud, potters' clay, and mud that is found in the thoroughfares at all times, even in the summer. All of these substances intervene. Other mud does not intervene when wet, because it will dissolve in the water. When it is dry, it is considered as an intervening substance.",
            "When the following: honey, ink, milk, blood, and the sap of berry bushes, fig trees, wild fig trees, and carob trees are dry, they are considered intervening substances. When they are moist, they are not. The sap of other fruits are considered as intervening substances whether moist or dry.<br>Blood that sticks to the flesh, even if it is moist, is considered an intervening substance. A loosely hanging limb or flesh is considered an intervening substance.",
            "A woman's hidden area is considered to have intervening substances present unless she washes before her immersion, because that portion of the body is always sweaty and dust collects there and intervenes.<br>To whom does the above apply? To a married woman. Different rules apply for an unmarried woman. Since she is not concerned about the cleanliness of that area, it is not considered to have intervening substances present.",
            "The following rules apply to bandages on a wound, metal plates on a broken bone, necklaces, noserings, choker necklaces, and rings. When they are firm and cling to the flesh, they are considered as intervening substances. If they are loose, they are not considered as intervening substances.",
            "Strands of wool, strands of flax, and straps that women tie to their heads as adornments are intervening substances, because they separate between the body and the water. Strands of hair are not considered intervening substances, because water penetrates through them, even when they are not loose.",
            "Strands tied around one's neck, even of flax, are not considered as intervening substances, because a woman does not strangle herself with them. Tight necklaces, e.g., choker necklaces and necklets, are intervening substances, because a woman chokes herself with them to look fat.",
            "Hair over the heart that became tangled and matted and similarly, matted hairs of the beard are intervening substances.",
            "When an arrow is stuck in a person's flesh, if it is visible, it is considered an intervening substance. If it is not visible, he may immerse in a <i>mikveh</i> and partake of <i>terumah</i> in the evening even though the arrow itself is impure. Similarly, if a person swallowed an impure ring and immersed, he is pure. If he vomited it out after immersing, he contracts impurity, because of contact with it. For, as we explained, any entities swallowed within the body of a living being, do not impart impurity or contract impurity.<br>If pebbles or splinters enter the cracks on the soles of a person's feet, they are considered as intervening substances.",
            "When there is a bandage, a compress, or a dressing over the hidden parts of a person's body, they are considered as intervening substances. The rationale is that even though water need not enter these parts, they must be fit for water to enter them and not have any intervening substances upon them, as we explained.<br>If there was one or two hairs that were outside the wound, but their tips were stuck to the wound, there were two hairs with mud or filth stuck to their tips, or there were two hairs from one's upper eyelashes that were perforated and hairs from one's lower eyelashes were threaded through them, they are considered an intervening substance.",
            "A person should not immerse with dust on his feet. If, however, he did, the dust is not an intervening substance.",
            "When one holds another person or an implement and immerses them, they remain impure. This applies even if he loosens his hand and allows water to reach the person or the article being immersed. This is a decree, lest he not loosen his hand. If he rinses his hand in water first, the immersion is acceptable.",
            "When a woman slings her infant son over her back and immerses, the immersion is not acceptable, for perhaps there was mud on the infant's feet or hands and it became attached to his mother at the time of her immersion and intervened between her body and the water, but it fell off after she emerged.",
            "When a woman who was a <i>nidah</i> put her hair in her mouth, clenched her fists, pursed her lips, or a bone was discovered between her teeth, it is as if she did not immerse. This applies to other impure individuals as well.<br>If she placed coins in her mouth and descended and immersed, she is purified from <i>nidah</i> impurity, but she is impure because of her spittle. Thus she is a primary derivative of impurity, like one who touched the spittle of a <i>nidah</i>. The same laws apply with regard to a <i>zav</i>.",
            "These are the substances that do not intervene for a human: the matted hair of the head, the arm pits, and the hidden parts of a man, the secretions of the eye, the scab above a wound, moist drops of filth on his skin, filth that is under a nail, a loose-hanging nail, and the thin hair that is on the skin of a child. All of these substances are not considered as intervening.",
            "When two or more hairs are knotted in one knot, they are not considered as an intervening substance, because the water can penetrate through them. If one hair is knotted, it is considered an intervening substance, provided the person is particular about it. If, however, he is not particular about it, his immersion is acceptable unless the larger portion of his hair is tied individually hair by hair. This is the ruling of the <i>Geonim</i>.<br>It appears to me that a person's hair is considered like his body with regard to immersion and is not a separate entity to the extent that it is inappropriate to speak of \"the larger portion of his hair.\" Instead, even though all of a person's hair is tied hair by hair, if the person is not particular about the matter, his immersion is acceptable unless the hairs are combined with another intervening substance on his body and thus there are intervening substances covering the larger portion of his body, as we explained. The laws mentioned here apply equally to a woman in the <i>nidah</i> state and to other impure people who have hair on their heads.",
            "Ezra ordained that a woman should comb out her hair and then immerse. If it is possible for her to comb out her hair at night and immerse immediately thereafter, it is praiseworthy. In a pressing situation or when there is a question of sickness, she may comb out her hair - say - on Friday and immerse Saturday night.",
            "The following rules apply when a woman immersed and then an intervening substance was found upon her that disqualified her immersion. If she immersed on the same day that she prepared herself, she does not have to prepare herself again. Instead, she may remove the intervening substance and immerse again immediately. If not, she must prepare herself a second time and then immerse.",
            "A woman should not comb out her hair with natron, because it causes the hairs to snap, nor with oak sap, because it snarls the hair. Instead, she should use hot water, even water heated in the sun, because it hardens the hair and enables it to be combed out. Cold water, by contrast, tangles the hair and causes it to contract and thus become intertwined.",
            "When a <i>nidah</i> gave cooked food to her son and then immersed, the immersion is invalid because of the fatty substances on her hand.",
            "The following laws apply if a woman scratched her skin to the extent that it bled and then immersed. If the immersion was within three days of the bleeding, the place of the scratches is not considered as intervening. After three days, it is considered as intervening because the blood coagulates there, like a scab on the wound.<br>Similar concepts apply with regard to secretion in the eye. If it is dry and has begun to change color, it is considered as an intervening substance for a <i>nidah</i>.",
            "Blue ointment in the eye is not considered as an intervening substance. If it is outside the eye, it is considered as an intervening substance. If her eyes open and close frequently, even the ointment outside the eye, it is not considered as an intervening substance.",
            "If, while immersing, a woman opened her eyes to a great extent or closed them very firmly, the immersion is not acceptable.<br>With regard to what does the above apply? With regard to immersion to partake or touch pure foods. With regard to permitting intimacy with her husband, by contrast, she is permitted even if she gave cooked food to her son, she had an old scratch, there was blue ointment above her eye, or she opened her eyes very widely or closed them tightly. The rationale is that all of these matters and other similar ones are considered as intervening only according to Rabbinic Law and the Sages ordained their decree with regard to pure foods, but not with regard to intimacy.<br>Whenever a substance is considered as intervening for a <i>nidah</i> with regard to pure foods, it is considered as intervening for other impure people with regard to pure foods and as intervening for a convert when immersing during conversion.",
            "When a person immersed and after he ascended an intervening substance was found upon his body, even though he was involved with that substance for the entire day after the immersion, he is considered as impure unless he says: \"I know with certainty that this substance was not upon me before the immersion.\" The rationale is that since he was categorized as impure, he is presumed to remain in that state until it is known for certain that he regained purity."

If it is on the outside, it is not an intervening substance. When does the above apply? To a <i>k'li</i> in a craftsman's shop. When one belongs to a homeowner, whether the tar is on the inside or on the outside, it is an intervening substance.<br>When there is tar on a large pot or on a bowl, whether it is on the inside or on the outside, whether it belongs to a homeowner or comes from a craftsman's shop, it is considered as intervening.",

If the surfaces are dirty, the foreign substances are not considered as intervening, because he does not object to their presence.",

If they were found on the saddle placed on a donkey belonging to an ordinary homeowner, they are considered intervening. If found on the wineskins placed on a donkey, they are not considered as intervening; on both sides of its saddle-blanket, they are considered intervening.",

Similar laws apply in all analogous situations.<br>If a butcher also sold oily substances and both blood and oily substances were found on his clothes, there is an unresolved question whether they are considered as intervening, because there are two stains, or whether they are not considered as intervening, since this is his work and hence he does not object to their presence.",
            "If tar, mortar, or the like were present on the inside of a sandal, on its upper surface, it is intervening; on its lower surface, it is not intervening.

            "Spots of filth on a chair and a carriage top that have been laundered, whether in the inside or on the outside, whether below or on the sides, are not intervening, because the water will wash them away. Filth coming from dregs left in a cup and a bottle, cotton on the inside of a necklace or inside a bell, and mud or dough on the handle of a hatchet or a rake are not considered as intervening. Should they harden, they are considered as intervening.",
            "It is clear that whenever we have said that tar, mortar, or the like do not intervene for <i>keilim</i>, the rationale is that the owner does not object to their presence. Therefore, if the larger portion of the <i>k'li</i> was covered with tar, mortar, or the like, its immersion is invalid, even though the owner does not object, as we explained. There is no difference in this context regarding any particular type of <i>k'li</i>. Instead, all <i>keilim</i> are the same in this regard.",
            "Whenever the handles of a <i>k'li</i> are hollow and were inserted into a <i>mikveh</i> upside down, they were inserted in the ordinary manner, but they were not thoroughly washed out, or they were of metal and they were bent out of shape, their immersion is invalid.",
            "When one turned the opening of a container upside down and immersed it, it is as if it was not immersed, because the water will not enter it entirely. If a utensil has a portion into which water will not enter unless it is tilted to its side, its immersion is not valid until it is tilted to its side.",

The following rules apply to a container holding water mixed with the ashes of the red heifer. If the greater portion of the container was empty, so that the quantity of <i>mikveh</i> water would be greater than that of the water mixed with the ashes of the red heifer, the container is pure.

If the greater portion of the container was empty so that there would be more water than milk or wine, it is pure. This leniency is granted, because the impurity is of Rabbinic origin. If it contained red wine or other liquids, the immersion is not effective.",

If he inclined it on its side and immersed it, the immersion is not acceptable for the <i>keilim</i> inside of it unless the opening is as wide as the mouthpiece of a drinking pouch. Similarly, if the larger <i>k'li</i> is pure and one placed impure <i>keilim</i> and immersed them together, the immersion is not acceptable for the <i>keilim</i> inside of it unless the opening is as wide as the mouthpiece of a drinking pouch.<br>When does the above apply?

Our Sages measured this figure as a cubit by a cubit by a height of three cubits. This measure contains 40 <i>se'ah</i> of water. According to Scriptural Law, the water is acceptable whether drawn or not.",

Moreover, if there was a body of water that was not drawn and three <i>lugim</i> of drawn water fell into it, the entire body of water is invalidated.<br>Although the disqualification of drawn water is a Rabbinic decree, our Sages explained it based on an association found in a Biblical verse. Leviticus, <i>op. cit.</i>, states: \"Only a spring, a cistern, or a gathering of water shall be pure.\" Based on a comparison of the terms used in the verse, they explained: The water of \"a spring\" is not dependent on man's activity at all. The water of \"a cistern\" is entirely dependent on man's activity, for it contains drawn water entirely. Our Sages said: The \"gathering of water\" should not be entirely made up of drawn water like a cistern, nor need it come entirely from the hand of heaven. Instead, if it came into being partially through human effort, it is acceptable.",

When a person places barrels on top of a roof to dry, but it rained and they became filled with water, even though it is during the rainy season, he may break the barrels or turn them over and the water collected from them is acceptable for immersion.

Similarly, immersion in a <i>mikveh</i> to ascend from impurity is included in the category of <i>chukim</i>, because impurity is not mud or filth that can be washed away with water. Instead, the immersion is a Scriptural decree and requires the focusing the intent of one's heart. Therefore our Sages said: \"When one immersed, but did not intend to purify himself,\" it is as if he did not immerse.<br>Although it is a Scriptural decree, there is an allusion involved: One who focuses his heart on purifying himself becomes purified once he immerses, even though there was no change in his body. Similarly, one who focuses his heart on purifying his soul from the impurities of the soul, which are wicked thoughts and bad character traits, becomes purified when he resolves within his heart to distance himself from such counsel and immerse his soul in the waters of knowledge. And Ezekiel 36:25 states: \"I will pour over you pure water and you will be purified from all your impurities and from all your false deities, I will purify you.\""
