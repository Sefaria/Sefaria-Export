            "The admonition of jealousy<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">קנא usually has the connotation of jealousy. There are, however, instances where it has the meaning \"warning,\" as in Joel 2:18.</i> stated in the Torah [Numbers 5:14], \"And he will adjure his wife,\" means the following. He tells her in the presence of witnesses: \"Do not enter into privacy with this and this man.\"<br>This applies even if the man [under suspicion] is her father, her brother, a gentile, a servant or a man who is impotent and incapable of having an erection or fathering a child.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The intent in all these examples is that it is unlikely that the woman would engage in adultery with such a man: the father and the brother because of the family connection, the gentile or the servant because we assume that a modest Jewish woman would not associate with such people, and the impotent man because of his physical condition. By citing such examples, the Rambam implies that surely such a warning can be given with regard to any ordinary man.</i>",
            "The term \"enter into privacy\" mentioned in the Torah [<i>Ibid.</i>:13] refers to entering into privacy with the man concerning whom she was warned, in the presence of two witnesses, not to enter into privacy.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These can be the same two witnesses in whose presence the warning was administered (<i>Hilchot Edut</i> 21:5).</i><br>If she remains with him long enough to engage in relations - i.e., the amount of time necessary to roast an egg and swallow it,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We suspect that she committed adultery.</i> she is forbidden to her husband<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As stated in <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 11:14, a woman who commits adultery is forbidden to her husband.

In an era when [the probe of] the waters of the <i>sotah</i> is unavailable, she is forbidden to her husband forever and is divorced without receiving the [money due her by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For it is her immodest behavior that caused her to become forbidden (<i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 24:24).</i>",

            "If he told her in the presence of two [men]: \"Do not speak to so and so,\" this is not considered to be a warning. Even if she enters into privacy with him in the presence of witnesses and remains there long enough to engage in relations, she is not forbidden to [her husband], nor can she be required to drink [the bitter water] because of such a warning.",
            "Similarly, if he told her, \"Do not enter into privacy with him,\" and witnesses saw her speaking with him, she is not considered to be having entered into privacy. She is not forbidden to [her husband], nor can she be required to drink [the bitter water].<br>Similarly, if she was not warned at all, and two witnesses came and testified that she entered into privacy with a man and remained long enough to engage in relations, she is not forbidden to [her husband],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Entering into privacy (<i>yichud</i>) with another man is forbidden (<i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i>, ch. 22). Nevertheless, <i>Kiddushin</i> 81a states that as long as a warning was not given, such an act is not sufficient cause for a woman to be forbidden to her husband.</i> nor can she be required to drink [the bitter water].",
            "If he told her: \"Do not enter into privacy with so and so,\" and named a boy below the age of nine,\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Implied is that the warning is effective after a boy reaches the age of nine, for from the age of nine a boy is fit to engage in sexual relations, as explained in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 11:3. Rav Ovadiah of Bertinoro (<i>Sotah</i> 4:4) differs and maintains that a youth must attain majority before a warning is effective. There are several Midrashic sources for the Rambam's ruling.</i> or he told her: \"Do not enter into privacy with this animal,\" this is not a [binding] warning.<br>[These laws are derived as follows:] The Torah [<i>ibid.</i>] states: \"And a man had relations with her.\" This excludes a minor and an animal. She is not forbidden to her husband because of them.",
            "When a husband forgoes a warning before his wife enters into privacy with [the man in question], the warning is nullified, and it is as if he had never issued a warning to her [regarding him]. If, however, he forgoes the warning after she enters into privacy with him, the warning cannot be nullified.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And she must drink the bitter water.<br>The rationale for this ruling is that as long as the woman has not entered into privacy with the other man, the husband's warning has not been reinforced by her conduct. Accordingly, since he has authority over his warning, he can withdraw it. When, however, she has already entered into privacy with the other man, she is already required by the Torah to drink the bitter water. Her husband has no authority over the Torah's requirement, and thus, he can no longer withdraw his warning (<i>Likkutei Sichos</i>, Vol. IV). See also the gloss of the <i>Tzafnat Paneach</i> to this halachah.</i><br>If he divorces his wife, it is as if he has nullified the warning. If he remarries her, he must issue a second warning [for her to be bound by it].",
            "If [the husband] issued a warning to [his wife] in the presence of two [witnesses] and then saw her enter into privacy with the man concerning whom she was warned, and she remained long enough to engage in relations, she becomes forbidden to him. He must divorce her and pay her [the money due her by virtue of her] <i>ketubah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this instance, the husband is required to pay his wife the money due her by virtue of her <i>ketubah</i> because, although he is bound by the evidence of his own eyes, it is not sufficient to require his wife to drink the bitter water. For that, the testimony of two witnesses is necessary.</i><br>Similarly, if he hears people gossiping about her after she has been warned, that she entered into privacy with the man in question, to the extent that the women who weave at night by the moonlight chatter about her, saying that she committed adultery with the man concerning whom she has been warned, her husband is forbidden to remain married to her and must instead divorce her and pay her [the money due her by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam is speaking about an instance when, despite the gossip generated about the woman, there is no (or only one) witness who can testify about her entering into privacy with the man involved. Hence, because of her immodest conduct, he must divorce her. He must, however, pay the money due her by virtue of her <i>ketubah</i>, because, as stated in <i>Sotah</i> 6b, the bitter water will not test the chastity of a woman whose immodest conduct has become public knowledge.</i>",
            "[The following rules apply when] one witness comes and testifies that, after a warning was issued, she entered into privacy with the man concerning whom she was warned and remained long enough to engage in relations. If [the husband] considers [the witness] to be faithful, and he relies on him, he must divorce her and pay her [the money due her by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the testimony of one witness is not sufficient to require her to drink the bitter water, and yet the husband relies on the testimony of the witness, she is forbidden to the husband, but he must bear the financial burden of the prohibition. (See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 24:17.)</i> If [he does] not [rely on that person], his wife remains permitted to him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For a woman does not become forbidden until two witnesses testify that she entered into privacy with the man in question.</i>",
            "The court should issue a warning to the following women [who are suspected of immodest behavior]: a woman whose husband has become a deaf-mute or has lost control of his mental faculties, one whose husband is overseas or one whose husband is imprisoned. The intent is not to have [such a woman] drink [the bitter water],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For that is possible only when a warning was administered by the husband, as stated in the following halachah.</i> but rather to disqualify her from receiving [the money due her by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the men in question are incapable of acting on their own, the court takes the initiative on their behalf. The court's action has two objectives: to maintain the moral standard of the Jewish people, and if that fails, to protect the husband's interest and cause a woman who acts immodestly to pay the penalty for her conduct.</i>",
            "What is implied? If the court hears that people are gossiping about [a particular woman], they call her and tell her: \"Do not enter into privacy with so and so.\" If witnesses come afterwards and testify that she entered into privacy with the man concerning whom she was warned, and remained long enough to engage in relations, the court prohibits her [from engaging in relations] with her husband forever and tears up her marriage contract.<br>When her husband returns, regains his health or is released from prison, he must give her a <i>get</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From the commentaries, it appears that he is required to do so; he does not have an option.</i> He cannot require her to drink [the bitter water], because he did not administer the warning himself.",
            "[The following rules apply if a woman was required to] drink the bitter water [because of her husband's suspicion of a particular man] and did not die as a result of it, and afterwards, her husband gave her a warning with regard to that same man. If she enters into privacy with him, he cannot make her drink because of him a second time. Instead, she becomes forbidden to her husband forever and must be divorced without receiving [the money due her by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this instance as well, entering into privacy with the man is considered an immodest act, sufficient cause for the woman to forfeit the money due her by virtue of her <i>ketubah</i>.</i><br>If, however, her husband issued a warning to her regarding another man, and she entered into privacy with him in the presence of witnesses, she can be forced to drink the waters again. Indeed, this can happen several times, provided each time her husband has her drink because of another man.",
            "If a woman's husband had her drink [the bitter water] because of a specific man and then divorced her and she remarried, her second husband can issue a warning to her with regard to the same man. If she enters into privacy with him, her husband can make her drink [the bitter water], because he is her second husband. Even if a hundred men married this woman one after the other, they can all have her drink [the bitter water] because of this same man.",
            "[The following laws apply if] a woman was warned by her husband and then entered into privacy [with the man in question] after the warning, thus causing her to be required to drink [the bitter water]. If [even] one witness comes and states that she engaged in sexual relations with the man regarding whom she was warned in his presence, the woman is forbidden to her husband forever.

Generally, the Torah requires two witnesses for all matters involving marital law (<i>Sotah</i> 31b).

This causes her to be forbidden to her husband forever, to be prevented from drinking [the bitter water] and to be divorced without receiving [the money due her by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i>.<br>[The rationale is] that since the Torah accepts the testimony of one witness with regard to [the woman's] adultery [we see that the formal laws of testimony do not apply]. Therefore, anyone's testimony is accepted with regard to this matter.<br>Even the five women who we assume hate each other<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As stated in <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 12:16, these women are the woman's mother-in-law, her mother-in-law's daughter, her husband's other wife, her <i>yevamah</i> and her husband's daughter from another marriage.</i> can offer testimony regarding each other,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's wording refers to the following concept. Generally, because of the bad feelings that characterize the relationship between these pairs, testimony is also disqualified in the reverse of the above situations. For example, if the husband of the daughter of a woman's husband is missing, the woman may not testify about the matter, although she has no natural reason to hate the other woman.</i> saying that they committed adultery [in these circumstances].

We assume that these women would desire to discredit her entirely and cause her to forfeit this money. Since without their testimony, the woman is forbidden to her husband until she drinks the bitter water and forfeits the money due her by virtue of her <i>ketubah</i>, their testimony abets her position rather than harms it. (Indeed, note the gloss of Rabbi Akiva Eiger, who questions why the testimony of these women is accepted at all.)</i>",

Thus, the testimony of the second witness cannot nullify the testimony of the first witness, which is considered to be equivalent to [that of] two witnesses.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This principle applies not only with regard to a <i>sotah</i>, but with regard to all instances in which one witness's testimony is considered equivalent to that of two witnesses (<i>Sotah</i> 31b) - e.g., testimony regarding the death of a woman's husband (<i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 12:18).</i>",

At the outset, a warning should not be given.)<br>Significantly, Rabbi Akiva was noted for his love of his fellow man, as he stated: \"'Love your fellow man as yourself,'... this is a great general principle within the Torah.\" This implies - and so is evident from the continuation of the Rambam's words - that the warning is not an instrument of strife, but rather is intended to prompt love and closeness.</i> [as implied by Numbers 5:14] \"And he shall warn his wife.\" [Our Sages said that] whoever issues a warning to his wife has become possessed by a spirit of purity.<br>A warning should not be issued in a spirit of levity, nor in the midst of conversation, nor with frivolity, nor in the midst of an argument, nor with the purpose of instilling fear.<br>If, however, a man transgressed and issued a warning to his wife under such circumstances, the warning is binding.",
            "It is not proper for a man to rush and at the outset issue a warning in the presence of witnesses.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For this is likely to cause shame and embarrassment and prevent healthy communication between husband and wife. If, however, a warning that was delivered gently and in private is not effective, then the husband should warn his wife in the presence of witnesses.</i> Instead, he should [first speak to his wife] privately and gently, in a spirit of purity and caution, in order to guide her to the proper path and remove obstacles.<br>Whenever a person is not careful regarding [the conduct of] his wife, his sons and the members of his household, warning them,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., giving them gentle warnings, as mentioned in the first clause of this halachah.</i> and scrutinizing their ways at all times so that he knows that they are perfect without sin or transgression, he is himself a sinner, as [implied by Job 5:24]: \"And you shall know that your tent is at peace and scrutinize your dwelling, and you shall not sin.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One may infer that failing to invest oneself in such scrutiny is sinful.</i>"
