            "The warning that is mentioned in the Torah - \"And he warned his wife\" - is that he tells her in the presence of witnesses, \"Do not seclude yourself with Mr. so-and-so,\" even if that man is her father, her brother, a gentile, a slave, or an impotent person who cannot achieve an erection or produce children.\"",
            "The seclusion mentioned in the Torah - \"And she secludes herself\" - is that she secludes herself with the same man about whom her husband had told her, \"Do not seclude yourself with him,\" in the presence of two witnesses. If she remained with him long enough to defile herself, which is the time it takes to roast an egg and swallow it, then she is forbidden to her husband until she drinks the bitter waters and the matter is examined. And when there are no Sotah waters, she becomes forbidden to her husband forever and she leaves the marriage without a kesubah.",
            "If he warns her about two people simultaneously and he tells her, \"Do not seclude yourself with so-and-so and so-and-so,\" and she secludes herself with both of them simultaneously, and she remains with them long enough to defile herself, then even if the two men are her brothers or her father and brother, she is forbidden to her husband until she will drink the Sotah waters.",
            "If he tells her in the presence of two witnesses, \"Do not speak with so-and-so,\" that is an invalid warning. And even if she secludes herself with that man in the presence of witnesses and remains with him long enough to defile herself, she does not become forbidden to him and need not drink the Sotah waters based on this warning.",
            "And similarly, if he told her, \"Do not seclude yourself with him,\" and witnesses see her speaking with him, this is an invalid seclusion, and she does not become forbidden to her husband, and she need not drink the Sotah waters. And similarly, if the warning did not precede the arrival two witnesses who testify that she secluded herself with someone and remained with him a duration long enough to defile herself, then she is not forbidden to her husband and she need not drink the Sotah waters."
