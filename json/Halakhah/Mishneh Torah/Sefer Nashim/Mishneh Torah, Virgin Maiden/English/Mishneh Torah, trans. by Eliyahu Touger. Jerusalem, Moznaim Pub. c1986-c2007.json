            "When a man seduces a virgin,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Between the ages of three and twelve and a half, as evident from Halachah 8. See Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 177:1).</i> he is fined 50 <i>sela'im</i> of pure silver.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Eruvin</i> 1:12 and <i>Hilchot Shekalim</i> 1:2, where the Rambam describes the weight of this coin. According to the figures he gives in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Bechorot</i> 8:8), in contemporary measure a <i>sela</i> is 19.2 grams. According to the <i>Piskei Siddur</i> of Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, it is 20.4 grams.</i> This is called a <i>k'nas</i> (\"fine\"). The same law applies if he rapes her.<br>Payment of this fine is one of the Torah's positive commandments,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 220), which describes this mitzvah as \"the commandment we have been given with regard to a man who seduces [a virgin].\" (See also <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, Mitzvah 61.)<br>Both in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the payment of the fine by a seducer, a rapist and one who issues a slanderous report appears to be included in the same mitzvah (<i>Nachalat Efrayim</i>).<br><i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 5:8 states that the cases involving laws governing a seducer and a rapist are to be tried by judges with <i>semichah</i>, a qualification that is not possessed by Rabbinical judges in the post-Talmudic period. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 177:2) states that in the present age, a seducer and a rapist should be compelled to satisfy the girl's father for the damage they have caused.</i>, as [Deuteronomy 22:29] states: \"The man who raped her must give the maiden's father 50 silver pieces.\"",
            "What is meant by a seducer, and what is meant by a rapist? A seducer is one who enters into relations with a girl with her consent; a rapist is one who takes her by force.<br>Whenever a man entered into relations with a woman in a field, we operate under the presumption that he raped her, and apply those laws<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned in the following halachah, a rapist must marry the woman he raped, while a seducer need not. And, as mentioned in Chapter 2, Halachah 1, a rapist must also reimburse the woman for the pain and embarrassment he caused her.</i> unless witnesses testify that she entered into relations with him willingly.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, explaining that unless there are witnesses to the relations, the woman has no way of proving her claim against the man. The <i>Migdal Oz</i> explains that this refers to an instance where witnesses saw the man and the woman engage in relations from afar and were not able to determine whether she was seduced or raped.<br>The assumptions mentioned by the Rambam are based on the passage (stated with regard to a consecrated maiden, Deuteronomy 23:24-27): \"This is the law when a virgin maiden was consecrated to one man and another man meets her in the city and has relations with her. Both of them should be executed, [i.e., we assume the girl consented]... because she did not cry out in the city.... If the man encountered the maiden who was consecrated in the field..., the girl has not committed a sin... for the man attacked her in the field..., where there was no one to come to her aid.\"</i> Whenever a man enters into relations with a woman in a city, we operate under the presumption that she consented, because she did not cry out, unless witnesses testify that she was raped - e.g., he pulled out a sword and told her, \"If you cry out, I will kill you.\"",
            "When a girl who was seduced does not want to marry the seducer, or her father does not want to give her in marriage to him,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 22:16 states: \"If her father refuses to allow him to marry her...,\" and <i>Ketubot</i> 39b explains that the girl is also given the option of rejecting the man.</i> or if [the seducer] does not want to marry her, he may pay the fine and depart. We do not force him to marry her.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The simple meaning of the passage from Exodus implies that the seducer should marry the girl, but <i>Ketubot</i> 40a explains that this is not a binding obligation.</i><br>If they do desire [to wed], and he marries her, he does not pay a fine.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He does, however, pay damages, as stated in Chapter 2, Halachah 7.</i> Instead, he writes her a <i>ketubah</i>, as is written for other maidens.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., she is given a <i>ketubah</i> of 200 <i>zuzim</i>, as is given to other virgin maidens (<i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 11:4), despite the fact that she was not a virgin at the time of the marriage (<i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i>). <i>Mishneh LaMelech</i> explains that this concept is derived from Exodus 22:16, which states: \"he must pay the usual dowry money for virgins.\"<br><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Yevamot</i> 60a) and the Nimukei Yosef differ and maintain that the girl is given a <i>ketubah</i> of only 100 <i>zuzim</i> as is given to non-virgins.</i><br>When, however, a woman who is raped or her father do not desire that she marry the rapist, they have that prerogative. [In such an instance,] he must pay the fine and depart. If she and her father desire [that the marriage take place], but he does not desire, we force him to marry her, aside from paying the fine, as [Deuteronomy 22:29] states: \"He must take [the maiden] as his wife\"; this is a positive commandment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 218). See also <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 557).</i><br>Even if the girl is lame, blind, or afflicted with leprosy,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this halachah, the Rambam uses the Biblical term <i>tzara'at</i>, although generally he uses the Rabbinic term <i>mukeh sh'chin</i>. See Chapter 3, Halachah 4, and the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>.</i> he is forced to marry her and he may never take the initiative in divorcing her,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If, however, the woman wants to be divorced, the rapist may divorce her [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 177:3)].</i> as [the above verse continues]: \"He may not send her away as long as he lives.\" This is a negative commandment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 358). See also <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 558).</i>",
            "[This girl] is not granted a <i>ketubah</i>. For our Sages instituted the requirement of a <i>ketubah</i> so that [a husband] will not consider divorce a frivolous matter. [In this instance this is unnecessary, because] the man cannot divorce [his wife].",
            "If the girl he raped was forbidden to him,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Torah does not require him to marry a woman with whom there is any prohibition whatsoever.</i> even if the prohibition stems from a positive commandment, or she was a <i>sh'niyah</i> [or forbidden by other Rabbinic prohibitions],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For all Rabbinic prohibitions have the source in the Torah's commandment to observe the rulings of our Sages.</i> he should not marry her. Similarly, if he discovers adulterous behavior<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For a husband is forbidden to engage in marital relations with an adulterous wife, as stated in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 24:17. See the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 177:4, who emphasizes that the intent is that witnesses observed the actual commission of adultery, not merely immodest behavior that suggests adultery.<br>See also Chapter 3, Halachah 5.</i> on her part after he marries her, he should divorce her. [These concepts are implied by the phrase: \"He must take [the girl] as his wife\" [which our Sages interpreted to mean]: \"She must be fit to be his wife.\"",
            "When a High Priest rapes or seduces a virgin maiden, he should not marry her, because he is commanded to marry a virgin,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Leviticus 21:13; <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 1:8.</i> and at the time he marries this girl she is not a virgin.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although her lack of virginity is a result of his deed, she is still forbidden to him. See <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 17:16.</i> If he marries [this girl], he must divorce her.",
            "Although it is said with regard to a rapist: \"He may not send her away as long as he lives,\" since [this prohibition] is preceded by a positive commandment, as it is said, \"He must take [the girl] as his wife,\" the Torah made the prohibition [rectifiable] by the observance of the positive commandment. Thus, this is a negative commandment [whose violation] can be rectified by [the observance of] a positive commandment. Lashes are not given [as punishment for the violation of such a commandment] unless one does not fulfill the positive commandment, as will be explained in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chapter 18, Halachah 2.</i><br>Therefore, when a rapist violates [this prohibition] and divorces [his wife], he is compelled to remarry her and is not punished by lashes. If, however, his divorcee dies or is consecrated by another man<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">At which point her husband is forbidden to remarry her, as stated in <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 11:12.</i> before he remarries her, or if he is a priest, who is forbidden to marry a divorcee, he should be punished by lashes. For he transgressed the negative commandment, and is unable to fulfill the positive commandment associated with it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although he did not personally prevent the positive commandment from being observed, since he is no longer able to observe it, he must bear the consequences of his violation of the prohibition.</i>",
            "Neither a rapist nor a seducer is liable to pay the fine unless he engages in relations in the ordinary fashion,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., vaginal and not anal intercourse. The Rambam's ruling is not accepted by the Ra'avad and Rabbenu Asher, who cite <i>Kiddushin</i> 9b-10a in support of their conception.<br>The <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> supports the Rambam's ruling, based on <i>Sanhedrin</i> 73b, which states that the man is not liable until he inserts the entire penis into the vagina, explaining that it is only then that the woman will lose her virginity. Since she will never lose her virginity through anal intercourse, the man is not held liable.</i> and the relations are observed by witnesses.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For a person who admits his culpability in matters punishable by a fine is not liable. See Chapter 2, Halachah 12 and notes.</i> A warning is not necessary.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For a warning is necessary only before infliction of the punishments of execution or lashing.</i><br>At what age is a girl fit to be paid a fine? From the age of three<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although there are times when the Hebrew term <i>na'arah</i>, translated as \"maiden,\" has a more specific meaning (see <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 2:1), <i>Ketubot</i> 40b explains that in this instance the intent is also a girl below the age of twelve.<br>Although most <i>Rishonim</i> agree with the Rambam, there are, however, significant authorities who rule that a fine need not be paid until the girl reaches the age of <i>na'arut</i>.</i> until she reaches the age of <i>bagrut</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Generally, this refers to a girl of the age of twelve and a half who has manifested signs of physical maturity. If a girl does not manifest signs of physical maturity, she is not considered a <i>bogeret</i> until the age of 20 or 35. See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 2:1-4.</i> If a man engages in relations with a girl less than three years old, the relations are not significant.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For her hymen will grow back, as implied by <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 3:11.</i> If he engages in relations with her after she reaches the age of <i>bagrut</i>, he is not fined.

            "Whether or not [a girl's] father is alive, a fine must be paid.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the Torah states that the fine should be paid to the father, it is necessary to clarify that the fine must be paid even if the father is not alive.</i><br>A fine need not be paid [because of relations] with the following women: a <i>bogeret</i>, a girl who has dissolved a marriage through <i>mi'un</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned in <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 11;1, when a girl below the age of majority marries without being consecrated by her father, she can nullify the marriage without a formal divorce.

See Chapter 2, Halachot 10-11.<br>Note Rav David Arameah, who states that this applies only when she is a <i>na'arah</i>.

            "[The following rules apply with regard to] a convert, a girl who was taken captive, and a [Canaanite] maidservant who was freed:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As the Rambam states in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 11:2, we operate under the presumption that these women have engaged in relations previously: a convert and a Canaanite maidservant because non-Jews' morals are considered to be weak, and a woman held captive because she is at the mercy of her captors.</i> If she was converted, redeemed or freed before she reached the age of three, she is entitled to a fine.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even if she engaged in relations before the age of three, her hymen will grow back, as stated in the notes on Halachah 8.</i><br>If she was three years old [or older] when she was converted, redeemed or freed, she is not entitled to a fine.

            "[The following rules apply when] the virgin [who was raped or seduced] was forbidden to the rapist or the seducer. If the prohibition was punishable by <i>karet</i> - e.g., she was his sister, his aunt, in the <i>niddah</i> state or the like - or she was forbidden by virtue of a negative commandment [that does not involve either <i>karet</i> or execution], he is not liable for a fine if he was given a warning.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As stated in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 12:2 and 16:4, a person receives corporal punishment for the commission of a transgression only when he has been warned previously.</i> [Instead,] he should be lashed.

The Rambam himself states (<i>Hilchot Chovel UMazik</i> 4:5-6) that if the man did not intend to strike the woman, he is liable to pay damages to her heirs.<br>In that source, he explains that the leniency granted by the verse applies when the man intended to strike the woman, but did not intend to kill her.</i> as it is written [<i>Ibid.</i>]: \"If men strive and a woman receives a blow....\" This teaches that with regard to a [fatal] accident, Scripture did not differentiate between an intentional and unintentional act to free him from monetary obligation.<br>And [Leviticus 24:18-21] says: \"A person who [fatally] strikes an animal shall reimburse [its owner] for it, and one who [fatally] strikes a man must die.\" Just as Scripture did not distinguish between intentional and unintentional action for killing an animal to make him liable for payment, so too, it did not distinguish between intentional and unintentional action for killing a person to free him from financial obligation.",

            "The fine of 50 silver pieces represents merely the payment for the pleasure of sexual relations.

[A seducer is not required to make this payment,] because a girl who willingly engages in relations does not [suffer] pain.

If a man rapes a <i>bogeret</i> or a girl who had dissolved her marriage via <i>mi'un</i>, although a fine is not required to be paid, compensation is also required for embarrassment damages and pain.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A fine is not required for a <i>bogeret</i>, because the verse mentions a <i>na'arah</i>, a younger maiden. Nevertheless, if one seduces a <i>bogeret</i>, no fine is required, because she willingly accepted any damages and embarrassment.<br>With regard to a minor who has dissolved her marriage through <i>mi'un</i>, we are obviously speaking of a girl who did not engage in sexual relations as a minor and was still a virgin. Although she is not entitled to a fine, since she was a virgin, she does receive damages. The commentaries have questioned the distinction between such a woman and a woman who is divorced after <i>nisu'in</i>, but is still a virgin.</i> And a man who rapes a mentally incompetent girl or a deaf mute is required to make compensation for pain.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He is not liable to make compensation for the embarrassment and damages because these women are not entitled to damages, because they have no financial worth; they would not be purchased if sold as slaves. (See <i>Ketubot</i> 32a, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 80a.) And with regard to embarrassment, since they are mentally incompetent, they suffer no embarrassment.<br>(Compare, however, to <i>Hilchot Chovel UMazik</i> 3:4, which states that a mentally incompetent person is not reimbursed for embarrassment, but a deaf mute is.)</i> One who seduces any of these girls is not liable at all.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For, as mentioned previously, a girl who is seduced does not suffer pain, and she either forgoes or need not be reimbursed for damages and embarrassment.</i>",
            "A person is not ever liable to pay a fine because of his own admission. Instead, he is made liable by the testimony of witnesses.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a principle that applies not only with regard to the fine in question, but with regard to all <i>k'nasot</i> levied by the Torah. To explain: There are two types of monetary penalties levied by the Torah: a) <i>nezek</i>, damages - i.e., compensation for personal injury and/or loss of property - and <i>k'nas</i>, a fine, payment required by the Torah over and above what a person would be held liable for damages.<br>Although a person is liable for <i>nezek</i> when he makes an admission of guilt, he is not held liable for a <i>k'nas</i> unless his guilt is established by witnesses. (See <i>Hilchot Nizkei Mammon</i> 2:8 and <i>Hilchot Geneivah</i> 3:7.) Moreover, even if he admits his guilt and then witnesses come, he is not liable for payment of the <i>k'nas</i>.</i> Therefore, [if a man] says: \"I raped or seduced the daughter of so and so,\" he is not liable to pay a fine. He must, however, make restitution for the embarrassment and the damages [he caused].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned in the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, the Rambam's statements here are in direct contradiction to his statements in <i>Hilchot Chovel UMazik</i> 5:6, where he states that when a person admits injuring a colleague, but there are no witnesses who testify to the matter, he is not liable for the damages and the pain, but is liable for the injured's unemployment, embarrassment and medical treatment. (As reflected by the commentaries on <i>Hilchot Chovel UMazik</i>, this ruling is contested by many authorities.)<br>The Rambam's descendant, Rav Yehoshua, attempts to reconcile the Rambam's rulings, explaining that the laws governing the injuries suffered by a raped or seduced maiden differ from those governing other types of injury.</i><br>Similarly, when a maiden files a legal claim against a man, saying \"You raped me,\" or \"You seduced me,\" and he denies the matter entirely, he is required to take a Rabbinic oath<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">More precisely, the term used is <i>sh'vuat hesset</i>, a Rabbinic oath of lesser severity. See <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 11:13 and <i>Hilchot To'en V'Nit'an</i> 1:3.</i> to support his claim, for if he admits his culpability, he would be liable for the embarrassment, the damages and the pain.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam is emphasizing that if the only issue were the <i>k'nas</i>, the man would not be held liable for an oath, because this oath was instituted to encourage the defendant to admit his guilt. With regard to the <i>k'nas</i>, this admission would be of no significance, because his liability is dependent only on the testimony of witnesses. Nevertheless, since there is also a claim for damages, and on that matter his admission would make him liable, he is required to take an oath.</i>",
            "If a girl claims, \"You raped me,\" and the man claims, \"No, I seduced you,\" he is required to take an oath mandated by Scriptural law with regard to [the compensation for] the pain, and he must pay the damages and the embarrassment. [The oath is required] because he admitted a portion of the claim [made against him], as will be explained in [the section dealing with that subject].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As explained in <i>Hilchot To'en V'Nit'an</i> 1:1, whenever a person admits a portion of the claim against him, he is required by Scriptural law to take an oath stating his lack of liability to the remaining portion of the claim.<br>The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam, because, as mentioned in the following halachah, the payment for these damages goes to the girl's father and not to her herself. Hence, the situation resembles the case (<i>Sh'vuot</i> 38b) where a person claims \"You owe my father 100 <i>zuzim</i>,\" and the defendant states, \"I owe him only 50,\" in which instance the defendant is not required to take an oath, because the person making the claim is not the one to whom the money is paid.<br>It is possible, the Ra'avad continues, for the father to make a definite claim that his daughter was raped. But it must be established that this indeed was the case.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> justifies the Rambam's ruling, explaining that this instance is unique. Although the money goes to the girl's father, she and not her father is considered to be the plaintiff.</i>",
            "The three payments made because of seduction, and the four payments made because of rape are made to the girl's father, for all the monetary benefit that accrues during a girl's youth belongs to her father.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When the girl manifests physical signs of maturity at the ordinary times, the period of \"youth\" mentioned here continues until she is twelve and a half. During that time, as mentioned in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 3:11, the father is entitled to consecrate his daughter and receive the money given for consecration, and to receive any benefits from her labor.</i><br>If her father is no longer alive [at the time of the rape or the seduction], [these payments are made] to her.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And not to any other heirs of her father's estate. With regard to the <i>k'nas</i>, the money is not considered to be owed the father until the defendant denies the debt in court (for if he agreed to the claim, he would not be obligated to pay the fine). Therefore, the money owed because of the fine is not considered part of the father's estate. See <i>Or Sameach</i>.</i>",
            "When a girl who was raped or seduced does not file a claim until [either] she reaches <i>bagrut</i>, she marries, or her father dies,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam on this point, stating that this money is considered part of the father's estate, and belongs to his heirs. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and others, however, question the reason for the difference, noting that the Rambam's opinion is based on an explicit <i>mishnah</i>.</i> she herself is entitled to the three or four payments [mentioned above].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In all the instances mentioned, she leaves her father's domain and assumes independent responsibility for her own financial concerns. Although the event for which the person becomes liable took place before the girl has assumed financial independence, since a claim was not issued at that time, she and not her father (or his heirs) is entitled to the money.<br><i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> states that this supports the thesis of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> mentioned in the notes on Halachah 13, that the girl herself is the plaintiff.</i><br>If she appeared in court and filed a claim for payment, and then she reached <i>bagrut</i> or she married, the father is entitled to the payments. If the father dies after she files a claim for payment in court, the payments belong to her brothers, for they are her father's heirs. [The rationale is that] once she files a claim for payment in court, her father is considered to have acquired the payments.",
            "When a girl was consecrated and then divorced, she is entitled to the fine, but only that.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">But not to the payment for damages; that is awarded to her father. As mentioned in the notes on Chapter 1, Halachah 9, our Sages derived from the exegesis of Deuteronomy 22:29 that when a girl has been consecrated, she is entitled to the fine. But that applies only to the fine and not to the damages (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). Rabbenu Asher differs and maintains that she is also entitled to the damages, for she is no longer within her father's domain.</i> If she was raped or seduced, and afterwards, she becomes consecrated to another [man], her father is entitled to the fine and the damages, for consecration does not take a girl out of her father's domain [and nullify his rights over her].",
            "I maintain that [the intent of] the Torah's statement [Leviticus 19:29], \"Do not defile your daughter to have her play the harlot,\" is that a father should not say: \"Since the obligation of the Torah for a seducer or a rapist was solely that he should give the father money, I will hire my virgin daughter to someone to have relations with her for whatever price I desire, or I will allow him to have relations for her without charge. For a man has the right to forgo monetary rights to him to any person he desires.\" To counter such thoughts, it is written: \"Do not defile your daughter.\"<br>The Torah obligates a rapist and a seducer to pay money rather than be punished by lashes when the matter happened by chance, without the knowledge of [the girl's] father, and she did not ready herself for [the relations]. For this is an extraordinary and uncommon matter.<br>If, however, a person leaves his virgin daughter accessible for anyone to engage in relations with her, this will cause the entire earth to be filled with sexual immorality.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam is referring to the wording of the verse in Leviticus cited previously.</i> For [ultimately], a father will marry his daughter and a brother his sister, [for in a sexually permissive society] a [girl] may become pregnant and give birth without knowing who the child's father is.<br>When a person has his daughter act in this manner, she is considered to be a harlot, and both the man and the girl who engage in relations should be punished by lashes, as [Deuteronomy 23:18] states: \"There shall not be a harlot.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad differs and maintains that a woman is not considered to be a harlot unless she is a professional prostitute. See the discussion of this issue in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 1:4.</i><br>[In such an instance,] the man is not required to pay a fine, for the Torah prescribed a fine only in the instance of seduction or rape. When a girl prepares herself [for relations] either on her initiative or on that of her father, she is a harlot. And the prohibition against harlotry applies both with regard to a virgin and a non-virgin.<br>For this reason our Sages stated that a girl who was reputed to have conducted herself immodestly while young is not entitled to a fine, as we have explained,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chapter 1, Halachah 9.</i> for we can assume that she willingly opened herself to this experience."
