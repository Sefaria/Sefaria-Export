            "Before the Torah was given, when a man would meet a woman in the marketplace and he and she decided to marry, he would bring her home, conduct relations in private and thus make her his wife. Once the Torah was given, the Jews were commanded that when a man desires to marry a woman, he must acquire her as a wife in the presence of witnesses. [Only] after this, does she become his wife. This is [alluded to in Deuteronomy 22:13]: \"When a man takes a wife and has relations with her....\"",
            "This process of acquisition fulfills [one of] the Torah's positive commandments.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 213) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 552) include this as one of the Torah's 613 commandments.</i> The process of acquiring a wife is formalized in three ways: through [the transfer of] money, through [the transfer of a] formal document and through sexual relations.<br>[The effectiveness of] sexual relations and [the transfer of a] formal document have their origin in the Torah [itself], while [the effectiveness of transfer of] money is Rabbinic in origin.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad and others object to this statement, noting that <i>Kiddushin</i> 4b derives the concept that the transfer of money is an effective means of formalizing a marriage bond from a <i>gezerah shavah</i>, a correlation between two verses in the Torah, indicating that this practice also has its source in the Torah.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> draw attention to the Rambam's statements in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (General Principle 2), which state that any law that is not explicitly stated in the Torah, but rather derived through the Thirteen Principles of Biblical exegesis, is considered to be Rabbinic in origin (<i>midivrei soferim</i>). This classification does not, however, in any way diminish the status of this practice, and it is as if it were explicitly stated in the Torah. Thus, a marriage bond formalized through the transfer of money has the same status as one formalized through either of the other means mentioned by the Rambam.<br>Rav Kapach differs and states that the Rambam altered the text in his later years, and the correct version states, \"All three are from the Torah.\" In explanation, he draws attention to the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Kiddushin</i> 1:1) and to one of the Rambam's responsa, and on this basis differs with the above principle.<br>He maintains that whenever the Rambam uses the expression <i>midivrei soferim</i>, he means that the practice is Rabbinic in origin and does not have the status of Torah law. The only practices that are considered to be ordained by the Torah are those explicitly stated in the Torah or mentioned by the Sages as having the status of Torah law.<br>In this context, he explains the Rambam's approach. Originally [as evidenced by the Rambam's statements in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 213)], the Rambam thought that sexual relations are the only <i>kiddushin</i> that are effective according to the Torah. For not only the effectiveness of the transfer of money, but also that of the transfer of a legal document is derived by the Sages only through Biblical exegesis. Afterwards, on the basis of certain passages that state that the effectiveness of the transfer of a legal document has the status of a Torah practice, the Rambam changed his opinion and wrote that the transfer of a document is also effective according to the Torah. This opinion is reflected in the Commentary on the Mishnah and the original version of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. Even later, the Rambam accepted the opinion that the effectiveness of the transfer of money also stems from the Torah itself. This is reflected in Chapter 3, Halachah 20, and the corrected text mentioned above.<br>(See <i>Birkat Avraham</i>, Responsum 44, in which the Rambam's son, Rabbenu Avraham, substantiates Rav Kapach's version of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.)</i><br>This process of acquisition is universally referred to as <i>erusin</i> (\"betrothal\") or <i>kiddushin</i> (\"consecration\"). And a woman who is acquired in any of these three ways is referred to as <i>mekudeshet</i> or <i>me'ureset</i>.",
            "Once this process of acquisition has been formalized and a woman has become <i>mekudeshet</i>, she is considered to be married even though the marriage bond has not been consummated and she has not entered her husband's home. Should anyone other than her husband engage in sexual relations with her, he is liable to be executed by the court. If her husband desires to divorce her, he must compose a <i>get</i> [a formal bill of divorce].",
            "Before the Torah was given, when a man would meet a woman in the marketplace, and he and she desired, he could give her payment, engage in relations with her wherever they desired, and then depart. Such a woman is referred to as a harlot.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad and others differ and maintain that a woman is not considered to be a harlot unless she is a professional prostitute. The difference between this approach and the Rambam's involves only the severity of the prohibition. Both agree that sexual relations outside the context of marriage are forbidden. With regard to a <i>pilegesh</i>, a woman one designates as a sexual partner but who is not consecrated as a wife, see <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 4:4.</i><br>When the Torah was given, [relations with] a harlot became forbidden, as [Deuteronomy 23:18] states: \"There shall not be a harlot among the children of Israel.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 355) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 570) include this as one of the Torah's 613 commandments.</i> Therefore, a person who has relations with a woman for the sake of lust, without <i>kiddushin</i>, receives lashes as prescribed by the Torah, because he had relations with a harlot.",
            "Whenever it is forbidden to engage in relations from the Torah, and engaging in relations makes one liable for <i>karet</i> - i.e., the [forbidden relationships] mentioned in <i>Parashat Acharei Mot</i>, such as a person's mother, his sister, his daughter and the like - these relations are called <i>arayot,</i> and each particular forbidden relationship is called an <i>ervah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These include incestuous and adulterous relationships as mentioned in Leviticus, Chapter 18. The forbidden relationships that are punishable by execution are discussed in <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i>, Chapter 1, and those for which one is liable for <i>karet</i> and for which lashes are given are discussed in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i>, Chapter 19.</i>",
            "There are other women with whom relations are forbidden according to the Oral Tradition; these prohibitions are Rabbinic in origin. These women are called <i>shniyot</i> (prohibitions of a secondary nature). There are twenty such women, including:<br>a) one's maternal grandmother; this prohibition continues upward without interruption: a person's maternal grandmother's maternal grandmother - and also those further removed - are also forbidden;<br>b) the mother of a person's maternal grandfather; this prohibition applies to her alone [and not her forbears];<br>c) a person's paternal grandmother; this prohibition continues upward without interruption: a person's paternal grandmother's maternal grandmother - and also those further removed - are also forbidden;<br>d) the mother of his paternal grandfather; this prohibition applies to her alone [and not her forbears];<br>e) the wife of his paternal grandfather; this prohibition continues upward without interruption; the wife of our Patriarch Jacob is forbidden to any one of us;<br>f) the wife of his maternal grandfather; this prohibition applies to her alone;<br>g) the wife of his father's maternal brother;<br>h) the wife of his mother's brother, whether a paternal or a maternal brother;<br>i) his son's daughter-in-law; this prohibition continues downward without interruption; any one of our wives is forbidden to our Patriarch Jacob;<br>j) the daughter-in-law of one's daughter; this prohibition applies to her alone;<br>k) the daughter of one's son's daughter; this prohibition applies to her alone;<br>l) the daughter of one's son's son; this prohibition applies to her alone;<br>m) the daughter of one's daughter's daughter; this prohibition applies to her alone;<br>n) the daughter of one's daughter's son; this prohibition applies to her alone;<br>o) the daughter of the son of one's wife's son; this prohibition applies to her alone;<br>p) the daughter of the daughter of one's wife's daughter; this prohibition applies to her alone;<br>q) the maternal grandmother of one's wife's father; this prohibition applies to her alone;<br>r) the paternal grandmother of one's wife's mother; this prohibition applies to her alone;<br>s) the maternal grandmother of one's wife's mother; this prohibition applies to her alone;<br>t) the paternal grandmother of one's wife's father; this prohibition applies to her alone.<br>Thus, the categories of <i>shniyot</i> that continue without interruption are four: one's maternal grandmother - this continues upward without interruption; one's paternal grandmother - this continues upward without interruption; the wife of one's paternal grandfather - this continues upward without interruption; and the wife of one's son's son - this continues downward without interruption.",
            "All relations with women that are forbidden by the Torah, but that are not punishable by <i>karet</i>, are referred to as <i>issurei lavin</i> (prohibitions forbidden by negative commandments); they are also referred to as <i>issurei kedushah</i> (prohibitions [that encourage] holiness).<br>They are nine: relations between a widow and a High Priest;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Leviticus 21:14.</i> those between a divorcee, a <i>zonah</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 18:1 defines this term as meaning either a woman who is not Jewish, a Jewish woman who has engaged in relations with a man she is forbidden to marry, or one who engages in relations with a <i>challal</i> (a male born from relations between a priest and a woman he is forbidden to marry).</i> or a <i>chalalah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A woman who engages in relations with a priest despite a prohibition against doing so, or a female born from relations between a priest and a woman he is forbidden to marry (<i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 19:1).</i> and either a High Priest or an ordinary priest,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Leviticus 21:7, 21:14.</i> those between a bastard<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A bastard is defined as a person born from any of the forbidden sexual relations that are punishable by execution or <i>karet</i>, with the exception of relations with a woman in the <i>niddah</i> state.

Until she and her brother-in-law fulfill this rite, she is forbidden to marry anyone else. (See Deuteronomy 25:5-10.)</i><br>According to Rabbinic decree, an equation is established between a divorcee and a woman who undergoes <i>chalitzah</i>, and the latter is also forbidden [to engage in relations] with a priest. The Rabbis also placed <i>netinim</i> in the same status as bastards. In <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i>, we will explain who the <i>netinim</i> are.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>netinim</i> are the Givonites, who were forbidden to marry into the Jewish people even after their conversion by Joshua. King David reinforced the ban against them. (See <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 12:22-23.)</i>",
            "There are certain relationships for which there is a prohibition resulting from a positive commandment [<i>issurei aseh</i>], but they are not prohibited by a negative commandment. There are three such prohibitions: the first and second generations of Egyptian or Edomite converts, both men and women [to all native-born Jews and Jewish women], and a woman who is not a virgin to a High Priest.<br>In these instances, there are no verses that state \"He shall not enter [the congregation of God]...\" or \"he may not take....\" The prohibition [against the marriage of the Edomite and Egyptian converts] is instead derived [from Deuteronomy 23:9], which states that \"in the third generation they may enter the congregation of God.\" This implies that the first and second generations may not enter [this marriage group].<br>Similarly, from [the positive commandment, Leviticus 21:13]: \"He [the High Priest] shall marry a virgin,\" we can derive that he is forbidden to marry a woman who is not a virgin. A prohibition that is derived from a positive commandment has the status of a positive commandment."

Halachah 8 appears to support this explanation.<br>b) The second view is that the doubt is one of principle: The Sages did not define whether the obligation that a man precipitate the marriage bond requires merely his giving money, or also making the statement.

In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Kiddushin</i> 1:1), he originally stated that the relations must also be observed by witnesses for the marriage bond to be established.

With regard to a financial claim, no witnesses are necessary if both litigants agree regarding a matter.<br>As stated in this halachah, this concept does not apply with regard to the laws of marriage and divorce.

With regard to financial matters, by contrast, the rights of others are not restricted (Rashba).<br>b) There is a fundamental difference between the function of witnesses in cases involving financial matters and their function with regard to wedding and divorce. With regard to financial matters, the function of witnesses is to clarify the truth (<i>eidei berur</i>). With regard to marriage and divorce, by contrast, the witnesses' function is to notarize the event (<i>eidei kiyyum</i>). For a marriage bond to be established - or broken - even when the husband and wife agree that the event took place, witnesses must observe the proceedings (<i>Tumim</i> 90:14, <i>Tzaphnat Paneach, Kallei HaTorah</i>).</i> Surely this applies when [a man] consecrates [a woman] without any witnesses at all [observing the act].<br>When [a man] consecrates [a woman] in the presence of individuals who are disqualified from serving as witnesses by Scriptural law, she is not consecrated.

Nevertheless, the common practice is to follow the Rambam's view as well. For this reason, after the ceremony under the wedding canopy, the bride and groom go to a private room, the <i>cheder yichud</i>.

It is not until <i>nisu'in,</i> however, that the couple begins living together as man and wife. At present, <i>nisu'in</i> follows directly after <i>erusin</i>; under the wedding canopy the groom consecrates the bride, and afterwards they go to a private room.</i><br>When a man has relations with his <i>arusah</i> for the sake of [establishing] <i>nisu'in</i> after he has consecrated her, the relationship is established at the beginning of sexual relations.

The rationale is that the fundamental requirement of the marriage contract is a Rabbinic injunction, and the same authority that obligated the husband to meet this requirement rescinded it when he lodged a claim denying her virginity.

Rav Kapach maintains that the early manuscripts of the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Ketubot</i> 9:1; <i>Bava Batra</i> 8:1) indicate that the Rambam himself originally subscribed to the view mentioned by the Ra'avad and changed his mind later in life.

Accordingly, the option of whether or not to forego the arrangement is in the woman's hands. If a woman can earn more than her subsistence, she is also entitled to forego the above arrangement.<br>Even in such a situation, the woman is still responsible for taking care of the household tasks (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i> If, however, her husband says: \"I will not provide for your subsistence, and I will not receive the right to the fruits of your labor,\" he is not given this option, lest the woman be unable to earn her subsistence.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The husband may, however, tell his wife: \"Endeavor to earn your subsistence, and I will compensate for whatever deficiency remains\" (Ramah, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 69:4).</i> Because of this institution, [the obligation to provide for a woman's] subsistence is considered to be one of the <i>t'na'ei ketubah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., although the <i>t'na'ei ketubah</i> are rabbinic in origin, and the obligation to provide for the woman's subsistence is from the Torah, since the linkage of it with her wages is rabbinic, the obligation is considered to be part of the <i>t'na'ei ketubah</i>.</i>",

            "The property that a woman brings to her husband's [resources] - be it landed property, movable property or servants - is not referred to with the term <i>ketubah</i>, but rather with the term <i>nedunyah</i>.<br>[More particularly, there are two subdivisions within this category.] When the husband accepts responsibility for the <i>nedunyah</i> and it is considered to be his property<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the article or land that the woman brings to the household is evaluated, and the husband takes responsibility for the value of the article. From this time onward, it is as if the article were his, and he is obligated to pay his wife a fixed amount if he divorces her or she is widowed.</i> - i.e., if it decreases in value he suffers the loss, and if it increases in value the gain is his - the property is referred to as <i>nichsei tzon barzel</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This term literally means \"property [that is like] iron sheep.\" The term iron is used to indicate that the husband's obligation is unchanging, like iron. The reference to sheep stems from the fact that during the Talmudic period in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, a similar agreement was frequently made with a shepherd with regard to the sheep entrusted to him. He was given a herd that was evaluated at a given price, and he was obligated to return either sheep of that value, or payment for them to their owner. (See the commentary of Rav Ovadiah of Bertinoro, <i>Yevamot</i> 7:1.)</i><br>If the husband did not accept responsibility for the <i>nedunyah</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With this statement, the Rambam indicates that - in contrast to the opinion of certain authorities - the property belonging to a woman does not automatically become <i>nichsei tzon barzel</i>. For it to be placed in that category, the husband must explicitly accept responsibility for it (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>). (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 85:3.)</i> and it instead remained the property of the woman<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With regard to this type of property as well, the husband has the privilege to manage the use of the property and reap its benefits during the time he remains married to the woman, but the property itself belongs to her.</i> - if it decreases in value she suffers the loss, and if it increases in value the gain is hers - the property is referred to as <i>nichsei m'log</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The term <i>m'log</i> means \"to pull out hairs\" (Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Yevamot</i> 7:1). Just as a person pulls out the hairs from a head, leaving it uncovered, so too, the husband continues to use his wife's property even though its value depreciates.</i>",
            "Similarly, all the property that a woman owns that she did not bring to her husband's household, nor had written in her <i>ketubah</i>, but rather left as her own, or property that came to her as an inheritance, or that was given to her as a present - all of this is referred to as <i>nichsei m'log</i>, for it is all in her possession.<br>The term <i>ketubah</i>, by contrast, refers only to the fundamental requirement of the marriage contract - i.e., 100 [<i>zuz</i> for a non-virgin] or 200 [<i>zuz</i> for a virgin] and the additional amount that [the husband promised].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">By making a distinction between the money due a woman by virtue of her <i>ketubah</i> and her <i>nedunyah</i>, the Rambam is emphasizing that they are governed by different laws. With regard to the money of the <i>ketubah</i>, the husband or his estate is granted certain leniencies. But with regard to the <i>nedunyah</i>, by contrast, the woman is considered the same as any other of her husband's creditors (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>). The <i>Beit Yosef</i> and the Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 100:2) quote this explanation.</i>",
            "We have already explained that our Sages established the fundamental requirement of the marriage contract, and that the laws governing the additional amount [promised by the husband] are the same as those governing the fundamental requirement.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 10, Halachah 7.</i><br>[Our Sages] did not grant a woman the option of collecting [the money due her by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i> whenever she desired. Instead, it is like a debt, which is not payable until a given date. For a <i>ketubah</i>, the time when payment is due is not until after the woman's husband dies or divorces her.<br>Similarly, our Sages ordained that if a husband has fields [of varying quality] - good, bad and intermediate - when the woman comes to collect [the money due her by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i> from this property, she is entitled to collect only from the inferior fields.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although a creditor has the right to collect his due from the properties of intermediate value, the woman is given this disadvantage. The rationale is that a woman desires to marry and therefore is willing to accept this stipulation (<i>Gittin</i> 50a).</i> They are referred to as <i>ziboorit</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Aruch HaShalem</i> interprets this term as being derived from an Arab word meaning \"a rocky field.\" The Ramah (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 101:5) states that it refers to a bee that stings and is therefore considered one of the lower forms of life.</i>",
            "Similarly, our Sages ordained that when a woman comes to collect [the money due her by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i> after her husband's death, she may not collect [this sum] until she takes an oath while holding a sacred article,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., a Torah scroll, as mentioned in <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 11:8. An oath is required because the woman is seeking to collect money from an estate bequeathed to heirs, and whenever payment is to be collected from an estate, an oath is necessary (<i>Ketubot</i> 87a; <i>Hilchot Malveh V'Loveh</i> 14:1).</i> that her husband did not leave any property in her possession,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 96) states that the woman must also take an oath that she did not seize any of her husband's property.

(See Halachah 21.) The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions the Rambam's view, but appears to favor that of the <i>Tur</i>.</i> [Her wardrobe, even] the garments she is wearing should be evaluated and the sum deducted from [the money due her by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to a trousseau given to the woman by her husband. Although the husband gave his wife these clothes as a gift, he did not give them to her with the intent that she take them and leave his household (<i>Ketubot</i> 54a).</i><br>If, however, he voluntarily divorces her, she may collect [the money due her] without taking an oath,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the first half of this halachah, the oath is instituted by the court to protect the interests of the heirs. In this instance, however, unless the husband himself issues a claim requiring an oath (see Halachah 19), no oath is required.</i> nor should [her wardrobe] be evaluated.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From <i>Hilchot Malveh V'Loveh</i> 1:5, it appears that this does not apply to a woman's Sabbath and festival clothing, or to her jewelry. Similarly, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 99:1) states that those articles should be evaluated and deducted from the sum due her by virtue of her <i>ketubah</i>.</i> [The rationale is that] he bought them for her, she acquired them, and it is he who desires to divorce her, and not the reverse.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If, however, the husband is compelled to divorce his wife, her wardrobe should be evaluated and deducted from the money due her by virtue of her <i>ketubah</i> (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>; see <i>Ketubot</i> 77a).</i>",

Her husband's property was worth 150 <i>zuz</i> at the time of his death. Although its value rose afterwards to 200, the woman is entitled to only 150, because that was its value at the time of her husband's death.</i> Similarly, after their father's death, [the woman's] daughters do not receive their subsistence<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is one of the conditions of a woman's <i>ketubah</i>.</i> from the increment in the value of that property after his death.<br>Similarly, a woman may not collect [the money due her by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i> from the increment in the value of [landed] property accomplished through the efforts of a purchaser, although other creditors are entitled to collect their due from that increment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Landed property that was owned by a man at the time of his marriage or acceptance of a financial obligation is considered to be on lien to his wife or to his creditor. Even if it is sold to another person, the debt can be collected from it, if the person or his estate has no other property, as stated in Halachah 10. (See also <i>Hilchot Malveh V'Loveh</i>, Chapter 19.)<br>As mentioned in <i>Hilchot Malveh V'Loveh</i> 21:1, a creditor is entitled to collect not only the property itself, but also any increment in its value, whether an increment that comes naturally, or even one that results because of effort on the part of the purchaser. A woman is not, however, given this privilege with regard to the money due her by virtue of her <i>ketubah</i>.</i> These rulings are among the leniencies [granted with regard to the the payment of the money due a woman by virtue] of her <i>ketubah</i>.",
            "Similarly, among the leniencies [granted with regard to the payment of the money due a woman by virtue] of her <i>ketubah</i> is that a woman will collect the money due her from the coinage that is of least value.<br>What is implied? A man married a woman in one country and divorced her in another. If the coinage of the country in which the couple married is more valuable than the coinage of the country in which they divorced, he may pay her with the coinage of the country in which they divorced. If, by contrast, the coinage of the country in which the couple divorced is more valuable than the coinage of the country in which they married, he may pay her with the coinage of the country in which they married.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the woman's <i>ketubah</i> mentioned 200 silver coins without specifying the type of coin, and there was a difference between the value of the silver coins used in the country where the <i>ketubah</i> was written and those used in the country where the divorce takes place. If this were a loan contract, we would say that the intent is the coins of the country in which the loan was given. As a leniency to the husband, however, the law is different with regard to a <i>ketubah</i>, and he is obligated to pay only the lesser of the two values.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 100:5) state that this law applies only when the value of the money the woman receives is not less than 100 <i>zuz</i> of the Talmudic period for a non-virgin, and 200 <i>zuz</i> for a virgin.</i><br>When does the above apply? When her <i>ketubah</i> states a sum of coins without specification. If, however, a specific type of coin is explicitly mentioned, whether with regard to the fundamental requirement of the <i>ketubah</i>, or with regard to the extra amount added by the husband, the law is the same as when a person lends a colleague a specific type of coin - he must return the loan in the coinage that he took, as will be explained in <i>Hilchot Halva'ah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Hilchot Malveh V'Loveh</i> 4:11.</i>",

Land was commonly owned in the Talmudic period, and hence a woman would not feel secure unless the obligation of her <i>ketubah</i> were supported by land. In contrast, the ownership of land was less common in the era of the <i>geonim</i>.

Nevertheless, there are dissenting views. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 111:14) mentions both views without appearing to favor either one.</i>",
            "In all the [Jewish] communities of which I know and have heard reports from, it has already become the custom to write the <i>ketubah</i> so that [its obligations are binding] on both the landed property and the movable property [in the estate].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the Rambam's text of the <i>ketubah, Hilchot Yibbum</i> 4:33.</i><br>[Making] this addition is a great asset; it was ordained by learned men of great stature.

            "[The following rules apply when] this stipulation was not included in the text of the <i>ketubah</i>, but instead [the couple] married without making an explicit statement [in this regard]. If the husband knew of this ordinance established by the <i>geonim</i>, the woman may collect [the money due her from the movable property in his estate].<br>If, however, he was not [aware of this ordinance], or we are unsure whether he knew of it, we deliberate at length concerning this matter.

Therefore, it is binding even when it was not explicitly stated in the <i>ketubah</i>, and the husband's heirs claim that he was unaware of it.</i> [The distinction between the two is that the conditions of the <i>ketubah</i>] are ordinances instituted by the Great <i>Sanhedrin</i>.",
            "Our Sages also ordained that all of a husband's property should be on lien for the woman's <i>ketubah</i>.

The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states, however, that the fact that the Rambam does not mention such a distinction indicates that he does not accept this concept.</i> For the court would refrain from administering the oath, lest she not be precise with herself when making it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Gittin</i> 35a explains that since a widow carries out certain activities on behalf of the heirs of her deceased husband's estate (who are, in most instances, her children), she feels free to take certain articles belonging to the estate, without taking this into consideration.

Thus, the first and second wife each received 250 <i>zuz</i>; the third wife received 200; and the fourth wife, 100. This pattern of allocation is followed even when there are 100 [wives].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This pattern is also followed in the allocation of a person's holdings when they are not sufficient to pay the debts he owes, as explained in <i>Hilchot Malveh V'Loveh</i>, Chapter 20. The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam's approach and follows the minority view that the Rambam cites in that source, which maintains that the money should be divided proportionately. The Rambam's view is followed by most other <i>Rishonim</i> (Rashi, Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi, the Rashba and Rabbenu Asher) and is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 96:18).</i>",
            "A person who guarantees the value of a woman's <i>ketubah</i> is not obligated to pay [her the money due her in the event that her husband's holdings are not sufficient if he dies or divorces her]. [This applies] even when he affirmed his commitment with a contractual act.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bava Batra</i> 174b explains that the guarantor is not serious about his commitment. He feels that the couple needs only a small push to get married, and that is his intent, rather than making a serious financial commitment. Even a contractual act, which in other contexts serves as an indication of seriousness of purpose, is not sufficient in this instance.<br>The Ra'avad and the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 102) differ, and maintain that if a guarantor affirms his commitment with a contractual act, he is liable. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 102:6) quotes the Rambam's view, while the Ramah cites that of the Ra'avad.</i> [The rationale is that] his [intent is to] perform a mitzvah,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., he brought about the marriage between the couple.</i> and he did not cause the woman to lose anything.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As can be deduced from the Rambam's wording, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that if a person guarantees a woman's <i>nedunyah</i> (the goods she brought to the household), his commitment is binding. For in this instance, the woman did give up something of value.</i><br>If, however, a person guarantees the <i>ketubah</i> of his son and affirms his commitment with a contractual act,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this instance as well, the Ra'avad and the <i>Tur</i> differ and hold the father liable, even when he did not affirm his commitment with a contractual act. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 102:6) follows the Rambam's view, while the Ramah cites that of the Ra'avad.</i> he is obligated to pay. For a father will make a binding commitment on behalf of his son and decide to obligate himself.<br>A person who underwrites a <i>ketubah</i>, by contrast, is obligated to pay, even though he did not affirm his commitment with a contractual act. What is meant by a person who underwrites a <i>ketubah</i>? One who tells a woman: \"Marry this man. I will give [the money for] this <i>ketubah</i>.\" If, however, he says: \"I will guarantee this <i>ketubah</i>,\" \"I will pay this <i>ketubah</i>,\" \"I am obligated for it\" or the like, he is not liable unless he is the father [of the groom].<br>When a person divorces a wife [whose <i>ketubah</i> has been underwritten in the above fashion], he must first take a vow<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Moreover, this vow must be taken <i>al da'at rabbim</i>, based on the judgement of the public, and it thus cannot be nullified (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Even HaEzer</i> 102:7).</i> that she is forbidden to derive benefit from him.

Instead, she must take the oath required of her, and then she [is entitled to] collect [her due]. If afterwards she desires, she may return to her husband. For the purchasers know that the property was under lien to the <i>ketubah</i> of a woman, and they caused themselves the loss by taking property that was under such a lien.",
            "When a husband sold his property, and afterwards the woman agreed to [her husband's] act and wrote the purchaser: \"I have no claim against you,\" she may, nevertheless, collect [the money due her by virtue of her <i>ketubah</i> by expropriating this property].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The sale is valid, however, until the woman seeks to claim the property.

If this agreement is affirmed with a contractual act, and afterwards the husband sells the property [to him], [the woman is not entitled to] expropriate this property.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since she entered into the agreement with the purchaser before her husband made the sale, she cannot excuse herself by saying that she made her statements only to please her husband.</i><br>Similarly, [a woman is not entitled to expropriate property sold by her husband in the following circumstance]. Her husband sold a property [on a previous occasion, and at that time] asked his wife to write the purchaser, \"I have no claim to this property,\" and the woman refused, causing the sale to be nullified.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> questions the reason for this phrase. When this law is cited in the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 90:17), this phrase is omitted. Nevertheless, based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Ketubot</i> 10:5), the <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> maintains that, according to the Rambam, a sale must have been nullified in order for the woman's commitment to be binding later on.</i> [If,] afterwards, the husband sells [property] - whether the same field he had sold previously or another field - to another person, and after the husband's sale the woman agreed, [made a commitment] that she has no claim to this field and affirmed it with a contractual act, she may not expropriate it. For she cannot say, \"I did this [merely] to please my husband,\" since on the previous occasion, when she did not want [to waive her rights], she did not follow her husband's desires.",
            "[The above ruling is also relevant in the following situation.] A man had two wives. He sold a field, and the purchaser had entered into a contractual act with one of [the husband's] wives, waiving her lien to this field in a manner in which the agreement was effective and the woman no longer had the privilege of claiming, \"I did this [merely] to please my husband.\" Afterwards, the husband died or divorced both his wives.<br>The second wife may expropriate the property from the purchaser, for she did not enter into any agreement with him. The first wife may then expropriate [the property] from the second wife, for she had a prior claim to it, and she waived her lien only with regard to the purchaser [and not with regard to anyone else]. When the property comes into the possession of the first [wife], the purchaser may expropriate it from her, since she made an agreement with him. [The second wife can then expropriate it from the purchaser,] and the cycle continues until they reach a compromise among themselves.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A three-way compromise would obviously be most desirable.

The provision on which the present was based was never fulfilled.<br>Seemingly, this property can be compared to a woman's property of which her husband was unaware. As mentioned in the notes on the previous halachah, the husband has the right to inherit such property, and thus he should also inherit the property mentioned in this clause.<br>Rabbenu Nissim explains that since the Rambam maintains that a husband's right to inherit his wife's property is a Rabbinical ordinance, there is room for leniency when, as in the present case, it is obvious that the woman did not desire her husband to inherit her estate. Obviously motivated by the same question, but unwilling to offer such a resolution, Rav David Arameah explains that the Rambam's ruling applies in an instance when the woman in fact expressed her consent to the present before her death.</i>",

For only transactions that are formalized by a written deed are binding on the purchasers of property. Moreover, since this commitment can be formalized by the spoken word alone, even if it is later recorded in a written document, it is not binding on the purchasers. If, however, a formal deed of transfer is composed, it must be honored by the purchasers (<i>Maggid Mishneh, Hilchot Zechiyah UMatanah</i>).
