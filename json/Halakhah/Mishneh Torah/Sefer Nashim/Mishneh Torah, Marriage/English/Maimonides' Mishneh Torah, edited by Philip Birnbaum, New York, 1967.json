            "If a man betrothed a woman upon condition, her betrothal is valid if the condition has been fulfilled; if it has not been fulfilled, she is not betrothed. It is immaterial whether the condition proceeds from the man or the woman. Every condition in the world, whether in matters of betrothal or divorce, purchase or sale, or any other civil case, must consist of four things.",
            "The four things constituting any stipulation are as follows: 1) the stipulation must be double [stating both alternatives and their eventual consequences]; 2) the positive must be expressed before the negative; 3) the condition in the agreement must precede the act; 4) the condition must be possible of performance. If the condition lacks one of them, it is void as if there has been no condition attached. Then the betrothal or divorce of the woman takes effect immediately, the purchase or the gift is fulfilled forthright, as if there has been no condition expressed, just because the condition has lacked one of the four [components].",
            "If, for example, a man said to a woman: \"If you give me two hundred <i>zuz</i> you will be betrothed to me with this denar, and if you do not give me you will not be betrothed,\" and having imposed this condition he gave her the denar; it is a valid stipulation, and she is betrothed conditionally. If she gives him two hundred <i>zuz</i>, she will be betrothed in fact; if she fails to give him that amount, her betrothal is invalid.",
            "If, however, he said to her: \"You are betrothed to me with this denar,\" and he handed her the denar; then he completed the condition and said: \"If you give me two hundred <i>zuz</i> you will be betrothed, and if you do not give that amount you will not be betrothed,\" the condition is void, because he performed the act of handing her the denar before he stipulated the condition. Even though it all occurred instantly, while speaking, her betrothal took immediate effect and she does not have to give him anything.",
            "So too, if he said to her: \"If you give me two hundred <i>zuz</i> you are betrothed to me with this denar,\" and then he handed her the denar; the condition is void because he did not double it [by stating both alternatives and their consequences]; for he did not tell her: \"If you will not give me the amount you will not be betrothed.\" Hence, she is betrothed immediately, and does not have to give him anything.",
            "Similarly, if he said to her: \"If you will not give me two hundred <i>zuz</i> you will not be betrothed to me, and if you will give me two hundred <i>zuz</i> you are betrothed to me with this denar,\" and he handed her the denar; the stipulation is invalid because he stated the negative before the affirmative. Accordingly, she is betrothed immediately without being required to give him anything.",
            "So too, if he said to her: \"If you will ascend to heaven or descend to the bottom of the ocean you are betrothed to me with this denar, but if you will not ascend to heaven or descend to the bottom of the ocean you will not be betrothed,\" and then handed her the denar; the condition is void and she is betrothed immediately, because it is known that she cannot perform this stipulation; he merely meant to divert her with jesting words.",

            "There are some recent Geonim who have stated that a man does not have to double his condition anywhere except in divorce and betrothal cases; he is not required to do so in civil cases. But this opinion should not be relied upon, seeing that the rule about doubling the condition along with the three other restrictions have been derived by the sages from the condition that Moses stipulated in addressing the Israelites concerning the Gadites and the Reubenites: \"If the Gadites and the Reubenites cross the Jordan … you shall give them the land of Gilead … but if they do not cross over with you…\" (Numbers 32:29-30). This condition had nothing to do with divorce and betrothal occasions. Hence, the early great Geonim ruled as stated previously, and we should act accordingly.",
            "If a man has betrothed a woman conditionally, her betrothal will be valid from the moment the condition has been fulfilled, and not from the time she became betrothed. Example: A man said to a woman: \"If I will give you two hundred <i>zuz</i> this year, you are betrothed to me with this denar; and if I will not give you, you shall not be betrothed.\" He handed her the denar on <i>Nisan</i>, and gave her the two hundred <i>zuz</i>, which he had stipulated with her, on <i>Elul</i>. Then her betrothal becomes valid beginning with <i>Elul</i>. Accordingly, if someone else betrothed her before the fulfillment of the condition made by the first man, she is betrothed to the second man. The same law applies to divorce cases as well as property rights. At the moment the condition is fulfilled, the divorce takes effect, the bargain or the gift becomes valid.",
            "This rule applies only where there was a condition and the man did not say <i>from now</i>. If, however, he said to her: \"You are betrothed to me with this denar from now if I will give you two hundred <i>zuz</i>,\" and after some time he gave her two hundred <i>zuz</i>, her betrothal is valid retroactively from the moment the betrothal was contracted, even though his condition became a reality after a long period only. Accordingly, if a second man betrothed her prior to the fulfillment of the condition, her betrothal is not binding. The same rule applies to divorce and property cases.",
            "Anyone who says <i>from now</i> does not have to double his condition or to express the condition before stating the act; even if he has stated the act first, his condition is valid. Nevertheless, the condition must be possible of performance; if he has made a condition that is impossible of fulfillment, he is regarded as if he used diverting speech, so that no condition exists.— —"

We should not take into consideration any rumor that was not made known in the law court. On the basis of what rumor is she assumed to be betrothed? For example, two men came and testified that they had seen the lamps burning, the couches arranged, the people coming and going, and the women cheerfully telling that so-and-so had become engaged today.— — Similarly, if two men came and said: \"We saw something like an engagement party and heard a rumor; we heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so that so-and-so had become engaged in the presence of two witnesses who left for another country, or died\"; she is deemed betrothed on the basis of such a rumor.",
            "This is only in a case where there was no reasonable explanation [showing the report to be mistaken]; if, however, there was such a reasonable explanation, which they heard together with the rumor, she is not assumed to be betrothed. If, for example, there was such an explanation as: \"So-and-so has become betrothed conditionally, or dubitably,\" she is not assumed to be betrothed. She should be asked and trusted, since there is no clear evidence available nor even a strong rumor.",

            "It once happened that a rumor spread that a girl had become betrothed to the son of a certain party. After some time, the father of the young man was asked, and he replied that she had become betrothed to his son conditionally, and the condition was not fulfilled. The sages did not rely on what he said but declared: \"She is doubtfully betrothed as if there were no halting explanation available\" (Gittin 89a).",

            "If a rumor spread that she was betrothed to a certain party and then another rumor, like the first, spread that she was betrothed to another party, then either the first party or the second should write a divorce so that the other can marry her.",

If the husband has assumed responsibility for the <i>nedunya</i>, which has come under his control, so that the increments and losses are his, it is termed <i>nikhsé tzon barzel</i> [property of iron sheep: like iron, it cannot be destroyed; like sheep, the husband derives all profit from it]. If, however, he has not assumed responsibility for the <i>nedunya</i>, so that the losses and increments belong to her, it is called <i>nikhsé melog</i> [property of plucking: the husband has the usufruct and need not answer for any damage that may occur to it].",

Only the main marriage contract, amounting to a hundred or two hundred <i>zuz</i>, plus the additional dower, is designated as <i>kethubbah</i>.",
            "We have already stated that the sages instituted the writing of a marriage contract for the woman, and that the additional dower has the same legal status as the main <i>kethubbah</i>. They have ruled that she cannot collect it from her husband whenever she pleases; instead, it is regarded as a debt bearing a date of collection. The <i>kethubbah</i> can be collected only after the husband's death, or in the case of his divorcing her.— —",

            "A woman is believed when she says \"my husband is dead,\" so that she may lawfully marry, as will be explained among the laws of divorce. The <i>kethubbah</i> stipulates that if she remarries after her husband's death, she is to receive all that he detailed in her <i>kethubbah</i>. Accordingly, if she came to the court and said: \"My husband is dead, give me permission to remarry,\" and she mentioned no <i>kethubbah</i> at all, she is permitted to marry; she is given her <i>kethubbah</i> after imposing an oath on her. If she came and said: \"My husband is dead, give me my <i>kethubbah</i>,\" she is not even permitted to remarry, because the presumption is that her husband is not dead and that she has come only to collect the <i>kethubbah</i> when he is still alive, and does not intend to marry.
