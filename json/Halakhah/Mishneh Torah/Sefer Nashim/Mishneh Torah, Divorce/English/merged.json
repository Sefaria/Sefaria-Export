            "The wife can be divorced only with a written document that comes into her possession; such a document is called <i>get</i> (letter of divorce). There are ten basic things prescribed by the Torah in the divorce proceedings, namely: 1) The <i>get</i> must come from the husband voluntarily. 2) He must prepare it in writing only. 3) The subject of the letter must unfold that he has divorced and removed her from his possession. 4) It must express the idea of separation between him and her. 5) It must be especially written for her. 6) It must not require any other act except delivery. 7) He must hand it to her. 8) He must hand it to her in the presence of witnesses. 9) He must give it to her as a letter of divorce. 10) Only the husband, or his agent, must be the one handing it to her. The rest of the features of a <i>get</i>, such as the date and the signature of the witnesses, and the like, are all rabbinic in origin.",
            "How do we know that these ten essentials are prescribed by the Torah? It is written: \"If she fails to please him … and he writes her a bill of divorcement, hands it to her, and sends her away from his house…\" (Deuteronomy 24:1). <i>If she fails to please him</i> denotes that he divorces her only voluntarily; if his divorce has been involuntary it is invalid. The wife, however, is divorced whether or not she has been willing.",
            "<i>And he writes</i> denotes that she can be divorced only with a written document; <i>her</i>, especially for her; <i>a bill of divorcement</i>, something that separates between him and her, leaving him no right of possessing her; if this separation between him and her is not stated, her divorce is invalid, as it will be explained. <i>Hands it to her</i> denotes that she is not divorced until the <i>get</i> is given into her hand, or the hand of her agent that means the same as her own, or into her courtyard, all of which is legally regarded as her own hand, as it will be explained. <i>And sends her away</i>, the context of the <i>get</i> must convey that he sends <i>her</i> away and not that he sends <i>himself</i> away from her.",
            "If, for example, he wrote to her: \"You are sent away, you are divorced, you are free to yourself, you are permitted to marry any man,\" or something like this, her divorce is valid. The essential formula of a <i>get</i> is: \"You are permitted to marry any man.\" If, however, he wrote to her: \"I am not your husband, I am not your betrothed, I am not your man,\" it is not a valid divorce, since it is written <i>and he sends her away</i> and not that he sends himself away. So too, if a man has written to his wife: \"You are a free woman,\" it is not a valid divorce.",
            "The biblical expression <i>and he sends her away</i> does not indicate that her divorce is incomplete until she leaves his house, but that she is divorced as soon as the <i>get</i> reaches her hand, even if she is still in his house.— —",

            "How do we know that he must hand it to her only in terms of a divorce? It is written: \"a bill of divorcement … hands it to her,\" that is, he must give it to her as a bill of divorcement. If, however, he handed it to her in terms of a note of indebtedness or a <i>Mezuzah</i>, or if he placed it in her hand while she was asleep, and when she awoke she noticed it in her hand, it is not a valid divorce. But, if he told her afterwards: \"This is your divorce,\" it is a valid divorce.",
            "If a man said to witnesses: \"Look at the <i>get</i> I am giving her,\" and then he said to her: \"Take this note of indebtedness,\" it is valid, because he had informed the witnesses that he was giving it to her in terms of a divorce. He told her about a bill of indebtedness only because he was embarrassed in her presence.",
            "The man who divorces his wife must say to her, while handing her the <i>get, this is your get</i>, or <i>it is your get</i>, or something like this. If, however, he handed it to her and said nothing, it is a disqualified <i>get</i>. This rule applies only in a case where he had not spoken with her concerning her divorce; but if he had spoken with her about her divorce, and then handed it to her while saying nothing, it is a valid divorce.",

            "The sages have ruled that the witnesses must sign the divorce: suppose he gives her a <i>get</i> in the presence of two men and they die, her <i>get</i> would be as insignificant as a potsherd, seeing that it is not confirmed by witnesses. Hence, it has been instituted that the <i>get</i> should bear the testimony of witnesses. Even though the evidence of witnesses is included in the <i>get</i>, he must hand it to her in the presence of two men, either those who signed it or two others, because the <i>get</i> basically depends on the delivery witnesses [who transfer it to her].",

The term <i>he writes</i> solely signifies that she can be divorced only with a written document; <i>and he hands her</i>, she must not take it by herself.",

            "Some of the Geonim have taught that any woman with whom [a man] has had sex before witnesses requires a <i>get</i>, [because of] the presumption that a person will not have licentious sex. They extended this principle until it occurred to them to teach that when a person has a child with his maidservant, we take it into consideration and his wife cannot perform <i>yibbum</i> [should the man die childless], lest he had freed the maidservant and after that had sex with her. There are those who teach that [we can assume that] he certainly freed her, because a person will not have licentious sex. All of these rulings stray, in my opinion, from the paths of Torah and it is not appropriate to rely on them. The Sages only used this presumption with regard to [a man's] wife whom he had divorced or [a man] who married a woman conditionally and then had sex with her unconditionally. For indeed she is his wife [in these situations] and with regard to a man's wife we assume that he will not have licentious sex with her unless he explicitly states [that he intends to engage in] licentious sex or if he has sex with a condition. But for other women, [we do not rely on this presumption]. If [a man has sex with] a prostitute, [there is] a presumption that he had sex in the name of licentiousness until such a time as he makes explicit his intention to marry her. Needless to say [this applies with regard to] a maidservant or a non-Jewish woman, because she cannot be married [according to Jewish law] and we do not suspect at all [that he intends to marry her]. The son [that results] from [having sex with these women] is presumed to be a non-Jew or a slave until it is definitively known that his mother was freed or converted.",
