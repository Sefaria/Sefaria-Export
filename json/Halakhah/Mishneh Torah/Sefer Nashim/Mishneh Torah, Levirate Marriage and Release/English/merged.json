            "It is a positive biblical command that a man shall take in levirate marriage his paternal brother's wife if he died childless whether after wedlock or after betrothal.— —",
            "If he or she refuses levirate marriage, he should give her <i>ḥalitzah;</i> then she is permitted to marry another man.— —",
            "The biblical expression <i>and he leaves no son</i> (Deuteronomy 25:5) means son or daughter, or even the offspring of either son or daughter. If he has left any offspring whatever, whether from this wife or another, he exempts his wife from <i>ḥalitzah</i> and <i>yibbum</i> (levirate marriage).— —",
            "However, his son by a bondmaid or a non-Jewish wife does not exempt his wife, because the children coming from a bondmaid are slaves, and those from a non-Jewess are non-Jews; they are regarded as nonexistent.— —",

            "If a man died and left many brothers, it is the duty of the eldest to marry the childless sister-in-law or to give her <i>ḥalitzah</i>, as it is written: \"The first son that she bears\" (Deuteronomy 25:6). This has been traditionally interpreted to refer only to the firstborn among the brothers; that is, the eldest of the brothers \"shall succeed to the position of the dead man.\" The phrase <i>that she bears</i> denotes <i>that the mother bore</i>, and does not mean <i>that the sister-in-law will bear</i>.",
            "If the eldest brother refuses to perform the levir's duty, we must go around from one brother to the other. If they refuse, we must come back to the eldest and say: \"It is your duty, either give <i>ḥalitzah</i> or marry her.\" The brother-in-law should not be coerced to perform the levir's duty, but should be compelled to give <i>ḥalitzah</i>."

            "How is the duty of <i>ḥalitzah</i> performed? The brother's widow proceeds to the place where the <i>yavam</i> (brother-in-law) is to be found and comes to the judges, who summon him and give him such advice as suits him and her alike. If it is advisable for him to marry her, he is counseled to marry her; if it is advisable to perform <i>ḥalitzah</i>, as when she is young and he is old or she is old and he is young, he is advised to perform <i>ḥalitzah</i>.",
            "",
            "She and the <i>yavam</i> are taught to recite the formula until they are both used to it and she can pronounce in one breath <i>lo avah</i> (he will not), then adding <i>yabbemi</i> (perform the levir's duty to me), so that it should not sound as if she were to say <i>avah yabbemi</i> (he desires to perform the levir's duty to me).",
            "",
            "The <i>ḥalitzah</i> ceremony must take place by day and not at night, and in the presence of three men capable of instructing them what and how to recite.— —",
            "How is the <i>ḥalitzah</i> shoe removed? A heeled leather-shoe that is not stitched with flax is brought to him, who puts it on and fastens its straps on his right foot. Then he and she stand before the judges of the court, who instruct her to say in Hebrew: \"My husband's brother refuses to establish a name in Israel for his brother; he will not perform the duty of a levir\" (Deuteronomy 25:7). Then the <i>yavam</i> is made to recite: \"I do not wish to marry her\" (8). He puts his foot down on the ground, and she sits down, stretches out her hand in front of the court, unties the straps of the shoe from his foot, takes off the shoe and throws it upon the ground. As soon as most of the heeled shoe is detached from his foot, the brother's widow is permitted to marry a stranger.",
            "— — Thereupon she is made to recite: \"Thus shall be done to the man who will not build up his brother's house! And he shall become known in Israel as the unsandaled one\" (9-10).",
            "All must be done in the Hebrew language, as it is written \"thus,\" in this language. All those who are seated there respond by repeating after her \"the unsandaled one\" three times.— —"
