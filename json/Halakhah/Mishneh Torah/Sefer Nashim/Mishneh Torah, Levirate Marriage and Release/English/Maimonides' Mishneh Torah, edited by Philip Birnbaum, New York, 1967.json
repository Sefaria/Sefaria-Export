            "The biblical expression <i>and he leaves no son</i> (Deuteronomy 25:5) means son or daughter, or even the offspring of either son or daughter. If he has left any offspring whatever, whether from this wife or another, he exempts his wife from <i>ḥalitzah</i> and <i>yibbum</i> (levirate marriage).— —",
            "However, his son by a bondmaid or a non-Jewish wife does not exempt his wife, because the children coming from a bondmaid are slaves, and those from a non-Jewess are non-Jews; they are regarded as nonexistent.— —",

This has been traditionally interpreted to refer only to the firstborn among the brothers; that is, the eldest of the brothers \"shall succeed to the position of the dead man.\" The phrase <i>that she bears</i> denotes <i>that the mother bore</i>, and does not mean <i>that the sister-in-law will bear</i>.",

If they refuse, we must come back to the eldest and say: \"It is your duty, either give <i>ḥalitzah</i> or marry her.\" The brother-in-law should not be coerced to perform the levir's duty, but should be compelled to give <i>ḥalitzah</i>."

Then he and she stand before the judges of the court, who instruct her to say in Hebrew: \"My husband's brother refuses to establish a name in Israel for his brother; he will not perform the duty of a levir\" (Deuteronomy 25:7). Then the <i>yavam</i> is made to recite: \"I do not wish to marry her\" (8). He puts his foot down on the ground, and she sits down, stretches out her hand in front of the court, unties the straps of the shoe from his foot, takes off the shoe and throws it upon the ground. As soon as most of the heeled shoe is detached from his foot, the brother's widow is permitted to marry a stranger.",
