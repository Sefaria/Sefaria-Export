In this state, it is called <i>g'vil</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In one of his responsa, the Rambam explains that the term <i>g'vil</i> is used to describe any coarse, uneven surface. Note a parallel usage in <i>Bava Batra</i> 3a.<br>If the hide is not prepared in this fashion, it is referred to as <i>diftera</i>, and a Torah scroll, <i>tefillin</i>, or <i>mezuzah</i>, written upon it is invalid.

            "After the hair is removed, the hide may be taken and divided in half in the manner known to the parchment processors.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is, however, no obligation to divide the parchment. If it has been processed correctly, it may be used for a Torah scroll without being separated, as stated in the following halachah.</i> Thus, there are two pieces of parchment: a thin one, which is on the side where the hair<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">or wool of the animal</i> grew, and a thicker one, on the side of the flesh.<br>After it has been processed using salt, then flour, and then resin and the like,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Several of the Rambam's responsa were addressed to communities where it was not customary to prepare hides in this manner. In these letters, the Rambam stresses that even after the hair is removed from the hide, it must be processed in this manner. Otherwise, it may not be used for either a Torah scroll, <i>tefillin</i>, or <i>mezuzah</i>.</i> the portion on the side where the hair grew is called <i>k'laf</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">which means \"peel.\" It is given this name because it is a thin layer of flesh which is peeled easily.</i> and the portion on the side of the flesh is called <i>duchsustos</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Duch</i> is Aramaic for \"place,\" and <i>sustos</i> is Greek (Median in other texts) for \"meat.\" Thus, the word means \"the place of the meat\" (<i>Aruch</i>).<br>Our translation and commentary follows the standard published text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, which is quoted in the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 32:7. It must, nevertheless, be emphasized that the authoritative Yemenite manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> reverse the interpretations of <i>k'laf</i> and <i>duchsustos</i>. The latter interpretation is reinforced by several responsa of the Rambam on the subject. It also is supported by <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 11:6.

Thus, according to these texts, when writing on the thin upper parchment, one should write on the epidermis, and when writing on the thick lower parchment, one should write on the part facing the inside of the body.<br>There is an advantage to this version. According to the standard texts, there is an apparent contradiction. Although one should write on the epidermis when writing on <i>g'vil</i>, it is improper to do so when writing on <i>k'laf</i>.</i>",

Even בדיעבד (after the fact), such parchment is not acceptable, as stated in Halachah 14.<br>As explained in Chapter 3, this requirement applies not only to the parchment, but also to all the other elements involved in making these sacred articles.</i> One may write on the hides of [all] kosher animals, wild beasts, and fowl.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Halachah 20 in regard to writing on parchment made from the skin of birds.</i> This applies even when these animals died without being ritually slaughtered or when they were killed by wild beasts.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shabbat</i> (ibid.) offers the following parable to explain why even though such animals may not be eaten, it is permitted to use their hides.

Obviously, the one whom the king executed himself.<br>Similarly, in the present instance, the fact that these kosher animals were \"executed by the king\" - i.e., their death came about at God's decree - distinguishes them from other animals which are never fit to be eaten.</i><br>We may not write on the skin of a kosher fish because of the foul secretions, since the processing of the skin will not cause the foul secretions to cease.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Hilchot Keilim</i> 1:4 states: \"The skin of a fish is not susceptible to contracting ritual impurity and would be fit for <i>tefillin</i> to be written upon, were it not for its foul secretions.\" This implies that the only problem is the secretions of the fish skin.</i>",
            "The <i>g'vil</i> for a Torah scroll and the <i>k'laf</i> for <i>tefillin</i> and for a Torah scroll must be processed with this purpose in mind.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:8; <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 271:1) states that when placing the skin in lime at the beginning of the process of making it into parchment, one should explicitly say that one is processing it for these purposes.<br><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (32:11) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (32:26-27) explain that parchment processed to be used as a Torah scroll may be used for <i>tefillin</i> (or for a <i>mezuzah</i>). Parchment processed for the sake of <i>tefillin</i>, however, may not be used for a Torah scroll, because a Torah scroll is on a higher level of holiness.</i> If they were not processed with this intent, they are not acceptable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even if no parchment that was processed with the proper intent is available, this parchment should not be used, as stated in Halachah 14.</i><br>Accordingly, if they were processed by a gentile, they are not acceptable.

It is not that we suspect that the gentile will not listen to the person who hires him, and his act is therefore not acceptable. Rather, because his nature is to \"follow his own intentions,\" he is disqualified from performing any act that requires a sacred intention.<br>According to this interpretation, the question of whether a gentile's actions are accepted if he is supervised by a Jew must be understood as follows: The act of preparing the parchment for a Torah scroll is not, in and of itself, a sacred act, but merely a preparation for performing such an act. Accordingly, one might assume that it is sufficient for a Jew to command the gentile to process the scroll for the proper intent. The gentile would be considered like a machine which performs activities with no will of its own, and it would be as if the Jew performed the act himself. In conclusion, however, it is accepted that because the gentile acts independently, the intention of the Jew who hires him cannot be associated with his acts.</i> Therefore,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">the scope of this ruling can be expanded:</i> whenever an article must be made with a specific intent in mind,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">e.g., the strands of tzitzit (<i>Hilchot Tzitzit</i> 1:11) or a bill of divorce (<i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 3:16)</i> it is unacceptable if made by a gentile.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbenu Asher does not accept the Rambam's ruling with regard to these parchments. Though he accepts the general principle, he explains that this particular instance is an exception.<br>In other instances, the gentile must act according to the Jew's intent for a prolonged period of time. Here, it is absolutely necessary to have the intent to use the parchment for <i>tefillin</i> or a Torah scroll only at the moment it is placed in the lime. We can assume that if a gentile is given instructions to place it in the lime with that intent, he will do so with that intent.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> quotes both opinions in <i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:9. <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 271:1, however, mentions only the Rambam's opinion. In both places, the Ramah states that it is customary to follow Rabbenu Asher's opinion.<br><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 32:12 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:28-29 quote Rabbenu Asher's statements that a Jew should be present at the time the parchment is placed in the lime and that he should explicitly tell the gentile to put it in the lime to be used for a Torah scroll. Afterwards, he should assist the gentile somewhat in the process of preparing the parchment.</i><br>[The parchment used for] a <i>mezuzah</i> need not be processed with this purpose in mind.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Yoma</i> 3:6) states, \"Parchment which was processed for use as a talisman is acceptable for a <i>mezuzah</i>.\"<br>In one of his responsa, the Rambam explains that the reason for the difference in law between a <i>mezuzah</i>, on the one hand, and a Torah scroll and <i>tefillin</i>, on the other, stems from the fact that a Torah scroll and <i>tefillin</i> are mitzvot which each person is obligated to fulfill. In contrast, the mitzvah of <i>mezuzah</i> is an obligation that is not incumbent on a person unless he dwells in a house that requires one. (It must be noted, however, that there are opinions which maintain that this responsum was not written by the Rambam.)<br>This ruling is not accepted by the other authorities. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 288:5) states that לכתחילה (at the outset), one must seek a <i>mezuzah</i> that was written on parchment processed with this intention in mind. Only if it is impossible to find such a <i>mezuzah</i>, may one use a <i>mezuzah</i> which was not processed with this intent. (Note also our commentary on Chapter 3, Halachah 15.)</i>",

See Chapter 7, Halachah 16, and also see the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 284:2).<br>In <i>Orach Chayim</i>, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> continues, explaining that a person who cannot write on a straight line without ruling the parchment should rule the parchment before writing <i>tefillin</i>. The Ramah states that it is customary for even the most competent scribes to write <i>tefillin</i> on ruled parchment. If, however, one wrote <i>tefillin</i> without ruling the parchment, the <i>tefillin</i> are acceptable even if the lines are crooked (<i>Mishneh Berurah</i> 32:21).</i> because they are covered.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This explains why although a verse from the Torah must always be written on ruled parchment, we are not required to do so for <i>tefillin</i>.<br>Even though a <i>mezuzah</i> is also covered, ruling the parchment is required because it can be removed from its covering easily and must be checked twice in seven years. In contrast, there is no obligation to check <i>tefillin</i> and the parchments are almost never removed from their compartments (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rabbenu Nissim).</i><br>It is permissible to write <i>tefillin</i> and mezuzot without [looking at] an existent text, because everyone is familiar with these passages.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:20, 29), however, emphasizes that one should carefully check the passages of the <i>tefillin</i> to make sure that they were written correctly.

In <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:8, the Rambam defines an <i>apikoros</i> as a person who denies the Torah and/or the prophetic tradition, while in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:7, he describes a <i>min</i> as a person who does not believe in God. When a <i>min</i> writes a Torah scroll, the names of God it contains do not possess any holiness, because he does not believe in God at all.

Since this is his intent, the names [of God he writes] do not become holy.<br>Significantly, the Rambam does not state that we presume that the scribe had the intention that the name of God refer to a false deity.

In the process of a <i>sotah's</i> trial, a scroll on which is written a passage containing God's name is blotted out.

The difficulty in purchasing them extends beyond one's willingness to opt for the more lenient opinion mentioned in the above sources.

If one wrote a passage which should be <i>s'tumah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As the Rambam explains at length in Chapter 8, there are two general categories for the passages of the Torah, <i>s'tumah</i> and <i>p'tuchah</i>.<br><i>S'tumah</i> means \"closed.\" It refers to a passage whose first word is always written in the middle of a line in the Torah.

Since there is a difference between <i>tefillin</i> and a Torah scroll - in a Torah scroll, there are many other passages between <i>Shema</i> and <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i> - the <i>tefillin</i> are not disqualified if <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i> is written as <i>p'tuchah</i>. Contemporary Ashkenazic practice is based on this opinion. [Note our commentary on Chapter 5, Halachah 2.]</i><br>The first three passages are all <i>p'tuchot</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For this reason, the first two passages should be written in a manner in which they end at least nine letters before the end of the column (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 32:36).</i> while the final passage, <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i>, is <i>s'tumah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As is explained in the commentary on Chapter 8, Rabbenu Asher differs with the Rambam and offers a different interpretation of the terms <i>s'tumah</i> and <i>p'tuchah</i>.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states that the Rambam's opinion should be followed. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:26) offers a compromise, which satisfies, according to his interpretation, both the Rambam's and Rabbenu Asher's views. His interpretation, however, is not accepted by all authorities.</i>",

Nevertheless, although an entire passage was written, correcting a word by erasing an extra letter is not a contradiction to this principle.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:23) mentions that a problem may arise if the letter to be erased is in the middle of a word, since, when it is erased, the space left will cause the word to appear divided. The commentaries explain that the difficulty can sometimes be corrected by extending a letter, for example, writing a <i>resh</i> with an extended upper line.</i> If one writes a word which requires a full form using a short form, it is invalid and may not be corrected.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because the additional letter will not have been written in the proper order.</i><br>These are [the correct spellings of the words that could present difficulties] with regard to the short and full forms in these four passages.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's inclusion of these particulars in the next four halachot is a clear expression of the desire he expressed in his introduction to the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, to compose a text that will serve as \"a compilation of the entire Oral Law,\" that would allow a person to \"comprehend the entire Oral Law from it without having to study any other text.\" He saw the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> as a guide to the performance of the mitzvot, and therefore included in it details that would allow every individual to understand - and thus carry out - the minute particulars involved in the fulfillment of each mitzvah.<br>1. The Rambam does not use the expression, \"short form,\" because the <i>chirik</i> of the <i>alef</i> possesses a <i>yud</i>. Similarly, the Rambam states \"without a <i>vav</i>\" or \"without a <i>yud</i>\" in several other instances in these halachot, because the form of the word is neither short or full in its entirety. 2. Generally, the word is written ידך. <i>Menachot</i> 37a explains that this departure from the norm was intended to teach us that <i>tefillin</i> are worn on the left hand, as explained in the commentary on Chapter 4, Halachah 2. 3. There are three sizes of letters in the Torah - the normal size, an enlarged size, and a reduced size - as mentioned in Chapter 7, Halachah 8. The <i>Baal HaTurim</i> notes that <i>ayin</i> and <i>dalet</i> spell the word <i>eid</i>, which means \"witness.\" The <i>Shema</i> describes God's oneness. By reciting this verse and placing it in their <i>tefillin</i> and <i>mezuzot</i>, the Jews serve as witnesses, testifying to that oneness. 4. The Rambam also discusses the subject of crowns in Chapter 7, Halachot 8-9. When discussing this matter, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 36:3) mentions the obligation to place crowns on the letters, שעטנ\"ז ג\"ץ. The obligation of placing crowns on these letters is explicitly mentioned in the Talmud, <i>Menachot</i> 29b. Hence, they are regarded with greater stringency.<br>Afterwards, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> also states that there are scribes who customarily place crowns on other letters. Significantly, even in Yemen, where the Rambam's directives are usually adhered to precisely, an exception is made in this instance, and there are different customs with regard to the crowns placed upon letters.<br>5. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (36:5) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (36:15) require that one add any crowns that are lacking in the passages.

When the scroll is written on <i>k'laf</i>, it may be more or less, provided that the length is equal to the circumference. If one wrote a scroll on <i>g'vil</i> less than six handbreadths long and concentrated one's writing, or [wrote a scroll] more than six handbreadths long and spread out one's writing, if the length is equal to the circumference, it has been written in the proper manner.",
            "The following margins should be left [on each column]: Below the column: four thumbbreadths; above the column: three thumbbreadths; and between each column: two thumbbreadths.<br>[To allow for these margins,] one should leave an additional thumbbreadth at the beginning and the end of each portion of parchment and room to sew the parchments together. Thus, when one sews all the portions of parchment together, there will be two thumbbreadths between each column throughout the entire scroll.<br>One should also leave an extra portion of parchment at the beginning and the end of the scroll, to wind around its staves.<br>All these measures are part of [performing] the mitzvah [in the optimum manner]. If one decreased or increased any of them, [the scroll] is not disqualified.",
            "How should a person structure the scroll [he is writing] so that its length will be equal to its circumference? He should begin by making equal portions of parchment, each having a standard width of six handbreadths.<br>Afterwards, he should wind the parchments, each in the same manner, making one tight coil. He should continue adding to the coil, winding the parchments tightly until the circumference of the coil is six handbreadths, the width of the parchment. He should measure with a red cord that [is long enough] to surround the entire coil.",
            "Afterwards, one should make a measuring rod, forty or fifty thumbbreadths long. Each thumbbreadth on the rod should be divided into halves, thirds, and quarters, so that it will be possible to have exact measurements, including even half and quarter thumbbreadths.<br>One should measure each piece of parchment with this rod to determine its length in thumbbreadths. In this manner, one can calculate the length in thumbbreadths of the entire coil.",

One should write a [sample] column.<br>It is obvious that the length of the column [used for the writing] will be seventeen thumbbreadths, since three thumbbreadths are left for a margin above the column and four thumbbreadths are left for a margin below. The width of the column, however, varies according to the thickness of one's writing. Similarly, the number of lines within each column varies according to the writing. The space of a line should be left between each two lines.",

When more than three or four fingerbreadths remain after the final column [which fits onto] the portion of parchment, one should leave only a thumbbreadth and the space necessary to sew it and cut off the rest.<br>One need not worry that, ultimately, additional parchments will have to be added to the coil to compensate for the portions which were cut off. This is not a factor of circumstance, because the writing will cause [the size of the scroll] to be extended [only] according to the number of columns [originally calculated].",
