            "The tassel that is made on the fringes of a garment<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>anaf</i>, translated as \"tassel,\" literally means \"branch.\" Just as a branch is an extension of the tree, the tzitzit are extensions of the fringes.</i> from the same fabric as the garment<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 3, Halachah 5.</i> is called tzitzit,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">in Numbers 15:38-39. Deuteronomy 22:12 refers to these tassels as <i>g'dilim</i> (braids).</i> because it resembles the locks of the head, as [Ezekiel 8:3] relates, \"And he took me by the locks of my head.\"<br>This<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note Halachah 8, which derives a halachic ruling from this comparison of terms.</i> tassel is called the white [strands], because we are not commanded to dye it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Torah alone (מדאורייתא), we are obligated to place tzitzit only on fabrics of linen and wool (Chapter 3, Halachah 1). Both fabrics are white and need not be dyed.</i> The Torah did not establish a fixed number of strands for this tassel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Though the Rabbis established a fixed practice, as explained in Halachah 6, according to the Torah alone (מדאורייתא) there is no fixed number of strands. Though there are some sources that appear to indicate that the Torah also fixed the number of strands required, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 88b concludes that the essence of the mitzvah of tzitzit is a Torah obligation; its explanation, however, is Rabbinic in origin.<br>Significantly, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 11:12) rules that if one includes more than eight strands in tzitzit, they are unacceptable. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 11:1 goes further and states that by doing so, one violates the prohibition forbidding adding to a Torah commandment. Note the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 11:60, which quotes other opinions that differ.</i>",
            "Then we take a strand of wool that is dyed a sky-like color<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., sky-blue. <i>Menachot</i> 43b relates that this color is also reminiscent of God's throne.</i> and wind it around this tassel. This strand is called <i>techelet</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam discusses the nature of this dye and its preparation in Chapter 2.</i> The Torah did not establish a fixed requirement for the number of times that this strand should be wound [around the tassel].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Menachot</i> 39a requires that the strand of <i>techelet</i> be wound at least seven times around the tassel, as explained in Halachah 8. This is a Rabbinic ordinance.</i>",
            "Thus, this mitzvah contains two commandments: to make a tassel on the fringe [of a garment], and to wind a strand of <i>techelet</i> around the tassel. [Both these dimensions are indicated by Numbers 15:38, which] states: \"And you shall make tassels... and you shall place on the tassels of the corner a strand of <i>techelet</i>.\"",
            "The [absence of] <i>techelet</i> does not prevent [the mitzvah from being fulfilled with] the white strands, nor does the [absence of] the white strands prevent [the mitzvah from being fulfilled with] <i>techelet</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this aspect, they resemble the arm tefillin and the head tefillin. (See <i>Hilchot Tefillin</i> 4:4.) As explained in the following halachah, however, unlike tefillin, they are counted as one mitzvah and not two.</i><br>What is implied? A person who does not have <i>techelet</i> should make [tzitzit] from white strands alone.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the practice in the present age, when we do not know how to obtain <i>techelet</i>. Even in Talmudic times, when <i>techelet</i> was available, it was very expensive, and many of the common people made their tzitzit without it.</i> Similarly, if [tzitzit] were made from both white strands and <i>techelet</i>, and afterwards, the white strands snapped and were reduced until [they did not extend beyond] the corner [of the garment],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The explanation of the Rambam's statements has been debated by the commentaries. Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Menachot</i> 4:1.</i> and thus only the <i>techelet</i> remained, it is acceptable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> emphasizes that the Rambam does not accept tzitzit that were made from <i>techelet</i> without any white strands. Since the verse states, \"and you shall place on the tassels of the corner a strand of <i>techelet</i>,\" there must be tassels of white strands around which to wind the <i>techelet</i>. Once this has been done, however, if the white strands are severed, one can still fulfill the mitzvah with the <i>techelet</i> alone.</i>",
            "Although the [absence of] one does not prevent [the mitzvah from being fulfilled with] the other, they are not considered as two mitzvot.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In General Principle 11 of <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam writes:<br>One might think that since neither is dependent on the other, they would be counted as two mitzvot.... [Nevertheless,] they are a single mitzvah... because they have a single objective, \"that you remember all the mitzvot....\" All the elements that bring about this remembrance are counted as a single mitzvah.</i> Instead, they are a single mitzvah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 14) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 386).</i> Whether [the tzitzit] a person wears on his garment are white, <i>techelet</i>, or a combination of the two colors, he fulfills a single mitzvah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Whether [the tzitzit] a person wears on his garment are white, techelet, or a combination of the two colors, he fulfills a single mitzvah.</i><br> The Sages of the early generations<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sifre Zuta, Mechilta D'Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai</i></i> related: [Numbers 15:39 states:] \"And they shall be tzitzit for you.\" This<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">the use of the singular form of the verb והיה</i> teaches that they are both one mitzvah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">teaches that they are both one mitzvah.</i><br> The [presence of each of the] four tzitzit is necessary [for the mitzvah to be fulfilled],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., although a garment has several tzitzit, the mitzvah is not fulfilled unless it has all four.</i> because all four are [elements] of a single mitzvah.",
            "How are the tzitzit made? One begins from the corner of a garment<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., the end of its woven portion. - The tzitzit must be placed at the \"corners\" or the \"fringes\" of the garment.</i> - i.e., the end of its woven portion. One ascends upward no more than three fingerbreadths from the edge,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Any further distance upward would be considered part of the garment itself and not its \"corner\" or \"fringe\" (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 11:9).</i> but no less than the distance from the knuckle of the thumb to its end.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is approximately two fingerbreadths. Any lower would be considered as \"below the fringe\" and not \"on the fringe\" (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 11:16).<br>Other opinions mention that these distances should also be applied in regard to the space between the hole and the side of the garment. It is customary to follow this view (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 11:10).</i><br>[A hole is made] and four strands inserted, [causing them] to be folded in half. Thus, there will be eight strands hanging down from the corner.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned in Halachah 1, the Torah does not explicitly mention the number of strands in the tzitzit. Although <i>Menachot</i> 39b derives this concept from the exegesis of Deuteronomy 22:12, the Rambam considers this process of derivation to be Rabbinic in origin (מדברי סופרים).</i> These eight strands must be at least four fingerbreadths long.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This decision is based on the Rambam's interpretation of<i>Menachot</i> 39a and 41b. Based on the same sources, Rabbenu Tam requires that the strands be at least twelve fingerbreadths long. His opinion is accepted as halachah by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 11:4) and the later authorities.</i> If they are longer<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">even if they are a cubit or two long - it is acceptable. - It is common to make the strands slightly longer than twelve fingerbreadths, so that, even if they tear, they will still retain the desired length (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 11:9; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 11:21).</i> - even if they are a cubit or two long - it is acceptable. The term \"fingerbreadth\" refers to a thumbbreadth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Sefer Torah</i> 9:9. In contemporary measure, a thumbbreadth is approximately 2 centimeters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 2.4 centimeters according to <i>Chazon Ish</i>.</i><br>One of the eight strands should be <i>techelet</i>;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Though the eight strands come from folding four larger strands, only half of one of these strands should be dyed. The other half should retain its natural color, white.<br>The Ra'avad disagrees with this point and maintains that one of the larger strands should be dyed in its entirety, thus producing two smaller strands that are dyed <i>techelet</i>. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 10) and other Ashkenazic authorities maintain that two of the four strands were <i>techelet</i> and two were white.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> supports the Rambam's position, noting that Numbers 15:39 states, \"And you shall place on the tassels of the corner a strand (singular) of <i>techelet</i>.\" Note also the commentary of the <i>Or Sameach</i>.<br>Significantly, archaeological excavations have uncovered tzitzit belonging to bar Kochba's soldiers. Only one of the eight strands was dyed <i>techelet</i>.</i> the other seven should be white.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The dyed strand should be slightly longer than the others, so that, even after it has been wound around them, it will be the same length as the others.</i>",
            "Afterwards, one should take one of the white strands and wind it once around the other strands close to the edge of the garment and let it go. Then one takes the strand that was dyed <i>techelet</i> and winds it twice [around the other strands], next to the coil made by the white strand, and then ties the strands in a knot. These three coils are called a segment.<br>Afterwards, one should leave a slight space, and then make a second segment using only the strand that was dyed <i>techelet</i>. Again, one should leave a slight space, and then make a third segment [using only the strand that was dyed <i>techelet</i> for this segment as well]. One should continue in this manner until the final segment, which is made of two coils of <i>techelet</i> and a final coil using a white strand.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The pattern of winding the <i>techelet</i> mentioned by the Rambam is based on his interpretation of <i>Menachot</i> 39a. As the Rambam mentions in Halachah 9, it must be followed only when the tzitzit include a strand of <i>techelet</i>. If they do not, as in the case of our tzitzit, different principles apply.<br>The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam's approach and suggests a different manner of winding the coils of the tzitzit, which resembles the pattern we use today. The Rambam was aware of this approach and, in one of his responsa, explains that the method he mentioned has its source in the Talmud (<i>Menachot</i>, ibid.), while the other approach is of later origin.</i> Since one began with a white strand, one concludes with it, because one should always ascend to a higher level of holiness, but never descend.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi, <i>Menachot</i>, ibid., states that since the white strand was used first, not ending with it would appear to detract from its importance.<br>The principle, \"one should always ascend to a higher level of holiness, but never descend,\" is applied in many other contexts within Torah law - e.g., <i>Hilchot Tefillin</i> 3:17.</i><br>Why should one begin using a white strand? So that [the coil that is] next to the corner of the garment should be similar to [the garment itself].<br>The same pattern is followed regarding all four corners.",
            "How many segments should be made at every corner? No fewer than seven and no more than thirteen.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Menachot</i> 39a explains that the <i>techelet</i> reminds one of the heavens. There are seven heavens and six spaces between them, thus resulting in a total of thirteen.</i><br>[The above] represents the most preferable way of performing the mitzvah. If, however, one wound only one segment around the strands, it is acceptable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This law also applies at present, as mentioned in the following halachah.</i> Should one wind the <i>techelet</i> around the majority of the [length of the] tzitzit, it is acceptable. For the <i>techelet</i> to be attractive, [however,] all the segments should be in the upper third of the strands, and the [remaining] two thirds should hang loose.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note the <i>Zohar</i>, Vol. III, p. 228b, which explains the mystical significance of the division of the tzitzit into three portions.</i><br>One must separate the strands like the locks of one's hair.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 8:7) obligates one to separate the strands of the tzitzit before putting on one's garment. Note the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 8:18, which quotes the <i>Ari zal</i> as stating that the word ציצת is an acronym for the Hebrew words meaning, \"A righteous person constantly separates his tzitzit.\"</i>",
            "A person who makes [tzitzit using only] white threads without using <i>techelet</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned in Halachot 4-5, the absence of <i>techelet</i> does not prevent one from fulfilling the mitzvah of tzitzit. Indeed, this is the manner in which most people fulfill the mitzvah at present.</i> should take one of the eight strands and wind it around the others, covering one third of [the length of] the strands and leaving two thirds hanging loose.<br>When winding [this strand around the others], one may create segments as one does when winding the <i>techelet</i>, if one desires. This is our custom. If, however, one desires to wind [the strand around the others] without creating segments, one may.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Significantly, besides the knot with which the tzitzit are attached to the garment (Halachah 7), the Rambam does not mention tying knots in the tzitzit at all. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 11:14) mentions the common practice in which five knots are tied on the strands, leaving four spaces, which are filled with coils in between them. There are certain authorities who combine the two opinions, tying the knots as mentioned in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, but dividing the coils into segments as the Rambam mentions (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 11:27-28,31).</i><br>The general principle is that one should intend that one third of the tzitzit be bound, and two thirds hang loose.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the tzitzit lack entirely strands which hang loose, they are unacceptable (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> There are those, however, who are not precise about this matter when [making tzitzit] with white threads [alone].<br>Should one wind a white thread around the majority [of the length] of the strands or should one make only a single segment,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This principle is also accepted by the opinions that do not require that the coils be divided into segments of three. Even so, for tzitzit to be acceptable, they must possess at least three coils (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 11:63,66).</i> [the tzitzit] are acceptable.",
            "Both the white strands and those dyed <i>techelet</i> may be made out of entwined strands.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam leaves the use of entwined strands up to a person's choice. The Ra'avad objects, quoting a passage from the <i>Sifre</i> that requires that the strands of the tzitzit be made by entwining different threads together. Numbers 15:38 uses the expression, <i>p'til techelet</i>. The word <i>p'til</i> implies \"twisted threads.\" See the <i>Targum Yonaton</i> to this verse. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 11:2) follows the Ra'avad's view and obligates the use of entwined strands. From Chapter 2, Halachah 7, it appears that the Rambam also considered this as the common practice.</i> Even a strand that is made from eight threads entwined into a single strand is considered as only a single strand in this context.",
            "Both the white strands of the tzitzit and those dyed<i>techelet</i> must be spun for the sake of being used for [the mitzvah of] tzitzit.<br>[Tzitzit] may not be made from wool which becomes attached to thorns when sheep graze among them, nor from hairs which are pulled off the animal, and not from the leftover strands of the woof which the weaver leaves over when he completes a garment. Rather, they must be made from shorn wool or from flax.<br>[Tzitzit] may not be made from wool which was stolen, which came from an <i>ir hanidachat</i>, or which came from a consecrated animal. If such wool was used, it is unacceptable. If a person bows down to an animal, its wool is not acceptable for use for tzitzit. If, however, one bows down to flax which is planted, it is acceptable, because it has been changed.",
            "Tzitzit that were made<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., attached to the garment and tied</i> by a gentile are not acceptable, as [implied by Numbers 15:38, which] states: \"Speak to the children of Israel... and you shall make tzitzit for yourselves.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Menachot</i> 42a relates that this verse serves as the source for the ruling that only a Jew may tie tzitzit.<br>The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> state that since the phrase ישראל בני literally means \"sons of Israel,\" tzitzit should not be made by women. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 14:1) does not accept this opinion. The Ramah, however, states that it is preferable for women not to tie tzitzit.</i> If, however, a Jew made tzitzit without the intention [that they be used for the mitzvah], they are acceptable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This principle can be derived from the above concept. Were it necessary for the tzitzit to be tied with the intent that they be used for the mitzvah, there would be no need for a special verse from the Torah to teach that those made by a gentile are unacceptable. The concept would be self-explanatory. Whenever a deed must be performed with a specific intention, a gentile's acts are not acceptable (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>The Ashkenazic authorities do not accept this premise and maintain that, at the very least, the strands must be attached to the garment with the intent that they be used for the mitzvah. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 14:2.)</i><br>Tzitzit that are made from those already existing are not acceptable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This principle is explained and illustrated in detail in the following four halachot.</i>",
            "What is implied? Should a person bring the corner of a garment which has tzitzit attached to it and sew it onto another garment, it is not acceptable. [This applies] even if that corner of the garment is a square cubit in size.<br>[This concept is derived from Numbers 15:38, which] states: \"And you shall make tzitzit for yourselves\" - i.e., [you should make them] and not [use those] which were made previously,since this would be as if [the mitzvah] came about on its own accord.<br>It is permissible to remove strands [of tzitzit] - whether white or <i>techelet</i> - from one garment and tie them on another.",
            "Should one suspend the strands between two corners of the garment and tie [tzitzit on] each of the corners in the proper manner, and then separate them from each other,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam is speaking about the following instance: The person used long strands and placed one end of them through each of the two holes. Afterwards, using the strands from each corner that was not passed through the hole, he tied both tzitzit, and then separated them from each other.</i> it is unacceptable.<br>[The rationale is] that, at the time they were tied, they were unacceptable, since the two corners were connected with each other through the strands. When the strands were cut, two tzitzit were made. This is considered as making tzitzit from those which already exist.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This law is based on the Rambam's interpretation of <i>Sukkah</i> 11a-b. Others (see <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 11:13) interpret that passage as speaking about the tzitzit of a single corner. If one inserts a single long strand in the hole several times, thus producing eight strands, ties the tzitzit, and then separates the strands from each other, the tzitzit are not acceptable. This is also considered as making tzitzit from those which are already existing.</i>",
            "[The following rules apply when] a person ties tzitzit over existing tzitzit: Should [he tie the second set] with the intention of nullifying the first set, if he unties or cuts off the first set,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 11:24, which describes the manner in which tzitzit should be removed from a garment.</i> the tzitzit are acceptable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since he intended to remove the initial tzitzit, there is nothing wrong with attaching the second one (<i>Menachot</i> 40b).</i><br>Should, however, [he have tied the second set] with the intention of adding [a second tzitzit, the tzitzit] are not acceptable even though he cuts one of them off.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Rambam, it does not matter which tzitzit he removes. For the tzitzit to be acceptable, both sets have to be removed, and then a single set retied.</i> When he added the second tzitzit, he disqualified both sets<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">By adding the second set, he transgresses the prohibition against adding to the mitzvot of the Torah. Therefore, both sets of tzitzit are disqualified. The Ra'avad and the Ashkenazic authorities do not accept the Rambam's decision. They maintain that while both sets of tzitzit are hanging from the garment, their existence is not considered at all significant. It is as if they do not exist at all. Therefore, by removing the extra set, one is not making tzitzit from ones which previously exist. On the contrary, one is bringing an acceptable set of tzitzit into existence.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 10:6) accepts the Rambam's view. The Ramah, however, follows the other opinions.</i>, and when he unties or cuts off the additional one, the remaining one is [disqualified because it involves] making [tzitzit] from those which are already existing, since the manner in which it existed previously was not acceptable.",
            "Similarly, all the tzitzit of a garment are unacceptable<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's statements have raised questions. Though all commentaries agree that the three tzitzit made when the garment had only three corners are unacceptable, the question revolves around the fourth corner. Why is the tzitzit made upon it disqualified? When it was made, the garment already had four corners. On this basis, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> (10:6) rules that, indeed, the fourth tzitzit is not disqualified and may remain.</i><br>[in the following instance]: A person placed tzitzit on a garment that had three corners.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tzitzit are required only on a garment with four corners, as stated in the proof-text quoted from Deuteronomy and mentioned in Chapter 3, Halachah 1.</i> afterwards, he made the garment a fourth corner and placed tzitzit on it. [This is also excluded by the commandment, Deuteronomy 22:12:]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a slight difficulty with the Rambam's statements: In this halachah he cites the verse from Deuteronomy as a proof-text, while in Halachah 13 he cited a verse from Numbers.</i> \"Make braids,\" [which implies that one may not use those] which were made previously.",
            "A garment should not be folded in half, and then tzitzit hung on the four corners of the folded garment,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although in its present state, the garment has four corners, unless it is sewn it is possible that the folds will open and the position of the corners will change (<i>Menachot</i> 41a). Note the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 10:6), who quotes a difference of opinion where the tzitzit should be placed during the time the garment is folded. Because of this difference of opinion, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 10:13 suggests not wearing such a garment unless it is sewn closed.</i> unless one sews it along [one] side entirely. [It is sufficient, however, to sew it] on one side alone.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our translation follows the explanation of the <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 10). Note, however, the explanation of the <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 10.</i>",
            "[The following rules apply] if the corner [of the garment] to which the tzitzit were attached is torn off the garment: If more than three fingerbreadths were torn, it may be sewed back in its place.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When the torn portion is three fingerbreadths long, it is considered as the \"corner\" of the garment. Therefore, the tzitzit are considered to be attached to a significant portion of the garment and need not be untied before the corner can be sewn back on the garment (<i>Nimukei Yosef, Menachot</i> 40b). The commentaries note the apparent contradiction between this law and Halachah 13, which forbids one to sew a piece of a garment to which tzitzit are attached to another garment. The commentaries differentiate between these two laws, explaining that there is a difference between a piece of fabric from another garment (Halachah 13) and a portion of the original garment which was detached (the present halachah). The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 15:3 does not accept this distinction, and maintains that even attaching a piece of the original garment is unacceptable. The later authorities suggest following this stringency.</i><br>If less than three fingerbreadths were torn off, it should not be sewn back.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A portion of a garment less than three fingerbreadths long is not considered significant. Therefore, the tzitzit are no longer considered to be attached to part of the garment.

If, however, both ends of one long strand are cut off entirely, the tzitzit are not acceptable. Rabbenu Tam does not accept this decision and requires that at least two entire strands remain their full length. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 12:1.)

There is a difference of opinion among the Rabbis if the exclusion of wearing tzitzit at night applies to all tzitzit, or if it applies only to garments which are worn primarily at night. According to the latter opinion, garments worn primarily at night do not require tzitzit, even when worn during the day. In contrast, a garment which is worn primarily during the day requires tzitzit, even during the night and one does not transgress the prohibition against <i>sha'atnez</i> when wearing it at that time.<br>By altering the terminology used by the Talmud, the Rambam indicates his acceptance of the first perspective. Rabbenu Asher is the primary exponent of the second position. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 18:1) mentions both views without reaching a conclusion.</i> when one is not required to wear tzitzit, and thus violate a negative commandment when the performance of a positive commandment is not involved.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Kilayim</i> 10:32, which mentions a similar concept regarding the priestly garments. The sash worn by the priests was made from <i>sha'atnez</i>. Therefore, the priests were allowed to wear it only when they were actually involved in the Temple service. Wearing it at other times constitutes a transgression, and not a mitzvah.<br>Significantly, Rabbenu Tam differs with the Rambam and allows the sash and tzitzit to be worn even during the times when doing so does not fulfill a mitzvah.</i><br>[This is because] the obligation to wear tzitzit applies during the day, but not at night [as can be inferred from Numbers 15:39]: \"And you shall see them.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 8:13, which states that this verse also implies that one should wear tzitzit in a manner in which the strands can be seen.</i> [The mitzvah applies only] during a time when one can see.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., the daytime hours. Note the <i>Chatam Sofer</i> and Rabbi Akiva Eiger (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 18), who mention opinions that maintain that the mitzvah is not limited by the times of day and night, but rather by situations when one can see the tzitzit. During a daytime eclipse, one would not be obligated.</i> [Nevertheless,] a blind man is obligated to wear tzitzit.

This ruling is based on the rationale that both the child and the adult share the same degree of obligation, a Rabbinical decree.

There are Sages who maintain that tzitzit is an obligation that depends on the garment - i.e., the mitzvah is completed by placing tzitzit on every garment which requires them. The other opinion states that tzitzit are an obligation incumbent on a person, that a person is required to attach tzitzit to his garments. The Rambam rephrases the latter opinion as follows:</i> Rather, the requirement is incumbent on the person [wearing] the garment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With this choice of phraseology, he desires to indicate that - in contrast to other mitzvot (e.g., tefillin) - there is no obligation from the Torah to wear tzitzit every day. Only when a person desires to wear a garment that requires tzitzit is he obligated to fulfill the mitzvah.<br>This conception represents a change of position for the Rambam. Rav Yitzchak Alfasi, whose decisions the Rambam frequently followed, maintains that each person is obligated to wear tzitzit, apparently indicating that tzitzit, like tefillin, are an obligation which a person is required to fulfill.<br>The Rambam apparently held this view himself at one time. Therefore, in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, at the conclusion of the listing of the positive commandments, he lists tzitzit (together with tefillin) as one of the positive commandments whose observance we must pursue. Here, his choice of phraseology indicates that, although the mitzvah is incumbent on the person, it does relate to the garment. Only when a person wears a garment which requires tzitzit is he obligated to fulfill the mitzvah.</i>",

Accordingly, the people took to wearing the smaller <i>tallit katan</i>, which could be accommodated to other styles of dress more easily.<br>There is no explicit mention of a <i>tallit katan</i> in the Talmud, although a story related in <i>Menachot</i> 44a appears to indicate that such garments were worn in that era as well.
