            "The fringe that is attached to the corner of the garment, and made of the same species of material as the garment, is called <i>Tzitzith</i> Fringes, because it is like the fringes of hair of the head, as it is said, \"And he took me up by the lock (<i>Tzitzith</i>) of my head\" (Ezekiel 8:3). This fringe is called \"the White (part)\", because we are not commanded to dye it. No definite number of threads is prescribed in the Torah for the fringes.",
            "A thread of wool, dyed the color of the sky, is taken and wound round the fringe. This thread is called <i>Techeleth,</i> the blue (thread). The number of times this thread should be wound is not specified in the Torah.",
            "This precept thus consists of two ordinances;—to attach to the corner of the garment a fringe projecting from it, and to wind a blue thread round the fringe, as it is said, \"Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them a fringe upon the corners of their garments … and that they put upon the fringe of each corner a thread of blue\" (Numbers 16:38).",
            "The absence of the blue thread does not bar the use of the white fringe. Nor does the absence of the white fringe prevent the use of the blue thread. How so? If a person has no blue thread, he puts in the white fringe alone. So too, if the white fringe and the blue thread have been attached and the white fringe has been severed and diminished up to the corner of the garment and only the blue thread was left, it is fit for use.",
            "Though the non-fulfillment of either ordinance does not bar the observance of the other ordinance, they are not two precepts but one precept. The ancient sages said, \"The text 'and it shall be unto you for a fringe' \", teaches that both ordinances form one precept. The four fringes on the garment are, all of them, indispensable, for the attachment of all the four constitute one precept. Whoever puts on a garment with white fringes or a blue thread or with both together has fulfilled one affirmative precept.",
            "How are the fringes attached? One begins at the corner of the garment, that is, at the edge of the woven cloth, and measures off a length not greater than three finger-breadths and not less than the length between the base of the thumbnail and the first joint. Four threads are inserted there and turned down in the middle, so that eight twined threads are pendent from the corner, The eight threads are not to be less than four finger-breadths long. If longer, even as much as one or two cubits, they are fit for use. The breadth of the thumb is the standard for all finger-breadths. One of the eight threads should be blue, and seven should be white.",
            "One of the white threads is taken up and wound once about the other threads close to the garment. It is then dropped. The blue thread is then taken and wound twice about the other threads close to the winding with the white thread. The threads are then tied. These three windings are called a section. A small space is left; a second section is made, the windings being done with the blue thread only. A small space is left; a third section is made; and so till the last division where the blue thread is wound round the other threads twice and the third winding is done with a white thread, because, as the winding began with a white thread, it should also end with a white thread, on the principle that things sacred may be elevated to a higher degree but may not be degraded to a lower degree. The reason why the winding begins with a white thread is that the corner of the garment shall have adjacent to it threads of the same kind of material. This is the method followed with the four corners.",
            "How many divisions are made in the fringes at each corner? Not less than seven and not more than thirteen. This is the choicest mode of carrying out the precept. But if one wound the threads, to form one division only, the fringe is regarded as correctly made. And if one wound the blue thread over the greater portion of the fringes, it is correctly made. The beauty of the blue thread is manifested if all the sections that are wound take up the first third of the pendent fringes, while the remaining two thirds are loose. The threads in this part need to be separated, so that they shall be like the fringes of hair on the head.",
            "When a person uses white threads only without a blue thread, he takes one of the eight threads and winds it around the others to the extent of a third of the length, leaving two thirds for the loose fringe. With regard to this winding, if he desires to make divided sections as is done when a blue thread is used, he is at liberty to do so. And this is our custom. If, on the other hand, he desires to make the winding without divisions, he may do so. In short, what he should aim at is that the part wound shall be a third of the length and the fringe two thirds. Some pay no attention to this point, when only white threads are used. If one of the white threads has been wound round the greater portion of their length, or if only a single division has been made, the fringes are regarded as proper.",
            "The white as well as the blue threads may be twined, if so desired. Even if the thread consisted of eight threads folded and twined so that it becomes a cord, it is still regarded as one thread only.",
            "The threads used for the fringes, whether white or blue, must be spun with the express intention of being made into fringes. They are not made of wool caught by the thorns where the sheep lie down, nor from the wisps that are plucked from the animal, nor from the remainders of the warp left by the weaver on the selvage of the cloth, but only of the wool-shearing or of flax. Nor are the fringes to be made from wool that has been part of the proceeds of a robbery, or that comes from a city that has gone astray (Deuteronomy 13:13-18), nor from wool of beasts set apart for sacrifice. If such wool has been used for fringes, the latter are unfit for use. If a person prostrates himself in worship before a beast, its wool is unfit for use as fringes. But if he so prostrates himself before planted flax, it is fit for use, because its character has been changed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">*The flax has been turned into linen.</i>",
            "Fringes made by a non-Israelite are unfit for use, for it is said, \"Speak unto the <i>children of Israel</i> and bid them that <i>they</i> make them … fringes\" (Numbers 15:38). But if an Israelite made them without thinking of their purpose, they are fit for use. Completed fringes attached to a garment are unfit for use.",
            "For example, if one took the corner of a garment that had fringes and sewed it on to another garment, even if the corner was a cubit long and a cubit wide, the fringes are unfit for use, for it is said, \"They shall make unto themselves fringes\" (Numbers 15:38) but not attach those already made—this being analogous to a thing that came into existence of itself. It is however allowable to undo the fringes from one garment and insert them in another, whether the fringes are white or blue.",
            "If threads were suspended from one corner of a garment to another and the threads in each corner were tied according to the prescribed rules, after which the threads were severed in the middle, so as to form separate fringes, they are unfit for use, because at the time when the threads were tied they were unfit for use, the two corners being connected by the threads between them, and they only became two fringes when they were severed, so that they were made out of fringes already completed.",
            "When a person inserted additional fringes in a garment that already had them, if his intent was to nullify the first set of fringes, he is to undo these or cut them off, and the set subsequently added is fit for use. If however his intent was to add the second set, then, even if he cuts off either of the sets, the one remaining is unfit for use, because by the addition he made all the fringes unfit; and when he undid or cut off a superfluous set of fringes, the one remaining turns out to have been fashioned out of that which had already been complete, and the first time it had been made it was unfit.",
            "So too if one inserts fringes in a garment with three corners and then makes a fourth corner and inserts a fringe in it, the fringes are all unfit for use, for it is said, \"Thou shalt make fringes\" (Deuteronomy 22:12) and not use those already made.",
            "A garment is not to be folded and fringes inserted in the garment as folded, unless one of the edges at least is sewn up.",
            "If the corner of the garment in which fringes have been inserted has become torn, and the tear is more than three fingers' breadth from the edge, it can be sewn up. If the tear is less than three fingers' breadth from the edge, it cannot be sewn up. If the space between the opening into which the fringes are inserted and the edge of the woven fabric has become less, (owing to the edge having worn away) the fringes are fit for use, provided that some portion of the fabric, however small, is still left. So also, if the threads of the fringes have become less in length, they are fit for use, provided that enough of them is left to make a loop. But if even a single thread has been severed at the point where the fringes are inserted, they are unfit."

            "Blue thread, wherever it is mentioned in the Torah, is wool dyed azure, the color of the firmament seen in a blue sky when the sun is shining. The blue thread mentioned in connection with fringes must be dyed with a special dye which retains its lustre without change. Wool that has not been dyed in this dye is unfit for use as the blue thread, even though it is of the color of the sky; as, for instance, if it has been dyed with indigo, lamp-black or other darkening material, it cannot be used as the thread of blue with the fringe. The wool of a ewe whose dam was a she-goat is unfit for use as fringes.",
            "How are the blue threads used with the fringes to be dyed? Wool is soaked in lime and afterwards washed till it is clean. It is then scalded in a solution of alum and similar substances such as are used by dyers, so that it may take the color. The blood of the <i>Chalazon</i> is then taken,—a fish the color of which is azure while its blood is black as ink. This fish is found in the Dead Sea. The blood is put into a cauldron together with other ingredients such as potash and similar substances used by dyers, and brought to a boiling point. The wool is immersed in the cauldron till it has assumed the hue of the sky. This is the blue thread used with the fringes.",
            "The blue thread of the fringes must be dyed with that express intent. If it has been dyed without this intent, it is unfit for use. If a little wool was dyed in the cauldron containing the coloring material as a test, in order to ascertain whether the color is good or not, the entire contents of the cauldron become unfit. How then is one to proceed? A small portion of the cauldron's contents should be removed into a small vessel. In this, the wool used for testing should be placed, and subsequently burnt, because it was dyed for testing purposes. The dye in the vessel used for testing is also poured away because its being used for testing has rendered it unfit to be used for dyeing the blue thread. The wool which is to serve as the blue thread is dyed in the rest of the dye which has not been spoilt.",
            "The blue thread is only to be purchased from a reliable expert. Otherwise there is reason to apprehend that it was not dyed with the express intent to be used with the fringes. Even though it had been bought of an expert, if it was afterwards ascertained that it had been dyed with one of the dark dyes that do not keep the color fast, it is unfit for use.",
            "How is it tested, in order to determine whether it has been dyed in accordance with the legal requirements or not? Straw is taken, together with snail's slime and urine that has been permitted to stand for forty days. The wool is immersed in the mixture for a period of twenty-four hours. If the wool keeps its color and does not become paler, it is fit for use. If however it has become paler, dough of barley flour that had been put aside to become stale for fish sauce is taken. Into it, the blue thread, the color of which has faded is placed. The dough is baked in an oven. The blue thread is taken out of the loaf and examined. If it has become still paler, it is unfit for use. If the color is richer and darker than it had been before baking, it is fit for use.",
            "In a market where blue thread is sold for fringes, and where the vendors have a reputation for trustworthiness, blue thread may be purchased without enquiry. No investigation is necessary, the benefit of the presumption continuing till suspicion of untrustworthiness arises. If blue thread was deposited with a non-Israelite, it is unfit for use, for fear that the depositary may have substituted other blue thread. If it was in a receptacle sealed with two seals, one within the other, it continues fit for use. If only one seal had been affixed, it becomes unfit for use.",
            "Blue threads, found in the street, are unfit for use, even if they are found severed (in the usual lengths). If however they are twined they are fit for use. A garment with fringes is presumed to be fit for use, if bought from an Israelite. It likewise has the benefit of this presumption if purchased from a non-Israelite tradesman. But if the non-Israelite is a private person, the fringes are unfit for use.",
            "If a garment is entirely red or green, or of any other color, the fringes which ordinarily are white should be of the same color as the garment; green, if it is green, red, if it is red. If the garment is entirely blue, the ordinary fringes should be of any color except black,—black resembling blue. One blue thread is wound round the other fringes just as is done in the case of other fringes that are not colored.",
            "Not to attach white fringes to one's garment is more culpable than to omit the blue thread. For the white fringes are procurable by all, while the blue thread cannot be obtained in all places and at all times on account of the need of the special dye, of which we have spoken."

            "The garment in which one is bound by scriptural enactment to insert fringes, is a garment that has four corners or more than four corners; its dimensions must be sufficient to cover the head and greater portion of the body of a child that walks by itself in the street and does not need any one to watch it and accompany it; furthermore the garment has to be of wool or linen.",
            "Garments of other materials such as silk, cotton, camel's hair, hares' down, goats' hair, etc., only require fringes by the ordinance of the sages—to make us heedful of the precept concerning Fringes, and their ordinance also applies to garments with four or more corners and of the dimensions above stated; for wherever the Torah speaks of garments without special qualification, it refers exclusively to such as are of wool or linen.",
            "\"On the four corners of thy vesture\" (Deuteronomy 22:12). This means that a garment requires fringes when it has four corners but not when it has three. But cannot the text also mean that the garment must have four fringes but not five? To guard against this inference, the text concludes, \"wherewith thou coverest thyself\", i.e., even if it has five corners or more. Why however should a garment with five corners be included in the obligation and one with three corners be exempted, seeing that neither has four corners? The answer is that the number five includes the number four. Accordingly, when fringes are inserted in a garment with five or six corners, they are to be inserted in those four of the five or six corners, that are furthest from each other, for it is said, \"On the four corners of thy vesture.\"",
            "A garment made of cloth (as specified above) and the corners of which are of leather requires fringes. A garment of leather, the corners of which are of cloth is exempt, since the main part of the garment alone is taken into consideration. A garment owned by two partners requires fringes, for it is said, \"in the corners of their garments\" (Numbers 15:38). The word \"thy vesture\" (Deuteronomy 22:12) is only intended to exclude a borrowed garment from the obligation of fringes. Such a garment is exempt for thirty days, after which fringes must be inserted.",
            "For a woolen garment, the white fringes are to be of wool. For a garment of flaxen material (linen) the white fringes are to be threads of linen, these being of the same species. For garments of other materials, the white fringes are to be threads of the same material as the garment, threads of silk for a garment of silk; goats' hair threads for a garment of goats' hair. If one desires to use woolen or flaxen (linen) threads as fringes for garments made of any other materials, he may do so. The reason is that fringes of wool or flax (linen) satisfy the requirements of the law whether the garments are of the same species of material or not; while fringes of other species are permissible when the garments are of the same species as the fringes but not when they are different.",
            "May woolen threads be used as fringes in a garment of flaxen material, or flaxen threads in a woolen garment, even when only white fringes are inserted? According to the strict rule, this should be permissible, since the prohibition of a mixture of wool and flax is suspended in the case of fringes, the blue thread which is of wool being inserted in a garment of flax (linen). Why then is this not done? Because threads of the same material as the garment can be used as fringes. And wherever there are a positive precept and a negative precept, both of which can be observed, this should be done. Where they conflict, the affirmative overrides the negative commandment. In this case, however, both precepts can be observed.",
            "In a garment of flax (linen), the blue thread is not inserted, but only white fringes of flaxen (linen) thread. This is not because the precept concerning fringes is superseded by the prohibition of a mixture of wool and flax. But it is a precautionary regulation of the sages who had in mind that such a garment might be worn at night when there is no obligation to have fringes on the garments, and so a prohibition would be violated at a time when there was no (over-riding) affirmative precept in force, since the duty of having fringes is incumbent by day and not at night, as it is said, \"that ye may look upon it\" (Numbers 15:39) which means at a time when it can be seen. A blind man is under the obligation of having fringes in his garments; for, although he does not see the fringes, others see them.",
            "It is permitted to put on a garment with fringes at night, during the working week-days as well as on the Sabbath, notwithstanding that the precept is not obligatory at night—provided however that the blessing for the fringes is not recited. At what time in the morning is the blessing for the fringes recited? From the time when the white fringes can be distinguished from the blue thread. What is the form of the blessing? \"Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us to enwrap ourselves in a garment with fringes\". And whenever, during the day such a garment is put on, the blessing is recited before putting it on. When fringes are inserted in a garment, no blessing is recited; the consummation of the precept is putting on the fringed garment.",
            "It is permissible, while clad in a garment with fringes, to enter a lavatory (privy) or bath house. If threads either of the white fringes, or the blue cord, have been severed, the fringes may be thrown on the waste-heap, because the fringes though used in the fulfillment of a precept, have no intrinsic sanctity. It is forbidden to sell a garment with fringes to a non-Israelite, unless the fringes are unwound; not because any sanctity attaches to them, but for fear that the non-Israelite, wearing the garment with fringes, may be joined on the road by an Israelite who will deem him a co-religionist, and the Gentile may murder the Israelite. Women, bondsmen and minors are exempted by the Scriptural law from the obligation of having fringes in their garments. The Sages however have prescribed that a male child, as soon as he can put on a garment, is under the obligation of having a garment with fringes, so as to be trained in religious observances. If women or bondsmen desire to wear garments with fringes, no objection is raised, but they do not recite the blessing. The same is the rule with respect to other affirmative precepts from the obligation of which women are exempt. If they wish to fulfill them without reciting the blessing, no objection is raised. Persons of doubtful sex and a hermaphrodite, because of the doubt, are under the obligation to fulfill all the precepts. Hence, they do not recite the blessing, but fulfill the duty without pronouncing the benediction.",
            "How is the obligation of the precept of fringes incurred? Anyone upon whom the fulfillment of this precept is incumbent, desirous of putting on a garment that requires fringes, must first insert them and then may put on the garment. If he puts it on before the fringes have been attached, he has neglected an affirmative precept. But garments to which fringes should be attached are exempt as long as no one has worn them and they are kept folded and put away, because the obligation does not attach to the garment, but is incumbent upon the owner of a garment (who wears it).",
            "Although one is not bound to purchase a garment and wear it, so as to insert fringes therein, still it is not right for a pious man to release himself from the observance of this commandment. He should always endeavour to be robed in a garment that requires fringes, so as to fulfill this precept. He should be especially heedful of this, during prayer. For scholars it is particularly disgraceful to recite the prayers without being so robed.",
            "At all times, a person should be heedful of the precept concerning fringes, since Holy Writ estimates it as so weighty that all the commandments are made dependent upon it, as it is said, \"And ye shall look upon it and remember all the commandments of the Lord\" (Numbers 15:39)."
