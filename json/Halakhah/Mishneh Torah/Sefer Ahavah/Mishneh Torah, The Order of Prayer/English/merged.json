Have mercy Lord on us and on Israel Your people and on Jerusalem Your city, the city of mourning, destruction and desolation given over to the hand of strangers.  She sits, her head uncovered like a barren woman that has not given birth.  Legions have devoured her and idolators have inherited her and given the carcasses of Your servants as food to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the earth.  Therefore Zion weeps bitterly and Jerusalem raises her voice.  My heart, my heart grieves for their slain ones; I am in anguish, I am in anguish for those they killed.  See her desolation and comfort her because with fire You consumed it and with  fire You will rebuild it, as it is written, \"And I myself will be, says the Lord, a wall of fire around it and will be its glory within (Zechariah 2:9).\"  Blessed are You, Lord, who rebuilds Jerusalem.

We sanctify you and we declare you King and three times  daily we declare Your holiness as it says by the hand of Your prophet, \"And they turned one to the other and said, 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts, the whole earth is filled with His Glory (Isaiah 6).\" His Glory and His Greatness fill the world and His servants ask, 'where is the place of His Glory?'  To revere him, those facing praise and say, \"Blessed is the glory of God from His place (Ezekiel 3).\"  From Your place, our King, appear and rule  over us because  we wait for You.  When will You rule  in Zion?  In our lives and in our day may you dwell, be sanctified and be exalted in the midst of Jerusalem, Your city,  from generation to generation forever.  May our eyes see the kingdom of your strength, as it is said in Your holy writings by the hand of David your righteous anointed one, \"The Lord will reign forever, Your God O Zion, from generation to generation, Halleluyah(Psalm 146)!\"  From generation to generation we will declare Your greatness and from eternity to eternity proclaim Your holiness; Your praise, our God, shall not cease from our lips because You, God, are a great and holy King.  Blessed are You, Lord, the holy God.  At the time when the communal agent says within this blessing, \"And one turned to the other,\" all the people respond, \" Holy, holy, holy, etc.\"  And when he says, \"Where is the place of Your glory?\" All of the people respond, \"They praise and say, blessed, etc.\"  And when he says, \"In our lives and in our days,\" all the people respond, \"Amen.\"  And when he says, \" By the hand of David, Your righteous anointed one,\" all the people respond, \"The Lord will reign forever.\"  And all of these, the words that the congregation responds, he recites with them and does not raise his voice at the time that they respond with him, one for the individual and one for the communal agent.  During the ten days from Rosh Hashanah until Yom Kippur, one says at the end of this blessing, as it is said, the Lord of Hosts is exalted by justice and the holy God is sanctified through righteousness.  Blessed are you, Lord, the Holy King. "
