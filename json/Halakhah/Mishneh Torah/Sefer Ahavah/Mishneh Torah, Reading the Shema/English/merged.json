            "The <i>Shema</i> is read twice every day,—in the evening and in the morning, as it is said, \"and when thou liest down and when thou risest up\" (Deuteronomy 6:7), the phrases in this text meaning at the time when men are lying down, that is, at night, and at the time when they have risen, that is, by day.",
            "What does one read? Three sections as follows: the section beginning, \"Hear, O Israel\" (Deuteronomy 6:4-9); that commencing, \"And it shall come to pass\" (Deuteronomy 11:13-21); and that commencing, \"And the Lord spoke\" (Numbers 15:37-41). The section beginning, \"Hear, O Israel\" is recited first, because it sets forth the duties of acknowledging the Unity of God, loving Him, and studying His words. This is the great and essential matter on which all depends. Then, the passage beginning, \"And it shall come to pass\" is read, this containing a charge to fulfill all the other commandments. Finally the section concerning Fringes is read, as it also contains a charge to remember all the commandments.",
            "Although the precept to wear fringes is not incumbent at night, still the section concerning this precept is recited at night, because it mentions the departure from Egypt, which it is a duty to recall by day and at night, as it is said, \"that thou mayest remember the day of thy going forth from the land of Egypt all the days of thy life\" (Deuteronomy 16:3). The reading of these three sections in this order is termed \"The reading of the <i>Shema</i>.\"",
            "When reciting the <i>Shema,</i> after concluding the first verse, one repeats in a low tone the sentence, \"Blessed be the name of His glorious sovereignty for ever and ever\" and then resumes the reading of the first section in the regular order from the verse, \"And thou shalt love the Lord, thy God,…\"to the end of the section. Why is the sentence above mentioned interpolated? We have a tradition that when the patriarch Jacob, residing in Egypt, gathered his sons about him, in his dying hour, he earnestly charged them concerning the Unity of God and the Way of the Lord in which Abraham and his father Isaac had walked. He questioned them, saying to them, \"Possibly, my sons, there is some one among you who is unworthy, and is not at one with me on the doctrine of the Unity of the Creator of the World,\" in the same way as our teacher Moses charged the people in the words, \"Lest there be among you a man or a woman … whose heart turneth away this day\" (Deuteronomy 29:17). They all answered, \"Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.\" This means, \"Our father, Israel, hear this, our [confession of faith]: 'the Lord our God is one Lord'\". The aged patriarch then ejaculated, \"Blessed be the name of His glorious Sovereignty for ever and ever.\" Hence, all Israelites keep the custom of reciting, after the first verse of the <i>Shema,</i> the thanksgiving uttered by the Patriarch Israel.",
            "Blessings are recited before the <i>Shema</i> and after it. When reading the <i>Shema</i> by day, two blessings are recited before it, and one after it. When reading it at night, two blessings are recited before, and two after it.",
            "The former of the two blessings recited before the <i>Shema</i> by day, is that beginning, \"Who formest light and createst darkness.\" The latter is that beginning, \"With everlasting love hast Thou loved us.\" The blessing subsequent to the <i>Shema</i> is that beginning, \"True and Firm.\" The former of the two blessings recited <i>before</i> the <i>Shema</i> at night is that beginning, \"Who bringest on the evening twilight.\" The latter begins \"With everlasting love hast Thou loved Thy people Israel.\" The former of the blessings, recited <i>after</i> it, is that beginning, \"True and trustworthy.\" The latter, that beginning, \"Cause us to lie down [O Lord, our God, in peace.\"]",
            "The first of the blessings recited before the Shema, whether by day or at night, is introduced with the formula, \"Blessed [art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe]\" and concludes with the formula, \"Blessed [art Thou, O Lord].\" Of the other blessings, each concludes with the formula, \"Blessed [art Thou, O Lord]\" but are not introduced with the formula, \"Blessed art Thou …\" These blessings as well as all the other blessings with which all Israel are familiar were instituted by Ezra and his court and no one is permitted to take aught away from the wording or add to it. The blessings which they (Ezra and his colleagues) ordained to conclude with the formula, \"Blessed [art Thou etc.]\" may not be recited without this formula. Those which they ordained should conclude without this formula may not be recited with it. Those which they ordained not to begin with a benedictory formula, may not be begun with it. Those which they ordained should begin with it may not be begun without it. In short, whoever alters the form the Sages gave to the blessings commits an error and must recite the blessing again according to its prescribed form. Whoever does not recite the blessing beginning, \"True and firm\" in the morning, and that beginning, \"True and trustworthy\" in the evening has not fulfilled his duty.",
            "If one has recited the second blessing before the first, either in the Morning or in the Evening Service, and whether the blessings thus transposed are those recited before or after the <i>Shema,</i> he has fulfilled his duty; for no order has been statutorily fixed for the blessings. If, in the morning service, one began the first blessing with the formula, \"Who createst light\" and concluded it with the formula, \"Who bringest on the evening twilight,\" he has not fulfilled his duty. But if one began with the formula, \"who bringest on the evening twilight\" and concluded with the formula, \"who createst light\" he has fulfilled his duty. Thus too, in the evening service, if one began with the formula, \"who bringest on the evening twilight\" and concluded with the formula, \"who createst light\" he has not fulfilled his duty; but if one began with the formula, \"who createst light\" and concluded with the formula, \"who bringest on the evening twilight\" he has fulfilled his duty; for the essential element in all Blessings is the Conclusion.",
            "When is the time for reading the <i>Shema</i>? In the evening, the duty is correctly performed if it is read at any time from the first appearance of the stars till midnight. If one however transgressed and delayed, but read the Shema before daybreak, he has discharged the obligation. The Sages fixed midnight as the limit only in order to prevent complete violation.",
            "One who reads the Evening Shema after dawn but before sunrise has not discharged his obligation, unless he had been unavoidably prevented from reading it earlier, as, for instance, if he had been inebriated or sick, etc. Anyone who unavoidably delays reading the <i>Shema</i> till this time does not recite the Blessing beginning, \"Cause us to lie down in peace.\"",
            "When is the right time for reading the <i>Shema</i> by day? To observe the precept properly, one should begin reading it before sunrise, so as to conclude the recital of the Blessing after the Shema exactly at sunrise. This interval is about a tenth of an hour before the Sun rises. One who deferred reading the Shema till the Sun had risen, has discharged his obligation—the period for reading the Shema being extended, for one who delayed, to the end of the first three hours of the day.",
            "If one anticipated the hour and read the Shema of the Morning Service after dawn, he has fulfilled his duty, even if he concluded it before sunrise. In case of urgency, as for instance, when one has risen early in order to set out on a journey, he may deliberately read it before dawn.",
            "If one reads the <i>Shema</i> after the first three hours of the day are gone, even though he had been unavoidably prevented from doing so earlier, he has not fulfilled the duty of reading the Shema at the right time. He is in the same category with one who reads the <i>Torah.</i> Still he recites the blessings that precede and follow it, at any part of the day, even if he delayed the reading till after the first three hours of the morning had elapsed."

        [
            "One who reads the <i>Shema</i> and does not concentrate his mind while reciting the first verse—\"Hear, O Israel, the Lord, our God, the Lord is One,\" has not fulfilled his duty. As to the remaining verses, if he did not concentrate his mind (while reciting them), he has nevertheless fulfilled his duty. Even if he was reading the Torah in his usual course of study or examining these sections in a scroll (to ensure correctness), and read them at the prescribed time, he has fulfilled his duty, provided however that he concentrated his mind while reciting the First Verse.",
            "Everyone may read the <i>Shema</i> in the ordinary postures—standing, walking, lying down or riding on an animal. It is forbidden to read the Shema, lying down prone with face to the ground, or lying on the back with face looking up. But one may read it while lying on one's side. An extremely corpulent person who is unable to turn on his side or one who is sick should slightly turn on his side and then recite the <i>Shema.</i>",
            "A traveller, journeying on foot, must stand while reciting the first verse. The remaining verses he may read walking. A person who is asleep should be aroused when the time comes for reading the Shema, and kept awake till he has read the first verse. If after that, he is overcome by drowsiness and falls asleep, he is not to be disturbed.",
            "A person, engaged in work at the time, pauses till he has read the whole of the first section. So also, artizans intermit their tasks while reciting the first section, so that their reading of the Shema shall not be perfunctory. The rest of the <i>Shema,</i> everyone reads, continuing his task in the meanwhile. Even if one is standing on the top of a tree or on a wall, he reads the <i>Shema</i> in that place, reciting there also the preceding and succeeding blessings.",
            "If one was engaged in the study of the Torah and the time has come to read the <i>Shema,</i> he intermits his study, reads the <i>Shema</i> and recites the blessings before and after it. If one was engaged in public duties, he should not stop but complete them, and then read the <i>Shema</i> if there is still time to do so.",
            "If one was eating, bathing, trimming his hair, turning hides in a tannery or hearing a trial in court, he finishes the matter in hand and then recites the <i>Shema.</i> If, fearing that the time for reading the <i>Shema</i> might pass, he interrupted the work on which he was engaged and read the <i>Shema,</i> he is accounted praiseworthy.",
            "If one who had gone to take a ritual bath has time to come up from the bath and dress before the sun rises, he should do so and recite the <i>Shema.</i> If he feared that the sun would have risen before he was ready, he should immerse his body in the water in which he is standing and read the <i>Shema.</i> He must not do so in water so foul that it has a bad odor, nor in water that has been used for soaking flax nor in water that is so clear that the lower part of his body would be visible. But he may immerse his body in turbid water that has no offensive odor and read the <i>Shema</i> in the place where he stands.",
            "While reading the <i>Shema,</i> one must not wink with the eyes, signal with the lips, or point with the fingers, so that his recital shall not be perfunctory. If he did any of these things, he has, though fulfilling his duty, been guilty of unbecoming conduct. A person should read the <i>Shema</i> so that the words are audible to himself. If he has not done so, he has nevertheless fulfilled his duty. He should enunciate the letters distinctly. If he has not done so, he has nevertheless fulfilled his duty.",
            "How should care be exercised in enunciation? One should take heed not to sound a letter with a strong <i>Dagesh</i> as if it were without such a <i>Dagesh,</i> nor a letter without a strong Dagesh as though it had such a Dagesh; nor sound a letter with a <i>Sheva mobile</i> as if it were immobile, nor, vice versa, sound a letter with a <i>Sheva immobile</i> as if it were mobile. Hence also, a pause should be made between two words, where the first of the two words ends with the letter with which the one immediately following it begins. For example, in reading the words <i>Bechol levavcha,</i> a pause should be made after the word <i>Bechol,</i> before reading <i>levavcha.</i> The same practice should be observed in the case of <i>Va-avadtem meherah</i> and <i>Hacanaf pesil;</i> so too the <i>zain</i> in <i>tizkeru</i> should be pronounced distinctly. One should dwell on the <i>Daleth</i> in <i>Ehad</i> a sufficiently long interval to enable one to acclaim God as Sovereign in Heaven and on Earth and towards the four cardinal points of the compass. The <i>Heth</i> in <i>Ehad</i> should not be pronounced hurriedly, for then the word would sound <i>Ee had</i><sup>*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Not one.</i>.",
            "A person may recite the <i>Shema</i> in any language that he understands. And if one reads the <i>Shema</i> in a secular language, he must take care to avoid errors in that language, and be as scrupulous in correctly enunciating the Shema in that language as he would be if he were reading it in the Sacred Tongue.",
            "One who reads the <i>Shema,</i> but not in the correct sequence has not fulfilled his duty. This only refers to the recital of the verses out of their correct order. But if one reads a later section before the one that should have preceded it, though this is not permissible, still, in my opinion, he has fulfilled his duty, on the ground that these sections do not immediately follow each other in the Torah. To recite a verse and then reiterate it is unseemly. But if one reads a word and then repeats it, for instance, if one reads <i>Shema, Shema,</i> he is silenced.",
            "One who reads the <i>Shema</i> but not continuously, has done his duty, even if he paused between the reading of one section and the next so long that he might have concluded the whole of it, provided that he reads the verses in the right order. If one reads the <i>Shema</i> when one is drowsy, not fully awake nor yet fast asleep, he has fulfilled his duty, provided that he is awake while reading the first verse.",
            "If a person is in doubt whether he has read the <i>Shema</i> or not, he should read it again and recite the blessings that precede and follow it. But if one is certain that he read the <i>Shema</i> and is in doubt only whether he recited the blessings that precede and follow it, he should not read the blessings. If, while reading the <i>Shema,</i> he made a mistake, he should go back to the place where he had made the mistake. If between one section and another, he forgot and did not know which section he had completed and which he had to begin, he should go back to the first section, namely to the verse, \"Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God.\"",
            "If one made a mistake in the middle of a section and does not know where he paused, he should return to the beginning of the section. If one recited the word <i>U-chesavtom</i> (\"And thou shalt write them\") and is uncertain as to whether it is the word in the first, or in the second section, he is to return to this word in the first section. But if the doubt arises after he had already read the phrase <i>Lemaan Yirbu Yemechem</i> (\"That your days may be multiplied\") he is not to go back, as it may be assumed that he has read regularly in the way his tongue is accustomed to do.",
            "A person, while reading the <i>Shema,</i> met other people or was accosted by them. If at that moment, he had already concluded one section and not yet begun the next, he pauses and salutes anyone whom it is his duty to show honour to, e.g. a father, teacher, or superior in learning. And he returns the greeting of anyone who first saluted him.",
            "If he was, at the time, in the middle of a section, he only pauses to salute one of whom he stands in awe, e.g. a king or a tyrannical individual, etc. And if one entitled to honour, e.g. a father or teacher, greets him first, he pauses to return the greeting.",
            "The divisions between the sections are as follows: Between the first blessing and the second; between the second blessing and the <i>Shema;</i> between the first section and second section of the <i>Shema;</i> between the second and third section of the <i>Shema.</i> One reading the <i>Shema,</i> when reaching these places, greets one whom it is his duty to honour, and acknowledges the greeting of anyone who first salutes him. But the conclusion of the third section and the opening words of the subsequent blessing are regarded as the middle of a section. One may only pause there either to salute a person of whom one stands in awe or to return the greetings of a person whom it is one's duty to honour."

            "Before reading the <i>Shema,</i> the reader washes his hands in water. If the time for reading has arrived, and he does not find water for the preliminary washing, he is not to delay the reading in order to search for water; but he is to wipe his hands with earth, or on anything solid, on a beam or similar object, and then he reads.",
            "The <i>Shema</i> is not to be read in a bath house nor in a latrine, even if there is no ordure in it, nor in a graveyard, nor in proximity to a corpse. One is permitted to read it after moving away from the grave of a corpse to a distance of at least four cubits. If the <i>Shema</i> was read in a place where it was improper to do so, it must be read a second time.",
            "Where a latrine has been newly erected but not yet used, the <i>Shema</i> may be read facing it, but not within it. In a new bath house, the <i>Shema</i> may be read. Where one of two buildings was set apart as a latrine, and the owner said of the second building, \"And this\", it is doubtful whether the latter has also been appropriated to the same use as the former, or not. Hence one may not deliberately read the <i>Shema</i> there, but whoever has done so has fulfilled his duty. If the owner uttered the phrase, \"This too\", both buildings are deemed to have been set apart as latrines, and the <i>Shema</i> may not be read in either. It is permitted to read the <i>Shema</i> in the courtyard of a bath house, i.e. in the place where people stand about, clothed.",
            "Not only the sections of the <i>Shema,</i> but anything that appertains to things sacred may not be uttered in a bath house or latrine, even in a secular language. It is forbidden to speak there of such topics. Even to meditate silently on the words of the Torah in a latrine, in a bath house, or in any unclean place that contains ordure or urine, is also prohibited.",
            "Secular matters may be discussed in a latrine, even in the Sacred (Hebrew) language. Thus also, the terms used to express the Divine Attributes, such as \"Merciful\", \"Gracious\", \"Faithful\", etc., may be uttered in a latrine. But the Proper Names of the Deity—which may not be erased—must not be uttered in a latrine or in a bath house that had been used. If, however, there is occasion in a bath house or latrine, to restrain one from what is forbidden, this should be done, even if the Sacred Tongue has to be used and the matter appertains to things sacred.",
            "It is forbidden to read the <i>Shema</i> where one is facing ordures of human beings, dogs or swine, even if hides are immersed in them (for tanning), or any other filth that emits an odor as foul as these. This reading is also forbidden where one is facing human urine. But where there is urine of a beast, the <i>Shema</i> may be read in front of it. When an infant is so young that it could not consume a quantity of cereal equal in volume to an olive, in the time that it would take an adult to eat a quantity of cereal equal in volume to three eggs, there is no need to move away from its stools or urine (in order to read the <i>Shema</i>).",
            "If the ordure is as dry as earthenware, the <i>Shema</i> may not be read before it. If it is drier than earthenware, so that it crumbles when flung away, it is regarded as dust, and the <i>Shema</i> may be read before it. When urine, which the ground soaked up, still wets the hand touching the spot, the <i>Shema</i> may not be read before it. Where this condition no longer obtains, the <i>Shema</i> may be read there.",
            "How far must one remove from ordure or urine, to be permitted to read the <i>Shema?</i> Four cubits. This applies to the case where these are behind him or beside him. But if they are in front of him, he must move away so far that he no longer sees them, and then he reads the <i>Shema.</i>",
            "This rule applies when he is in a room and on the same level with these. But if there was a place ten hand-breadths higher or lower than the level of their situation, he can stay there and read the <i>Shema,</i> there being an intervening space between him and the excreta—provided however that no foul odor reaches him. So too, if he covered the ordure or urine with a vessel, they are regarded, though still in the room, as buried, and the <i>Shema</i> may be read notwithstanding their being there.",
            "If one is separated from ordure by a glass partition even if the ordure is still visible through the glass, the <i>Shema</i> may be read near it. When a quarter of a log of water (= the volume of a hen's egg and a half) has been poured into a vessel containing urine of one micturition, the <i>Shema</i> may be recited within four cubits of it.",
            "If ordure is in a hollow in the ground, one may stand with his sandal covering the hollow and read the <i>Shema,</i> provided that the sandal is not in contact with the ordure. If it is exceedingly minute, a mere drop, he expectorates thick saliva upon it till it is covered and reads the <i>Shema</i>…. Many Geonim have decided that it is forbidden to read the <i>Shema</i> if the hands are unclean and it is right to follow this ruling.",
            "Where a foul odor emanates from any substance, one must move away [from it] to a distance of four cubits, and then one may read the <i>Shema,</i> if the odor has ceased. If it is still perceptible, one must move to a further distance where it is no longer perceptible…. The <i>Shema</i> may not be read in front of a cesspool or before a chamberpot, even though these are empty and emit no odor, they being regarded as a latrine.",
            "When filth is moving, e.g. if it is floating on the water's surface, it is forbidden to read the <i>Shema,</i> opposite it. A swine's mouth is regarded as moving filth; it is forbidden to read the <i>Shema</i> opposite it, till the swine has passed on beyond the reader's presence to a distance of four cubits.",
            "If one, while walking, is reading the <i>Shema</i> and reaches a place where there is filth, he should not place his hand over his mouth and continue to read, but he must pause till he has passed the place.",
            "If, when about to read the <i>Shema</i> in a room, a doubt arises in one's mind as to whether or not there is ordure or urine in it, he may read. If he is standing on a dust heap and he is in doubt as to whether there is ordure there, he is not to read till he has made an investigation, the presumption in the case of a dust heap being that it is a place where there is filth. If the doubt is as to whether there is urine there, he may read.",
            "Just as the <i>Shema</i> may not be read in a place where there is ordure or urine till he has moved away [to a distance of at least four cubits], so it is forbidden to read the <i>Shema</i> in the presence of any person, even a gentile or child, whose privy parts are exposed, even though a glass partition separates him from them, unless he turns away his face. Since he is able to see, he may not read the <i>Shema,</i> unless he turns away his face. Any part of a woman's body falls under the same rule. Hence, while reading the <i>Shema,</i> one must not gaze at a woman's body, even if she is his wife. And if a hand-breadth of a part of her body [which is usually covered] is exposed, he must not read the <i>Shema</i> while facing it.",
            "And just as one is forbidden to read the <i>Shema</i> in the presence of any one, the lower part of whose body is exposed, so it is forbidden for anyone to read it, who is himself in the same condition. One must accordingly not read it when nude, till he covers his nakedness. If his loins are covered with a girdle of cloth, skin or sacking, he may read the <i>Shema,</i> even though the rest of the body is uncovered, provided that (when sitting cross-legged) his heel does not touch his privy parts. If he is lying under a coverlid, and is otherwise without clothing, he should draw the coverlid closely below his heart, and then read the <i>Shema.</i> But he should not draw it about his neck and read it, for in that case there would be nothing separating his heart from the lower part of his body, and he would be in the same class with one who recites the <i>Shema</i> without wearing a girdle.",
            "When two persons are lying under one coverlid, neither of them may read the <i>Shema,</i> even if he draws the coverlid closely beneath his heart, unless the coverlid is so arranged as to separate them, so that their bodies, from the loins downward, do not touch. When a man is sleeping with his wife, young children or other young members of his household, their bodies are like his, and he is not affected by contact with them. Hence, even if his body touches theirs, he turns away his face, draws the cover closely beneath his heart and then reads the <i>Shema.</i>",
            "Up to what age are they, in this respect, regarded as young children? A boy, in this respect, till the age of twelve years and a day; a girl, till she is eleven years and a day old. And then only if they have the marks of puberty—breasts developed and hair on the body. In that case, he may not read the <i>Shema</i> unless they are separated by clothing. But if they are not physically so developed, he may read the <i>Shema,</i> even though their flesh touches his, and there is no need of separation till the male child has attained the age of thirteen years and a day, and the female child is twelve years and a day old."

            "Women, slaves and children are exempt from the duty of reading the <i>Shema.</i> Children are taught to read it at the proper time; and they recite at the same time the blessings preceding and following it, so that they may be trained in the performance of religious duties. One whose mind is preoccupied and in an agitated state because of any religious duty which he has to perform is freed from the obligation of reading the <i>Shema.</i> Hence, a bridegroom who has wedded a virgin is exempted from reading the <i>Shema</i> till he has consummated the marriage…. If however consummation has been deferred till the night after the Sabbath subsequent to the marriage, it is his duty to read the <i>Shema</i> from that night and onwards, as his mind has become calm and he is already familiar with his bride.",

A watcher, even if the body is not that of a relative, is exempt from reading the <i>Shema.</i> When there are two watchers, one watches while the other withdraws to another room and reads it. Then he returns and watches while his companion withdraws and reads it. So too, one who is engaged in digging a grave for the interment of a human body is exempt, for the time being, from reading the <i>Shema.</i>",

If the funeral procession had started, and the time for reading the <i>Shema</i> arrived while the bier is being followed, those needed for [carrying] it, such as the bearers and those who relieve them as well as those by whom these in turn are relieved, are exempt from reading the <i>Shema,</i> whether they are in front of the bier or behind it. Others who follow the bier but are not needed to carry it are obliged to read the <i>Shema.</i>",
            "When the people are engaged in listening to funeral addresses and the time arrives to read the <i>Shema,</i> they withdraw singly, to read the <i>Shema,</i> and return to listen to the funeral addresses that are delivered in the presence of the dead. But if the dead body is not in the place where they are gathered, all those present read the <i>Shema</i>—the mourner however is silent as he is under no obligation to read the <i>Shema</i> till he has buried his dead.",
            "After the interment, when the mourners have returned from the grave to receive condolences, and the people follow them from the grave to the spot where the mourners stand, to form a line to receive condolences—if there is time for the people to commence and conclude the recital of at least one verse of the <i>Shema</i> before they reach the line, they should do so. Otherwise they are not to begin but should first offer their condolences to the mourners, and, after they have left them, read the <i>Shema.</i> Those who are in the interior lines and face the mourners are exempt from the duty of reading the <i>Shema;</i> but those who stand in the exterior lines, since they do not see the mourners, have the duty of reading the <i>Shema</i> where they are standing.",
            "If one, exempt from reading the <i>Shema,</i> nevertheless desires to fulfill his duty strictly, and read it, he may do so, provided that his mind is free. But if such an exempted individual is in an excited state, he may not read it, till his mind is composed.",
            "All who are ritually unclean are bound nevertheless to read the <i>Shema</i>; and, while still unclean, they recite the blessings that precede and succeed it, even if it is possible for them to get rid of their uncleanness, on the same day; as is the case with those who have touched a creeping thing, or touched a woman in the period of menstruation, or touched one who has a running issue, or the couch on which anyone of these has lain, etc. Ezra and his colleagues ordained that only one who had had an emission—as an exception to all unclean classes—may not read the words of the Torah till he has ritually bathed. This ordinance was not adopted universally. The majority of the community were unable to observe it, and it fell into desuetude. All Israelites have accordingly had the custom to read the Torah and recite the <i>Shema,</i> notwithstanding that they had had emissions. For the words of the Torah are insusceptible of defilement, but remain always pure, as it is said, \"Is it not thus, my words are like fire, saith the Lord\" (Jeremiah 23:29). Even as fire is incapable of being defiled, so the words of the Torah are insusceptible of defilement, but keep their purity forever."
