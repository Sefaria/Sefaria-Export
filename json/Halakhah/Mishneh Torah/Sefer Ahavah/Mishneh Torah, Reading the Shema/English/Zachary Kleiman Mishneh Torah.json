            "Women, Slaves and minors are exempt from the obligation to read the Shema. [Nevertheless,] we teach to read it at the proper time and to bless before and after it to train them in the commandments. He whose heart is occupied and distracted over a commandments is exempt from all commandments including the recital of the Shema. Therefore, a groom who marries a virgin is exempted from reciting the Shema until he consumates the marriage because he's worried [about the possibility that] he may not find signs of virginity on her. If however it has been delayed until after the Sabbath he is obligated to read the Shema because his mind has calmed down and his heart sure of her even though they haven't yet consumated the marriage.\n"
