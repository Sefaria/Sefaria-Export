            "We [are obligated to] recite the <i>Shema</i> twice daily - in the evening and in the morning<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">as [Deuteronomy 6:7] states: \"...when you lie down and when you rise\" - In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 10), the Rambam mentions the beginning of this verse, ודברת בם... (And you shall speak of them...) as the source for the mitzvah of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>.<br>Nevertheless, his statements in this halachah do not necessarily represent a change of mind. Here, the Rambam is not interested in the actual source for the mitzvah itself (which is the case in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>), but in stating our obligation to recite the <i>Shema</i> twice daily, once at night and once in the daytime. This is derived from the end of the verse, as mentioned by the Rambam.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The obligation to recite the <i>Shema</i> at night is mentioned first both in the Mishnah,<i>Berachot</i> 1:1 and here in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, following the pattern mentioned in the verse quoted above: \"...when you lie down and when you rise.\"<br><i>Berachot</i> 3a understands this order as parallel to the creation of the world itself which began: ויהי ערב ויהי בקר (And then there was night and there was day..., Genesis 1:5 . (See also the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 1:1.)<br>i.e., when people are accustomed to sleep - this being the night - and when people are accustomed to rise - this being daytime. - The Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 10b) records a disagreement between the school of Shammai and the school of Hillel regarding the laws derived from the verse: \"... and when you lie down and when you rise.\"<br>Both agree that the <i>Shema</i> is recited twice daily, once at night and once in the morning. However, based on the above verse, <i>Beit Shammai</i> obligates one to recline while reciting <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night, and to stand while reciting it in the morning. <i>Beit Hillel</i> holds that the verse simply establishes the general times at which the <i>Shema</i> is recited, as stated by the Rambam in this halachah; i.e., at the time that people sleep and at the time that they are accustomed to wake up.</i> - as [Deuteronomy 6:7] states: \"...when you lie down and when you rise\" - i.e., when people are accustomed to sleep - this being the night - and when people are accustomed to rise, this being daytime.",
            "And what is it that one recites?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are various opinions as to what constitutes the positive commandment of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Commandment 419) states clearly that the Torah obligates us to read only the first verse of the <i>Shema</i> - i.e., <i>Shema Yisrael</i>. The reading of the rest of the three sections was instituted by the Sages.<br>Rabbenu Yonah understands that the whole first section constitutes the Torah obligation. (See <i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 63 at the end.) There is also an opinion that the obligation to recite the first two sections originates in the Torah. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Orach Chayim</i> 58.) However, in practice, everyone ultimately agrees that one must recite all three sections mentioned by the Rambam in this halachah (<i>Berachot</i> 13a).</i> These three sections:<br>\"Hear O Israel...\" (Deuteronomy 6:4-9),<br>\"And if you will listen...\" (Deuteronomy 11:13-21),and<br>\"And God said...\" (Numbers<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For, as explained, each of these paragraphs contains fundamental concepts central to the Jewish faith.<br>Note <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Commandment 420) who quotes the Rambam, not to explain the order of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, but rather to clarify why the Sages included these three sections in the <i>Shema</i>.<br>we begin with the section of \"Hear O Israel...\" - <i>Berachot</i> 13a, 14b, offers two different explanations regarding the order of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. The Rambam, however, does not quote either explicitly, but rather seems to suggest his own reason.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> holds that the Rambam's explanation of the order of the first two sections, \"Hear O Israel\" and \"And if you will listen,\" is in fact consistent with the Mishnah in <i>Berachot</i> 13a. Regarding the last section, the Rambam desired to supply us with both the reason for its inclusion and its placement after the second section (even though the third section precedes it in the Torah itself).</i> 15:37-41).<br>We begin with the section of \"Hear O Israel\" since it contains [the concept of] the unity of God,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The statement \"God is our Lord, God is one\" implies not only that there is only one God, but all creation is one with Him. See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 61:6.</i> [the commandment of] loving Him<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">\"And you shall love God, your Lord, with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your strength\" (Deuteronomy 6:5).</i> and the study of Torah,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">\"... and you shall teach your children and speak of them\" (Deuteronomy 6:7).<br>It must be noted that in <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i>, the Rambam quotes Deuteronomy 11:19 (a verse in the second section of the <i>Shema</i>), as the source for the mitzvah of Torah study.</i> it being a fundamental principle upon which everything is based.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to the concept of the unity of God. (See <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:6.)</i><br>After it, [we read] \"And if you will listen...,\" since it contains the imperative to fulfill the rest of the commandments,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">\"And if you will listen to all my commandments...\" (Deuteronomy 11:13 . This section also contains the commandment of loving God (verse 13) and the study of Torah (verse 19). It is, however, the mention of \"all the commandments\" which distinguishes this section as separate and unique from the first section.<br>and finally the portion of tzitzit, since it also contains the imperative of remembering all the commandments - \"And you shall see them (<i>tzitzit</i> - the fringes on the corners of four-cornered garments) and remember all the commandments of God and do them\" (Numbers 15:39).<br>Rashi, in his commentary on the above verse, explains how <i>tzitzit</i> serve as a reminder of all the Torah's commandments. The numerical value of the Hebrew word ציצית is 600 (צ = 90 י = 10 צ = 90 י = 10 ת = 400) There are also eight strings and five knots. Therefore, by looking at the <i>tzitzit</i>, one is reminded of the 613 divine commandments.</i> and finally the portion of <i>tzitzit</i>, since it also contains the imperative of remembering all the commandments.",
            "The commandment of <i>tzitzit</i> is not obligatory at night.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 15:39 states: \"And you shall see them...\" - implying that <i>tzitzit</i> must only be worn when they can be seen, i.e., daytime. Accordingly, there is no obligation to wear <i>tzitzit</i> at night. See <i>Hilchot Tzitzit</i> 3:7-8.</i> Nevertheless, we recite [the section describing] it at night because it contains mention of the exodus from Egypt.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">\"I am God, your Lord, who took you out of the land of Egypt to be your Lord, I am God, your Lord\" (Numbers 15:41 .<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the mention of the exodus can itself be understood as the reason for the inclusion of this section in <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. The Rambam, however, mentions <i>tzitzit</i> as the basis for the presence of this section in <i>Kri'at Shema</i> (see Halachah 2), since it is the <i>tzitzit</i> that cause us to remember all the commandments.</i><br>We are commanded to mention the exodus both during the day and at night<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Berachot</i> 12b.<br>It is interesting to note that in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam does not count the mentioning of the exodus from Egypt as one of the 613 commandments in the Torah, nor does he mention it elsewhere in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.<br>The Rambam does, however, count the commandment of the telling of the story of the exodus on the fifteenth of <i>Nisan</i> - i.e., Passover night - as one of the mitzvot. See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 157), <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 21), and <i>Hilchot Chametz U'Matzah</i>, Chapters 7 and 8.<br>According to some opinions, one can differentiate between the two obligations as follows: A person can fulfill his daily obligation with simply a thought about the exodus, whereas on <i>Pesach</i> night the mitzvah can be performed only through the verbal description of the redemption from Egypt. (See <i>Sha'agat Aryeh</i>, 13.)<br>This would explain the omission of this commandment from <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>. A commandment that can be fulfilled with a thought alone and not an explicit statement or action is not \"worthy\" of inclusion in the list of 613 commandments of the Torah. (See the Rambam's explanation of the commandment to remember Amalek: Positive Commandment 189).<br>The <i>Aruch HaShulchan</i>, however, disagrees with this opinion. In <i>Orach Chayim</i> 67, he states that even the daily obligation requires an explicit statement. Nevertheless, he explains that it was not chosen as one of the 613 commandments because the obligation to remember the exodus twice daily is not stated in the form of a command in the Torah to \"Remember,\" but rather, as a reason for another mitzvah (the mitzvah of <i>matzah</i>): \"In order that you shall remember...\" (Deuteronomy 16:3 .</i> as [Deuteronomy 16:3] states: \"In order that you shall remember the day of your leaving the land of Egypt all the days of your<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word \"all\" includes even the nighttime.<br>The <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Parshat Vayakhel</i> 216b) explains the mystical significance of mentioning the exodus from Egypt after proclaiming the unity of God.</i> life.\"<br>Reading these three sections in this order constitutes the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 1:5) mentions that the sections of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> also contain a reference to each of the 10 utterances of the revelation at Mount Sinai (Exodus 20:1-14), thus representing a complete statement of Jewish spirituality and values.</i>",
            "When reciting the <i>Shema</i>, after completing the first verse, one says quietly \"Blessed be the name of the glory of His Kingdom forever.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This phrase is recited quietly because it is not part of the section of the <i>Shema</i> as it appears in the Torah, but rather was recited by Jacob in Egypt, as explained later in this halachah.<br>It is, however, pronounced loudly on Yom Kippur. <i>Pirkei D'rabbi Eliezer</i> explains that the angels praise God with this verse. On Yom Kippur, we are as pure as angels and thus, emulate their practice (<i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i>).<br>It is preferable to separate clearly between the end of \"Blessed be the name\" - i.e., the words לעולם ועד - forever, and the beginning of the next section, ואהבת (And you shall love...) (<i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 61).</i> He then continues to read the first section in its normal fashion: \"And you shall love God, your Lord...\"<br>Why do we read it in this fashion?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., Why do we include this verse of \"Blessed be the name...,\" since it is not part of the section of the Torah beginning with \"<i>Shema Yisrael</i>...\"</i> It is our tradition that when the patriarch, Jacob, gathered all his sons together in Egypt close to his death,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Genesis, Chapter 49.</i> he commanded and urged them regarding the Unity of God and the path of God upon which Abraham and Isaac, his father, had tread.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This narrative can be found in <i>Pesachim</i> 56a.</i><br>He asked them: \"My sons, perhaps there are dregs among you, one who does not stand with me in the Unity of God?\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">What would cause Jacob to have such a doubt regarding his children? One of the greatest merits of Jacob is that he - unlike Avraham, who fathered Yishmael, and Yitzchak, who had Esau as a son - had only righteous children.<br><i>Pesachim</i> (ibid.) explains that Jacob desired to reveal the secret of the end of days to his children, but that this knowledge suddenly left him. He was worried that perhaps his sudden lack of understanding was due to the imperfect state of his children and therefore, felt compelled to ask them about their faith in the One God.<br>The Rambam omits all these particulars, since they are not relevant to the matter at hand - namely, the source of the custom of saying \"Blessed be the name...\" after \"<i>Shema Yisrael</i>...\"</i> This is comparable to the manner in which Moses, our teacher, said to us: \"Lest there be among you a man or woman [whose heart turns this day from God...]\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam adds this in order to teach us the nature of Jacob's doubts. He was not casting aspersions on the behavior of his sons, since he knew that their deeds were righteous. He was, however, worried that perhaps one of them had a mistaken understanding regarding the unity of God. This is in line with the verse the Rambam quotes. Moses is not chastising the Jewish people for their actions, but rather warning them of the possibility that there might be someone with a lack of faith that could lead to blasphemy later (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> (Deuteronomy 29:17).<br>They all answered and said: \"Listen, Israel,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jacob is also called by that name (Genesis 32:29).</i> God is our Lord, God is One,\" i.e., listen to us, Israel, our father, God is our Lord, God is One.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">God is our Lord, God is One,\" i.e., listen to us, Israel, our father, God is our Lord, God is One.</i><br>The wise elder responded:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Praising God for the fortune of having righteous children; \"Blessed be the Name of the Glory of His Kingdom forever.\" Therefore, the Jews are accustomed to utter the praise that Israel, the wise elder, uttered after this verse.</i> \"Blessed be the Name of the Glory of His Kingdom forever.\" Therefore, the Jews are accustomed to utter the praise that Israel, the wise elder, uttered after this verse.",
            "Blessings are recited before and after <i>Kri'at Shema</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 11a.</i> In the day, one recites two blessings before it and one after it. At night, one recites two blessings before and two blessings after it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are a total of seven blessings associated with the reading of the <i>Shema</i>, three in the day and four at night. The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 1:5) bases this on the verse \"Seven (times) in the day will I praise you\" (Psalms 119:164).<br>The <i>Tanya</i>, Chapter 49, discusses the reasons for these blessings at length, noting that, on the surface, they are not related to the <i>Shema</i> at all. That text explains that the basic intent of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> is to attain the love for God as described in the verse, \"And you shall love God, your Lord, with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your strength.\"<br>To reach such a level, one must first contemplate the greatness of God. Accordingly, in the first blessing, we outline the praises of God uttered by the angels, who are of supreme intelligence and spiritual wisdom. These lofty creatures proclaim God's greatness and abnegate themselves completely to Him, stating that He transcends even their ability to understand.<br>Then, in the second blessing, we describe God's great love for the Jewish people, as manifested by His giving us His Torah and choosing us as His people.<br>Having contemplated such ideas, we are prepared to reciprocate God's love for us by proclaiming our love for Him. We recognize His infinite Greatness and Unity, see His Providence in the events of our life, and internalize our intellectual understanding into an emotional outpouring for our Creator.</i>",
            "The first blessing preceding [the <i>Shema</i>] in the day [begins: \"Blessed are You, God...], the One who forms the light and creates darkness,...\" The second blessing [begins with]: \"With everlasting love, You have loved us...\"<br>[The <i>Shema</i>] is followed by [the section beginning] \"True and certain...\"<br>The<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">affirming the truth of the statements mentioned in the <i>Shema</i>.</i> first blessing preceding [the <i>Shema</i>] at night [begins: \"Blessed are You, God...], the One who brings the evening,...\" and the second [begins] \"With everlasting love, You have loved Your people Israel.\" The first blessing after [the <i>Shema</i>] is [the section begining] \"True and faithful...\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These blessings parallel the content of the three blessings recited in the morning.</i> and the second [begins] \"Lay us down...\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">in preparation for going to sleep.</i>",

The paragraphs of \"True and certain\" and \"True and faithful\" are also considered as blessings that follow another blessing, even though the <i>Kri'at Shema</i> itself would seem to constitute an interruption. Therefore, these blessings need not begin with a <i>p'tichah</i>, but simply conclude with the standard <i>chatimah</i>: Blessed are You, God (Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> 36a).<br>[The Rambam discusses only the concepts of <i>p'tichah</i> and <i>chatimah</i> and omits the second category of blessings mentioned in the Mishnah and <i>Tosefta</i> (i.e., long and short blessings). This seems to indicate that he equated a long blessing with that which has a <i>p'tichah</i> and a <i>chatimah</i>, and a short blessing with one that has only a <i>chatimah</i> (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). In fact, in his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 11a), the Rambam writes that even a long blessing has a <i>p'tichah</i> and <i>chatimah</i>, and a short one has only one of the above.<br>In contrast, Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 11a) holds that the distinction between long and short blessings is a matter of length only, irrespective of <i>p'tichot</i> and <i>chatimot</i>. He defines the blessing of אמת ואמונה - \"True and faithful\" - (the first blessing after <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night) as a long blessing, and \"Lay us down\" (the last blessing after <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night) to be a short blessing, even though they both have only a <i>chatimah</i> and no <i>p'tichah</i>.]</i><br>These blessings and all the rest of the blessings familiar to the Jewish people were instituted by Ezra, the scribe, and his court.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a general statement. In particular, there are some blessings that were not established by Ezra, but rather by the Sages of the Mishnah.

Only when one deviates from the <i>p'tichah</i> or <i>chatimah</i> of a blessing does the Rambam require the recitation of another blessing. However, a person who maintains the nature of the <i>p'tichah</i> and <i>chatimah</i>, but changes the wording of the rest of the blessing, fulfills his obligation as long as the basic intent of the blessing remains.</i><br>Anyone who does not say [the paragraph of] \"True and certain...\" in the morning prayer or [the paragraph of] \"True and faithful...\" in the evening prayer<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Berachot</i> 12a derives this from Psalms 92:3: \"To relate Your lovingkindness in the morning and Your faithfulness at night.\" Rashi explains that ויציב אמת, \"True and certain\" (which is recited after <i>Kri'at Shema</i> in the morning) is necessary, since it tells of God's infinite lovingkindness in taking our forefathers out of Egypt and splitting the Red Sea.<br>אמת ואמונה (True and faithful) (which is recited at night) chronicles our hopes and beliefs regarding our future, that God will fulfill His promise to redeem us from the exile and restore us to a vibrant life of freedom.

Therefore, he explains <i>Berachot</i> 12a as saying that one who does not say <i>Emet v'yatziv</i> has not fulfilled his obligation of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> and must therefore recite it again. The Rambam appears to accept this opinion.<br>However, the vast majority of the <i>Rishonim</i> are of the opinion that a person can fulfill his obligation to recite the <i>Shema</i> even if he does not recite the blessings. The above passage, therefore, is to be understood as teaching that one has not performed the mitzvah in its proper fashion if he omits the blessings.<br>Both the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 66:10) reflect this understanding. They add the word \"properly\" at the end of this halachah: \"One who does not say <i>Emet v'yatziv</i>, etc., does not fulfill his obligation properly.

            "When is the [proper] time for the recitation of Shema at night? The commandment [starts] from the time of the appearance of the stars<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 2a) states that the time for the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> begins at the hour when a priest who has become ritually impure may immerse in a <i>mikveh</i> and resume eating <i>terumah</i>. The Talmud explains that this is the time when the stars appear.<br><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 2a) holds that the <i>Shema</i> may be recited earlier, during the last hour before sunset. This is based on the understanding that Rabbi Yehudah, who disagrees with the majority opinion regarding the proper time for the afternoon prayer, also disagrees about the proper time for the evening prayer and <i>Kri'at Shema</i> contained therein. (See <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 235.) This will be discussed at length in <i>Hilchot Tefilah</i> 3:6.<br>There are several different positions regarding the precise definition of צאת הכוכבים (the appearance of the stars). It generally refers to the appearance of three medium-sized stars. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 235:1 requires the sighting of three small stars before reciting <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> explains that the basic halachah is indeed that three medium sized stars constitute the time of צאת הכוכבים, but that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> obligated one to wait for smaller stars in order to diminish the possibility of error regarding the recitation of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night.<br>There are three basic positions regarding the actual time of צאת הכוכבים (the appearance of the stars). <i>Shabbat</i> 34b determines that it refers to the time that it takes one to walk 3/4 of a <i>mil</i> after sunset.<br>The other two positions are found in <i>Pesachim</i> 94a: one defines צאת הכוכבים as the amount of time needed to walk four <i>mil</i> after sunset, and the other, as the time necessary to walk five <i>mil</i>.<br>There are two different methods of determining the time it takes to walk a <i>mil</i>. The Rambam, Commentary to the mishnah, <i>Pesachim</i> 3:2, maintains that it takes 24 minutes to walk a <i>mil</i>. However, the most widely held opinion - and the opinion accepted regarding <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i> - is that the measure of time is 18 minutes.<br>Therefore, according to <i>Shabbat</i> 34b, the appearance of the stars is 13 1/2 (3/4 x 18) minutes after sunset. Both the Vilna Gaon and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> maintain that צאת הכוכבים is determined in this fashion. Thus, the proper local time may be calculated by extrapolation based on the amount of light visible 13 1/2 minutes after sunset in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> on the day of the Equinox. Generally, people wait up to 36 minutes after sunset in order to be certain.<br>According to <i>Pesachim</i> 94a, the appearance of the stars will be either 72 (4 x 18) minutes or 90 (5 x 18) minutes after sunset. <i>Rabbenu Tam</i> strongly suggests adhering to the position that צאת הכוכבים takes place 72 minutes after sunset. Though some authorities support the 90-minute position, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein (<i>Iggerot Moshe, Orach Chayim</i>, Vol. 1, Siman 24), mentions only the position of the <i>Vilna Gaon</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, on the one hand, and <i>Rabbenu Tam</i> on the other.</i> [and continues] until midnight.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are three positions recorded in the Mishnah in <i>Berachot</i> 2a regarding the time until which one may recite the <i>Shema</i> at night.<br>Rabbi Eliezer says until the end of the first of the three watches of the Temple - i.e., one third of the night, which is until approximately 9:30 pm. The Sages say until midnight, and Rabban Gamliel says until dawn. The Mishnah then explains that the Sages' opinion is, in effect, that one may recite the <i>Shema</i> until dawn, but that they mentioned midnight as a preferred time in order to distance people from transgression. This is the source of this halachah in the Rambam.<br>The <i>Rosh</i> and the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 235) hold that the halachah follows Rabban Gamliel's position, and that a priori (לכתחילה), a person may read the <i>Shema</i> at night until dawn. The Rambam sees the Sages' position as halachically valid, and therefore one may rely on Rabban Gamliel only after the fact (בדיעבד). The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 235:3 quotes the Rambam's position. (See also <i>Mishnah Berurah 235:34-35.)</i><br>A person who transgresses and delays - the Rabbinic decree that the <i>Shema</i> should be read before midnight.</i><br>A person who transgresses and delays fulfills his obligation if he recites [the Shema] before dawn.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 1:1), the Rambam defines dawn (עלות השחר) as the light that radiates from the east before sunrise.<br>There are three major positions regarding this time. All are based on <i>Pesachim</i> 94a which defines the time from dawn until sunrise as that in which a person can walk either 4 <i>mil</i> (according to one opinion) or 5 <i>mil</i> (according to the other).<br>As mentioned above, there are two opinions regarding the measure of time it takes to walk a <i>mil</i>: 18 minutes or 24 minutes. Thus, Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi defines dawn as 120 (5 x 24) minutes before sunrise. The most widely held view is that it is 90 (5 x 18) minutes before sunrise, while the <i>Beit Yosef</i> holds that dawn is 72 (4 x 18) minutes before sunrise. This is the opinion of the Rambam, as stated in his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 1:1.)</i> [The Sages established the limit] of midnight only in order to distance us from negligent wrongdoing.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Berachot</i> 1:1 lists other instances where the Sages established similar guidelines, e.g., partaking of sacrificial meat, burning sacrificial limbs.</i>",

The evening <i>Shema</i> must be recited \"when you lie down.\" The Torah left the definition of that term to the Rabbis. The latter maintained that a person who intentionally delays the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> cannot recite it after dawn. However, they were more lenient in regard to a person who was unavoidably detained and gave him until sunrise.</i> - e.g., drunk or sick, or in a similar situation.

The commandment is that one should start to read before sunrise<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Mishnah, (<i>Berachot</i> 9b) records a disagreement regarding the time of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> in the morning.<br>An anonymous position sees the earliest possible time as when one can distinguish between <i>techelet</i> (blue-green) and white. Rabbi Eliezer says: Between green and blue-green - i.e., later - and that the time lasts until sunrise. Rabbi Yehoshua says that one may recite the <i>Shema</i> \"until three hours.\"<br>The Talmud then adds various other opinions and quotes Abaye as saying that the <i>Shema</i> should be recited כותיקין - i.e., one should finish reciting the <i>Shema</i> as the sun rises, in order to start the silent <i>Amidah</i> with the sunrise.<br>The Rambam clearly prefers this position and establishes 6 minutes as a reasonable amount of time to recite the <i>Shema</i> and the blessing after it, in order to start the <i>Amidah</i> at the proper time. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (<i>Orach Chaim</i> 58:1) explains that all opinions agree that the commandment to recite <i>Shema</i> in the morning begins at dawn. The only disagreement revolves around the optimum time to recite <i>Kri'at Shema</i>.

The <i>Magen Avraham</i> holds that daylight is divided into 12 equal parts from dawn until the appearance of the stars. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> and the <i>Vilna Gaon</i> hold that daylight is determined from sunrise to sunset.<br>Therefore, the end of the third hour according to the <i>Magen Avraham</i> is earlier than that of the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> and the <i>Vilna Gaon</i>, and even though each \"hour\" is longer, it is calculated from dawn, which is at least 72 minutes before sunrise.

We must say that the Rambam understands Rabbi Yehoshua's position as secondary and that, at the outset, one should recite the <i>Shema</i> 6 minutes before sunrise. Indeed, in his responsa, he writes that it it is preferable to read the <i>Shema</i> without a <i>minyan</i> before sunrise, than to wait until after sunrise to recite it together with a <i>minyan</i>.<br>The majority of <i>Rishonim</i> (see Rabbenu Asher on <i>Berachot</i> 9b and <i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 58) disagree with the Rambam and understand that although reciting <i>Kriat Shema</i> just prior to sunrise is the most desirable method of fulfilling one's obligation (מצוה מן המובחר), the actual commandment is from before sunrise (i.e., the time at which one can recognize his friend 6 feet away) to the end of the third hour.

(See <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 6:2.) The requirement to wash our hands upon rising in the morning was established by the Sages as a preparation for <i>Kri'at</i> Shema and the <i>Amidah</i>.

In response to receiving anew his soul from Heaven, one is obligated to praise and thank God. In that context, the Sages also instituted the requirement that he sanctify himself for his day's worship, just as the priests in the Temple did - i.e., by washing his hands with water from a vessel.

If he has no father, the obligation falls on his mother and on the local Rabbinic court (<i>Terumat Hadeshen</i> 99).<br><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 48a) differs and explains that the Sages placed the obligation on the minor himself. Support for this premise can be derived from the Rambam's decision in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 5:15-16, which states that an adult who ate a small meal can fulfill his obligation to recite grace by listening to a child reciting those blessings (for both are obligated by virtue of Rabbinic decree).

The phrase ובלכתך בדרך - \"and as you go in your way\" implies that the obligation to recite the <i>Shema</i> only applies to someone going on \"your way,\" i.e., involved in his own personal affairs and not preoccupied with the fulfillment of a mitzvah as is a bridegroom. [In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam mentions that the bridegroom is involved in the mitzvah of being fruitful and multiplying.]<br>Rashi explains that this concept could not be derived from the phrase בשבתך בביתך - \"and while you are sitting in your house\" because if there were only one verse, one would have thought that only one who is actually involved in the performance of a commandment is exempted. Thus, an additional phrase is necessary to exempt a bridegroom, who though not immediately involved in the performance of the mitzvah is in an anxious state, because of the possible problems inherent in the overall situation.</i> because he is distracted lest he not find her a virgin.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">as explained above. Rabbenu Manoach writes in the name of the Ra'avad that the bridegroom is exempt from <i>Kri'at Shema</i> only if he is able to have relations with his wife. However, if she is menstruating or sick, he is obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i>.<br>Rabbenu Manoach also discusses the different views regarding the bridegroom's obligation to recite the <i>Shema</i> during the day if he does not engage in relations the first night. He concludes that he should be obligated since \"the Jews are a holy people and the bridegroom will be able to divert his thoughts from his wife and concentrate on reciting the <i>Shema</i>.\"</i><br>However, if he delays until Saturday night after the wedding<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is dependent on the Talmudic custom (<i>Ketubot</i> 2a), which relates that virgins would marry on Wednesday night.<br>and does not have relations with her, he is obligated to recite the Shema from that time onward, since - he has waited this long, we can assume that...</i> and does not have relations with her, he is obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i> from that time onward, since his mind has settled and he is familiar with her even though they have not consummated the marriage.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., he is no longer nervous and distracted and can be expected to recite the <i>Shema</i> with the proper intention. In his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam mentions that by this time, his all-consuming desire to consummate the marriage has passed.<br>In this instance, the actual halachah does not reflect the Rambam's position. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 70:3, mentions that bridegrooms were originally exempt from <i>Kri'at Shema</i> the first three days (i.e., days and nights) after the wedding. However, today, because of the general lack of intention that everyone has regarding <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, even the bridegroom is obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i>.<br>The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (70:14) adds that a bridegroom who does not recite the <i>Shema</i> appears haughty, because his actions appear to imply that he usually has a high level of intentions. The bridegroom is also obligated to recite the blessings before and after <i>Kri'at Shema</i> and to pray as usual (<i>Magen Avraham; Mishnah Berurah</i>). These positions are based on <i>Tosafot</i> in <i>Berachot</i> 17b.</i>",

A bridegroom's lack of concentration stems from his involvement with a mitzvah. In contrast, the mourner's inability to concentrate is a personal matter. Rashi elaborates: Though mourning is a mitzvah, the pain associated with mourning is not.<br>The Jerusalem Talmud notes that a mourner should not voluntarily recite the <i>Shema</i>.

            "After the burial, the mourners return to receive condolences and the people follow them from the gravesite to the place where they form a line to receive condolences.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The people form a שורה - a line (or lines) around the mourners. Afterwards, they offer their condolences one by one, as they pass before the mourners (<i>Hilchot Aivel</i> 13:1,2). Others interpret the שורה as two lines facing each other. The mourners then walk between these two lines, and as they pass, the people offer their condolences.<br>The people are generally accustomed to say: May God comfort you among the other mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.</i> If the people are able to start and finish even one verse [of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>] before they arrive at the line,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">directly before the mourners</i> they should do so.

In his commentary on <i>Mishnah Pe'ah</i> 1:1, the Rambam divides acts of lovingkindness into two categories: a) those one does with his money, such as charity,b) those one does with his body - e.g., comforting mourners and accompanying the dead to burial.<br>Rabbenu Yonah states explicitly that this is a Torah commandment. The Rambam, however, is of the opinion that burying the dead, comforting the mourners, and all acts of lovingkindness are Rabbinic commandments. In <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 14:1, he writes:<br>It is a positive commandment of Rabbinic origin to visit the sick, comfort those mourning, take out the dead, bring in the bride, accompany guests [from your house] and to involve oneself in those things necessary for burial - i.e., to carry [the coffin] on his shoulders, to walk before him, to eulogize him, to dig [the grave] and to bury him.<br>The Rambam's classification of these commandments as of Rabbinic origin creates a problem for us. How are we to understand the halachot we have just learned?<br>The Rambam has taught us that those involved in the burial of the dead and the comforting of the mourners are exempt from reciting the <i>Shema</i>, based on the principle that those involved in the performance of one commandment are exempt from another. According to Rabbenu Yonah, who understands גמילות חסד (acts of lovingkindness) to be Torah commandments, this is easily comprehended. However, according to the Rambam, how can involvement in a Rabbinic commandment exempt one from the fulfillment of a Torah obligation, especially one as central as <i>Kri'at Shema</i>?<br>The answer to this question depends on the continuation of <i>Hilchot Eivel</i>, <i>ibid.</i>:<br>Even though all these commandments are of Rabbinic origin, they are included [in the command] ואהבת לרעך כמוך (Love your fellow as yourself, Leviticus 19:18 . All those things that you would want others to do for you in the realm of Torah and commandments, you should do for your colleague.<br>Thus, the Rabbinic commandments regarding acts of lovingkindness are the specific ways established by the sages to express the Torah commandment of \"Love your fellow as yourself.\" Accordingly, although these commandments are Rabbinic in origin, since their ultimate source is found in a Torah commandment, the rule that \"one performing one commandment is exempt from another\" applies to them as well.</i> Those standing in the inner line<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., they can see the faces of the mourners - are exempt from Kri'at Shema.

On one hand, we see Torah study as being associated with the student, as obvious from the law, <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 5:11, that allows a Torah scholar to forgo the honor due him. Although that honor is not being paid to him personally, but to the Torah knowledge he possesses, that Torah is considered his to the extent that he can forego the honor. Nevertheless, even while Torah is associated with the person studying it, its essential Godly nature remains intact to the extent that it cannot contract ritual impurity.</i> Rather, they stand in their state of purity forever, as [Jeremiah 23:29] states: \"Are not my words like fire, declares the Lord.\" Just as fire is incapable of becoming ritually impure, so, too, the words of Torah are never defiled."
