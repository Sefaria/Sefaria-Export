            "It is a biblical positive command to recite grace after meals, as it is written: \"When you have eaten your fill, bless the Lord your God\" (Deuteronomy 8:10). One is biblically obligated to recite the grace only when sated, since it is written <i>when you have eaten your fill, bless</i>. But on rabbinic grounds, one is to recite grace after eating anything the size of an olive.",
            "By rabbinical enactment, one should recite a blessing before enjoying any food. He should even recite a blessing before eating or drinking anything at all. So too, one should recite a blessing before enjoying a sweet fragrance. Whoever enjoys anything without a blessing commits sacrilege. Similarly, by rabbinical enactment, one should recite grace after eating or drinking anything; that is, if he drinks a quarter of a <i>log</i> [equal to the contents of an egg and a half] or eats an olive's bulk. Mere tasting requires no blessing either before or after, if it is less than a quarter of a <i>log</i>.",
            "Just as blessings are recited over food enjoyment, so must we recite a blessing before the performance of each religious duty. The sages instituted many blessings in the form of praise, thanksgiving, and petition, in order to have God in mind constantly, even when one does not partake of food and drink or perform a religious duty.",

            "One should recite all blessings audibly enough for himself to hear what he is saying; but if he did not recite them audibly, he has nevertheless fulfilled his duty, whether he uttered them with his lips or recited them in his mind.",
            "There must be no pause between any blessing and the object for which it is pronounced. If such a pause has occurred, the blessing must be repeated. If the interruption was due to anything pertaining to the blessing, the blessing should not be repeated. If, for example, one recited the blessing over bread, and before eating he said: \"Bring salt, bring the cooked food, give food to so-and-so, feed the animals,\" he should not repeat the blessing.",

Children are taught the blessings in their regular form. This is permitted, even though they recite the blessings in vain during the study period. We should not answer <i>Amen</i> after them; he who answers <i>Amen</i> after them does not fulfill his duty."

They are: grapes, pomegranates, figs, olives and dates. After eating any of these, one blessing is recited that sums up the first three blessings of the grace after meals. Over fruit that grows on the ground and over green vegetables the initial blessing is \"who createst the fruit of the earth,\" and at the end, \"who createst many living beings.\" Over food that does not grow from the soil, such as meat, cheese, fish, eggs, water, milk and honey, the initial blessing is \"by whose word all things come into being,\" and at the end, \"who createst many living beings.\" A person who drinks water not to quench his thirst is not required to say a blessing before or after.",
