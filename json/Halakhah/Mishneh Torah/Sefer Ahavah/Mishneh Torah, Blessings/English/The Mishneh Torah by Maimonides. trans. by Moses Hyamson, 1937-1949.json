            "It is an affirmative precept of the Torah to say Grace after a meal, as it is said, \"And thou shalt eat and be satisfied and shalt bless the Lord, thy God\" (Deuteronomy 8:10). The Torah only imposes the obligation on a person when he is satisfied; for it is said, \"When thou hast eaten and art satisfied, thou shalt bless etc.\" According to the ordinances of the sages, however, even if one has eaten only as much food as the size of an olive, he recites Grace after the meal.",
            "It is also an ordinance of the Sages that before partaking of any food, a blessing is first recited and then it is eaten. And however little one intends to eat or drink, the blessing is first recited and then the refreshment is taken. So too, one who wishes to smell a fragrant odor first recites the blessing and then enjoys the fragrance. Whoever partakes of any enjoyment without reciting a blessing commits a trespass. It is also an ordinance of the sages that a blessing is to be recited after eating or drinking, provided that the quantity drunk is at least a quarter of a <i>log</i> (equal to the volume of an egg and a half), and the food eaten is at least as much as an olive in size. A cook who is tasting food does not need to recite a blessing before or after doing so, provided that the quantity tasted is less than a quarter of a <i>log.</i>",
            "And just as blessings are recited when partaking of material enjoyments, so when about to fulfill any precept, a blessing is said, after which the precept is performed. The sages have moreover instituted several blessings of praise and thanksgiving and petition, in order that when not partaking of material enjoyments nor engaged in the fulfillment of religious duties we should constantly have God in mind. ",
            "All blessings accordingly fall into three kinds; blessings recited when partaking of material enjoyments, blessings recited when fulfilling religious duties, and blessings of thanksgiving, which have the character of praise, thanksgiving and supplication, and the purpose of which is that we should always have the Creator in mind and revere Him.",
            "The forms of all the blessings were established by Ezra and his Court. It is not proper to vary them, or add to or take aught away from any one of them. Whoever deviates from the form which the Sages have given to the Blessings, is in error. Any blessing in which the name of God and His Sovereignty are not mentioned is not regarded as a blessing, unless it follows immediately another blessing.",
            "All blessings may be recited in any language, provided that the form instituted by the sages is followed. And if the form has been changed, the duty of reciting the blessing is discharged, since the name of God and His sovereignty as well as the subject matter of the blessing have been mentioned, even though in a foreign tongue.",
            "All blessings should be so recited that the reciter hears what he is saying. But if he has not recited the blessings so that he can hear them, he has nevertheless fulfilled his duty, whether he uttered them with his lips or recited them mentally.",
            "There must be no interruption between the recital of any blessing and that for which it is recited. If such an interruption has taken place, the blessing must be repeated. If the interruption was in connection with matters appertaining to the blessing, the blessing need not be recited a second time. For example, a person recites the blessing over bread; and, before he eats it, says \"Bring salt\", \"bring the cooked course\", \"give food to So and So\", \"Feed the cattle\", he need not recite the blessing a second time. The same is the rule in similar cases.",
            "All blessings may be recited by one ritually unclean, whether the uncleanness is of such a nature that he can free himself of it the same day or not. It is forbidden to a male to recite blessings while in a nude state.",
            "Blessings, even when they have already been recited by a person in fulfillment of his obligation, may be said by him, a second time, on behalf of others who have not said them, so as to free them of their obligation. Blessings recited on partaking of refreshments, when this is not a religious duty, form an exception. A person may only recite the blessings on behalf of others, when he also partakes of the refreshment. But when the refreshment is also a religious duty, as, for instance, eating unleavened bread on the first nights of Passover, eating bread or drinking wine at the inauguration of Sabbath and Festival, a person may recite the blessings for others who eat and drink, without having to join them.",
            "He who hears any blessing from beginning to end, with the intent to fulfill his obligation (to recite that blessing) has fulfilled his obligation, even if he has not responded \"Amen\". Whoever responds Amen after a blessing has been said is in the same category with the reciter, provided that the latter was under the obligation of saying such a blessing. If the reciter's obligation was only Rabbinical, while the respondent's was Scriptural, the latter does not fulfill his duty unless he responds Amen or listens to the recital of the blessing by one who is under a scriptural obligation.",
            "When several persons had agreed to eat bread or drink wine in company, and one of them recited the blessing, while all the rest responded \"Amen\", they are permitted to eat and drink. If, however they had not intended to have a meal together but each came (without preconcerted arrangement) even though they should be eating of the same loaf, each of them recites the blessing for himself. This rule refers to bread and wine only. The consumption of other foods and beverages does not require an agreement to form one party. If any one of those present recites the blessing and the rest respond \"Amen\", they may all eat and drink, even if originally they had had no intention to form one company.",
            "Whoever hears an Israelite recite a blessing has to respond \"Amen\", even if he has not heard the entire blessing from beginning to end, and even if he himself is not under an obligation to recite that blessing. If however the reciter was an idolater, a free thinker (Epikoros), a Samaritan, a child practising blessings, or an adult who deviated from the fixed form of the blessing, no response of Amen is made.",
            "Whoever responds \"Amen\", must not utter it with the first or last letter clipped, or unduly hurried or drawn out, but should utter it in the way it is ordinarily pronounced. He should not raise his voice above that of the reciter of the blessing. A person who is under an obligation to recite a blessing and has not heard it recited by another may not join the hearers in responding Amen.",
            "Whoever recites a blessing unnecessarily takes the name of God in vain and is like one who swears in vain. After such a blessing it is forbidden to respond Amen. But children are taught the blessings in their regular form. Although while they are learning, they recite the blessings without due occasion, this is permitted. There must however be no response (of Amen) to such recitals, nor does any one who responds Amen discharge his obligation if he had occasion to recite such blessings.",
            "Whoever responds Amen to the blessings which he himself says acts objectionably; but to add Amen to the last of concluding blessings is laudable; as, for instance, after the phrase, \"Who rebuildeth Jerusalem\" in the Grace after meals, or after the last of the blessings recited after the <i>Shema</i> in the Evening Service, or at the close of the concluding blessings the reciter responds Amen to his own recital of the blessings.",
            "Why does one respond \"Amen\" to the blessing ending \"Who rebuildeth Jerusalem\", seeing that it is followed by the benediction, \"Who is kind and dealeth kindly\"? Because this last named benediction was instituted in the times of the Sages of the Mishna, and is in the nature of a supplement, while the essential portion of the Grace after meals ends with the formula, \"Who rebuildeth Jerusalem.\" Why does one not respond \"Amen\" to the blessing beginning, \"With everlasting love\"? Because it is the conclusion of the blessings preceding the recital of the <i>Shema.</i> The rule is the same with all blessings said before any act; as, for instance those said before reading the Scroll of Esther or those said before kindling the Hanucah Lights, so that there should be no interruption between the recital of the blessings and the act for which the reciter said the blessings.",
            "Why does one not add \"Amen\" to the blessing one has said on partaking of fruit etc.? Because it is a single blessing, and Amen is only added to a final blessing, when preceded by one or more blessings; for example, the blessings recited by the King or the High Priest,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mentioned in Mishnah Sotah, chapter I, paragraph 1 and set forth in detail in paragraphs 7 and 8. Paragraph 7:—Blessings recited after reading by the High Priest, or someone else, in his presence, during the night of the Day of Atonement, sections from the Book of Leviticus appertaining to the Day (Leviticus ch. 16 and ch. 23:26-32). Paragraph 8:—Blessings after recital in public of passages from the Book of Deuteronomy, on the second evening of the Feast of Tabernacles after the close of the Sabbatical year. This in accordance with the precept (Deuteronomy 31:10-13). The reading was done in the courtyard of the Temple on Mount Zion. The King was the Reader. If there was no King, the chief leader of the people was the reader. The passages read were Deuteronomy 1:1 till 6:9; 11:13 till 11:21; 14:22 till 14:29; 26:12 till 26:15, 17:15 till 17:20; chapter 28; and 17:15 till 17:20 were repeated.</i> the addition of the Amen in these cases indicating that all the blessings had been completed.",
            "Whoever eats forbidden food, wilfully or in error—recites no blessing either before or after. For example, if one eats of that which is Rabbinically regarded as <i>Tevel</i> (produce from which priest's dues and Levite's tithes should have been, but had not been separated), or eats Levite's tithes from which the priest's dues (two per cent by the original owners, and ten per cent by the Levite of his portion) had not been taken, or eats (outside Jerusalem) Second tithes (which should be consumed in Jerusalem), or consumes that which had been set apart for the Sanctuary and had not been properly redeemed, he does not recite the blessings for the food. Needless it is to add that no blessing is recited if flesh is eaten of a beast that was not properly slain or was pronounced unfit for consumption by Jews owing to a lesion, or if wine is drunk that is forbidden to Jews etc.",
            "But if one eats <i>Demai</i> (produce bought from those concerning whom it is doubtful whether they give the tithe), or of the Levite's tithe from which the priest's dues given by the Levite have been separated, but not the proportion of priest's dues, which should have been given by the original owner, provided that the Levite took his tithe while the grain was still in the ear, or of the Second Tithe, or of that which was devoted to the Sanctuary and has been redeemed, but without the addition of an extra fifth of the value—in these, and all similar cases, the blessings, both before and after partaking of the food, are said."

            "The order of the Grace after meals is as follows: The first blessing is that beginning \"Who feedeth\"; the second is the blessing for the Promised Land; the third, that ending \"Who rebuildeth Jerusalem\"; the fourth, that beginning \"Who is good and doeth good\". The first blessing was instituted by Moses, our teacher; the second, by Joshua; the third, by David and Solomon, his son; the fourth, by the Sages of the Mishna.",
            "Laborers when taking a meal during the time that they are working for an employer, do not recite the blessing before the meal, so that they may not neglect his work, and only recite two blessings after it. The first of these two blessings is recited in its regular form. The second begins with the blessing for the Promised Land, includes a reference to the blessing, \"Who will rebuild Jerusalem\" and ends with the concluding formula of the second blessing, \"Blessed art thou, O Lord, for the land and the food.\" If however the workmen's sole wage is their board, or if their employer takes the meal with them, they recite all the four blessings of the Grace after meals in their complete form as others do.",
            "The blessing for the Promised Land must begin and end with thanksgiving and its concluding formula is \"for the land and for the food\". Whoever omits in this blessing the phrase, \"a land, desirable, good and ample\" has not fulfilled his duty. The Abrahamic covenant and the Torah must also be mentioned in it. The reference to the Covenant must come first, since the covenant referred to in the benediction for the land is the rite of circumcision in connection with which there were thirteen covenants, while in connection with the Torah there were only three, as it is said, \"These are the words of the Covenant\" (Deuteronomy 28:69); \"beside the Covenant which He made with them in Horeb\" (ibid. 28:69); \"Ye stand this day … that thou shouldst enter into the Covenant (ibid. 29:9-11).",
            "The third blessing begins, \"Have mercy, O Lord our God, upon us and upon Israel, Thy people, and upon Jerusalem Thy city, and upon Zion, the abiding place of Thy glory\"; or \"Comfort us, O Lord our God, in Jerusalem, Thy city\", and concludes, \"Who will rebuild Jerusalem\" or \"Who will comfort His people Israel in the rebuilding of Jerusalem\". This benediction is accordingly styled \"Comfort\". Whoever has not mentioned in it the Sovereignty of the House of David has not fulfilled his duty. For this constitutes the very essence of the blessing. Israel's consolation will only be a complete consolation when the House of David will be restored to Sovereignty.",
            "On Sabbaths and Festivals, one begins [this blessing] and concludes it with Consolation, and includes a reference to the special holy character of the day. One begins, \"Comfort us, O Lord our God, in Zion Thy city\"; or \"Have mercy, O Lord our God upon Israel, Thy people, and upon Jerusalem, Thy city\", and ends, \"Who comfortest Thy people Israel in the rebuilding of Jerusalem\", or \"Who rebuildest Jerusalem\". In the middle of the blessing one adds, \"O our God and God of our fathers, be pleased to fortify us by Thy commandments, and especially by the commandment of this great and holy seventh day, (since this day is great and holy before Thee<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Omitted in the manuscript but included in the extant editions.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Omitted in the manuscript but included in the extant editions.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Omitted in the manuscript but included in the extant editions.</i>), we will rest and repose thereon (in love) in accordance with the precept of Thy will. (In Thy favor, O Lord our God, grant us repose), and let there be among us no trouble, evil, sorrow nor sighing on the day of our rest\". On the Festivals the formula beginning, \"May our remembrance rise and come\" is added in the third blessing, as also on the first day of the month and on the intermediate days of the festivals.",
            "On the Feast of Lights and on the Feast of Lots, there is added in the blessing for the Promised Land the formula beginning, \"For the miracles\" which is inserted on these days in the <i>Amidah</i> prayer. When a festival or the first day of the month falls on a Sabbath, the paragraph beginning, \"Be pleased to fortify us\" is said first, and then that beginning, \"Let arise and come\". So too, when the first day of the month of Tebeth falls on a Sabbath, the paragraph beginning, \"For the miracles\" is added in the blessing for the Promised Land and those respectively commencing, \"Be pleased to fortify us\" and \"let arise and come\" are added in the blessing for the comforting of Israel.",
            "In the fourth blessing, the sovereignty of God must be mentioned three times. When there is a guest at table who recites Grace after the meal, he adds a blessing for the host, as follows: \"May it be the Supreme Will that the master of the house shall not suffer shame in this world nor be confounded in the world to come.\" The guest may add other blessings to this blessing for the host or expand it.",
            "When Grace is said in the home of a mourner, the following is added in the fourth blessing: \"O living King who art kind and dealest kindly, true God and Judge Who judgest righteously and rulest in Thy world, doing therein according to Thy Will, Whose people and servants we are and Whom in all situations we have to thank and bless\". The reciter of Grace then offers up a prayer at his discretion that the mourner shall be vouchsafed comfort, and continues, \"May the All-merciful etc.\".",
            "In the home of the newly wedded, the marriage blessing is recited at every meal after the four blessings of the Grace. This blessing is not recited by slaves nor by minors (those under thirteen years of age). For how long a period is it recited? When a widower marries a widow, it is recited on the first day only. When a bachelor marries a widow or a widower marries a spinster, it is recited during the seven days of the festivity (after the marriage).",
            "The blessing which is added to the Grace in the bridegroom's home is the last of the seven marriage benedictions. And this rule applies if those at the meal attended the wedding and heard the blessings. But if there are other guests at the table who had not heard the blessings at the wedding ceremony, the seven blessings are recited for their sake, after Grace, provided however that a quorum of ten adult males is present, including the groom.",
            "The following in brackets is omitted in the manuscript but included in the extant editions: [The seven benedictions are as follows: Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast formed man. Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast created all things to Thy glory. Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast formed man in Thine image, after Thy likeness, and hast prepared unto him out of his very self a perpetual fabric; blessed art Thou, O Lord, Creator of man. May she who was barren (Zion) be exceedingly glad and exult when her children are gathered within her in joy; blessed art Thou, O Lord, who makest Zion joyful through her children. O make these loved companions greatly to rejoice, even as of old Thou didst gladden Thy creature in the garden of Eden; blessed art Thou, O Lord, who makest bridegroom and bride to rejoice. Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast created joy and gladness, bridegroom and bride, mirth and exultation, pleasure and delight, love, brotherhood, peace and fellowship. Soon may there be heard in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of joy and gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the jubilant voice of bridegrooms from their canopies and of youths from their feasts of song; blessed art Thou, O Lord, who makest the bridegroom to rejoice with the bride.]",
            "If, on Sabbath or Festival, a person forgot to recite in the Grace after meals, the paragraph referring to the special sanctity of the day, and became aware of the omission before he began the fourth blessing, he says, on Sabbath, \"Blessed be the Lord who has given rest to His people Israel, as a sign and holy covenant, blessed art Thou, O Lord, who hallowest the Sabbath\". And on festivals he says, \"Blessed be He who appointed feasts unto His people Israel for joy and gladness, blessed art Thou. O Lord who hallowest Israel and the festivals\". He then begins the fourth blessing and continues to the end. If he only became aware of the omission after he had begun the fourth blessing, he stops and goes back to the beginning of the Grace, namely to the blessing for food.",
            "If, on New Moons, one forgot to recite the paragraph beginning, \"Let arise and come\", and became aware of the omission before beginning the fourth blessing, he says, \"Blessed is He who appointed New Moons unto His people Israel as a remembrance\" and does not conclude with any other formula, (Blessed art Thou, O Lord, etc.\" as on Sabbaths and Festivals) but begins the fourth blessing and continues to the end. If he became aware of the omission after he had begun the fourth blessing, he continues to the end and does not go back. So too, on the intermediate days of the festivals and on the Feast of Lights and the Feast of Lots, if he forgot and made no reference to the special character of the day he does not go back.",
            "If one forgot to say Grace after a meal, and became aware of the omission before the meal was digested<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">as long as he is not hungry.</i> he goes back and recites Grace. Once the food has been digested, he does not go back to say Grace. So too, if he has forgotten whether he had said Grace or not, he recites it as long as the meal is not yet digested."

            "There are five species of grain;—wheat, barley, spelt, oats and rye. Spelt belongs to the wheat species; oats and rye belong to the barley species. As long as they are in the ear, these five species are everywhere called produce. After having been threshed and winnowed, they are termed grain. When they have been ground and the meal has been kneaded and baked, the product is called bread. The bread made of any of these species is everywhere styled bread without qualification.",
            "Whoever eats bread has to recite before the meal the blessing, \"Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who bringest forth bread from the earth\"; [and after the meal, the four blessings of the Grace after meals.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Words in brackets are not in the manuscript but are in the printed text.</i>] If one eats grain, plainly boiled, he recites before the meal the blessing; <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">All these blessings have the introductory formula “Blessed art Thou Lord, our God, King of the Universe”.</i> \"… Who createst the fruit of the earth\", and after it, \"Who createst many living beings with their wants etc.\". If one eats meal, he first recites the blessing \"by Whose word all things exist\", and after he has eaten, \"Who createst many living beings\".",
            "Meal of any one of these five species of grain that had been boiled and then mixed with water or other fluids, if it is so thick that it can be eaten and masticated, requires, before it is eaten, the recital of the blessing, \"Who createst various kinds of foods,\" and after it is eaten, the recital of the blessing, \"For the sustenance and nourishment etc.\" If the gruel was so thin that it could only be drunk, the blessing before partaking of it is, \"by Whose word all things exist\", and afterwards that beginning, \"Who createst many living beings\".",

            "This only applies when this species of grain was regarded by the consumer as the chief constituent in the dish and not as an adjunct. But if one of the five species of grain that had been mixed with other ingredients was secondary, the consumer recites the blessing for the chief constituent of the dish and is freed from the obligation of uttering a blessing for the adjunct. For the general rule in the recital of blessings is that where a dish contained both a principal and a secondary constituent, the blessing is recited for the principal constituent, and this recital dispenses one from reciting a blessing for the adjunct, whether the latter was mixed with the former or not.",
            "What is a mixed adjunct? For example, if turnip or cabbage is cooked, and meal of one of the five species of grain is added in the cooking to thicken the dish, the blessing \"Who created different species of foods\" is not recited, because the turnip or cabbage is the principal constituent while the meal is secondary. For everything added to a dish to give it thickness, fragrance or color, is adjunctory. What however is added to give savour [taste] to the mixture, is regarded as a chief constituent. Accordingly, when various kinds of honey are cooked together with the addition of starch to thicken the mixture in order to make sweetmeats, the blessing \"Who createst different species of food\" is not recited over the products, since the principal constituent is the honey.",

If one needs to eat salt fish and eats bread with it, so that the salt should not injure his throat and tongue, he recites the blessing for the salty dish, and this dispenses him from the obligation of reciting the blessing for the bread, since the bread is an adjunct. The same rule applies to similar cases.",

He must therefore first say Grace for what he has already consumed and (when he comes back) again say the blessing for what he is about to eat or drink. But a person who changes his seat from one corner of the room to another need not repeat the blessing. If one began a meal on the east side of a fig-tree and then goes to the west side to continue the meal, he must say the preliminary blessing again.",

But if he said the blessing for the relish, this does not dispense him from saying the blessing for the bread. If one said the blessing for cooked cereals, this dispenses him from the blessing for the soup, and if he said the blessing for the other cooked dish, this exempts him from saying the blessing for the cooked cereal.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So in the manuscript.

But if, regardless of the prohibition, they wish to drink before saying Grace or the blessing for the Sanctification of the Day, (though they are forbidden to do so) they must first say the blessing \"Who createst the fruit of the vine\" and then drink. But if they said \"Come let us say the Blessing for the conclusion of Sabbath or Festival,\" they need not, if they continue drinking, first say the blessing \"Who created the fruit of the vine.\"",
            "If a company was drinking wine, and another kind of wine was brought them; for instance if they were drinking red wine and black wine was brought, or old wine and new wine was brought, they need not say the blessing for the wine a second time; but they say the blessing \"Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who is good and doeth good\".",
            "No blessing for any food or drink is said till it has been placed before the one who says the blessing. If he has already said the blessing and then the food or drink is brought to him, he must say the blessing a second time. If a person took food in his hand and said the blessing, and it dropped out of his hand and was burnt or swept away in the river, he takes another portion of food and says the blessing a second time even though the food be of the same kind. He also needs to recite the sentence \"Blessed be the name of His glorious sovereignty for ever and ever,\" so as to avoid the sin of having uttered God's name in vain. A person, standing by a water-course, says the blessing and drinks, although the draught of water which he drinks is not that which was before him at the moment when he said the blessing, since he had this in mind from the beginning.",

The blessing for bread at the beginning of the meal and the Grace at the end cover all these which are contributory to the meal. Dishes not part of the meal, but which are served in the course of the meal, require a blessing to be said before they are eaten but none afterwards. Dishes served after the meal is over, whether they belong to the meal or not, require a blessing to be said before they are eaten and a blessing afterwards.",
            "On Sabbaths and festivals, as also at the meal eaten after blood-letting or after one has had a vapor-bath and on similar occasions, when wine is a principal part of the meal, a blessing recited for wine drunk before the meal exempts one from saying the blessing for wine drunk after the meal and before the recital of Grace. On other days however, he must recite the blessing for wine drunk after the meal. When wine is served during the meal, every one at the table says the blessing for himself; for the throat, engaged in swallowing the food, is not free to respond Amen. This blessing does not exempt the diners from saying the blessing for wine drunk after the meal."

It is doubtful however whether this obligation is imposed by the Torah, there being no set time for its fulfillment—or whether it is one only imposed by the sages.

Boys (under 13) are under an obligation to say Grace after meals by an ordinance of the sages so that they may be trained in the observance of religious duties.",

However, to prevent licentiousness, women, slaves and minors should not be formed into a joint company for Grace. But women may form a quorum for themselves, and so may slaves. In either case they do not use the name of God in the introductory formula. An androgyne recites the introductory formula if the entire company is of his class, but not if the other members are normal men and women. One whose sex cannot be determined never says the introductory formula. A minor if he is only seven or eight years of age, provided he understands Who it is that is addressed in benediction, may be counted in the quorum, whether it consists of three or ten persons. A non-Israelite is not to be counted.",

But if six ate bread while four partook of vegetables, they do not form a quorum of ten, because for such a quorum there must be an easily recognizable majority of those who ate bread. This rule applies to a quorum of ten.

A company of six however (less than ten) may divide for Grace into two groups. When there are ten or more in the company, they may not separate for Grace till they are twenty; for fellow-diners may only separate themselves into groups, when each group is sufficiently large to qualify for the recital of the same introductory formula as would be recited if they continued to be all together.",

They then count him in the quorum, though he is in the street, and he too discharges his obligation to join in the Grace. When he returns home, he must say Grace for himself. But when ten persons had their meals together and one of them went out into the street, they do not count him in the quorum of ten till he has returned and is seated in his place.",
            "If three persons ate together, and one of them anticipated the others and said Grace for himself, the others may still count him in their quorum of three, and have fulfilled their duty, but he has not done so since the obligation of saying Grace in a group cannot be discharged retroactively.",

If one knew the Grace while the other did not know it, the former recites it aloud and the latter responds \"Amen\" after each blessing and thus fulfills his duty. A son may in this way recite Grace on his father's behalf; a slave for his master; a wife for her husband.

In this case the obligation to say Grace is one imposed by the dicta of the Scribes, and can therefore be fulfilled on their behalf by a minor, slave or woman.

For this is an ordinance of the sages whose instructions the Torah bids us heed, as it is said \"According to the law which they shall teach thee' (Deut. 17-11).

If water has changed in color, whether it is contained in a vessel or kept in the ground and whether the change was caused by a substance dropped into the water, or is due to its situation, it is unfit for washing the hands. So also, if it has been subjected to such an exposure as would prohibit its being used for drinking, it is unfit for washing the hands.",

For example, water in which one washed utensils or dipped his bread, etc., whether the water is in vessels or in the ground is unfit for washing the hands. But if one rinses in it utensils that have been washed or that are new, he does not render it unfit. The water in which the baker dips the loaves is unfit for washing the hands; but that from which he fills his hands while kneading is fit, because only the water in his hands is regarded as having been used, but not the water left in the vessel from which he filled his hands.",

If he has no preference and there is on the table any one of the seven fruits indigenous to the Holy Land, he says the blessing over it first. Among these seven, that first mentioned in the Biblical verse is to be preferred. The seven fruits are those named in the text: \"A land of wheat, barley, vine, fig, pomegranate, a land of olive oil and honey\" (Deut. 8:8). The honey here referred to, is the honey of dates. Dates have the preference over grapes, because dates are mentioned in the text second after the word \"land\" (in the second part of the verse), while grapes come third after that word (in the first half of the verse).",

All other blessings said at the fulfilment of religious duties, begin with the formula \"Blessed art Thou\" but do not so conclude.",
            "There are some affirmative precepts in regard to which there is an obligation sedulously to strive to fulfil them; as, for example, to put on phylacteries, dwell in a booth on the feast of Tabernacles, take in the hand a palm branch together with the other plants on that feast, hear the sound of the ram's horn on the New Year. These are termed obligatory because there is an unconditional obligation to fulfill them. Again there are religious duties which are not obligatory but are in a sense permissive; for example, to affix a <i>Mezuzah</i> to the doors of a house or build a parapet on the roof; since there is no obligation to dwell in a house that requires a <i>Mezuzah</i> to be affixed to it. One may, if one chooses, live all one's lifetime in a tent or on a ship. Similarly there is no obligation to build a house in order to erect a parapet round the roof. Every duty to God, whether permissive or obligatory, requires a blessing to be said before its fulfilment.",
            "So too, all religious duties ordained by the Scribes, whether these are according to their dicta, obligatory; (for example, to read the Scroll of Esther on the Feast of Lots, to kindle lights on the Eve of the Sabbath and during the feast of <i>Chanucah</i>); or whether these duties are optional,—for example, to make an <i>Erub</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Setting aside food on the eve of a festival, to permit the cooking of food on the festival for the Sabbath, or on the eve of a Sabbath to permit carrying on the Sabbath in a court or a town.</i> or to wash the hands<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">for prayers or meals.</i> all require, before they are performed, the recital of a blessing, containing the formula \"Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandment and commanded us (to perform that particular duty). Where in the Torah did God so command us? In the text (Deut. 17:11) \"… and according to the judgment which they tell thee, thou shalt do.\" Hence, the meaning and purport of the Benedictory formula is as follows \"Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments among which Thou hast commanded us to give heed to those spiritual leaders who ordained that we should kindle the <i>Chanucah</i> light or read the Scroll of Esther.\" This applies to all the other duties ordained by the Scribes.",
            "Why is no blessing said, when washing the hands at the close of a meal? Because this was only ordained as a precaution against danger to health,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Touching or rubbing the eyes with fingers to which strong salt may be adhering.</i> and acts that are of a precautionary character do not require the recital of a blessing. This is similar to the rule that, before drinking water at night, one strains it to avoid the risk of swallowing a leech. One does not, on such an occasion, recite a blessing \"And commanded us to strain water.\" The same principle applies to all similar cases.",
            "If a person fulfilled a religious duty and omitted to say the appropriate blessing, he still says the blessing as long as the duty is in course of fulfilment. Once the fulfilment is past, he does not say the blessing. For example, when a man puts on a garment with <i>Zizith</i> (ritual fringes) or puts on phylacteries, or sits down in a booth on the Feast of Tabernacles, without reciting the appropriate blessing, he says, after having put on the garments with fringes, \"Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments, and commanded us to enwrap ourselves in a garment with fringes.\" Similarly, after having put on phylacteries, he says the blessing \"Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us to put on phylacteries;\" or after sitting down in the booth, he says \"Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us to dwell in a booth.\" And so in all similar cases [where the fulfillment of the duty is continuing, the blessing may be recited during its continuance, if he has not done so at the beginning].",
            "But if he ritually slew a beast or fowl without reciting the blessing, he should not, after the slaying, recite the blessing \"Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us concerning ritual slaughter.\" So too, if he had already covered the blood (of a fowl or clean wild beast), or set apart the priest's dues or levite's tithes, or taken a ritual bath, without saying the appropriate blessing, he should not say it after the religious duty had been discharged. The principle applies to all similar cases.",
            "There is one religious duty only where the blessing is said after the act to which it refers, namely the immersion of a proselyte (at his reception into Judaism). The reason is that, previously to the rite, he could not have said \"Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us,\" as he was neither sanctified nor commanded till he had taken the ritual bath. Hence he recites the blessing after the immersion, because, till that act had been performed, he was primarily ineligible and not qualified to say the blessing.",
            "Whenever the performance of a religious duty definitely completes the obligation, the blessing is recited at the time it is performed. Whenever the fulfillment of a precept is an antecedent to another precept, the blessing is said at the fulfillment of the latter. For example. A person builds a booth for the Feast of Tabernacles, prepares the palm branch for that festival, fashions a ram's horn for the New Year, puts fringes on a garment, or prepares phylacteries or a <i>Mezuzah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">slip of parchment containing passages of Scripture and affixed to the doors of rooms for habitation.</i> He does not, when preparing any of these articles of religious use, say the blessing \"Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us to build a booth, prepare the palm branch, write phylacteries\"; because the act in each of these cases is followed by another precept. When is the blessing said? When one sits in the booth (on the feast of Tabernacles), handles the palm branch, listens to the sound of the ram's horn (on the New Year) enwraps himself in the fringed garment, puts on phylacteries, affixes the <i>Mezuzah.</i> If however one erects a parapet on the roof, he recites, at the time of erection, the blessing \"Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us concerning a parapet\"; and so with similar precepts.",
            "A precept which is fulfilled at definite periods, for example, listening to the sound of the ram's horn, sitting in the tabernacle, handling the palm branch, reading the Scroll of Esther, lighting the Chanucah light; likewise every precept, connected with private property, e.g. putting on a fringed garment or putting on phylacteries for the first time, fixing the <i>Mezuzah,</i> erection of a parapet on the roof; as also a precept, not of a continuous character, and for which the opportunity of fulfillment does not always occur, e.g. circumcision of a male infant, redemption of the first born,—each of these requires the blessing \"Who hast preserved us in life, etc.\" to be said at the time of performance. If one omitted to say this blessing when building the tabernacle, or preparing the palm branch, he says it, when he fulfills his obligation connected therewith. This principle obtains in all similar cases.",
            "Whether one fulfills a religious duty for oneself or on behalf of others, he always, before doing it, says the blessing \"Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us to do, etc.\" The blessing \"Who hast preserved us in life, etc.\" is only said when a precept is fulfilled on one's own behalf. If a person has several duties to perform, he does not say \"Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us concerning the precepts\", but, at the performance of each precept, he says the blessing appropriate to it.",
            "When fulfilling a religious duty—whether it be a personal obligation or not, if one does it for himself, he says, \"… and commanded us to do (the particular duty)\". If he does it on behalf of others, he says \"… and commanded us concerning the duty.\"",
            "For example, on putting on phylacteries, one says the blessing concluding \"… and commanded us to lay <i>Tephillin</i> (phylacteries)\". When putting on the <i>Tallith</i> (fringed garment), he says the blessing ending \"… to enwrap oneself in the fringed garment.\" On taking a seat in the tabernacle (on the feast of Tabernacles), the blessing to be said ends \"to dwell in the tabernacle\". And so other blessings end \"to kindle the light for the Sabbath\"; to read the <i>Hallel</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The manuscript has <i>ligmor.</i> This means to <i>complete the Hallel</i> (Psalms 113-118).</i> (Psalms 113-118) recited on Festivals and on the Feast of Dedication. So too, if a person affixes the <i>Mezuzah,</i> to rooms in his own home, he ends the blessing—\"to affix the <i>Mezuzah</i>.\" If he builds a parapet for his own roof, he says the blessing \"Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us to make a parapet.\" If a person sets aside the priest's dues from his own produce, he says a blessing ending \"to set aside the dues\". If he circumcises his son, the blessing he says ends \"to circumcise the son\". If he slays his own paschal lamb or brings his festival offering, he says the blessing ending \"to slay, etc.\"",
            "But if he affixes a <i>Mezuzah</i> to the door of another's home, the blessing he says ends \"Concerning the affixing of a Mezuzah\". If he makes a parapet to the roof of a house belonging to others, he says a blessing concluding \"concerning the making of a parapet.\" If he separates priests' dues for other owners' produce, he says a blessing ending \"concerning the setting apart of dues.\" If he circumcises another person's male infant, he says the blessing ending \"concerning the circumcision.\" The same principle applies to all similar cases.",
            "When a person fulfills a precept for himself and others jointly, and the precept is not of an obligatory character, he says a blessing which ends \"concerning the fulfillment of the precept.\" Thus the blessing said, when making an <i>Erub,</i> ends \"concerning the precept of the <i>Erub</i>.\" If the precept is obligatory and the intent was to discharge the obligation for himself and others, the blessing concludes \"to fulfill the precept.\" Thus the blessing said at the sounding of the ram's horn (on the New Year) ends \"to hear the sound of the ram's horn.\"",
            "When a person takes the palm branch (on the feast of Tabernacles), he says the blessing ending \"concerning the taking of the palm-branch;\" because, as soon as he has taken it, he has discharged his obligation. If however one says the blessing before taking the palm branch, the blessing ends \"to take the palm-branch,\" on the analogy of the formula \"to dwell in the tabernacle.\" Hence the general rule that when the blessing is said after the precept has been performed, the blessing ends with the formula \"concerning the precept.\" But when one washes the hands or slaughters cattle for food, even for one's own consumption,—since these are optional, the blessings end with the respective formulas \"concerning the slaughtering of cattle;\" \"concerning covering the blood (of birds or deer);\" \"concerning washing of the hands.\" So also the blessing said \"when searching for leaven on the evening after the 13th of Nisan\" ends \"concerning the destruction of leaven\"—whether the search is on one's own behalf or for others; because, as soon as he has resolved in his mind to annul the leaven, the duty of destroying it has been discharged, before he begins the search,—as will be expounded in the proper place.",
            "For a practice that is only customary, even if traced to the prophets, for example, taking the willow branch on the seventh day of the feast of Tabernacles, and—needless to add—if it is ascribed to the Sages, for example, reciting the <i>Hallel</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 113-118 omitting 115:1-11 and 116:1-11.</i> on new moons and the intermediate days of Passover, no blessing is to be recited at its performance.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Ashkenazi ritual, a blessing is recited.</i> Thus also any act, in regard to which you are in doubt whether it requires a blessing or not, should be performed without a blessing. One should always carefully avoid saying blessings unnecessarily; and should be heedful to recite, as often as there may be occasion, the blessings that are requisite. And so David said \"Every day I will bless Thee and praise Thy name forever\" (Ps. 145:2)."
