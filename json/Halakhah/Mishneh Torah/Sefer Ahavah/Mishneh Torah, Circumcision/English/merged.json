            "Circumcision is a positive mitzvah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 215) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 2) consider this one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.</i> [whose lack of fulfillment] is punishable by<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Circumcision and the Paschal sacrifices are the only positive commandments for which the Torah prescribes punishment if they are not fulfilled. In both instances, the punishment is the same (<i>karet</i>).</i> <i>karet</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Premature death at the hand of God (<i>Mo'ed Katan</i> 28a) and a severe spiritual punishment, the \"soul's being cut off,\" and not being granted a share in the world to come (<i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 8:1,5).</i> as [Genesis 17:14] states: \"And an uncircumcised male who does not circumcise his foreskin - this soul will be cut off from his people.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The citation of the verse from Genesis is significant. In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Chulin</i> 7:6), the Rambam writes that our fulfillment of this mitzvah is not based on God's commandment to Abraham, but rather on the commandment issued to Moses (Leviticus 12:3), \"On the eighth day, the child's foreskin will be circumcised.\" Nevertheless, the commandment to Abraham is still significant, and many particulars concerning circumcision are derived from it.</i><br>A father<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">and not a mother (<i>Kiddushin</i> 29a)</i> is commanded to circumcise his son,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although when the son reaches the age of <i>bar mitzvah</i>, he is obligated by the mitzvah. Until that time, the father is responsible for the fulfillment of the mitzvah.<br>The <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> (Mitzvah 2) questions the extent of the father's responsibility. If the father does not circumcise his son before the latter reaches majority, is the father still charged with the mitzvah (together with the son) or is the son solely responsible for the mitzvah?<br><i>Likkutei Sichot</i> (Vol. 11) explains that the question is dependent on a difference of opinion between the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds. The Babylonian Talmud (<i>Kiddushin</i> 29a) derives the mitzvah from the verse (Genesis 21:4), \"And Avraham circumcised his son, Isaac.\" This indicates that the mitzvah is primarily the father's (although after the son reaches adulthood, he also becomes responsible). In contrast, the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Kiddushin</i> 1:7) quotes as a proof-text for the mitzvah (Leviticus 12:3), \"On the eighth day, the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.\" The <i>Korban Eidah</i> explains that this implies the mitzvah is the son's. Since he is not able to perform it himself as a youth, however, his father is given the responsibility while the child is a minor.<br><i>Likkutei Sichot</i> continues, explaining that the Rambam's position is obvious from his discussion of the blessings recited for the mitzvot in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i>, Chapter 11. In Halachah 11 of that chapter, the Rambam explains that if one performs a mitzvah on one's own behalf, one should use the form, \"who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us <b>to</b>....\" In contrast, if one performs a mitzvah on behalf of another person, one uses the form, \"... and commanded us <b>concerning</b>....\"<br>Rav Yitzchak ben Sheshet (Responsum 131) notes that the Rambam (<i>Hilchot Bikkurim</i> 11:5) rules that one should recite the blessing \"...concerning the redemption of a son,\" implying that the mitzvah is not the father's, but the son's (merely that as an infant, the son cannot fulfill it). In contrast, in Chapter 3, Halachah 1, the Rambam states that a father should recite the blessing \"... to circumcise...,\" implying that the mitzvah is his.</i> and a master, his slaves.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here, the responsibility for the mitzvah is surely the master's. This circumcision is one of the stages in the process by which the slave attains the status of <i>eved C'na'ani</i>, an intermediate rung between a gentile and a Jew. He is obligated to fulfill all the negative commandments and all those positive commandments that are not associated with a specific time. (See <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 12:11.)</i> This applies both to those who are born in his home<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., a non-Jewish maidservant gave birth to a male child</i> and to those purchased by him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Genesis 17:27, which relates that Abraham circumcised both these categories of servants.</i> If the father or the master transgressed and did not circumcise them, he negated the fulfillment of a positive commandment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 19:6):<br>If a person transgressed and did not circumcise his son or his servants born in his home... on the eighth day, he transgresses a very great and severe mitzvah, to which there is no comparison among the other mitzvot. He can never compensate for [the lack of fulfillment of] this mitzvah. His sin is much more severe than a person who did not build a sukkah on Sukkot, or one who did not eat matzah on Pesach.</i> He is not, however, punished by <i>karet</i>, for <i>karet</i> is incurred only by the uncircumcised person himself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is obvious from the proof-text quoted above.</i> The court is obligated to circumcise that son<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although when the son reaches the age of <i>bar mitzvah</i>, he is obligated by the mitzvah. Until that time, the father is responsible for the fulfillment of the mitzvah.<br>The <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> (Mitzvah 2) questions the extent of the father's responsibility. If the father does not circumcise his son before the latter reaches majority, is the father still charged with the mitzvah (together with the son) or is the son solely responsible for the mitzvah?<br><i>Likkutei Sichot</i> (Vol. 11) explains that the question is dependent on a difference of opinion between the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds.

In Halachah 11 of that chapter, the Rambam explains that if one performs a mitzvah on one's own behalf, one should use the form, \"who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us</i> or slave at the proper time and should not leave an uncircumcised male among the Jewish people or their slaves.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Kiddushin</i>, loc. cit., interprets Genesis 17:10, \"You must circumcise every male,\" as a charge to the Jewish court, making them responsible for circumcising every member of the people.</i>",
            "We may not circumcise a person's son without his knowledge,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Chovel UMazik</i> 7:13-14, where the Rambam describes the prohibition against \"stealing\" the performance of a mitzvah from a colleague, and the fine of ten gold pieces for doing so. The Ramah (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 382:1) explicitly associates this concept with circumcising a person's son without his knowledge.</i> unless he has transgressed and did not circumcise him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's phraseology has raised questions among the halachic authorities. Is his intent that once the father has allowed the eighth day to pass, the obligation falls on the court, or is his intent that only after the father makes it obvious that he does not want to circumcise his son that they become responsible? Similarly, the question has been raised what should be done if the father is unaware that a son has been born to him, or is prevented from carrying out the circumcision by factors beyond his control. Should the circumcision be carried out on the eighth day, or should the family wait until the father returns? See <i>Avnei Nezer</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i>, Responsum 318) and Rav Kapach's commentary.</i> [In such an instance,] the court must circumcise<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">the obligation mentioned in the previous halachah falls upon them</i> [the child] against [the father's] will.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even if he protests, the mitzvah should be performed.</i><br>If the matter does not become known to the court and they do not circumcise him, when [the child] reaches <i>bar mitzvah</i>, he is obligated to circumcise himself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tzafenat Paneach</i> explains that there are three aspects to the mitzvah of circumcision:<br>a) to remove the foreskin;b) to be circumcised;c) not to be uncircumcised. (See Chapter 2, Halachah 1.)&lt; /p&gt;<br>The first aspect involves a single deed. The second and third dimensions, however, are ongoing qualities that a person continues to possess even after the deed of circumcision is completed. Thus, the <i>Or Zarua</i> quotes <i>Menachot</i> 43b, which relates that when King David entered the bathhouse, he was upset for he was \"naked,\" without mitzvot. When he remembered that he was circumcised, he relaxed, realizing that he was still involved with the performance of a mitzvah.<br>This indicates that, even years after his circumcision, he was considered to be fulfilling the mitzvah. In contrast, with regard to the mitzvot of tefillin and tzitzit, although he had just removed them, he was no longer considered to be involved in the performance of these mitzvot.</i> With each and every day that passes after he has reached <i>bar mitzvah</i>, he negates a positive commandment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some of the manuscript editions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> state, \"It is as if he negates a commandment.\" The mitzvah of circumcision is not negated until the person dies without fulfilling it. Unlike tefillin or tzitzit, where each day a person performs a different mitzvah, there is only one mitzvah of circumcision (Rav Kapach).</i> He is not, however, liable for <i>karet</i> until he dies uncircumcised,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned above, there are two dimensions to the punishment of <i>karet</i>: premature death and the cutting off of the soul. According to the Rambam, a person who does not circumcise himself is liable only for the second aspect of this punishment, since until he dies, it is not known whether he will perform the mitzvah or not (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's statements, stating that each day he does not perform the mitzvah, he is liable for <i>karet</i> and is worthy of premature death. (Even according to the Ra'avad, were the person to circumcise himself, he would no longer be liable for <i>karet</i>).</i> having intentionally<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">but not if he was unaware of the mitzvah or was prevented from fulfilling it by forces beyond his control</i> [failed to perform the mitzvah].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's phraseology raises the question whether a person is liable for <i>karet</i> if he initially failed to perform the mitzvah intentionally, and then was prevented from fulfilling it by forces beyond his control.</i>",
            "A master is obligated to circumcise both a slave who was born as the property of a Jewish owner<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., the \"home-born slave\" mentioned in Genesis 17:12</i> and a slave purchased from the gentiles.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Such servants are also mentioned in the above verse.</i> [There is, however, a difference between the two.] A home-born slave should be circumcised on the eighth day [of his life].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">as is a Jewish child. The above verse states that \"all those born in your house\" - i.e., also slaves - should be circumcised on the eighth day (Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 135b).</i> In contrast, a slave who is purchased should be circumcised on the day he was purchased.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since Genesis 17:13 repeats the commandment, \"Circumcise all home-born [slaves] and those purchased with your money,\" we can assume that there are slaves who are to be circumcised immediately (Rashi, loc. cit.).</i> If he was purchased on the day he was born, he should be circumcised on that day.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">provided, of course, that the surgery will not affect the infant's health. (Note the Guide to the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapter 49, which explains that both physically and spiritually, a child is not prepared for circumcision until the eighth day.)</i>",
            "There are, however,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">certain exceptions to the rules mentioned in the previous halachah that are also mentioned in <i>Shabbat</i> 135b. There are some</i> slaves that are purchased who should be circumcised on the eighth day [of their lives],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">as explained in this halachah</i> and<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">some</i> home-born slaves who should be circumcised on the day they are born.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">as explained in the following halachah.</i><br>What is implied? Should one purchase a maidservant and purchase [the rights to] her fetus [separately],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is possible when the maidservant herself belonged to one master and the fetus to another (Rambam in his responsa).</i> when she gives birth, the baby should be circumcised on the eighth day. Although the fetus itself was purchased separately, since [the master] purchased his mother before the child was born,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">the child is considered \"home-born\" and</i> he should be circumcised on his eighth day.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> relates that, according to the Rambam, even if the master at first purchased only the rights to the fetus, and then purchased the mother, since she gave birth while in his domain, the slave is considered \"home-born,\" and is circumcised on the eighth day.</i>",
            "If a person purchased a maidservant for her offspring,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his responsum cited above, the Rambam compares this to a person who buys a tree for its fruit - i.e., he is not the actual owner of the tree, but is entitled to all the fruit it produces. Similarly, in this instance, the master is not the owner of the maidservant; what he has purchased is the right to her offspring. Therefore, none of the offspring are considered \"home-born,\" and must be circumcised immediately.</i> or purchased a maidservant with the intent of not immersing her as a slave,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Through immersion in a <i>mikveh</i>, a female maidservant becomes a <i>shifchah C'na'anit</i> and attains the intermediate status mentioned in the Commentary on Halachah 1.<br>As the Rambam mentions in the following halachah, it is possible to purchase a gentile slave and maintain possession of him or her without changing his or her status in the above manner.</i> even though her offspring is born in his domain, the child should be circumcised on the day he was born.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The first instance mentioned does not require explanation. With regard to the second category, the Rambam elaborates:</i><br>[This ruling was granted, because] this child is considered as if he alone has been purchased [by his master], and it is as if he purchased him this day. His mother is not included among the maidservants of the Jewish people, so that the child could be considered \"home-born.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the responsum cited above, the Rambam explains that the concept of a \"home-born\" slave is derived from God's commandment to Abraham. All the members of Abraham's household had accepted his beliefs and way of life. In contrast, a slave who is unwilling to accept the mitzvot cannot be considered part of a Jewish household, and her children are not \"home-born.\"</i> If his mother immersed herself after she gave birth,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This shows that the stipulation that she need not be immersed (see the following halachah) is nullified and considered of no consequence. Therefore, she is considered to be part of the household, and</i> the child should be circumcised on the eighth day.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's decision and maintains that unless the mother immerses herself before giving birth, the child should be circumcised immediately. Rabbenu Nissim, in his notes to <i>Shabbat</i> 135b, supports the Rambam's decision, explaining that the Sages did not reach a final ruling on the matter, and hence the more stringent approach should be taken.</i>",
            "When a person purchases a slave from the gentiles and the slave does not consent<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note the difference of opinion in <i>Yevamot</i> 48b, whether this leniency is granted if the slave refuses outright to be circumcised.</i> to be circumcised, we may be patient with him for twelve months.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">lest he change his mind and accept his status within the Jewish people.</i> It is forbidden to maintain him for any longer period while he remains uncircumcised, and one must sell him to gentiles.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He must, however, agree to accept the seven universal laws mentioned below. Otherwise, he should be slain (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i><br>If, at the outset, while the slave was still in the possession of his gentile master, he made a stipulation that he would not be circumcised,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Kapach maintains that the stipulation was made by the slave's master.

The commentaries differ whether the Rambam would accept the Ra'avad's decision (and his statement here is, like many of the other laws he states, reflective of the Messianic era), or whether permission is granted to kill a slave for refusing to follow these laws in the present age as well.</i> A resident alien may be accepted only in the era when the laws of <i>yovel</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Jubilee year</i> are in effect.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Jubilee must be observed only when the entire Jewish people are dwelling in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. Therefore, when the tribes of Reuven and Gad and half the tribe of Menasheh were exiled by the kingdom of Assyria (see II Kings, Chapter 16), the observance of the Jubilee was nullified (<i>Hilchot Shemitah V'Yovel</i> 10:8).</i>",
            "When a convert enters the congregation of Israel, he is obligated to undergo circumcision first.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 13:1-4 states:<br>With three acts, Israel entered into a covenant [with God]: circumcision, immersion [in the mikveh], and [the offering of] sacrifices.... Similarly, with regard to future generations, when a gentile wants to enter into the covenant, take refuge under the wings of the Divine Presence, and accept the yoke of the Torah, he must undergo circumcision, immersion, and the offering of a sacrifice.<br>The phrase \"accept the yoke of the Torah\" indicates that before performing these deeds, the prospective convert must resolve to fulfill the mitzvot.</i> If he had been circumcised while he was a gentile,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">and not by a Jew for the purpose of conversion.

(Perhaps the expression \"thin foreskin\" refers to the membrane removed by <i>pri'ah</i>.)<br>It must be noted that there are <i>Rishonim</i> (see Rashi,<i>Shabbat</i> 134a) who maintain that the extraction of the \"blood of the covenant\" is not a by-product of a search for a thin membrane, but rather serves an independent purpose: The Jews' covenant with God is established through their blood.</i> on the eighth day.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note Chapter 3, Halachah 6, which states that a blessing is not recited for this activity.<br>The Ramah mentions several other instances when blood must be extracted: a child who was circumcised before the eighth day (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 262:1), circumcised at night ( loc. cit.), or circumcised by a gentile ( loc. cit., 264:1) should have blood extracted for the sake of fulfilling the mitzvah.

            "[The following principles apply when] a child is born in the eighth month [of pregnancy]:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The comprehension of this and the following halachah are dependent on the following two Talmudic passages:<br>[The prohibitions against labor on] the Sabbath are superseded for [the circumcision of a child] born in the seventh month, but not for a child born in the eighth month (<i>Shabbat</i> 135a).<br>A child born in the eighth month is like a stone and may not be carried [on the Sabbath]. His mother may, however, lean over him and nurse him....<br> Rabbi states: [This is when] his physical features reflect his [lack of development]; i.e., when his hair and nails are not completely formed.<br>[Rabbi's statements imply that] if [his hair and nails] are completely formed, he is a baby that should have been born in the seventh month, but whose birth was delayed (<i>Yevamot</i> 80b).<br>From these passages, it appears that the Sages considered that there were two periods of gestation that could produce healthy babies, a seven-month period and a nine-month period. Therefore, a baby who was born in the seventh month was considered to be healthy, and circumcision could be performed on the Sabbath.<br>In contrast, a baby born in the eighth month was generally considered to be unhealthy. Not only was the baby not to be circumcised on the Sabbath, but moving it at all was forbidden. Since it was likely to die, it was considered to be <i>muktzeh</i>. If, however, a baby born in the eighth month looks healthy, we assume that it should have been born in the seventh month, but its birth was delayed. Therefore, it is considered a healthy baby and it may be circumcised on the Sabbath.<br>We have used the past tense in the above explanation, because these laws are no longer practiced, and all babies are allowed to be moved on the Sabbath. <i>Tosafot, Shabbat,</i> loc. cit., state that at present, it is no longer possible to determine exactly when a child was conceived, and we therefore do not know the month of pregnancy the mother was in. Furthermore, the advances in medical technology have enabled the lives of many premature babies to be saved despite the fact that, without these new developments, these babies would surely not have survived. At present, it is considered a mitzvah to try to save the lives of any premature babies, even if doing so involves carrying out forbidden labors on the Sabbath.<br>Also, it must be emphasized that, as stated in Halachot 16-18, a child is circumcised only when it is healthy and there is no danger involved. This is surely relevant with regard to premature infants. Rarely, if ever, would a doctor grant permission for such a baby to be circumcised on the eighth day of his life.</i> If the child's nails and hair are completely formed, we assume that this is a completely formed infant that should have been born in the seventh month, but whose birth was delayed. Hence, the baby may be carried on the Sabbath, is not considered to be a stone, and may be circumcised on the Sabbath.<br>If, however, when the baby was born, its hair and nails were incompletely formed, we can be certain that this child is in its eighth month of development and should not have been born until the ninth month, but was born prematurely. Therefore, he is considered as a stone and may not be moved on the Sabbath.<br>Nevertheless, if such an infant remains alive for thirty days, he is considered to be a child who will live and is governed by all the same rules as other infants.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Among the ramifications of this decision are that the child's mother is free of the obligations of <i>yibbum</i> and <i>chalitzah</i>.

According to their view, even Rabbenu Asher agrees that when a child is born during <i>beyn hash'mashot</i> eight days before the second day of a festival, he may be circumcised on that second day of the festival.</i> On Rosh HaShanah, however, it does not supersede [the prohibitions] of either the first or the second day.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As explained in <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Yom Tov</i> 1:21-24, the rules governing the celebration of the second day of Rosh HaShanah differ from those governing the celebration of the second days of other festivals.

            "Before the circumcision, the person who performs the circumcision recites the blessing, \"[Blessed are You...] who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning the circumcision.\" [This applies] when circumcising the son of another person.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's ruling depends on his statement (<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:13) that if someone performs a blessing on behalf of another person, he should use the form \"who has sanctified us with Your commandments and commanded us concerning....\"</i> When circumcising one's own son, one should recite the blessing \"... to circumcise a son.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:12, the Rambam states that when one fulfills a mitzvah on one's own behalf, one should use the form \"who has sanctified us with Your commandments and commanded us to...\"<br>Although the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 365:2) mentions the Rambam's opinion, the Ramah states that it is customary to recite the blessing \"... concerning the circumcision,\" at all times.<br>It is possible to explain that the Ramah does not accept the Rambam's general principle and prefers a universal form for a blessing to be recited every time a particular mitzvah is fulfilled. It is, however, also possible to interpret their difference of opinion as relating to the definition of the mitzvah of circumcision itself. The Rambam's text of the blessing, which uses the form \"... to...,\" indicates that the nature of the mitzvah of circumcision focuses on the act of circumcision. In contrast, the Ramah's text for the blessing can be interpreted to imply that the nature of the mitzvah is to bring a person to the state that he is no longer uncircumcised. Therefore, the form \"... concerning...\" is more appropriate (<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>).</i><br>[At the circumcision,]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The time when this blessing is recited is a matter of question. In two of his responsa, the Rambam writes that it makes no difference whether this blessing is recited before the circumcision or afterwards.

Therefore, if a child's father is not present, this blessing should not be recited. There are those who have ruled that the court or one of the people [in attendance should recite this blessing in the father's absence]. [Nevertheless, this ruling] should not be followed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's decision and rules that, in the absence of the father, the <i>sandak</i> (the person who holds the baby during the circumcision) should recite this blessing.

In this context, the<i>Sefer HaMaor</i> explains that this blessing was instituted to reassure converts and strengthen their resolve before they fulfill a mitzvah that is associated with pain and suffering.</i><br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to circumcise converts and to extract from them the blood of the covenant,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that this is a reference to the extraction of blood from converts who were circumcised previously.

Here, it appears that one need not cover the penis of a baby before reciting the blessing, yet in <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam writes that the <i>Shema</i> may not be recited in the presence of a minor whose sexual organ is exposed.<br>In one of his responsa, the Rambam resolves this difficulty, explaining that the prohibition begins when the child - either male or female - possesses some sexual potency.

The Ra'avad maintains that an <i>androgynous</i> is considered a male whose status is in doubt. Therefore, since a mitzvah from the Torah is involved, a blessing should be recited. The Rambam maintains that an <i>androgynous</i> is in a category of his own, and the question is whether the obligation to circumcise falls on people in this category. Hence, no blessing is recited.
