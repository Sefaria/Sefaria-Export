            "To pray daily is an affirmative duty, as it is said, \"And ye shall serve the Lord, your God\" (Exodus 23:25). The service, here referred to, according to the teaching of tradition, is Prayer, as it is said, \"And to serve Him with all your heart\" (Deuteronomy 11:13), on which the sages commented, \"What may be described as Service of the Heart? Prayer\". The number of prayers is not prescribed in the Torah. No form of prayer is prescribed in the Torah. Nor does the Torah prescribe a fixed time for Prayer. ",
            "Hence, women and slaves are under an obligation to pray, this being a duty, the fulfillment of which is independent of set periods. The obligation in this precept is that every person should daily, according to his ability, offer up supplication and prayer; first uttering praises of God, then, with humble supplication and petition ask for all that he needs, and finally offer praise and thanksgiving to the Eternal for the benefits already bestowed upon him in rich measure.",
            "One who was fluent, would offer up many prayers and supplications. If one was slow of speech, he would pray as he could and whenever he pleased. Thus also, the number of separate services depended on an individual's ability. One would pray once daily; others, several times in the day. All, however, turned during prayer to the Sanctuary, in whichever direction that might be. This was the uniform practice from the times of Moses to those of Ezra.",
            "When the people of Israel went into exile in the days of the wicked Nebucednezzar, they mingled with the Persians, Greeks and other nations. In those foreign countries, children were born to them, whose language was confused. Everyone's speech was a mixture of many tongues. No one was able, when he spoke, to express his thoughts adequately in any one language, otherwise than incoherently, as it is said, \"And their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod and they could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people\" (Nehemiah 13:24). Consequently, when anyone of them prayed in Hebrew, he was unable adequately to express his needs or recount the praises of God, without mixing Hebrew with other languages. When Ezra and his Council realized this condition, they ordained the Eighteen Benedictions in their present order. The first three blessings consist of praises of God and the last three, of thanksgiving to Him. The intermediate benedictions are petitions for the things which may stand as categories of all the desires of the individual and the needs of the community. The object aimed at was that these prayers should be in an orderly form in everyone's mouth, that all should learn them, and thus the prayer of those who were not expert in speech would be as perfect as that of those who had command of a chaste style. For the same reason, they arranged [in a fixed form] all the blessings and prayers for all Jews so that the substance of every blessing should be familiar and current in the mouth of one who is not expert in speech.",
            "Thus, too, they ordained that the Services of Prayer should be equal in number to the Sacrifices—two services of prayer daily, corresponding to the two daily offerings. And for the day on which an additional offering was ordained, they instituted a third prayer, corresponding to the additional offering. The Service which corresponds to the daily morning sacrifice is called the Morning Prayer. The Service which corresponds to the Afternoon Sacrifice is called the Afternoon Prayer, and the Service corresponding to the Additional offering is called the Additional Prayer.",
            "So also they ordained that a person should recite one service of Prayer at night, since the portions of the animal offered up as the Afternoon Sacrifice were consumed on the altar throughout the night, as it is said, \"This is the law of the burnt offering; this it is that which goeth up on its firewood upon the altar all night\" (Leviticus 6:2). And in this sense it is said, \"Evening and morning and at noon will I meditate and cry aloud, and He hath heard my voice\" (Psalms 55:18). The Evening Service is not obligatory like the Morning and Afternoon Services. Nevertheless all Israelites, wherever they have settled, have adopted the practice of reciting the Evening Service and have accepted it as obligatory.",
            "So, too, they instituted a service to be recited after the afternoon service, close to sunset, but only on a fast day, the purpose being to add petitions and supplication on account of the fast. This Service is called \"the Closing\" [service]—an allusion to the fact that the sky is closed to the sun which is at that hour of the day invisible—this service being recited near sunset.",
            "Thus the Services recited daily are three; namely, the Evening Service, the Morning Service and the Afternoon Service. On Sabbaths, Festivals and New Moons, they are four—the three daily services and the Additional Service. On the Day of Atonement, they are five services, the four just mentioned and the <i>Neilah,</i> the closing service.",
            "The number of these services may not be diminished but may be increased. If a person wishes to pray the whole day, he may do so. And the prayers he adds are accounted to him as if he brought free-will offerings. He must accordingly add in each of the middle blessings a thought appropriate to the particular blessing. If this is done in one of the blessings only, that is sufficient, the object being to make it manifest that the prayer is voluntary and not obligatory. In the first three and last three blessings there must be no addition, diminution or change.",
            "A congregation does not hold a voluntary service, because the community never brought a free-will offering. Additional services (those recited on Sabbaths, Festivals and New Moons), may not be recited twice [even by a private individual], once by way of discharging an obligatory duty and once voluntarily, because the additional sacrifices were never brought as free-will offerings. One of the Geonim decided that it is forbidden to recite any voluntary service on Sabbaths and Festivals, since on those days no free-will offerings were brought but only those that were obligatory."

            "In Rabban Gamliel's days, the number of heretics in Israel increased. They were wont to vex the Israelites and seduce them to turn away from God. When R. Gamliel realized that the most urgent need was to remove this evil, he composed a Benediction which contains a petition to God to destroy the heretics, and incorporated it in the Eighteen Blessings so that it should be in a fixed form for all. Hence the total number of Blessings in the Daily Service is Nineteen.",
            "In each of the three daily services, a person recites these nineteen blessings in their appointed order. But only if he finds that his mind is in a fit state for prayer and he is fluent in speech.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He knows the blessing correctly.</i> But if one is distracted and harassed, or is not fluent in speech, he should recite the first three blessings, a blessing embodying the gist of all the intermediate blessings, and the last three blessings, and then he has fulfilled his duty.",
            "The Blessing that they ordained as a summary of the intermediate blessings is as follows: Give us understanding, O Lord, our God, to know Thy ways, and circumcise our hearts to fear Thee. Be forgiving unto us, so that we may be redeemed. Keep us far from sorrow. Make us prosperous. Cause us to dwell in the pastures of Thy land. Gather the scattered from the four [corners of the earth]. Let them that go astray in the knowledge of Thee be judged;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to another reading, “Let them that go astray [learn to] judge according to the [true] knowledge of Thee.” (Rashi quoting Halachoth Gedoloth) Rabbenu Jonah renders, “Let them that go astray be judged according to Thy knowledge.”</i> and over the wicked wave Thy hand. Let the righteous rejoice in the rebuilding of Thy city and in the reestablishment of Thy temple, and in the flourishing of the horn of David, Thy servant, and in the rekindling of the light of Jesse's son, Thine anointed. Before we call, do Thou answer; before we speak, do Thou hearken; as it is said, \"And it shall come to pass, before they call, I will answer; while they are still speaking, I will hear\" (Isaiah 65:24); for Thou art He who answereth in all times of trouble, who delivereth and rescueth from all distress, Blessed art Thou O Lord who hearkenest unto prayer.",
            "The foregoing rule only applies to the summer season. But in the winter the summary of the intermediate blessings is not recited; because, in the blessing for a prosperous year, the petition for dew and rain has to be recited. So also, this summary is not recited in the Evening Prayer at the close of Sabbath or Festival, because in the Blessing for Granting Understanding, the paragraph relating to the distinction between sacred and profane has to be added.",
            "On Sabbaths and Festivals, seven blessings are recited in each of the four Services for the day; namely, the usual first three blessings, and last three blessings, and an intermediate blessing appropriate to the particular day. On Sabbaths, the intermediate blessing concludes with the formula, \"Who hallowest the Sabbath.\" On the Festivals it concludes, \"Who hallowest Israel and the Seasons.\" And on a Sabbath which is at the same time a festival, the concluding formula is, \"Who hallowest the Sabbath, Israel and the Seasons.\" On New Year, the conclusion is, \"King over all the earth, who hallowest Israel and the Day of Memorial.\" When the New Year falls on a Sabbath, the concluding formula is, \"King over all the earth, who hallowest the Sabbath, Israel and the Day of Memorial.\"",
            "The foregoing statement applies to the evening, morning and afternoon services of the New Year. But the additional service on the New Year consists of nine blessings; the first three and the last three recited daily, and three Intermediate. Of these intermediate benedictions, the theme of the first is God's Sovereignty; of the second His remembrance; while the third has references to the Shofar. Each of these blessings concludes with a formula appropriate to its theme.",
            "On the Day of Atonement, in each of the five services, seven blessings are recited, the first three, the last three, and an intermediate blessing, appropriate to the day, which concludes, \"King over the whole earth, who sanctifiest Israel and the Day of Atonement.\" If that day happens to fall on a Sabbath, the intermediate blessing in each service concludes, \"King over the whole earth, who sanctifiest the Sabbath, Israel and the Day of Atonement.\"",
            "The foregoing statement applies to the Fast of the Day of Atonement in ordinary years but on that fast-day in the Jubilee year, nine blessings are recited in the additional service as in the additional service of the New Year. The same blessings are recited, neither more nor less, and are only recited when the law of the Jubilee is in force.",
            "Before reciting the first blessing in each of the services, one begins, \"O Lord, open Thou my lips, and my mouth shall declare Thy praise,\" (Psalms 51:17) and after concluding the service, one adds, \"Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before Thee, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer,\" (Psalms 19:15), after which the worshipper steps backward.",
            "On New Moons and on the intermediate days of the festivals, the nineteen blessings are recited for the evening, morning and afternoon services, as on ordinary days; and the prayer beginning, \"O our God and God of our fathers, may our remembrance rise, come, etc.\" is incorporated in the blessing referring to the restoration of the ancient service. The additional service on the intermediate days of the festivals is the same as on the feast itself. On New Moons, one recites for the additional service, the first three and the last three blessings (common to all services) and an intermediate blessing having reference to the additional sacrifice prescribed for the New Moons, and concludes it with the formula, \"Who sanctifiest Israel and the new moons.\"",
            "On a Sabbath that is also an intermediate day of a festival, and likewise when the beginning of the month falls on a Sabbath, the evening, morning and afternoon services consist of the seven blessings, as on other Sabbaths—with the prayer, \"O, our God and God of our fathers, let our remembrance arise and come, etc.\" added in the blessing referring to the restoration of the ancient service. In the additional service, the intermediate blessing begins and ends with a reference to the Sabbath while the middle portion refers to the special sacred character of the day. On new moons it concludes, \"Who sanctifiest the sabbath, Israel and the beginning of the months,\" and on the intermediate days of the festivals, the conclusion is the same as on a festival that falls on the sabbath. When a festival falls on the first day of the week, the following paragraph is inserted, in the evening service, in the fourth blessing:",
            "\"Thou hast made known unto us the judgments of Thy righteousness, and hast taught us to perform the statutes of Thy will. Thou hast given us, O Lord our God, the holiness of the Sabbath and the glory of the appointed time, and the celebration of the festival. Thou hast made a distinction between the holiness of the Sabbath and that of the feast, and hast hallowed the great and holy seventh day. Thou hast given us, O Lord our God, appointed times for gladness and seasons for joy,…\" At the close of the Sabbath or festivals throughout the year, the <i>Habdalah</i> (paragraph referring to the distinction between the profane and holy), is recited in the fourth blessing, \"Thou favourest man with knowledge …\", although the <i>Habdalah</i> is afterwards also said over the cup of wine.",
            "During the Feast of Lights and on the Feast of Lots, the paragraph beginning, \"For the miracles\" is added in the blessing beginning, \"We give thanks unto Thee.\" On the Sabbath during the Feast of Lights the paragraph, \"For the miracles\" is recited in the Additional Services as it is in the other services.",
            "On fast days, every one who fasts adds, in the blessing concluding, \"Who hearkenest unto prayer,\" the paragraph beginning, \"Answer us etc.\" The reader of the congregation, when repeating the service aloud, recites this paragraph as an independent blessing, between the blessing relating to redemption and that relating to health; and concludes it with the formula, \"Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who answerest in time of trouble.\" And so on that day the reader recites twenty blessings. On the ninth of Ab, a paragraph is added in the blessing concluding, \"Who rebuildest Jerusalem,\" as follows: Have mercy, O Lord our God, upon us and upon Israel, Thy people, and upon the city that is ruined and desolate …\"",
            "During the winter, the phrase, \"Who causeth the rain to fall,\" is inserted in the Second blessing, while in summer the phrase, \"Who causeth the dew to descend\" is recited. The formula, \"Who causeth the rain to fall\" is first said in the Additional service of the last (eighth) day of the feast of Tabernacles and continues to be said till the morning service on the first day of Passover. And the formula, \"Who causeth the dew to fall\" is begun in the additional service of the first day of Passover.",
            "Beginning with the seventh day of Marheshvan, a petition for Rain is included in the blessing calling for prosperity during the year, and is recited as long as the reference to rain, inserted in the second blessing, continues to be said. This is the rule for the Holy Land. But in Shinar (now called Iraq), Syria, Egypt, and adjacent territories, as well as in other places similar to these (in climate) the petition for Rain is begun sixty days after the autumnal equinox.",
            "In places that require rain in the summer, for instance in the distant sea-girt islands, a petition for rain, is offered up, whenever it is needed, in the prayer ending, \"Who hearkenest unto prayer.\" In places where the second days of the feasts are kept, the formula, \"Who causest the rain to descend\" is recited, for the first time in the year, in the additional Service, on the first day of the feast of Solemn Assembly (8th day of Tabernacles) and continues to be recited throughout the winter.",
            "The third blessing ends, throughout the year, with the words, \"the holy God,\" and the eleventh blessing, with the words, \"King who loveth righteousness and justice.\" But in the ten days, from the New Year to the close of the day of Atonement, the third blessing ends with the words, \"the holy King\" and the eleventh, with the words, \"The King of Justice.\"",
            "In some places it is customary, during these ten days, to add in the first blessing the petition, \"Remember us unto life, …\", in the second blessing, the sentence, \"Who is like unto Thee, O merciful father …\", (in the Thanksgiving blessing, \"Remember Thy mercies …\")<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the German and Polish ritual, “Inscribe in the book of life, all the sons of Thy Covenant.”</i> and in the last blessing, \"In the book of life …\" So too, in some places they have the custom, during these ten days, to add in the third blessing the paragraphs, \"And thus cause the fear of Thee, O Lord our God …\" On the New Year and the Day of Atonement, the addition of these paragraphs to the third blessing is the general practice."

            "In order that the duty may be properly fulfilled, the morning service should begin at sunrise. It may however be recited till the close of the fourth hour after dawn, that is, till the lapse of one third of the day. And if one transgressed, wittingly or in error, and recited the Service after the fourth hour, and before noon, he has fulfilled the duty of reciting the prayer, but not that of reciting it at the right time. For even as prayer is a precept of the Torah, so it is an ordinance of our teachers to offer it at the proper time, as appointed by the sages and prophets.",
            "We have already stated that the time for reciting the afternoon service was fixed to correspond with the hour when the daily afternoon sacrifice was offered up. As this took place daily nine and a half hours after dawn, the time for reading the afternoon service was appointed to begin nine and a half hours after dawn. This is termed the Minor Afternoon (Service). And since the daily [afternoon] sacrifice was slaughtered six and a half hours after dawn on the Eve of Passover, whenever that date fell on the eve of the Sabbath, the Sages declared that if one recites the afternoon service later than six and a half hours after dawn, he has fulfilled his duty. The arrival of this hour marks the time when the obligation to read the afternoon service has commenced. This is termed the Major Afternoon (Service).",
            "Many have the custom of reciting both the major and minor afternoon services, one of them as an optional service. Some of the Geonim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Geonim were heads of religious academies in Babylon.</i> decided that only the major afternoon service may be thus recited. And this is in accordance with reason; for it corresponds to the fact that the offering of the daily afternoon Sacrifice at that hour did not take place regularly, every day.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">But only when the Eve of Passover fell on the sixth day of the week.</i> Still, if the major afternoon service had been recited as the obligatory service, the minor afternoon service should only be recited as an optional service.",
            "Hence, the time for reciting the major afternoon service begins six and a half hours (after dawn) and continues till nine and a half hours (after that time), while the time for the minor afternoon service begins from nine and a half hours and continues till one and a quarter hours before the close of day. The prayer should however be recited before sunset.",
            "The time for reciting the additional service begins after the morning service and continues till the seventh hour of the day. One who recites it after the seventh hour, although he has transgressed (the rule as to the hour), has nevertheless fulfilled his duty, since the time for reciting it is the whole day.",
            "The time for the evening service, though it is not obligatory, is, for the one who reads it, from the commencement of nightfall till dawn. The <i>Neilah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Concluding Service on the Day of Atonement and, in earlier times, on any public fast-day.</i> should be read at a time to allow it to be completed near sunset.",
            "One who recites a service, before the time appointed, has not fulfilled his duty and has to recite it again at the right time. But, if a person, on an urgent occasion, has recited the morning service after dawn (but before sunrise) he has fulfilled his duty. The evening service for the Sabbath Eve should be recited on the Eve of the Sabbath, before sunset. So the evening service for the close of the sabbath may be recited on the sabbath; the reason being that as the evening service is optional, one need not be strict as to the time of its recital; provided that the <i>Shema</i> is read at the proper time after the stars are visible.",
            "If the proper time of a service has passed without its having been recited, the omission, if wilful, cannot be rectified or made good. But if the omission was due to error or preoccupation, it can be made good at the next service. The latter is first recited at its proper time, and the prayer is then repeated to make good the omission.",
            "For example: If by mistake, one omitted to read the prayer in the morning and the first half of the day passed, he should read the prayer in the afternoon twice; first to fulfill the duty of reading the afternoon service, and a second time, to make good the omission of the morning service. If through error, the afternoon service had been omitted and the sun had set, the prayer in the evening should be read twice; the first time, as the evening service, and again, to make up for the omission of the afternoon service. If, by error, the evening service has not been read, and it has dawned, the morning prayer should be read twice, the first time, as the morning service, the second, to make up for the omission of the previous evening service.",
            "If two successive services had erroneously been omitted, only the latter can be made good. For example, if, by error, one recited neither the morning nor the afternoon services, he is to read the evening prayer twice; the first time as the evening service, the second to make up for the omission of the afternoon service. But the omission of the morning service cannot be made good, the time for that having passed. The same applies to other services.",

            "Cleanliness of hands: How is this condition complied with? The hands are washed in water, up to the wrists, and then the prayers are recited. A person, travelling on the road, finds, when the time for prayer has arrived, that he has no water. If it can be procured within a distance of four miles, equal to 8000 cubits, he should proceed to the locality where there is water, wash his hands and then recite the prayers. If the distance exceeds that limit, he wipes his hands on a clod, or with loose earth, or on a beam and then reads the Service.",

If he has passed on from the place where there is water beyond this distance, he is not obliged to go back, but wipes his hands and recites the prayers. The statement that for prayers only the hands need to be cleansed refers to all services except the morning service. For this service, the face, the hands and the feet<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Why feet? Because these may be mired as people walked barefoot or only wearing sandals.</i> should first be washed, and then the prayers are recited. If water is not accessible, one wipes the hands only, and recites the prayers.",
            "Those who are ritually unclean wash their hands only—like those that are clean—and recite the prayers. Although they are able to take a ritual bath and so be rid of their ritual impurity, their omission to do so does not debar them from the recital of the prayers. We have already explained that Ezra instituted the rule that one who had had an emission should not read Torah alone till he had taken a ritual bath. Subsequent authorities extended the rule to the recital of prayers, and ordained that such a person should not recite the prayers alone till he had ritually bathed. This rule has no connection with ritual cleanliness or uncleanliness. Its purpose is to restrain scholars from uxoriousness. Hence the limitation of the requirement of ritual bathing to those who had seminal emissions and whose case forms an exception to those otherwise unclean.",
            "While this ordinance was in force it was held that even one who suffered from flux and had a seminal issue, or a woman who in her period of menstration had a seminal discharge, or during cohabitation, found that her period of separation had come, must, in order to read the <i>Shema</i> and the prayers, first take a ritual bath on account of the seminal emission, even though they are also otherwise unclean. This is logical, the ritual bathing being prescribed not because of the uncleanness, but to discourage uxoriousness. The ordinance, however, has become obsolete, as it was never universally adopted by the Jewish people and was found too irksome.",
            "The custom is general in Spain and in Shinar (Iraq) that one who has had a seminal emission does not recite prayers till he has washed all his body in water, out of respect to the exhortation, \"Prepare to meet thy God.\" This only applies to a healthy person or one who is sick and has cohabited. But a sick man who has had an involuntary emission is exempt from the duty of bathing for prayer. The custom does not apply to his case, nor to the case of one who suffers from a flux or of a woman in her period of separation who had a seminal emission. They dry themselves, wash their hands and recite the prayers.",
            "The covering of the body: how is this requirement to be fulfilled? Although the lower part of the body is covered, as for the reading of the <i>Shema,</i> the prayers are not to be recited till the heart is also covered. If one has not covered it or is unable to do so, having nothing wherewith to cover it, and recites the prayers, he has fulfilled his duty, since the lower part of his body is covered. But he should not do so deliberately.",
            "Cleanliness of the place where prayers are recited: how is this condition fulfilled? One may not pray in a place where there is filth, nor in a bath-house, nor in a latrine, nor on a site used for depositing refuse, nor in any place concerning which there is no presumption that it is clean. In short, wherever the <i>Shema</i> is not read, there prayers are not recited. And as we move away from ordure, urine, a foul odor, a corpse, and an indecent exposure, in order that we may read the <i>Shema,</i> we do the same, for the recital of the prayers.",
            "A person who, after reciting prayers, finds ordure in the place, inasmuch as he had committed a sin in not examining it before his recital of the prayers, must read them again in a clean place. A person, while standing and reading the service, finds ordure in front of him. If by walking on, he would leave it four cubits in his rear, he should do so. If this is impossible,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A river or other barrier being in front of him.</i> he should move away from it sideways. If he cannot do this, he must intermit the recital of the prayers. The great sages did not recite prayers in a house where there was beer or strong sauce that had turned bad, because of its offensive odor, even though the premises might otherwise be clean.",
            "[Absence of] disturbing elements. How is this requisite fulfilled? If one feels an urgent call of nature, one must not pray. If the call is disregarded, the prayer that one utters is an abomination. And, having first relieved himself, he should recite the Service a second time. But if he can restrain himself as long as it would take to walk a <i>Parsah</i> (= 4 mil = 8000 cubits), his recital of prayer is accounted a proper recital. Nevertheless, prayers should not be recited by anyone till he has examined himself well and is satisfied that the calls of nature have been attended to. So also, phlegm, saliva and anything else that might disturb one should be removed and then the prayers should be recited.",
            "A person who, during prayers, stretches himself, yawns or sneezes, if he does so voluntarily, his behavior is unseemly. But if, before beginning his prayers, he examined himself and the act was involuntary, it does not matter. Saliva that has accumulated during prayer, should be covered with the garment. A person, whose delicacy would be offended by this procedure, casts it behind him with his hand, so that during prayer he may be saved from an annoyance which would disturb him. If, while standing in prayer, intestinal flatus involuntarily escapes, he waits till it has passed and resumes his prayer.",
            "If he is seized with intestinal flatulence, and its retention causes him excessive pain, he should step backwards four cubits and wait till he feels relieved. Then he should say: \"Lord of the Universe, Thou hast formed us with apertures and cavities. Our shame and reproach are open and known to Thee. Objects of shame and reproach are we while we live; worm and corruption, after we die.\" Then he returns to his place and resumes his prayer.",
            "If, while standing reading the service, his urine dripped on to his knees, he should pause till the dripping has ceased, and then resume his prayers at the place where he left off. If he had paused for an interval sufficiently lengthy to conclude the service, he starts again from the beginning.",
            "So, after urinating, one must pause for as long as it would take to walk four cubits and then one may recite the service. Thus too, after the conclusion of a service, one should wait as long as it would take to walk four cubits before urinating, so that there shall be an interval after the reading of the service.",
            "Concentration of the mind—how is this condition [to be fulfilled?] Any prayer uttered without mental concentration is not prayer. If a service has been recited without such concentration, it must be recited again devoutly. A person finds that his thoughts are confused and his mind is distracted: He may not pray till he has recovered his mental composure. Hence, on returning from a journey or if one is weary or distressed, it is forbidden to pray till his mind is composed. The sages said that he should wait three days till he is rested and his mind is calm, and then he recites the prayers.",
            "What is to be understood by concentration of the mind? The mind should be freed from all extraneous thoughts and the one who prays should realize that he is standing before the Divine Presence. He should therefore sit awhile before beginning his prayers, so as to concentrate his mind, and then pray in gentle tones, beseechingly, and not regard the service as a burden which he is carrying and which he will cast off and proceed on his way. He should, accordingly, also sit awhile, after concluding the prayers, and then leave. The ancient saints were wont to pause and meditate one hour before the service, one hour after the service and take one hour in its recital.",
            "An intoxicated person must not pray, because he cannot concentrate. If he prays, his prayer is an abomination. He must therefore recite the prayers again after he has recovered from his intoxication. A person under the influence of drink should not pray while in that condition. But if he has recited the service, it is regarded as prayer. A drunkard is one who is unable to speak in the royal presence. A person under the influence of drink is one who can speak in the presence of a king without committing error. Yet having drunk, if only a quarter of a <i>log</i> of wine,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Equal in volume to 1½ eggs.</i> one is not to pray till he is rid of the effect of the wine he has taken.",
            "So too, persons should not stand up to pray after indulging in jest, laughter, frivolity, idle talk, quarrelling or outburst of anger, but only after the study of Torah, not however of legal discussions by which the mind is distracted, but only after the study of such themes as require no profound reflection, as for instance established rules.",
            "Prayers which are only read at periodic intervals, such as the additional service for the beginning of the month and the services for the festivals should be first rehearsed before one stands up to recite them so that he shall not break down during their recital. If a person were travelling in a dangerous locality, infested, for example, by wild beasts or robbers, he should recite one blessing as follows: \"The needs of Israel, Thy people, are many. Their knowledge is scanty. Be it Thy will, O Lord, our God, to give every one what is sufficient for his maintenance and provide every creature with its requirements. Do what is good in Thy sight. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who hearkenest unto prayer.\" He recites this prayer, walking. If he is able to stand on one spot while uttering it, he should do so. And when he arrives in a neighbourhood that is populated and his mind is calm, he reads the service of nineteen blessings in its regular form."

If, however, these were disregarded, owing to stress, or disability or even wilfully, the recital of the prayers would not be debarred [deemed ineffective]. The points are as follows: one should stand; with face towards the Temple; the body should be in correct posture; the clothing adjusted; one should stand in a proper place; the voice should be properly modulated; and genuflection and prostration be correctly performed.",
            "<i>The Standing position.</i> The <i>Amidah</i> [main prayer] is only recited, standing. A person who is on a ship or in a wagon should, if he is able, stand up for that prayer. If unable, he may read it, sitting in his place. A sick person may read it, even lying down on his side, provided, however, that he can concentrate his mind. A thirsty or hungry person is in the same category as the sick: if he can concentrate, he recites the prayer; if not, he should not do so till he has refreshed himself with food and drink. A person who is riding, need not alight, even if there is some one to hold his beast so that his mind may be at ease.",
            "<i>With face turned towards the Temple.</i> Anyone outside Palestine turns his face towards the land of Israel and recites the prayer. One who is in the Holy Land turns towards Jerusalem. One who is in Jerusalem turns towards the Temple. If one is in the Temple, he turns towards the Holy of Holies. A person who is either blind, or unable to determine the right direction, or is on a ship, directs his heart to the Divine Presence and prays.",
            "<i>Correct posture.</i> When standing in prayer, the feet should be in line; the eyes lowered as if one were looking towards the ground; while the heart should be uplifted as if one were in heaven; the hands should be placed over the heart, close together, the right over the left. The worshipper should stand, like a servant in his master's presence, in awe, fear and dread. He should not place his hands on his hips.",
            "<i>Adjustment of the dress.</i> Before beginning the Service, the dress should first be adjusted and the personal appearance made trim and neat, as it is said, \"O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness\" (Psalms 96:9). One should not stand in prayer wearing a moneybelt, nor bareheaded, nor barefoot, where the local custom is not to stand in the presence of the great, without shoes. And one should not pray anywhere, holding phylacteries in the hand or carrying a scroll of the law in the arms, for the mind would then be preoccupied with those sacred objects. Nor while praying, should vessels or money be held in the hand. On the feast of Tabernacles, however, the worshiper prays, while carrying a palm branch—this being the religious duty of the day. When the time comes to recite the prayer, a person carrying a burden on his head, adjusts it behind him, if it is less than four kabs<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A kab is equal in volume to 4 logs. A log is equal in volume to 6 hen’s eggs.</i> and recites the prayer. If it is four kabs in size, he places it on the ground, and then prays. The practice of all the sages and their disciples is not to pray unless their heads are wrapped in the <i>Talith</i> (praying shawl).",
            "<i>Place where the worshiper prays.</i> He should stand in a low place and turn his face to the wall. Windows or doors towards Jerusalem should be opened, and he should stand facing them when he prays, as it is said, \"Now his windows were open in his upper chamber towards Jerusalem\" (Daniel 6:11). There should be one fixed place set apart for prayer. It should not be recited in a ruin nor at the rear of a synagogue, unless the worshiper turns his face towards the synagogue. It is forbidden to remain seated at the side of one who is standing in prayer, or pass in front of him unless he has moved away from the worshiper to a distance of four cubits.",
            "One must not, while praying, stand on a spot three hand-breadths or more above the floor of the room; nor may one stand for prayer upon a bed, stool or chair. A lofty structure, provided that it is four cubits by four cubits in area—the size of a chamber—is regarded as an attic, and it is permitted to pray in it. So, too, if it was enclosed on all sides by partitions, even though its area was less than four cubits by four cubits, prayers may be recited while standing in it, for the height of such a structure is not noticed, it being a compartment by itself.",
            "Labourers who are working on the top of a wall, or on the top of a tree, when the time for prayer arrives, should descend to the ground, recite the prayer, and resume their labours. If they are on the top of an olive tree or a fig tree, they recite it where they are, as it would entail excessive trouble to descend. What prayer do they recite? Those who work for board only recite the three daily prayers, of nineteen blessings each. If they were working for wages, they recite <i>Havinenu</i> [Summary of the Middle Blessings, together with the first three and last three blessings]. In either case, no congregational service is held, nor is the priestly benediction pronounced.",
            "<i>Modulation of the voice.</i> The voice should not be raised during the recital of the <i>Amidah</i> prayer nor should it be offered [silently] in thought alone. The words should be pronounced with the lips, but softly, and yet be audible to the speaker's ears. The worshiper should not permit his voice to be heard by others, unless he is sick, or is unable to concentrate his attention without reading aloud. He may not, however, do so at public worship, so that the congregants shall not be disturbed by his loud praying.",

The knees are then bent, the worshiper steps backwards three paces, and with knees bent, bows to the left, then to the right, and then raises his head. When he bends the knees the first four times, he does so while uttering the word \"Blessed\" and resumes the erect posture at the word \"O Lord.\" This rule applies to the layman. The high priest however bends the knees at the beginning and end of every blessing. The king bows his head at the beginning of the [<i>Amidah</i>] prayer and does not raise it till he has concluded it.",
            "Why does the worshiper bow towards the left, first? Because his left corresponds to the right of the person whom he faces. And just as one who stands before a king bows to the king's right and then to the king's left, so the sages ordained that at the conclusion of the <i>Amidah</i>, the same etiquette should be observed as in taking leave of the royal presence.",
            "In all these genuflections, the worshiper should bow till all the vertebrae of the spinal column become prominent, and his body assumes the shape of a bow. If however he bowed slightly and made an effort which caused strain, so that it is evident that he bows as low as he can, he need not be apprehensive [as to whether he had fulfilled his duty].",
            "<i>Prostration.</i> After he has raised his head, subsequent to the fifth genuflection, the worshiper seats himself on the floor and \"falls upon his face\" and offers all the supplications he pleases. Genuflection, wherever mentioned, always refers to bending the knees. <i>Kidah</i> means \"falling on the face\" [with knees bent]. <i>Hishtahvayah</i> means stretching out the hands and feet, so that one is lying prone with face to the ground.",
            "When performing the rite of \"falling on the face\", after the service, some fall on the face, some prostrate themselves. The latter is forbidden on a stone floor, except in the Temple of Jerusalem, as has been explained in the laws concerning Idolatry. [Even] a worthy person may not fall on his face unless he is conscious that he is a righteous man like Joshua.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">(Joshua 5:14) “And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship.”</i> He should only incline his face somewhat, but not press it against the floor.

Some individuals fall on their faces in the evening service. All do so in every service on the day of Atonement, this being a day of petition, supplication, and fasting."

            "A house of study is superior to a synagogue. Eminent sages, notwithstanding that there were many synagogues in their towns, only prayed in the places where they were engaged in the study of the Torah. It is understood that congregational services are [also] held there.",
            "How is public worship conducted? One person recites the prayers aloud, and all the rest listen. This is not done, if there are less than ten adult men present, the Reader being counted in the number. Even if some of them have already said their prayers and thus discharged their obligation, they help to complete the quorum of ten, provided that the majority have not yet said their prayers. So too, the <i>Kedushah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 6:3; Ezekiel 3:12; Psalms 146:10.</i> is not recited, nor is the Torah recited with the blessing before and after the reading, nor the lesson from the prophets read [with its blessings], unless a quorum of ten is present.",
            "Thus too, one individual is not to recite the blessings before the <i>Shema</i> while all listen and respond Amen, unless a quorum of ten is present. This is termed <i>Poress al Shema</i> (Cp. Targum to I Samuel 9:13). Nor is <i>Kaddish</i> recited, unless ten are present. Nor do the priests solemnly raise their hands (to recite the priestly benediction) unless ten are present, the priests being counted in the number. For every group of ten in Israel is called a Congregation, as it is said, \"How long shall I bear with this evil congregation\" (Numbers 14:27). Those alluded to here were ten, (the Spies)—Joshua and Caleb being excluded.",

Where a small court opens, throughout its complete breadth, to a larger courtyard, and nine persons are in the larger, while one person is in the smaller enclosure, they form a quorum. But if nine persons are in the smaller enclosure and one person is in the larger, they do not constitute a quorum. If the congregation is in the larger enclosure and the Reader in the smaller, their obligation to worship is discharged when he officiates on their behalf. But if the congregation is in the smaller, and the Reader in the larger enclosure, their obligation is not discharged when the reader recites the service, since he is separated from them and not in the same place with them, for the larger enclosure having posts on both sides is regarded as divided off from the smaller enclosure. The smaller enclosure, however, is regarded not as divided off from the larger enclosure, but as a corner of it.",
            "So too, if there is ordure in the larger enclosure, it is forbidden to recite prayers or read the <i>Shema</i> in the smaller enclosure. But if there was ordure in the smaller enclosure, prayers may be recited and the <i>Shema</i> may be read in the larger, provided that there was no offensive odor, since the smaller enclosure is divided off from the larger.",

When he recites the prayers and they respond with the utterance of Amen after every blessing, they are regarded as praying. This only aplies to one who does not know the liturgy. One who is proficient does not discharge his obligation unless he recites the prayers for himself.",
            "The foregoing rule holds good for all days of the year except New Year's Day and the Day of Atonement in a Jubilee year. On those two days, the Reader discharges the obligations of the proficient as of the non-proficient, on the ground that the prayers recited on those days are lengthy and the majority of those acquainted with them cannot concentrate their minds as the Reader can. Hence, if one who is proficient wishes on those days to rely on the Reader's recital of the prayers, he may do so.",

An endeavor should be made to secure one who has a pleasant voice and is accustomed to read. Anyone whose beard is not full grown, even though he is a great scholar, should, out of respect to the Congregation, not be appointed as the regular reader.

A teacher may appoint one of his pupils to read the services in his presence. A blind man may publicly recite the blessings before the <i>Shema</i> and be appointed Reader to the Congregation.

Then he says, \"Bless ye the Lord who is blessed\"; they respond, \"Blessed be the Lord who is blessed for ever and ever\". He then starts to recite the <i>Shema</i> with the blessings preceding and following it. They respond, \"Amen\" at the close of each blessing.

Blessings and Thanksgivings be to Thy great and holy Name, because Thou hast kept us in life and hast preserved us. So mayest Thou continue to keep us in life and be gracious unto us.

In this attitude, he offers up supplications. He then sits up and raises his head, the rest of the people doing the same; and, while seated, offers supplications aloud. The reader then rises alone and recites the <i>Kaddish</i> a second time, the Congregation making the responses as on the first occasion. He then recites, \"And He, being merciful, forgiveth iniquity, etc.,\" then, the Psalm of David—(Psalm 145). The reader in the meanwhile stands; the congregation remains seated and recites with him. He then recites, \"And a redeemer shall come unto Zion, etc. And as for me, this is my covenant, etc. But Thou art holy, etc. And one cried unto another, Holy, etc.\" He completes the <i>Kedushah.</i> The congregants respond, \"Holy, holy, holy\" three times. He then reads the <i>Kedushah</i> in the Aramaic version. Then he recites the text, \"Then a wind lifted me up, etc.\" He reads this also again in the Aramaic version.

Were this the motive, the slaughtering of all animals would have been prohibited. It is also forbidden to multiply epithets and say: \"O God, Great, Mighty, Awe-inspiring, Powerful, Puissant\", since it is beyond human power to exhaust the praises of God.

While reading this psalm, both he and the congregation are seated. The reader rises and says <i>Kaddish.</i> The congregants rise after him and make the customary responses. They all recite the <i>Amidah</i> inaudibly. The reader repeats the <i>Amidah</i> aloud, as in the morning service, till he has concluded the whole of it.

They respond, \"Blessed is the Lord who is to be blessed for ever and ever\". He then begins to read the <i>Shema</i> with its accompanying blessings and says <i>Kaddish,</i> after which all rise and silently repeat the Amidah. When they have concluded, the reader says <i>Kaddish.</i> The congregation then departs. The reader does not, in the Evening Service, repeat the Amidah aloud, because that Service is not obligatory. He accordingly abstains from a recital of blessings that would be nugatory, since there is no one under an obligation to recite them, or would require the reader to discharge the duty for him.",
            "On the Eves of the Sabbaths, the Reader, after saying the <i>Amidah</i> silently with the Congregation, repeats it aloud. He does not however recite the Seven Blessings, but one blessing only, which summarizes the seven. The following is what he says: \"Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, the great, mighty and revered God, the most high God, Possessor of Heaven and Earth. He with His word was a shield to our forefathers, and by His bidding, will quicken the dead; the holy God, like unto whom there is none; Who giveth rest to His people on His holy Sabbath day, because He took pleasure in them to grant them rest. Him we will serve in fear and with awe, and daily and constantly we will give thanks unto His name in the fitting form of blessings. He is the God to whom thanksgivings are due, the Lord of peace, Who halloweth the Sabbath and blesseth the Seventh Day, and in holiness giveth rest unto a people sated with delights, in remembrance of the Creation. Our God and God of our fathers, accept our rest etc. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who hallowest the Sabbath.\" He then says <i>Kaddish,</i> after which all the people depart.",
            "The reason why the Sages instituted this particular repetition is because the majority of the people come on the Eves of Sabbaths to join in public worship, and there may be one present who came late and has not completed his prayer. He might be left alone in the synagogue and incur danger. The Reader therefore repeats a summary of the <i>Amidah,</i> so that all the congregation shall stay till the late comer shall have concluded and be able to leave with them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In ancient times the Synagogues were outside the towns and villages. The evening prayer during the working days was recited by everyone at home. On Friday evening they repaired to the communal place of worship. It would have been dangerous for a late comer, left in the synagogue, to go home in the dark alone.</i>",
            "Hence, when a feast, the Day of Atonement or the First of the Month falls on a Sabbath, the reader who officiates does not include in this blessing any reference to the special day, but ends with the formula, \"Who hallowest the Sabbath,\" the reason being that the special day imposes no obligation to say this blessing.",
            "On sabbaths and festivals, after the Reader has completed the repetition of the morning <i>Amidah,</i> he says <i>Kaddish,</i> reads the 145th Psalm and again says <i>Kaddish,</i> after which the Congregation reads the additional service softly which he then recites aloud, as he did the [Amidah in the] morning service. He then says <i>Kaddish</i> after the additional service; and the people depart. Neither the \"Order of Sanctification\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Beginning: “And a Redeemer shall come to Zion … and Thou art holy.”</i> nor propitiatory prayers are then recited.

They must not however let their synagogue for rent or pledge it as security for a loan. So too, when synagogues are demolished to be rebuilt, the bricks, wood and earth may be sold, exchanged or given away, but not loaned, because the sanctity attached to the material passes only if money or a benefit equivalent to money is obtained in return.",

Similarly, houses and courts where people meet for prayer have no sanctity, because they have not been set apart for worship but are only so used casually, just as a man prays in his own home."

The reason is that the afternoon service, being recited on such a day near sunset, appears to have the character of <i>Neilah</i> and will not be confused with the afternoon service on other days. Hence the Priestly Benediction is pronounced on such a fast-day. A priest who transgressed the rule and went up in front of the ark on the Day of Atonement in the afternoon service is permitted to raise his hands to pronounce the Benediction—as it is known that on this day there is no inebriety—and he is not made to step down, so as not to give rise to the suspicion that he was disqualified and therefore had been made to step down.",

Every priest proceeding to the platform to pronounce the Benediction, as soon as he starts, says, \"May it be Thy Will, O Lord our God, that this Benediction which Thou hast commanded us to bless therewith Thy people Israel shall be a perfect blessing. May there be in it no stumbling nor perverseness from now and for evermore\". Before the priest turns his face towards the people to bless them, he recites the blessing, \"Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast sanctified us with the sanctification of Aaron and commanded us to bless Thy people Israel with love\". He then turns his face to the congregation and begins to bless them. And when he turns his face away from the congregation, after he had concluded the Benediction, he says \"We have done that which Thou hast decreed unto us.

A priest who had worshiped idols, whether under compulsion or in error, even if he had repented, must never perform this rite, for it is said, \"Nevertheless, the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem\" (II Kings 23:9); and the Priestly Benediction is like the Temple service, as it is said, \"To minister unto Him and to bless in His name\" (Deuteronomy 10:8).
