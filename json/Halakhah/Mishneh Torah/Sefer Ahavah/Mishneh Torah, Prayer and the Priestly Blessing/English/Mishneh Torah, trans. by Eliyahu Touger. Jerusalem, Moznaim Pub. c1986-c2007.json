            "It is a positive Torah commandment to pray every day, as [Exodus 23:25] states: \"You shall serve God, your Lord.\" Tradition teaches us that this service is prayer, as [Deuteronomy 11:13] states: \"And serve Him with all your heart\" and our Sages said: Which is the service of the heart? This is prayer.<br>The number of prayers is not prescribed in the Torah, nor does it prescribe a specific formula for prayer. Also, according to Torah law, there are no fixed times for prayers.",
            "Therefore, women and slaves are obligated to pray, since it is not a time-oriented commandment.<br>Rather, this commandment obligates each person to offer supplication and prayer every day and utter praises of the Holy One, blessed be He; then petition for all his needs with requests and supplications; and finally, give praise and thanks to God for the goodness that He has bestowed upon him; each one according to his own ability.",
            "A person who was eloquent would offer many prayers and requests. [Conversely,] a person who was inarticulate would speak as well as he could and whenever he desired.<br>Similarly, the number of prayers was dependent on each person's ability. Some would pray once daily; others, several times.<br>Everyone would pray facing the Holy Temple, wherever he might be. This was the ongoing practice from [the time of] Moshe Rabbenu until Ezra.",
            "When Israel was exiled in the time of the wicked Nebuchadnezzar, they became interspersed in Persia and Greece and other nations. Children were born to them in these foreign countries and those children's language was confused.<br>The speech of each and every one was a concoction of many tongues. No one was able to express himself coherently in any one language, but rather in a mixture [of languages], as [Nehemiah 13:24] states: \"And their children spoke half in Ashdodit and did not know how to speak the Jewish language. Rather, [they would speak] according to the language of various other peoples.\"<br>Consequently, when someone would pray, he would be limited in his ability to request his needs or to praise the Holy One, blessed be He, in Hebrew, unless other languages were mixed in with it. When Ezra and his court saw this, they established eighteen blessings in sequence.<br>The first three [blessings] are praises of God and the last three are thanksgiving. The intermediate [blessings] contain requests for all those things that serve as general categories for the desires of each and every person and the needs of the whole community.<br>Thus, the prayers could be set in the mouths of everyone. They could learn them quickly and the prayers of those unable to express themselves would be as complete as the prayers of the most eloquent. It was because of this matter that they established all the blessings and prayers so that they would be ordered in the mouths of all Israel, so that each blessing would be set in the mouth of each person unable to express himself.",
            "They also decreed that the number of prayers correspond to the number of sacrifices - i.e., two prayers every day, corresponding to the two daily sacrifices. On any day that an additional sacrifice [was offered], they instituted a third prayer, corresponding to the additional offering.<br>The prayer that corresponds to the daily morning sacrifice is called the Shacharit Prayer. The prayer that corresponds to the daily sacrifice offered in the afternoon is called the <i>Minchah</i> Prayer and the prayer corresponding to the additional offerings is called the <i>Musaf</i> Prayer.",
            "They also instituted a prayer to be recited at night, since the limbs of the daily afternoon offering could be burnt the whole night, as [Leviticus 6:2] states: \"The burnt offering [shall remain on the altar hearth all night until morning].\" In this vein, [Psalms 55:18] states: \"In the evening, morning and afternoon I will speak and cry aloud, and He will hear my voice.\"<br>The Evening Prayer is not obligatory, as are the Morning and <i>Minchah</i> Prayers. Nevertheless, the Jewish people, in all the places that they have settled, are accustomed to recite the Evening Prayer and have accepted it upon themselves as an obligatory prayer.",
            "Similarly, they instituted a prayer after the <i>Minchah</i> Prayer [to be recited] close to sunset on fast days only, its purpose being to increase supplication and pleading because of the fast.<br>This is called the <i>Ne'ilah</i> prayer, as if to say that the gates of Heaven are closed behind the sun, which becomes hidden, since it is recited only close to [the time of] sunset.",
            "Thus, three prayers are recited daily: the Evening Prayer, the Morning Prayer, and the <i>Minchah</i> Prayer. There are four on Sabbaths, festivals and Rosh Chodesh: the three that are recited daily and the <i>Musaf</i> Prayer. On Yom Kippur, there are five: these four and the <i>Ne'ilah</i> prayer.",
            "The number of these prayers may not be diminished, but may be increased. If a person wants to pray all day long, he may.<br>Any prayer that one adds is considered as a freewill offering. Therefore, one must add a new idea consistent with that blessing in each of the middle blessings. [However], making an addition of a new concept even in only one blessing is sufficient in order to make known that this is a voluntary prayer and not obligatory.<br>In the first three [blessings] and the last three [blessings], one must never add, detract or change anything at all.",
            "The community should not recite a voluntary prayer, since the community does not bring a freewill offering. Even an individual should not recite the <i>Musaf</i> Prayer twice, once as the obligation of the day and the other as a voluntary prayer, because the additional offering is never a freewill offering.<br>One of the <i>Geonim</i> taught that it is forbidden to recite a voluntary prayer on Sabbaths or holidays, since freewill offerings were not sacrificed on these days, but only the obligatory offerings of the day."

In <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:7, the Rambam describes the <i>min</i> as one who does not believe in God, whereas the heretic denies not God, but Torah.<br>Historically, this could refer to the Saducees and other Jews with assimilationist tendencies that began to multiply at this time. Though they were definitely a minority among the people, their number was signficant enough to warrant concern. Others interpret this as a reference to the early Christians who launched many missionary campaigns to attract the Jews.</i> They would oppress the Jews<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">by slandering them to the Roman conquerors.</i> and entice them to turn away from God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">and adopt other lifestyles as above.<br>Since he saw this as the greatest need of the people, - for the devotion to Torah is the backbone of our people's continuity</i><br>Since he saw this as the greatest need of the people,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">for the devotion to Torah is the backbone of our people's continuity.</i> he and his court established one blessing that contains a request to God to destroy the heretics. He inserted it into the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> so that it would be arranged in the mouths of all.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Berachot</i> 28b relates: Rabban Gamliel said to the Sages: \"Is there no one who knows how to establish the blessing of the nonbelievers?\" Shmuel Hakatan rose and composed it. <i>Olat Re'iah</i> explains why this Sage was chosen: All of our great and wise Sages were able to compose the other blessings of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> which are full of love and giving. The blessing of the heretics differs for it appears full of hate and destruction. The composition of this blessing required great care, since the content must not imply the hatred of people per se, but a righteous indignation, born out of love for God and the pain felt when His Majesty is not honored. Shmuel HaKatan authored the famous statement: \"Refrain from joy at the fall of your enemies\" (<i>Pirkei Avot</i> 4:19). Thus, he was most worthy to author this blessing. His zealousness bore no trace whatsoever of hate, but was a true reflection of his unbounded love for God and His Torah.</i> Consequently, there are nineteen blessings in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We do, however, still call the prayer the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, based on its original eighteen blessings.</i>",

Jerusalem and the Holy Temple serve as the repositories for Divine grace and act as the meeting point between Heaven - the source of the bounty - and earth, the recipient of this blessing.

Because of the infrequency with which one would normally recite this blessing, any change in the text would confuse people and result in errors.</i><br>Similarly, on Saturday nights and the nights after a holiday, one should not recite \"Give us knowledge...,\" since one must say <i>Havdalah</i> in [the blessing of] the One who bestows knowledge.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">to differentiate between the previous holy day and the upcoming day. This prayer is added in the first intermediate blessing of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>: חונן הדעת (\"the One who bestows knowledge\") as explained in Halachah 12.<br><i>Berachot</i> 29a also suggests adding the <i>Havdalah</i> prayer in the abbreviated summary of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, distinguishing between the inclusion of <i>Havdalah</i> and the petition for rain, which could not be mentioned in the abbreviated version of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> as explained above.<br>They explain that <i>Havdalah</i> is recited in the first of the intermediate blessings and would therefore be easy to remember and not cause errors, whereas the petition for rain is in the middle, when concentration is more difficult.<br>The question is left unresolved in the Talmud and therefore, some authorities allow it to be included in the abbreviated version. However, most do not. Rabbenu Yonah explains that it is omitted because its mention would create the impression that <i>Havdalah</i> was a blessing in its own right, just as all the other statements in this version of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> are shortened versions of individual blessings.</i>",

Therefore, he asked that God assist him in finding the proper means of expression through prayer to achieve atonement.<br>We, too, are in a similar situation for we have no Temple and our prayers were instituted in the place of our sacrifices. (See Chapter 1, Halachah 5.) Accordingly, we ask God to assist us in our desire to utter His praises, and request our needs in such a way that it will be desirable to Him.<br><i>Berachot</i> 4b raises a question regarding the recitation of this verse before <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. Rabbi Yochanan himself states that one who starts the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> immediately after the blessing after <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, גאל ישראל (Who redeemed Israel) is called a person of the World to Come. (See Chapter 7, Halachah 18, where the Rambam mentions this halachah.)<br>Why is the recitation of this verse not considered an interruption between the blessing and the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>?

When the Jewish people began to prosper, the Sages then required that it be said over a cup of wine. (Rashi explains that the original decree that it be mentioned in prayer was forgotten.) Then the fortunes of the Jewish people declined again, and the Sages reinstituted the obligation to recite <i>Havdalah</i> in prayer. They also ruled that after <i>Havdalah</i> in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, one must also recite the <i>Havdalah</i> service over a cup of wine. A parallel is drawn to Friday night when we mention <i>Kiddush</i> in prayer and then make <i>Kiddush</i> over a cup of wine afterwards.<br>The Rambam begins his discussion of <i>Havdalah</i> within the context of the halachot of the specific prayers recited on various holidays.

            "On Chanukah and Purim, one adds \"For the miracles,...\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Both Chanukah and Purim are commemorated with the same basic prayer, על הניסים.

Rav Huna and Rav Yehudah are of the opinion that it should not be mentioned, since <i>Musaf</i> is not usually recited on Chanukah, and, therefore, there is no need to refer to Chanukah during the <i>Musaf</i> prayer of the Sabbath. Rav Nachman and Rabbi Yochanan hold that since <i>Musaf</i> is simply one of the prayers of the day, and על הנסים is recited on this day, its inclusion in <i>Musaf</i> is in place.<br>The Talmud ultimately decides in favor of the position of Rav Nachman and Rabbi Yochanan. This is supported by the fact that on Yom Kippur which falls on the Sabbath, reference is made to the Sabbath in the <i>Ne'ilah</i> prayer, even though <i>Ne'ilah</i> is not normally recited on the Sabbath.<br>The Rambam does not mention this halachah with regard to Purim, since it is only in rare cases that Purim occurs on the Sabbath. Purim is generally celebrated on the fourteenth of Adar, which never occurs on the Sabbath according to our fixed calendar. However, cities which were walled at the time of Joshua's conquest of Israel celebrate Purim on the fifteenth of Adar (<i>Shushan Purim</i>). Nevertheless, there are very few such cities.<br>Jerusalem is, however, one of them, and there, Purim can fall on the Sabbath. In such a case, על הנסים is said on the Sabbath, even though most of the other commandments of Purim are fulfilled either on the Friday before or the Sunday afterwards.

This is in line with <i>Shabbat</i> 24a which states: \"On fast days...in the Evening, Morning, and <i>Minchah</i> Prayers, one adds a mention of the particular day in 'the One who hears prayer.' However, the <i>Tur</i> quotes the Geonim that one should recite עננו only in the <i>Minchah</i> Prayer. Since one could be overcome by terrible hunger and break the fast, if one recited עננו earlier he would have spoken falsely when he mentioned the fast day. Therefore, according to this position, this prayer should be mentioned only in the <i>Minchah</i> service at the end of the fast days.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 565:3) quotes the <i>Tur's</i> position, but distinguishes between the four public fast days that occur every year (i.e., those mentioned above in our commentary) and other public fast days. On the four main public fasts, he obligates the individual to mention עננו in all his prayers. Since the Sages declared it a public fast, even were he to eat later on, he would not have spoken falsely in his prayer.<br>The Ramah (<i>ibid.</i>), however, mentions that it is customary to recite עננו in <i>Minchah</i> only. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> explains that even one reciting <i>Minchah</i> in the early afternoon should add עננו, because even if he eats later on, at least he fasted until midday. (See Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 562:1.) Sephardim follow the custom of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, and Ashkenazim follow the ruling of the Ramah and therefore recite עננו only in <i>Minchah</i>.</i> leader of the congregation recites it as an independent blessing between \"the One who redeems Israel\" and \"the One who heals...,\" and concludes with \"the One who answers in times of trouble.\" Thus, he recites 20 blessings.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is based on the passage from <i>Ta'anit</i> 13b quoted above. A clear distinction is made between the silent <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> uttered by all the congregants and the repetition recited aloud by the שליח ציבור (leader of the congregation). The שליח ציבור does establish for himself, as representative of the community as a whole, an independent blessing relevant to the fast day. Therefore, he recites 20 blessings, as explained by the Rambam: 19 blessings as on any day, and one extra that is particular to the fast day.<br>There is no disagreement regarding the obligation of the שליח ציבור to recite עננו in the Morning Prayer. He is praying on behalf of the entire community. Therefore, we need not worry about the possibility of the fast being broken, since it is not possible that a number from among the congregants will not fast the whole day (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 565:3).

It is appropriate that the addition regarding the ninth of Av be placed in this blessing, which speaks of rebuilding Jerusalem.<br>Despite this logic, there is some question regarding the inclusion of this prayer in this blessing. The source for this addition is the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ta'anit</i> 2:2). That passage questions whether the addition should be made in the עבודה (the first of the last three blessings in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>) or the הודאה (the second of the last three blessings). It explains that as a general rule commemorative prayers are mentioned in הודאה, while prayers regarding the future are placed in עבודה.<br>Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi quotes this passage, but adds that the custom is to recite the addition in בונה ירושלים (the blessing of Jerusalem). He explains that this decision is based on <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 8a which states that even though normally, we add special requests in the blessing of שומע תפילה (the One who hears prayer), one is able to make a request relevant to one of the blessings of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, in that blessing itself. Therefore, our prayers and supplications regarding the rebuilding of Jerusalem may rightfully be placed in the blessing of בונה ירושלים. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 557:1.)</i> \"Have mercy on us, God, our Lord, and on Your people, Israel, and Jerusalem, Your city, the mourning city,...\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew term is רחם עלינו. This version appears in the Jerusalem Talmud. However, in both Rabbenu Asher's and Rabbenu Yitzhak Alfasi's quotes of that passage, the terms used is נחם (Console us...). This version is found in most siddurim, although the version of Yemenite Jewry is רחם, as in the Rambam.<br>There is also a question regarding when this prayer is recited. The Rambam seems to indicate that רחם (or נחם) is to be recited in every prayer on the ninth of Av. However, the Ramah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 557:1) states that it should only be recited in <i>Minchah</i>, just like עננו on fast days.<br>The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 557) quotes the custom of saying רחם in the Evening and Morning Prayers, and נחם during <i>Minchah</i>. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 557:1) rules that נחם should be recited in all three prayers of the day. This is the custom of Sephardim, though Ashkenazim follow the ruling of the Ramah mentioned above. (See the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 557:1.)<br>The Ramah explains that the rationale behind his decision is that the fire which destroyed the Temple broke out on the afternoon of the ninth of Av. Hence, we ask for comfort at that time specifically. Alternatively, the Ritba explains that only in the afternoon are we able to be comforted. Until then the pain of our loss is too real.</i>",

Rabbenu Asher (See <i>Tur</i> and <i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 117) raised the question of praying for rain in the summer in Spain or Germany when the climate of the land requires it. Similarly, since the crops in his area would be seriously damaged if rains were not to fall until late November, he lauds the practise (followed in Provence) which begins petitioning for rain in Marcheshvan. At present, the question has become more sensitive when many Jews live in the Southern hemisphere whose rainy season coincides with our summer.<br>Nevertheless, Rav Yosef Karo rules that all places outside of Eretz Yisrael should follow the practice observed in Babylonia. This position is accepted halachically. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim</i> 117:1 and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> which discusses this issue at length.)<br>One begins the petition for rain in the Evening Prayer of the sixtieth day (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, ibid.).

In regard to both these services, Deuteronomy 10:8 states: \"...To stand before God and serve Him\" (<i>Berachot</i> 30a, <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 98).<br>Indeed, the term <i>Amidah</i> - (lit. \"standing\") is used to refer to the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> because of this requirement.

The difference is that, in the <i>Shema</i>, intense concentration is only required when reciting the first verse, while the entire <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> should be recited with such intention.

After listing all the activities that are forbidden once <i>Minchah Gedolah</i> arrives, the Mishnah concludes: \"And if he starts, he need not stop.\"<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that this is the case only if he will be able to recite <i>Minchah</i> before the conclusion of the appropriate time. To emphasize this point, the Rambam mentions explicitly: \"and then recite <i>Minchah</i>\" - i.e., after he finishes doing whatever it is that he has started doing. However, if there will not be time to pray afterwards, he must stop and pray. Only then may he resume his activity.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 232:2, follows this interpretation of the Rambam and adds that if there will not be time afterwards, one must stop what he is doing immediately. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> points out that this means that even if it is still relatively early, if one is eating and expects the meal to continue until after the time of <i>Minchah</i>, he must stop immediately and pray, rather than wait until sometime later before the end of the day.</i>",

(<i>Shabbat</i> 9b) In his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam states that one who has put the cloth over his knees \"is prepared for a haircut.\" From that point on, even though no hair has actually been cut, he is considered involved in the haircut, so that he need not stop to pray.</i><br>When is the beginning of a bath?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., when is he considered to be bathing, so that he need not stop to pray?</i> When he takes off his underclothes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">literally, \"the garments next to his skin.\" This is based on the Rambam's interpetation of <i>Shabbat</i> 9b: \"When he removes his מעפרתו from himself.\" Rashi, in his commentary on that passage, offers a different interpretation - one's outermost garment, i.e., the first garment removed. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 232:2) rules in line with Rashi's position.</i><br>When is the beginning of [work in the] tanning house? When he ties the apron between his shoulders, as is the way of artisans.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shabbat</i> 9b states simply: \"When he ties between his shoulders.\" In his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam explains that it is when he ties his belt in order to work with the skins.

This is, however, hard to understand in light of his commentary here in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.</i><br>When is the beginning of eating? For those who live in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, it is when one washes his hands.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shabbat</i> 9b records a disagreement between Rav and Rabbi Chanina. Rav states that washing one's hands constitutes the beginning of eating, whereas Rabbi Chanina is of the opinion that loosening one's belt before eating is the beginning of the meal. The Talmud concludes that there is no real argument. Rav described the halachah for inhabitants of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, and Rabbi Chanina, for those of Babylonia.</i> For inhabitants of Babylonia, it is when they loosen their belts.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi explains that the custom in Babylonia was to wear their belts particularly tight, necessitating that they be loosened prior to eating. This was not the case in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<br>It is interesting to note that in his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam mentions only the halachah of washing one's hands. Since the Mishnah was written in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, its interpretation must be in line with the customs and realities of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. However, in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Rambam focuses on the actual halachah. Hence, he defines the beginning of eating in line with both positions, one relevant to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and the other to Babylonia.</i><br>When is the beginning of judgment?

Rather, the study of Torah is equal to all the other commandments, since study brings one to action. Therefore, study comes before action at all times.\"<br>A person involved in Torah study achieves a level of unity with God that is unparalleled by any other activity. One's intellect and God's wisdom become inextricably linked, until they are indistinguishable during the moments of one's actual involvement in study. On this basis, we can understand the description of Torah with the metaphor of bread (Proverbs 9:5, <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 4:13). After bread is consumed by a person, it becomes assimilated into his blood and becomes part of the person himself. Similarly, when Torah is studied, it becomes absorbed into the person's character and becomes an integral part of his being (<i>Tanya</i>, Chapter 5).<br>As explained in the introduction to this text, prayer focuses on our attempt to relate to the Godliness that permeates our worldly existence. Though this is an extremely significant service, the connection established through Torah study is more complete. Thus, <i>Shabbat</i> 10a records how Ravvah rebuked Rav Hamnuna for neglecting his Torah studies to prolong his prayers. By doing he was \"abandoning eternal life for transcient life.\" Therefore, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his colleagues whose commitment to Torah was all encompassing were not required to interrupt their studies for prayer.</i><br>Anyone involved in efforts for the welfare of the community is like one involved in Torah study.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., he can be compared to one whose full time occupation is the study of Torah. Therefore, he is exempt from the <i>Amidah</i> at that time.<br>This comparison of community work to the study of Torah is found in the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 5:1. However, there it is taught in the context of praying in the midst of words of Torah. (See Chapter 4, Halachah 18.) Community work is also considered like Torah, so that one may pray after such work and it is considered as if he prayed in the midst of words of Torah.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam derives this law from the continuation of the Talmudic passage (<i>Shabbat</i> 11a) cited above. The Talmud states that one involved in the decision of whether or not to proclaim a leap year (עיבור שנה) need not stop to pray, even though Torah study is not his full-time occupation. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> posits that the Rambam views involvement in עיבור שנה as community work.

Only a threat to one's very life is considered sufficient cause to interrupt the <i>Amidah</i>.</i> Even if the King of Israel greets him, he must not answer him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 29b) states: \"Even if the king greets him, he may not answer.\" The Talmud explains that this applies only to a Jewish king, but not to a foreign king. A Jewish king is expected to appreciate the seriousness of prayer and realize that a person's unwillingness to interrupt his prayers is not intended as an insult to the king's authority, but rather, submission to an even greater authority.<br>It is interesting to note that this halachah is taught in the Mishnah within the context of halachot stressing the serious nature of the <i>Amidah</i> and the high level of concentration necessary. Just as we learned that the level of intention necessary for the <i>Amidah</i> is greater than that necessary for <i>Kri'at Shema</i> (see Chapter 5, Halachah 8 and the commentary there), so too, the halachot regarding interruptions are stricter, as mentioned.</i> However, he may interrupt [to answer] a non-Jewish king, lest he<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">fail to understand the concept explained above and...</i> kill him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">as a rebel against the king.<br><i>Berachot</i> 32b-33a relates the following story which shows that the Sages did not always avail themselves of the leniency granted:<br>A righteous man was once praying on the road.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> also agrees with this explanation.<br>In Chapter 2, Halachot 2-3, the Rambam mentions the text for a shortened prayer. However, there is not necessarily a contradiction between this opinion and that law.</i> If unable to do so, he may stop.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Berachot</i> 32b offers these two alternatives.<br>Rabbenu Yonah maintains that if possible, one should move slightly in order to avoid confronting the king or tyrant, and thus avoid the need to talk.</i> Similarly, if one sees snakes or scorpions approaching him in a place where their bite is fatal, he should stop [praying] and flee. If they are not fatal, he should not stop.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 29b) states: \"...and even if there is a snake curled around his ankle, he should not interrupt [his <i>Amidah</i>].\" The Talmud (33a) mentions that a snake does not cause an interruption, but a scorpion does. Rashi explains that though snakes are not likely to bite, scorpions are likely to sting. Thus, the passage raises questions on the Rambam's decision, for he does not distinguish between snakes and scorpions.<br>The Rambam's statements appear to be based on the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 5:1, which states that one ignores a snake only if it is simply curling around his leg. However, were the snake to approach him in a menacing fashion, appearing likely to bite, he may flee from the snake.<br>It is important to note that there is no actual need to interrupt his <i>Amidah</i> in the case of the dangerous creatures. He need simply leave that spot, find a safe place and continue praying.<br><i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> points out that in all the cases mentioned, even if he did actually speak in the middle of <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, he need only start again at the beginning of the blessing in which he stopped. If, however, he interrupted himself during the first or last three blessings, he should return to the beginning of the beginning of the first of the three blessings.<br>The laws mentioned in this halachah are discussed in the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 104.</i>",

Some commentaries explain that this explanation would even be acceptable according to the Rambam. Though he holds that the <i>Amidah</i> is also a Torah obligation (see Chapter 1, Halachah 1), it is only necessary to pray once daily in order to fulfill one's Torah obligation. Therefore, one may be more lenient in granting an exemption from the <i>Amidah</i>, since the Torah obligation may have already been fulfilled or may be fulfilled by another <i>Amidah</i> later in the day.<br>However, the Rambam, himself, offers a different explanation in his commentary on the Mishnah.

Furthermore, in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 1:5, the Rambam writes that, unless a blessing follows another blessing, it must mention God's sovereignty over the world and no such mention is made in this blessing.<br>The <i>Meiri</i> in his commentary to <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) offers the following resolution to these difficulties: Despite the fact that the entire period of a person's sleep divides between the recitation of <i>hamapil</i> and <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i>, the sleep is not considered as an interruption and <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i> is considered as following directly after <i>hamapil</i>. Accordingly, it is not required to begin with <i>Baruch</i> or mention God's sovereignty.<br>Other commentaries who follow different halachic perspectives than the Rambam offer these resolutions:1) <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i> is a blessing of praise and prayer and does not require an opening phrase of blessing, in the same way that the blessing recited before travelling does not (<i>Tosafot, Pesachim</i> 104b).2) <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i> is generally recited immediately after the blessing of אשר יצר and therefore can be considered as a blessing which follows another blessing.</i> the soul that You have placed within me<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Each morning, we renew our thanks for the soul which God has returned to us, refreshed and revitalized.</i> is pure.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Despite his lowly physical state, man possesses an innate spirituality, a pure Godly soul, which is the source of all his positive actions and thoughts.</i> You have created it, You have formed it, You have breathed it into me<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The three verbs used in this blessing correspond to three different descriptions of the creation of man in the Torah:1) ויברא א-להים את האדם - \"And the Lord created man\" (Genesis 1:27). 2) א-להים את האדם וייצר ה' - \"And God, the Lord, formed man\" (Genesis 2:7). 3) ויפח באפיו נשמת חיים - \"And He blew into his nostrils the soul of life\" (<i>ibid.</i>).<br>These three verbs also relate to the three components of the soul, נפש, רוח, ונשמה (<i>Maharsha, 14Berachot</i> 60b).<br>In Kabbalah, the three verbs are understood as referring to the three worlds: עולם הבריאה - the world of creation, עולם היצירה - the world of form, and עולם העשיה - the world of physical action. The word טהרה - \"pure\" refers to עולם האצילות - the world of emanation, the highest of the four worlds.

The other blessings praise God for kindnesses enjoyed by all people. In contrast, these two blessings highlight actions performed by the Jewish people as an expression of modesty. The belt is intended to separate the heart from the lower half of the body (See <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 2:7 and 3:17). The covering of one's head signifies one's awareness of the Divine Presence, as stated above (See Halachah 4).<br>The <i>Avudraham</i> notes that this blessing is conceptually rooted in Jeremiah 12:11: \"'As a girdle clings to a man's loins so have I caused the whole of the House of Israel and the House of Judah to cleave unto Me,' says God; 'that they might be unto Me, a people, a name, a praise and a glory.'”</i> with strength.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Avodat Yitzchok</i> explains that a belt or girdle protects a person's body and affords him greater strength.

The Rambam's version is found in the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 9:2. Rabbenu Yitzchok Alfasi also follows the Jerusalem Talmud.<br>The <i>Levush, Orach Chayim</i> 46, explains the reason for reciting the blessing in the negative: <i>Eruvin</i> 13a states that it would have been better for man not to have been created than to have been created (i.e., man's soul was in a higher state before its descent into the world than it is while in this world). Therefore, we do not express thanks for being created. Nevertheless, having been created, we thank God for not creating us as gentiles since gentiles have a far lesser number of commandments to fulfill.<br>The <i>Bayit Chadash</i> explains that the negative formula was chosen for the following reason. Our Sages required that we recite three blessings each morning. Torah law states that whenever a single blessing covers two different circumstances, the second blessing may not be recited. Therefore, since a statement thanking God \"for making me a Jew\" would make the blessing for \"not making me a servant\" superfluous, it is preferable to recite this blessing using the negative formula.</i><br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has not made me a woman.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A woman is not obligated to fulfill all the positive mitzvot whose performance is limited to a specific time.

They consider these blessings to be ברכות שבח - \"blessings of praise\" for the goodness which God has granted the world as a whole and not thanks for benefit which one has derived as an individual.

The Ramah adds that the custom is to be very strict in this regard and not even to wash the eyes. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (basing himself on the <i>Bayit Chadash</i>) permits one to moisten his fingertips and clean the dirt from his eyes.

            "It is the custom of the people in the majority of our cities to recite these blessings one after another in the synagogue, whether or not they are obligated in them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This practice has its source in the opinions of the other Geonim mentioned above. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 46) explains the custom:<br>Since one's hand are not clean [upon rising], the [rabbis] instituted the practice of reciting the [blessings] in order in the synagogue. [Another reason for the institution of this practice is that] many of the common people do not know how to recite the [blessings] and when they are recited in the synagogue, they can answer \"Amen\" afterwards, and thus, fulfill their obligation.<br>This is a mistake and it is not proper to follow this practice. One should not recite a blessing unless he is obligated to. - The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam sees two difficulties in this practice:a) The blessings are not recited at their proper time, i.e., immediately after the action to which they are a response;b) In the synagogue, all the blessings are recited and it is improper to recite a blessing that one is not obligated to recite.<br>In answer to the first objection, Rabbenu Asher and Rabbenu Yonah explain that there is no problem with reciting these blessings after the actions to which they relate have been completed. The only blessings that must be recited in direct conjunction with the deed with which they are associated are those recited before fulfilling commandments. However, blessings of thanks or praise may be uttered later. This opinion is accepted by all Ashkenazic authorities.<br>Today, many people recite these blessings at home after washing and dressing. In certain communities, they are recited communally in the synagogue. In all cases, however, each individual who is able to read the blessings from a siddur or knows them by heart should recite the blessings himself every morning.</i><br>This is a mistake and it is not proper to follow this practice.

            "One who rises to study Torah, whether the Written or Oral Law,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is debate in the Talmud about this matter. Some Sages did not require the recitation of a blessing for the study of certain portions of the Oral Law (See <i>Berachot</i> 11b). Nevertheless, the decision quoted by the Rambam is accepted by all halachic authorities. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 47:2 explains the reason for this decision, \"They [all portions of the Oral Law] are all Torah and were given to Moses at Mount Sinai.\"</i> before he recites the <i>Shema</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Berachot</i> 11b states:<br>Once one has recited the <i>Shema</i>, he need not recite a blessing [for Torah study] since he has fulfilled his obligation with <i>Ahavah Rabbah</i> (the second blessing before the <i>Shema</i>).<br>This blessing praises God for teaching our ancestors \"the laws that bring eternal life\" and includes our prayers that He \"grant our hearts understanding... to learn and to teach... all the teachings of Your Torah.\" Therefore, <i>Ahavah Rabbah</i> is considered as comparableáto the blessings recited before Torah study (Rashi, <i>Berachot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>).<br>Rabbenu Asher quotes an opinion in the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 5:1) which states that the blessing of <i>Ahavah Rabbah</i> can replace the blessings before the study of the Torah only when one studies immediately after reciting the <i>Shema</i> and <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. The Ra'avad and the Rashba, however, maintain that the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> is also considered as Torah study. Therefore, if one recites the <i>Shema</i> after <i>Ahavah Rabbah</i>, one is considered to have fulfilled his obligation.<br>The Rambam appears to follow the latter opinion, however, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47:8) accepts Rabbenu Asher's view.<br>should wash his hands beforehand, - to fulfill the obligation of נטילת ידים upon rising in the morning.</i> should wash his hands beforehand, recite [the following] three blessings, and then study.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Both here and in Halachah 11, the Rambam states that one must study immediately after reciting these blessings.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>,:9) warns against making such an interruption.<br>[The comparison of the blessings before Torah study to the blessings of the mitzvot is not universally accepted. In addition to the opinion of the Ramban mentioned in the following halachah, the <i>Levush</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47) compares the blessings before Torah study to the blessings recited before partaking of food. Just as one thanks God for the satisfaction granted from food and other physical things, one blesses Him for the satisfaction derived from Torah study.

Therefore, since this paragraph does not begin \"Blessed are You...,\" it appears to be a continuation of the first blessing and not a blessing of its own. The <i>vav</i> - \"and\" - indicates the connection between the two paragraphs.<br>The Rambam, however, clearly states that the second paragraph is considered as a blessing in its own right and not a continuation of the first blessing. The <i>vav</i> would, therefore, appear to be superfluous. Though most printed texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> include a <i>vav</i>, the authoritative Oxford manuscript of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Yemenite manuscripts, and the Ramah's text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> all lack a <i>vav</i>.

However, in his responsa, the Rambam suggests a different conclusion for this blessing: \"Blessed are You, God, the Giver of the Torah.\" He explains the reasons why he favors the latter version:<br>This [wording] alludes to our recognition that God gave us the Torah so that we will learn to do everything it states. [The blessing is a request] that He open our hearts to the study of Torah, for this was the reason it was given to us as a heritage.However, to conclude [the blessing with] \"who teaches Torah...\" is incorrect, for God... does not teach us the Torah.

Our Sages clarified that statement, explaining that it means that the people would study Torah without reciting the blessings before it. A person who studies Torah without reciting the blessings fails to realize its holiness and sanctity, therefore, it is considered as if he \"\"forsook the Torah.''</i>",
            "One is obligated to recite these three blessings<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The nature of this obligation is debated among the commentaries. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47) and others understand the Rambam as considering these blessings similar to any other blessing recited before the performance of a mitzvah and hence, of Rabbinic origin.<br>Nevertheless, <i>Berachot</i> 21a and <i>Yoma</i> 37a state that the obligation to recite a blessing on Torah study stems from the Torah itself. In keeping with this view, the Ramban (<i>Hosafot</i> to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, positive commandment 15) reckons the recitation of the blessings of the Torah as a separate mitzvah.</i> every day.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Perhaps with the words \"every day,\" the Rambam is implying that these blessings should be recited even if one does not sleep at night. See <i>Magen Avraham</i> 47:11.<br>The blessings are recited only once a day. In contrast to the blessings recited over other mitzvot, even if one interrupts his study and occupies himself with other matters, one need not recite a second blessing. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 4:7 gives two reasons for this difference:1) The blessings before the Torah resemble the other morning blessings. A person enjoys the benefits associated with the morning blessings intermittently throughout the day, yet he only recites the blessings once in the morning. Similarly, though one may study at several different occasions in a single day, the blessings are recited only once daily.2) The obligation to study Torah is incumbent upon one throughout the entire day and, at all times, one's attention should be on one's studies.</i> Afterwards, one should read a few words of Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If these blessings are comparable to other blessings recited before the performance of mitzvot, the mitzvah (studying Torah) must also be fulfilled immediately after the recitation of the blessing (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> [To fulfill this obligation,] the people adopted the custom of reading the Priestly Blessing.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Priestly Blessing is found in Numbers 6:22-27. <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 11b) also mentions the custom of reciting the Priestly Blessing each morning and Rav Amram Gaon includes the Priestly Blessing in his siddur.<br>The <i>Avudraham</i> mentions that the recitation of these verses arouses Divine blessing for the Jewish people. The <i>Even Yarchi</i> notes that the verses of the Priestly Blessing contain 60 letters, corresponding to the 60 tractates in the Talmud.</i> In certain places, they recite [the passage, (Numbers 28: 1-9)]: \"Command the children of Israel...,\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These verses describe the morning sacrifice offered daily in the Holy Temple. The <i>Machzor Vitri</i> (an early siddur of French origin) does not include the Priestly Blessing and mentions these verses instead.</i> and there are places where they read both of them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Order of the Prayers for the Entire Year found at the conclusion of <i>Sefer Ahavah</i>, the Rambam includes both these passages, with the verses describing the sacrifices preceding the Priestly Blessings.<br>The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47:9) both understand the Priestly Blessing to be a fulfillment of the requirement to study Torah after the blessings. The verses of the Daily Sacrifice are recited later, with the intention that our recitation of these verses will compensate for our inability to actually offer these sacrifices (<i>Ta'anit</i> 27b, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 48).</i><br>Also, [it is proper] to read chapters or laws from the Mishnah and the <i>Beraitot</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">so that we will have studied passages from the written law, the Mishnah, and the Talmud and thus, emphasize how our obligation to study Torah applies to all three. Note <i>Kiddushin</i> 30a and <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 1:11, which advises one to divide his Torah study, a third in the Written Law, a third in Mishnah and a third in Talmud.<br>In his Order of Prayers, the Rambam lists the following passages from the oral law after the the Priestly Blessings:<br>These are the precepts for which no fixed limit is prescribed: <i>Pe'ah</i> (the corners of the field left unharvested for the needy, Leviticus 23:22 , <i>Bikkurim</i> (the first fruits, Exodus 23:19 , <i>HaRei'on</i> (the pilgrimage offerings, Deuteronomy 16:16-17), acts of kindness and the study of Torah. [A Mishnah, <i>Pe'ah</i> 1:1.]These are the precepts, the fruits of which a person enjoys in this world, while the principle remains [for him] in the world to come: Honoring one's mother and father, acts of kindness, concentration during prayer, visiting the sick, waking early to go to the study hall, hospitality to guests, bringing peace between man and his fellow man, and the study of Torah, which is equivalent to them all. [A <i>beraita</i>, <i>Shabbat</i> 127a]Rav Zeira says: \"Jewish women imposed a stringent practice upon themselves.

(Note the statement of Rabbi Simlai, <i>Berachot</i> 32a, which suggests praising God before reciting the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>.) Though from the passage from <i>Shabbat</i> quoted below one might infer that the recitation of these verses was instituted later, perhaps this refers to the designation of the specific verses to be recited, while the practice of reciting verses itself had already existed.</i> those who recite songs from the Book of Psalms every day; from \"A song of praise by David...

Therefore, our custom is to recite these blessings standing (<i>Or Zerua</i>).<br>The <i>Pri Chadash</i> takes issue with this view and maintains that these blessings were instituted by the <i>Geonim</i> after the conclusion of the Talmud. Though the <i>Or Zerua's</i> opinion is based only on \"tradition,\" the fact that the Jerusalem Talmud refers to these blessings, as mentioned below, indicates that they were recited during the Talmudic era.</i><br>They instituted a blessing before the [recitation of the] songs, <i>Baruch She'amar</i>..., and a blessing after [concluding] them, <i>Yishtabach</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> explain that the blessings, <i>Baruch She'amar</i> and <i>Yishtabach</i> are considered a single unit.

Accordingly, it does not begin \"Blessed are You, God....\"<br>Though the verses of פסוקי דזמרא are not considered an interruption between the blessings, idle conversation certainly would be.

            "What is implied by [the term,] communal prayer? One [person] prays aloud and all [the others] listen.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With this statement, the Rambam touches on a point debated both by the Sages of the Talmud and the later Rabbis. The mishnah, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 33b, states:<br>Just as the leader of the congregation is obligated [to pray], each individual is obligated. Rabban Gamliel states: \"The leader of the congregation fulfills the obligation on behalf of the community.\"<br>The Talmud (34b) elaborates on the difference of opinion:<br>They asked Rabban Gamliel: \"According to your opinion, why does the community pray?\"He replied: \"In order to allow the leader of the community to prepare his prayers.\"Rabban Gamliel asked them: \"According to your opinion, why does the leader of the congregation pray aloud?\"They replied: \"In order to allow those who are not knowledgeable to fulfill their obligation.\"He told them: \"Just as he fulfills the obligation on behalf of those who are not knowledgeable, he fulfills it on behalf of those who are knowledgeable.\"<br>The Sages of the Talmud continued to debate the issue. The ultimate decision accepted by Rav Yitzchok Alfasi, the Rambam (See Halachah 9), and Rabbenu Asher, is that during the entire year, the Sages' opinion is accepted. However, on Rosh HaShanah, because of the complexity of the blessings (See Halachah 10), Rabban Gamliel's opinion prevails.<br>Both Rabban Gamliel and the Sages agree that the practice of communal prayer involves two elements:a) the silent prayers of many individuals; andb) the <i>chazan's</i> repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>.They differ, however, as to which of these elements is considered of primary importance. According to the Sages, the essential element of communal prayer is that ten or more people recite the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> at the same time. According to Rabban Gamliel, the essential element of communal prayer is, as the Rambam states in this halachah, the prayer of the leader of the congregation.<br>[Note <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 24, which explains that their difference of opinion revolves around a more general issue: Which is of higher priority, quantity (the prayers of the many) or quality (the prayers of the leader of the congregation)?]<br>The Rambam's statement here is difficult to place in perspective. Though in Halachah 9, he accepts the Sages' view (See also Chapter 9, Halachot 2-3) in this halachah, his opinion follows that of Rabban Gamliel. In one of his responsa, the Rambam explains that after the Sages instituted the silent <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> to allow the leader of the congregation to prepare his prayers, even Rabban Gamliel would agree that all the individuals praying in a <i>minyan</i> also fulfill their obligation to pray by reciting their own prayers. Still it is difficult to understand why the Rambam would have the individuals forfeit the higher quality of communal prayer in order to pray individually.<br>In his notes to <i>Rosh HaShanah</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, Rav Chayim Soloveichik writes that to take into consideration the Rambam's statements in this halachah, after concluding his individual prayers, each person should stand and listen to the prayer of the leader of the congregation and thus, fulfill the mitzvah of communal prayer. Note <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, which compares answering to the <i>chazan's</i> prayer to reciting a voluntary prayer (See Chapter 1, Halachah 9).

The <i>Ramah</i> adds that under extraordinary circumstances, a minor may be counted.

However, the Rambam's opinion is universally accepted as halachah.<br>Similarly, we should not recite Kedushah, - See Chapter 7, Halachah 17.<br>In the <i>chazan's</i> repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, it is customary to recite three verses in the <i>Kedushah</i>:a) \"Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Hosts; the entire earth is full of His glory\" (Isaiah 6:3 ;b) \"Blessed be the glory of God from His place\" (Ezekiel 3:12 ;c) \"The Lord shall reign forever, your God, O Zion, throughout all generations\" (Psalms 146:10 .<br>Only the first two of these verses are recited in the <i>Kedushah</i> of the blessings before the <i>Shema</i>. However, in the<i>Kedushah</i> recited at the end of the service, a verse similar to Psalms 146:10 is also included.<br>The commentaries debate the definition of <i>Kedushah</i> and therefore, question which passage the Rambam requires to be omitted when one prays alone. The Rambam's statements in Chapter 9, Halachah 5, appear to define <i>Kedushah</i> as only the first of these three verses.</i><br>Similarly, we should not recite <i>Kedushah</i>, read the Torah with its blessings<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., the reading of the Torah as part of the prayer service.

Nevertheless, in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 153:9), Rav Yosef Karo mentions a latrine, but not a laundry.<br>The sanctity of the synagogue is transferred to the money received from its sale and the building itself is no longer considered as \"holy.\" Nonetheless, using the premises for such purposes is considered degrading.<br>As support for the prohibition against using premises that had previously served as a synagogue for such purposes, the <i>Or Sameach</i> cites II Chronicles 8:11: \"I will not have a woman dwelling in the house of David... for the [places] where the ark of God has come are holy.\" Although the ark had already been placed in the Temple, it was not becoming to the ark for Pharaoh's daughter to be allowed to live in a place where it had been kept.</i><br>If, at the time of the sale, the seven officials of the community<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In a responsum, the Rambam explains that there is no obligation to appoint seven officials to lead the community.

When it is sold in this manner, it can be \"used even as a tavern.\"<br>The Meiri explains the rationale for this decision as follows: Even if an explicit statement was not made to the effect that the synagogue could be used for an unbecoming purpose, it is understood that the village's inhabitants consecrated the synagogue with the understanding that it be subject to the decisions of the community's officials. Therefore, they have the right to sell the synagogue for whatever purposes they wish.<br>The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's decision and maintains that the license granted by <i>Megillah</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) only applies to the money received from the sale, while the building that was used as a synagogue can never be used for a purpose which is unbecoming. Though the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) quotes the Rambam's view, the <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> suggests following the Ra'avad's decision, quoting the law (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 21:2), which forbids using a <i>tallit</i> for an unbecoming purpose even after its <i>tzitzit</i> have been removed.<br>Rav Moshe Feinstein (Responsa, <i>Orach Chayim</i>, Vol. II, 45) mentions this halachah in regard to the sale of synagogues in neighborhoods where Jews no longer live. Unfortunately, the natural clients for the purchase of an abandoned synagogue are churches. Rav Moshe states that selling a synagogue for use as a church is definitely forbidden. Using a synagogue for such purposes is more demeaning than using it for the purposes mentioned by the Talmud. He maintains that even according to the Rambam, selling a synagogue for this purpose could not be permitted.</i>",

These authorities do not accept the Rambam's interpretation of <i>Megillah</i> 26a-b mentioned in the previous Halachah, and maintain that a certain measure of sanctity always remains in the synagogue. The Rambam maintains that the sanctity is transferred to the money received for the synagogue. Therefore, the condition made by the city officials can never effect the entire sum of money. Rather, the major portion must always be used for a sacred object.<br>[Interestingly, in his <i>Kessef Mishnah</i>, Rav Yosef Karo points out the advantages of the Rambam's position.

He explains that, in his age, the custom of translating the Torah had already been ceased because the people did not understand the Aramaic translation traditionally used. The rabbis did not want to translate the Torah into the languages which the people did understand, because of the possibility of error and misinterpretation. Such fears had not existed in regard to the Aramaic translation, since it had been composed with <i>Ruach Hakodesh</i> (Divine inspiration).<br>[The <i>Tur</i>, however, also mentions the opinion of Rav Natrunai Gaon, who maintains that the translation should be done freely, so that the people can understand, without referring to the traditional text.]<br>The <i>Tur</i>'s opinion is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 145:3) and in nearly all contemporary Jewish communities, the custom of using a translator during the Torah reading is no longer practiced. For this reason, rather than present a running commentary on Halachot 11 and 12, we have limited our comments to short footnotes.1. <i>Berachot</i> 45a states that this principle is derived from the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai. God, \"the Reader,\" did not lift his voice over that of Moses, \"the translator.\"<br>It was also customary to use a מתורגמן in teaching the oral law. Hence, parallels to many of the laws mentioned in this halachah can also be found in <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 4:3.2. The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Megillah</i> 4:1) mentions that we should approach the Torah reading with awe, reflecting the awe experienced by the Jews at Mount Sinai.3. Rabbenu Nissim maintains that this prohibition only applied before Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi permitted the oral tradition to be recorded. Afterwards, it was permitted for the translator to use a written text. Rabbenu Nissim's position is somewhat difficult to accept, since the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Megillah</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>), the source for this law, was written several hundred years after Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi granted this leniency. Nevertheless, Rabbenu Nissim's view was widely accepted.4. The <i>Tosefta, Megillah</i> 3:21, cites the example of Aharon, who served as a spokesman for Moses. See also <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.5. Genesis 35:22. The direct translation of this verse would be unbecoming to both Reuven and Jacob (Rashi, <i>Megillah</i> 25a).6. The third of the priestly blessings states: \"May God turn His countenance to you....\" This appears to be a direct contradiction to the description of God (Deuteronomy 10:17  as \"not turning His face....\" Though our Sages resolved that difficulty (<i>Berachot</i> 20b), a problem might come up in a simple translation of the verse.<br>Rav Kapach notes that the Yemenite texts of Targum Onkelos lack a translation for the three verses of the priestly benediction.7. Were the common people given the opportunity of hearing the full story of the golden calf, they might believe that it had spiritual power (Rashi, <i>loc. cit.</i>). Alternatively, the narrative places a major burden of responsibility on Aharon (<i>Tosafot, Megillah</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).8. The commentaries note that this passage is not read as a <i>haftarah</i> at present. Rav Kapach states that the need to make this statement indicates that in Talmudic times, the passages that were read as haftarot were not fixed and there was some room for choice.9.

Nevertheless, he should not recite \"Amen,\" because he may become confused and begin reading the wrong blessing to the priests.<br>Note that in Chapter 15, Halachah 10, the Rambam writes that if the <i>chazan</i> is the only priest present in a community, he should not bless the people, lest he become confused and err in his prayers. However, if he is sure that he will not make a mistake, he may bless the people. In the present halachah, the Rambam does not make such an allowance.<br>Perhaps the difference is that in Chapter 15, there is the possibility that the recitation of the priestly blessing will be nullified entirely. Hence, greater leniency is shown. In this halachah, the congregation as a whole will not suffer if the <i>chazan</i> does not respond \"Amen\" to the priests' blessings. Though the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i> 128:19) quotes the Rambam's decision, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (128:31) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (128:71) state that particularly at present, when the blessings are recited from a siddur, the <i>chazan</i> should respond Amen.</i>",

Rather, another member of the congregation should call the priests.<br>The Rambam addresses himself to this question in one of his responsa and explains that there is nothing wrong with another member of the congregation calling the priests. However, there is no obligation to have this done. Since calling the priests is a necessary element of the repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, it is not considered an interruption to the <i>chazan's</i> prayers.

There, the Levites would stand and accompany the Temple service with songs and music. No mention is made of the priests standing there. Also, in Halachah 14, the Rambam mentions that the priests would bless the people while standing on the steps of the Temple building.<br>The Radbaz (Vol. II, <i>Leshonot HaRambam</i>) offers a resolution to this difficulty, noting that priests with disqualifying physical deformities may not stand on the Temple steps (<i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 7:20). Thus, the majority of priests would stand on the Temple steps, and those with deformities would stand on the <i>duchan</i>.<br>The <i>Tiferet Yisrael</i> (<i>Middot</i> 2:4) states that most of the priests would stand on the Temple steps.

The Ramah differs and states that it is Ashkenazic practice that this word is also recited in response to the <i>chazan</i>.</i><br>A priest who does not move from his place to ascend to the <i>duchan</i> when the leader of the congregation recites [the blessing] <i>R'tzey<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 14, Halachah 3.</i></i> should not ascend [to the <i>duchan</i>] during that prayer service.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This applies even if he was prevented from leaving his place by forces beyond his control (Radbaz, <i>Magen Avraham</i>).</i> However, if he moved [from his place], even though he did not reach the <i>duchan</i> until after the [conclusion of the blessing <i>R'tzey</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 128:13 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 128:27 state that even if he reaches the <i>duchan</i> after the <i>chazan</i> completes <i>R'tzey</i>, as long as he reaches there before the priests begin reciting the blessing, he may join them.</i> he may<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">but he is not obligated to (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 128:106).</i> ascend [the <i>duchan</i>] and bless [the people].",
            "Any priest who does not ascend to the <i>duchan</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">even though he neglects [the performance] of [only] one commandment - is considered as if he violated three positive commandments, as Numbers 6:23-27 states: “This is how you shall bless the children of Israel,” “Say to them,” “And you shall set My name...” - The Rambam's statements are based on <i>Sotah</i> 38b. There, the Talmud states that one “violates three positive commandments.” The Rambam amends that statement, explaining that although there is only one commandment for the priests to bless the people, the Torah mentioned the commandment in three different ways to emphasize the importance of its fulfillment. Thus, the failure to bless the people is considered as nullifying the observance of three commands.<br>In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>Shoresh</i> 9), the Rambam cites this teaching as a classic example of a fundamental principle regarding the reckoning of the 613 mitzvot. Though the Talmud often states that many mitzvot are involved in the performance or transgression of a particular commandment, this does not mean that the mitzvah should be counted as more than one mitzvah when calculating the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. Rather, the Talmud means to say that the performance of this mitzvah is considered as important as if many mitzvot were involved.</i> - even though he neglects [the performance] of [only] one commandment - is considered as if he violated three positive commandments, as [Numbers 6:23-27] states: \"This is how you shall bless the children of Israel,\" \"Say to them,\" \"And you shall set My name...\"<br>Any priest who does not recite the priestly blessing will not be blessed, and any priest who blesses [the people] will be blessed, as [Genesis 12:3] states: \"And I will bless those who bless you.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Chulin</i> 49a quotes a difference of opinion between Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva's statements are quoted by the Rambam, while Rabbi Yishmael explains that the blessing for the priests is derived from Numbers 6:27: “And you will set My name upon the children of Israel and I will bless them.” “The priests bless the Jews and God blesses the priests,... together with the Jews” (Rashi).<br>By quoting the verse from Genesis, “and I will bless those who bless you,” Rabbi Akiva emphasizes that the blessings bestowed upon the priests - as well as the blessing conveyed by the priests - stem from God's infinite goodness (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 10).<br>Blessed be the Merciful One who grants assistance.</i>"
