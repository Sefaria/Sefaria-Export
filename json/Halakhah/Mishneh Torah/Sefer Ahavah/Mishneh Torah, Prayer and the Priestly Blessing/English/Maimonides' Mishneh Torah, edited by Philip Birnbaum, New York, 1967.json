            "When the Jewish people were exiled in the days of wicked Nebuchadnezzar, they mixed with Persians, Greeks and other nationalities. Children were born to them in foreign lands. The language of these children was confused, a mixture of many languages. They were unable to express themselves adequately and accurately in any one language, as it is written: \"Their children spoke half in the tongue of Ashdod; they could not speak Hebrew, nor any foreign tongue\" (Nehemiah 13:24). When anyone of them prayed, his Hebrew vocabulary was too limited to express his needs or to praise God without mixing Hebrew with other tongues. When Ezra and his council took notice of this, they instituted the Eighteen Benedictions in their present order: the first three contain praise to God; the last three, thanksgiving; the intermediate benedictions contain petitions for the most essential needs of the individual and the community. They were to be set on everyone's lips and learned, so that the men of inarticulate speech might offer prayer as clearly as those who speak an eloquent Hebrew. For this reason they instituted all other blessings and prayers which are arrayed on the lips of all Israel, to make each blessing readily available to one who is unfamiliar with the language."
