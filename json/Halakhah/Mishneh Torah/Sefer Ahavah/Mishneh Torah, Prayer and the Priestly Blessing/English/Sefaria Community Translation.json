            "It is a positive commandment to pray every day, as it is written: \"You shall serve the Lord your God\" (Ex. 23:25).  By tradition, they learned that this service is prayer, as it says: \"and to worship God with all of your heart\" (Deut. 11:13)—the sages said what is worship of the heart? This is prayer.  The number of prayers is not biblical, the form of prayer is not biblical, and prayer has no biblically fixed time.",
            "Therefore, women and slaves are obligated in prayer because it is a positive commandment lacking a fixed time, but the obligation of this commandment is as follows: a person should supplicate and pray every day and relate the praise of God, and afterwards ask for their needs as a request and a supplication, and afterwards give praise and thanks to God for the good that has been bestowed upon them, each person according to their ability.",
            "If one is accustomed/fluent, he increases in supplications and petitions, and if one has uncircumcised lips, he speaks according to his ability and anytime he likes. And so, the number of prayers is as each to their own abilities. There are some who pray once a day, and there are those who pray many times. And everyone would pray facing the Temple. And this was the way of things from the time of Moses to Ezra. ",
            "When Israel was dispersed in the days of Nebudchadnezzar the evil, they were in foreign lands and they had children in the foreign lands and their children spoke babble. And everyone’s language was this one and this one and languages were very mixed. And since the speaker was not able to speak all, they needed one language, rather that they should be confused. As it is said: “And half their children spoke in the language of Ashdod, etc” [Nehemiah 13:24]. And none knew how to speak “Yehudit” and spoke the language of the people. And because of this, when one prayed, his tongue was shortened to ask for his needs, or to give praise to the HKBH in the holy language until that their tongues were mixed up. And when Ezra and his Beit Din saw this was, they rose and instituted for themselves the 18 blessings in the order of three first praises to HaShem, and three last thanksgivings, and the middle there were in them requests on all the things that are like the foundations of every person’s desires/needs, man to man. And the needs of the community should be set in the mouths of all and they will learn them. And there will be a prayer, even the stutterers will pray wholly like the prayers of the smooth talkers, because this matter was set, all the blessings and prayers were ordered in the mouths of all Israel so that the whole matter was set in the mouths of the stutterer. ",
            "And so, they decreed that the number of prayers should be like the number of offerings: two prayers each day, corresponding to the two continual offerings. And for every day that has an additional offering, they decreed a third prayer, corresponding to the additional offering. And the prayer that corresponds to the morning continual offering is called \"the dawn prayer,\" the prayer that corresponds to the afternoon continual offering is called \"the gift prayer,\" and the prayer that corresponds to the additional offerings is called \"the additional offerings prayer.\"",
            "And so, they decreed that a person pray one prayer at night, as the limbs of the afternoon continual offering would continue to be consumed all night. As it says (Leviticus 6:2), \"it is that which goeth up ...,\" along the lines of what it says (Psalms 55:18): \"Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I complain, and moan; And He hath heard my voice.\" But the evening prayer is not obligatory like the dawn and gift prayers, but even so, all of Israel, in all of their places of residence, are accustomed to pray the evening prayer, and they accepted it upon themselves like an obligatory prayer.",
            "They also established a prayer after the afternoon prayer, just before sunset, only on the day of the fast [of Yom Kippur], in order to increase in pleading and supplication on account of the fast. This prayer is known as <i>Ne'ila</i> (\"closing\"), that is, [it refers to] the closing gates of Heaven as the sun sets, since it is only ever recited just before sunset. ",
            "In conclusion, we now have three daily prayers, <i>Aravit, Shacharit and Mincha</i>, and on Shabbat and festivals we have four - the three daily prayers and the additional <i>Mussaf</i> prayer. On Yom Kippur we have five - the four aforementioned prayers and the concluding <i>Ne'ila</i>. ",
            "One may not subtract from this [number of] prayers, but if one wishes, one may add to them. One can even pray all day long, if one so desires. These additional prayers are comparable to voluntary sacrifices [offered at the Temple], and one must therefore make an innovation in each of the middle blessings [of the Amidah], paraphrasing the [original] blessing. Even if one makes an innovation in a single blessing, this is sufficient to show that it is a voluntary prayer, rather than an obligatory one. Yet the first three and last three [blessings] are never added to or subtracted from, and nothing in them is to be changed. ",
            "A voluntary prayer may not be recited by a community, just as the voluntary sacrifice was never a public one. Similarly, an individual may not pray the Mussaf prayer twice, once to fulfil his obligation and the other voluntarily, since the Mussaf sacrifice was not offered voluntarily. In addition, some of the Geonim ruled that additional prayers were not to be recited on Shabbat and festivals, since voluntary sacrifices were not offered on those days, but rather only the obligated offerings of that day.

            "In the days of Rabban Gamliel, the number of heretics increased in Israel and they caused trouble to Israel and incited people away from [service of] God. And when he saw that this [problem] was larger than all other needs of the people, he and his court established a blessing in which there is a request before God to destroy the heretic, and they added it to the prayers so that everyone would be fluent in it. With this addition, the number of blessings in the prayer [amida] is 19.",
            "At every prayer each day, one says nineteen blessings in the proper order. When does this apply? When one can concentrate properly and is able to read at a brisk pace. However if one was distracted or pressed, or if he had trouble speaking, he should say the first three blessings, and one in the middle with elements of all the middle blessings, and the three blessings at the end and he fulfills his obligation.

Before we call, may You answer, as it says (Isiah 65:24) 'And it shall be that before they call I will answer, while they are still talking I will listen', for you answer at all times, redeem and save from every trouble. Blessed are You, Lord, Who listens to prayer.",

And also after the sabbath or festivals, one may not say \"grant us understanding\" since we need to say havdalah in the blessing of \"you grant us wisdom\".",
            "And on Shabbat and holidays, there are seven blessings in each and every one of the four prayers of the day. Three at the beginning, and three at the end, and one in the middle which contains elements of the day.  On Shabbat the middle blessing ends with \"who sanctifies the sabbath\". On the festivals it ends with \"who sanctifies Israel and the festivals.\" And if it is both shabbat and a festival, it ends with \"who sanctifies the sabbath, and Israel, and the festivals.\" On Rosh Hashanah it ends with \"King of the universe, who sanctifies Israel and the day of remembrance.\" And if it was also the sabbath, it ends with \"King of the universe, who sanctifies the sabbath and Israel and the day of remembrance.\"",
            "When does this apply? At the evening, morning, and afternoon prayers. But at the Musaf prayer on Rosh Hashana, one says nine blessings: the first three and last three the same as every day, and three middle blessings. The first of the middle blessings describes kingship, the second remembrances, and the third shofar. And each of these ends with a blessing relating to its topic.",
            "On Yom Kippur every one of the five prayers has seven blessings. The first three and last three and one in the middle relating to the day.

On the fast day of a every year, except on the fast day of the jubilee year the musaf prayer as nine blessings, like the mufar prayer on Rosh Hashana, and they are they same blessings, not less and not more, and we only say these prayers during the times when we observe the jubilee.

            "On Rosh Chodesh and on the intermediate days of a festival [Chol HaMoed] one prays the evening, morning and afternoon prayers with nineteen blessings like the rest of the days, but adds in [the blessing of temple] service \"Our Lord and Lord of our fathers, may it rise up and come before you etc.\" And in Musaf of the intermediate festival days pray Musaf like on the festival. And [for Musaf] on Rosh Chodesh one says seven blessings: the first three and the last three, and one in the middle relating to the sacrifices of Rosh Chodesh, and ends the blessing with \"who sanctifies Israel and new months\".",
            "When shabbat falls in Chol HaMoed, and also when Rosh Chodesh is on shabbat, one says the seven blessings of shabbat like normal at the evening, morning, and afternoon prayers, but adds \"Our Lord and Lord of our fathers, may it rise up and come before you etc.\" in [the blessing of temple] service. And in Musaf one begins the middle blessing on the topic of shabbat, and finishes with shabbat, and says the holiness of the day in the middle of the blessing, and ends with the new month, \"who sanctifies the sabbath and Israel and new months\". And on Chol HaMoed one ends the same way one ends on the festivals that fall on shabbat. ",

            "On Chanukah and Purim, we add \"for the miracles\" into the blessing of thanks. On shabbat during Chanukah, one says \"for the miracles\" in Musaf the same way it is said in all other prayers. ",

And the leader of the congregation says it as a blessing on its own, between \"redeem\" and \"heal\", and ends [the standalone blessing] \"He who responds in a time of trouble (and saves).\" Thus he prayers twenty blessings.  On the ninth day of [the month of] Av, insert into \"He who builds Jerusalem\" the following: \"have mercy Lord our God on us and on your people Israel and on Jerusalem your city and on the city of mourning etc.\"",

And if one transgressed or erred and prayed after the fourth hour but before midday, one fulfilled the obligation of prayer. However, one did not fulfill the obligation of prayer in its proper time. Since just as prayer is a commandment from the Torah, so too it is a rabbinic commandment to pray at the proper time, as instituted by the sages and prophets.",

And since the afternoon tamid offering was offered each day at nine-and-a-half hours [into the day], they established the time [for mincha] beginning at nine-and-a-half hours, and this time is called Mincha Ketana [lit. small mincha]. And since on the eve of Passover, if it falls on Friday, they would slaughter the Tamid at six-and-a-half hours, they said that one who prays after six-and-a-half hours fulfills one's obligation.

However, if one does pray during minchah Gedolah as his obligatory prayer, then he should only pray during minchah ketanah the optional prayer. ",
