Anyone who does this, and other things like this, strengthens the hands of transgressors and [doing so] transgresses \"do not put a stumbling block in front of  the blind\" (Lev. 19:14)",

And if he is established, and strict with himself, he returns [the things] to the original owners.",
            "When is the previous case applicable? When the tax collector is like a robber, like when an idolater or the tax collector that is standing above him or the one sent by the king, and there is no limit, rather, he takes as much as he wants and gives [to the king] as much as he wants. But the tax established by the king, and is he said he should take a third or a fourth, or any amount with a limit. And [if] he appoints a Jew to collect this part for the king and it is known that this person is trustworthy, and he does not add anything over what the king has decreed, he is not under the assumption that he is a robber, since the law of the king is law. Not only that, but one who transgresses and smuggles from this tax is stealing from the king, whether the king is an idolater or a Jewish king.",
            "And so too a king who put a tax over the inhabitants of a city, or over each and every person, a predictable thing of every year; or over a field, something predictable. Or if he decreed that everyone who passes over this thing, all his possessions will be taken to the house of the king. Or that every person who is found in the field at the time of working the threshing floor will pay a tax whether he is or not the owner of the field - and all cases similar: this is not theft, and a Jew that is collecting those for the king is not under the assumption of being a thief, and he is a \"kosher\" person - provided that he does not add, nor change, nor get anything for himself.",
            "",
            "The general principle is: Any law that a king decrees to be universally applicable, and not merely applying to one person, is not considered robbery. But whenever he takes from one person alone in a manner that does not conform to a known law, but rather seizes the property from the person arbitrarily, it is considered to be robbery. Therefore, the king's dues collectors and his officers that sell fields with a defined tax on the fields, their sale is valid. But a personal tax is only collected from the person himself, and if they sold the field with a personal tax, behold this is not a valid sale unless the king has decreed that it is.",

So too if he destroyed homes to make a path or a wall, one is allowed to benefit from it. And so it is for all similar circumstances, for the king's law is the law.",
            "In what instances does this principle [the king's law is the law] apply? When the king's coins are accepted throughout those lands [under his control], for the residents of that country have agreed to him and have accepted that he is their master and they are to him as slaves. But if his coins do not circulate, he is like a robber by force and like a band of armed thieves whose laws are not enforced, and such a king and all his servants are considered thieves in all matters."

This applies whether or not it has a mark by which it can be identified. The rationale is that perhaps the owner of the article left it there until he returns.

Therefore, it is forbidden for the finder to touch it, unless it appears to have fallen.
