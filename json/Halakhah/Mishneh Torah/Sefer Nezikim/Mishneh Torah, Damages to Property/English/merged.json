            "If any living creature under a man's control caused damage, the owner of the animal must compensate, because the injury was occasioned by his chattel, as it is written: \"If a man's ox hurt the ox of another man…\" (Exodus 21:35), implying not only domestic animals but also wild beasts and birds. In using the term <i>ox</i>, the Torah merely speaks of a common occurrence.",
            "How much must the owner compensate? If the animal occasioned damage by doing habitual things within its nature, as when it ate straw or hay or inflicted injury with its foot in the course of walking, the owner must pay full compensation with the best of his estate, as it is written: \"He shall make restitution with the best of his own field and the best of his own vineyard\" (Exodus 22:4). If, however, the animal acted strangely and did things that were not habitual, as when an ox gored or bit, the owner has to pay only half-damages from the body of the injurious animal itself, as it is written: \"They shall sell the live ox and divide the money\" (Exodus 21:35).",
            "Accordingly, if an ox worth one hundred denars gored an ox worth twenty and killed it, and the carcass is worth four, the owner of the goring ox has to pay eight, amounting to half of the remaining damage, which is to be paid only from the body of the ox that caused the damage, as it is written: \"They shall sell the live ox…\" Hence, if an ox worth twenty killed an ox worth two hundred, and the carcass is worth one hundred, the owner of the carcass cannot say to the owner of the live ox \"give me fifty,\" since the latter may say to him: \"Here is the ox that caused the damage, take it and go.\" This relates even to an ox that is worth no more than one denar. The same applies to all similar cases.",
            "An animal is called <i>mu'ad</i> [and the owner stands forewarned] with regard to any damage that should be expected from a creature of its kind; an animal is called <i>tam</i> (harmless) with regard to any damage that is strange and unlikely to be done by an animal of its kind, as when an ox has gored or bitten. If an animal acts in a strange manner repeatedly, it becomes a <i>mu'ad</i> with regard to the injurious action to which it got used, as it is written: \"If the ox is known to have been in the habit of goring\" (Exodus 21:36).",
            "An animal is considered a <i>tam</i> with regard to five classes of damages, [concerning which legal warning is required before the owner is made fully responsible and liable to pay in full for any thrice-repeated act] namely: an animal is not a natural attested danger as to goring, jostling, biting, squatting upon large utensils, or kicking. If, however, it became an attested danger with respect to any of these acts, it becomes a <i>mu'ad</i> in reference to it. The tooth, on the other hand, is an attested danger from the very beginning as to eating fit food; the foot is an attested danger from the very beginning as to breaking things in the course of walking; any animal is an attested danger from the very beginning as to squatting upon small pottery and the like and crushing them.",
            "Five kinds of animals are an attested danger from the outset even when they are tamed. Hence, if any of them did damage or killed by goring, biting, clawing, or the like, the owner must restore in full. They are: the wolf, the lion, the bear, the leopard, and the panther. So too, the snake, even if tamed, is an attested donger as to biting, and the owner must pay in full for the damage done.",
            "Any <i>mu'ad</i> pays full damage, collectible from the owner's best property; any <i>tam</i> pays half-damage from the sale of its own body. This rule applies to the animal that entered the premises of the injured party and caused him damage there. If, however, the plaintiff entered the premises of the defendant and the owner's animal caused him damage, the defendant is exempt from any claim, for he can say to the injured party: \"If you had not entered my premises, no injury would have been inflicted upon you.\" The Torah is explicit when it says: \"If he lets his beast loose and it feeds in another man's field…\" (Exodus 22:4).",
            "If the animal caused damage in a public domain, or in a courtyard which belonged neither to the defendant nor to the plaintiff, or in a courtyard which belonged to both of them, where they both had the right of placing their produce and cattle, such as a stretch of fields and the like, the law is that if the animal caused damage by tooth or foot, in a normal manner, its owner is not liable, because it had the right to walk in various directions, and it is natural for an animal to walk about and eat or to break things as it walks along. If, however, it gored or jostled or squatted or kicked or bit, the owner must pay half-damage if it was a <i>tam</i>, and full-damage if it was a <i>mu'ad</i>.",
            "",
            "Three primary causes of injury are to be found in an ox: damage done by the horn, the tooth, and the foot. Subordinate damages by the horn are jostling, biting, squatting, and kicking. Subordinate damages by the tooth are in cases where the animal rubbed itself against a wall for gratification and caused damage by its rubbing, or soiled fruit products for gratification. Subordinate damages by the foot are in cases where it occasioned injury with its body while walking along, or with its hair while treading along, or by swishing its tail, or with the saddle on its back, the bridle in its mouth, or the bell on its neck. So too, if a donkey caused injury with its load as it treaded along, or a heifer occasioned injury with the wagon it was pulling. All these are sub-damages by the foot, and the owner is exempt if the injury was occasioned in a public domain, but must pay in full if it was occasioned on the premises of the plaintiff."
        ],
        [
            "Both the primary and the secondary causes of injury are alike: if the primary cause is considered an attested danger, the secondary cause is likewise considered an attested danger; if the primary cause is not regarded as an attested danger, neither are its derivatives. All primary and secondary causes are considered forewarned from the very outset, except the horn and its derivatives, which are counted as innocuous to begin with until they are proved to be an attested danger, as we have explained.",

Fines are payable only on the basis of witnesses; anyone who admits liability in the case of any fine is exempt from paying it.",

If burglars brought the sheep out and it caused damage, they are liable.",
            "If a man broke a fence enclosing someone's animal, and it got out and caused damage, he is liable if the fence had been strong and firm. If, however, it had been weak, he is legally exempt but morally liable. So too, if a man placed deadly poison in front of another man's animal, he is legally exempt and morally liable.",

            "If a man entrusted his animal to an unpaid or a paid guardian, to a hirer or a borrower, the keeper takes the place of the owner and is held responsible for the damage the animal has caused. This is so only if they failed to guard it at all; but if they took excellent care of it, as it should be, they are quit of liability if it went out and caused damage, but the owner is liable, even if it killed a person [and the compensation exacted would be relatively high]. If they failed to take adequate care of it, an unpaid guardian is exempt, whereas a paid guardian, a hirer, or a borrower is held responsible."

If he took no care of his animal and failed to prevent it from pasturing there, the owner of the field has the right to slaughter the animal properly and then say to its owner: \"Come and sell your meat,\" since one is forbidden to do damage and pay for it; even to cause damage indirectly is forbidden.",
            "For this reason, the sages prohibited the raising of small cattle or small wild animals in Eretz Yisrael in areas containing fields and vineyards, though they allowed this in the wooded and desert areas of Eretz Yisrael. In Syria, however, such animals may be raised anywhere.",

If, for instance, evidence has been brought against a goring ox, and it stops goring, even though it jostles, it is deemed harmless with respect to goring. From what time is it assumed that the animal has turned harmless? If it does not gore when the children put their hands on it. So too, with respect to other actions concerning which evidence has been brought against an animal, it remains an attested danger unless it refrains from those actions when children put their hands on it.",
