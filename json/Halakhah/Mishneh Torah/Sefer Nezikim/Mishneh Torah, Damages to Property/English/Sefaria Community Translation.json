            "Five kinds of animals are an attested danger from the outset even when they are tamed. Hence, if any of them did damage or killed by goring, biting, clawing, or the like, the owner must restore in full. They are: the wolf, the lion, the bear, the leopard, and the panther. So too the snake that bit is an attested danger, even if tamed"

            "[The following laws apply when] a person was digging a cistern and the noise of the digging caused an animal to fall into the pit and die. If [the animal] fell forwards, [the owner of the cistern] is liable. If it fell backwards - i.e., it was startled [by the sound] and retreated and then fell - [the owner] is not liable. [The latter law is derived as follows. Exodus 21:33 states: \"When an ox...] falls,\" [implied is that for the person to be liable], the ox must fall in an ordinary manner.54 If [the animal] fell forward outside the cistern because of the sound of the digging and died, the court does not hold the owner of the cistern liable.55 If the person [whose ox died] seizes property [belonging to the owner of the cistern], it is not expropriated from him. If [the animal] fell backward outside the cistern and died or was injured, the owner of the cistern is not liable."
