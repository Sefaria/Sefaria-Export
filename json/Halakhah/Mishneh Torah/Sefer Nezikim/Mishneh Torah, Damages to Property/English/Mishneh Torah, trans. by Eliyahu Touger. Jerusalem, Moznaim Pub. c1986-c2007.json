            "Whenever a living animal owned by a person causes damages, the owner is required to pay, for the damage was caused by his property. [This is implied by Exodus 21:35:] \"When a person's ox will gore an ox belonging to a colleague....\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Sefer HaMitzvot (Positive Commandment 237) and Sefer HaChinuch (Mitzvah 51) consider this to be one of the Torah's 613 mitzvot. This mitzvah can be defined as compensating an owner for damages caused by one's animals through an action that they would not ordinarily perform.</i> These laws apply equally to an ox and to any other animal, beast or fowl. The verse mentions an ox only because that is a common instance.",
            "How much must [the owner] pay? If [the animal] caused damage through the performance of an act that it performs frequently and that is its natural habit - e.g., an animal ate straw or fodder, or it caused damage by [treading on an object] with its feet while walking - [the owner] is obligated to pay the full amount of the damage, [giving up, if necessary,]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> I.e., the owner is obligated to reimburse the person whose property was damaged for his loss. If the owner does not have cash readily available, his most valuable landed property should be expropriated and sold to pay the damages his animal caused.</i> his most choice property, as stated in [Exodus 22:4]: \"Payment should be exacted from his choice field and his choice vineyard.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Payment of these damages is also considered one of the Torah's 613 mitzvot Sefer HaMitzvot (Positive Commandment 240) and Sefer HaChinuch (Mitzvah 55). This mitzvah can be defined as compensating an owner for damages caused by one's animals through an action that they would ordinarily perform.</i> If [the animal] deviated from its ordinary habit and performed acts that it does not usually perform and caused damage in this manner - e.g., a ox gored or bit [another animal] - the owner is obligated to pay half the damages caused. [The payment must be exacted] from the animal that caused the damage, as [Exodus 21:35] states: \"And they shall sell the ox that is alive and divide the money.\"",
            "What is implied? When an ox that is worth a<i> maneh</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">  100 zuz.</i>gores an ox that is worth 20 <i>zuz</i> and kills it, [leaving] a corpse that is worth four <i>zuz</i>, the owner of the ox [that caused the damage] is liable to pay eight <i>zuz</i>, half of the loss [suffered by the owner of the ox that was killed]. The payment must be exacted from the body of the animal that caused the damage,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> As the Rambam proceeds to illustrate, the damages caused by the ox do not create a lien on all the property belonging to the owner of the ox.</i> as it is written: \"And they shall sell the ox that is alive.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> The commentaries have cited the apparent redundancy in the citation of the proof-text.</i> Therefore, if an ox that was worth 20<i> zuz</i> killed an ox that was worth 200 <i>zuz</i> and its carcass was worth [only] a <i>maneh</i>, the owner of the dead ox cannot compel the owner of the living ox to give him 50 [<i>zuz</i>]. Instead, he should tell him: \"Here is the ox that caused the damage. Take it and depart.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">  Thus the owner of the dead ox receives only the worth of the ox which gored, 20 zuz, 30 zuz less than what would be due him.</i>[This applies] even if the [ox that gored] is worth only a<i> dinar</i>. Similar principles apply in all analogous situations.",
            "[An animal] that performs a deed it is accustomed to performing by nature is called a <i>mu'ad</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Mu'ad literally means forewarned - i.e., the animal is prone to perform such acts, and the owner should be forewarned.</i> [When an animal] deviates from its ordinary pattern and performs an act that its species does not usually perform - e.g., an ox gores or bites - it is called a <i>tam</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Tam literally means simple, implying that the animal is not habituated in the performance of the abnormal behavior.</i> If the animal continues to follow the deviant pattern on several occasions, it is considered to be <i>mu'ad </i>with regard to the deviation to which it has become habituated, as [implied by Exodus 21:36]: \"Or it is known that it is a goring ox.\"",
            "Five types of activities are considered to be abnormal for an animal. If it repeatedly performs any of them, it is considered to be <i>mu'ad</i> with regard to that activity.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> I.e., for that activity alone, and not for any other abnormal activity (Maggid Mishneh).</i> An animal is not considered to be prone to gore, to butt,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> I.e., to attack an animal with a part of its body other than its horns (Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, Bava Kama 1:4).</i> to bite, to lie down on large utensils or to kick. If it becomes accustomed to such an activity, its owner should be forewarned. At the outset, [an animal] is, however, considered prone to eat foods that are appropriate for it and to break utensils [on which it treads] as it walks. Similarly, an animal is considered prone to lie down on small utensils and crush them.",
            "Five species of animals are considered prone to cause damage from the beginning of their existence. [This applies] even if they have become domesticated.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Even when these animals have been raised in a home and do not outwardly show wild traits, their tendency to violence is considered part of their instinct, never to be eradicated fully.The Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 389:8) states that these animals are considered mu'adim only with regard to the specific negative traits for which they are known. If they cause damage in other ways, they are considered as tamim.</i> Therefore, if they cause damage or death by goring, biting, treading, lying down upon, or the like, [the owner] is liable for the entire amount of the damages. They are a wolf, a lion, a bear, a tiger and a leopard. Similarly, a snake that bites is considered to be <i>mu'ad</i>, even if it has been domesticated.",
            "Whenever [an animal] is <i>mu'ad</i>, [the owner] must pay the entire amount of the damage, [even if this requires expropriating] his most choice property. Whenever, by contrast, an animal is considered a <i>tam</i>, [the owner] is required to pay [only] half the amount of the damages. [Moreover,] that half is taken only from the animal itself. When does the above apply? When the animal entered into the domain belonging to the person to whom damage was caused, and caused damage. When, however, the person to whom damage was caused entered into the domain of the person [whose animal] caused the damage, [the owner] is not liable for anything. For he can tell [the party who suffered the damages]: \"If you had not entered my domain, you would not have suffered any damages.\" Indeed, this is explicitly stated in the Torah, as [Exodus 22:4] states: \"And if he shall send forth his animals, and they pasture in another's field.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> This is the verse that describes the payment of damages caused by grazing. It emphasizes that the owner is liable for damages caused in another's field, and not in his own.The Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 389:10) and others cite Bava Kama 21b, which interprets this verse in a more specific and somewhat different manner. It would appear, however, that the Rambam is not referring to the exegesis of the verse by the Talmud, but is instead presenting the simple meaning of the verse as a support for the premise stated previously.</i>",
            "[The following rules apply when a person's] animal causes damage in the public domain or in a courtyard that belongs neither to the owner of [the animal that] caused the damage nor to the party who suffered the damages,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> This applies when the party who suffered the damages placed produce there without receiving permission from the owner.

If [the animal] caused damage by eating or treading in its ordinary manner, the owner is not liable. For [the animal] has permission to go from here to there, and it is the habit of an animal to go and eat as it proceeds and to break [anything lying in its way] as it proceeds.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> In the Guide for the Perplexed, Volume III, Chapter 40, the Rambam explains that this law is based on a logical premise. Since this is an animal's natural habit, it is difficult for the owner to prevent his animal from causing such damage. Moreover, the person whose property was damaged should have foreseen the problem and not left anything of value in such places.</i>[Different rules apply if] it [caused damage by] goring, butting, kicking or biting.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> For this represents a departure from the animal's natural pattern, for which its owner is held responsible.</i> If its status is <i>tam</i>, [the owner] must pay for half the damages. If its status is <i>mu'ad</i>, [the owner] must pay the entire amount of the damages.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Although both types of animals have the right to proceed in the public domain, neither has the right to damage the other animal.

            "There are three categories of damages [caused by] an ox: a) goring, b) eating and c) treading.

The derivatives of treading are<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> All the acts that follow are damages caused by an animal without any intent, that are likely to be caused when it proceeds in an ordinary manner (Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat 390:1).</i> causing damage with its body while walking; causing damage with its hair while walking or by swishing its tail, or with its saddle, the bit in its mouth or the bell around its neck. Similarly, a donkey that causes damage with its burden while walking or a calf that is pulling a cart that causes damage while pulling it. All of these are derivatives of treading. In a public domain [the owner] is not liable, and in a domain belonging to the party who suffered the damages, he must pay for the entire amount of the damages.",
            "When [an animal] swishes its tail repeatedly in an abnormal manner and causes damage in the public domain, or when it swishes its sexual organ and causes damage in the public domain, [the owner] is not held liable. If the person whose property was damaged seizes possession [of property belonging to the owner], he may take payment for half of the damages.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> As the Rambam proceeds to explain, these instances are the subject of an unresolved Talmudic debate (Bava Kama 19b). Because of the doubt involved, payment is not exacted from the owner, and for this same reason the person whose property was damaged may not seize the owner's property. If, however, he did seize the owner's property, the same rationale is advanced on his behalf. Since the property may rightfully belong to him, because of the doubt, we do not expropriate the property and return it to its owner.In any case, all that is involved is half of the damages, because the reason why one might hold the owner liable is that these activities are derivatives of goring. And for goring, the owner is required to pay only half the value of the damages.The Rambam's opinion is quoted by the Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 390:2). The Ramah cites the opinion of the Ramban and the Tur, who maintain that when a question of law is unresolved, and one party seizes the other's property, the property that was seized must be returned.</i> [The rationale for that ruling is that] there is an unresolved question whether these acts are derivatives of goring, in which case [the owner] is liable [for damage caused] in the public domain, or whether they are derivatives of treading, in which case [the owner] is not liable [for damage caused] in the public domain, as has been explained.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> See Halachah 8.</i>"

Nevertheless, if such stones cause damage in a person's private domain, [the owner of the animal] must pay [for the damages] from his most choice property,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> The Lechem Mishneh raises questions regarding this point, but the Rambam's ruling is justified by the later commentaries.</i> as he must pay for damages caused by treading, the major category.

            "What is implied? When an animal enters a courtyard belonging to another person and proceeds to walk, and in doing so propels stones from under its feet that break utensils, [the owner of the animal] must pay half the amount of the damage from his most choice property. This matter is a law communicated by the Oral Tradition.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> I.e., it is a law that was communicated orally to Moses on Mount Sinai and then transmitted orally from generation to generation. Although such laws are usually not even alluded to in the Written Law, their authority is the same as that of a law stated in Scripture.

            "Similarly, if [an animal] was proceeding in the public domain<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Despite the fact that the animal was walking in the public domain, since the damage took place in a private domain, the owner is liable.</i> and stones were propelled from under its feet into a domain belonging to someone else, and they broke utensils there, [the owner of the animal] must pay half the damages. If [an animal] treads on a utensil in a domain belonging to someone else and breaks it, and shards from the broken utensil fall on another utensil and break it, [the owner of the animal] must pay the entire [damages for the destruction of] the first utensil, and half [the damages for the destruction of] the second utensil.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> The damage to the first utensil is an ordinary instance of treading, while the damage to the second utensil is a case of the law illustrated in the previous two halachot.</i>",
            "If an animal was walking in the public domain and it kicked<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Intentionally.</i> [the ground] and propelled stones that caused damage in the public domain, [the owner] is not liable. If the person whose property was damaged seized a fourth [of the cost] of the damages, it should not be expropriated from him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> See Chapter 1, Halachah 11 and notes.</i> [The rationale is that] there is a doubt regarding the matter: perhaps this is considered a deviation from the ordinary pattern and it is not a derivative of treading, for [the animal] kicked.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> This law is the subject of an unresolved question in Bava Kama 19a. The question is whether kicking the stone is considered like goring - for the kicking was done intentionally - in which case the owner would be liable for damage caused in the public domain, or it is considered to be an ordinary instance of stones that were propelled, and since the damage took place in the public domain, the owner is not held liable.Even according to the logic that maintains that the owner is liable, he is liable for only a fourth of the damage. This figure is arrived at as follows: When damage is caused by propelling stones, the owner is required to pay only half. Since the animal is considered to be a tam - i.e., it is not prone to cause such damages - the owner is required to pay only half of the amount for which he would be liable. Thus, one half of a half is a quarter.Since the question was not resolved by the Sages, the owner should not be held liable. Conversely, if the person whose property was damaged seized the money involved, it should not be expropriated from him.The Ra'avad raises objections to the Rambam's ruling, based on a different understanding of the Talmudic passage. The later authorities, however, follow the Rambam.</i>",
            "If the animal kicked the earth in the domain belonging to another person and stones were propelled because of its kick and caused damages, [the owner] is liable to pay a fourth of the damages, for this is a deviation from the ordinary manner of propelling stones. If the person whose property was damaged seized half [of the cost] of the damages, it should not be expropriated from him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> This law is an extension of the unresolved question mentioned in the previous halachah. Since the damage took place in a private domain, the owner is definitely held liable. The question is whether he is liable for half the damages or for only a quarter of the damages. According to the opinion that maintains that kicking is considered a deviation, he should be held liable for only a fourth. According to the opinion that maintains that a deviation is not significant with regard to this category of damages, he is liable to pay half the damages.Since the matter was left unresolved, the owner may be required to pay only one fourth. If, however, the person whose property was damaged seized the owner's property, he need not relinquish half the value of the damages.</i> Even if an animal was walking in a place where it would be impossible for it not to propel stones, and it kicked [the earth] and propelled stones, [the owner] is liable to pay a fourth of the damages.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> The principles operating in this instance are the same as those operating in the first clause. The only reason for mentioning this law is that since it is impossible that the animal would not propel stones, one might not think that the deviation is significant, and the owner should be held liable for half the damages, as in an ordinary case of this nature. This premise is, nevertheless, not accepted.</i> If the person whose property was damaged seized half [of the cost] of the damages, it should not be expropriated from him.",
            "Whenever a person must pay full damages, the payment is considered to be a monetary obligation that he is liable to pay, as if he had borrowed [money] from his colleague. When, by contrast, a person must pay half the damages, the monetary obligation is considered a fine, with the exception of the half damages liable from stones,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> In this instance, although the owner does not pay for the full extent of the damages, none of the leniencies stated below apply.With  regard to the payment of half-damages, according to ordinary logic - and indeed, this was the practice of the secular laws at that time - since the animal was not mu'ad, prone to cause damage, one would not think to hold the owner liable. Nevertheless, to insure higher standards of respect for property, Torah law fined the owner of the animal for half the damages.</i> which is a halachah [transmitted by the Oral Tradition], as we have explained.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> See Halachah 3.</i>",
            "This is the operating principle: Whenever a person pays for the damage that he caused, it is considered a monetary obligation. Whenever he pays more or less - e.g., the double payment (for theft) or half the amount of damages - the amount that is greater or less than the principal is considered to be a fine. A fine is required only when one is obligated through the testimony of witnesses. When a person admits that he is liable for a fine, he is absolved of the obligation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> This applies even if after a person admits that he is liable for a fine, witnesses testify to that effect (Hilchot Geneivah 3:8-9 and the Maggid Mishneh). There are also other distinctions between fines and monetary obligations; for example, cases involving fines were arbitrated only by judges who were given semichah.

The Ra'avad raises the question: Since the first clause of the halachah draws an analogy between the rooster's crowing and an animal's propelling stones, how is this instance different from the law stated in Halachah 6, where the owner is held liable for only a quarter of the damages his animal caused?The Maggid Mishneh states that the Rambam's rationale is difficult to understand, but offers the following explanation. When there are no spices in the container, crowing and breaking the container is considered to be a derivative of goring, not of propelling stones.The Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 390:9) does not resolve the issue, explaining that since a deviation from the ordinary pattern is involved, the case is considered a fine and is not arbitrated in the present era.</i>",

It appears that the Rambam considers the damage caused by propelling stones to be kocho, a direct result of the person's energy, and not ko'ach kocho (Kessef Mishneh, Radbaz).

The Maggid Mishneh explains that the liability refers only to damage caused by the animal by goring. (See Chapter 7, Halachah 1.) The Kessef Mishneh refers to a responsum purported to have been sent by the Rambam to the Sages of Lunil, which states that there was a printing error and the text should read: If, however, they guarded the animal in an excellent manner, as they should, and it got loose and caused damage, the watchman is not liable. If the watchman guarded the animal in an inferior manner, he is not held liable if he is an unpaid watchman. Instead, the owners are liable, even if the animal kills a human being. The watchman is held liable if he is a paid watchman, a renter or a borrower.In his Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 396:8), Rav Yosef Karo quotes the interpretation of the Maggid Mishneh.

The Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 396:8) follows the Maggid Mishneh's conception. They maintain that the principle followed by the Rambam should be accepted with the exception of a goring ox.</i> If [the watchman] accepted responsibility [only] for the damages [the animal] causes, he is liable if it causes damage.

If the animal that caused the damage is considered to be an ordinary animal, in which case half the damages must be paid from the body of the animal itself, the person whose property was damaged should take his due from the animal, and the sum that he collects should be considered to be a debt owed by the watchman to the owner of the animal.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> If the animal was already classified as prone to cause damages, this law would not apply, because the obligation would rest solely on the watchman's person.

Instead, one considers the damaged crops as a part in a larger whole, thus reducing the amount of the damages. A compromise is accepted that takes in consideration the positions of both the owner of the land and the owner of the animal.The produce is not evaluated individually, for this would inflate the amount of damages paid. Nor is its share evaluated in comparison with the entire field, for then the amount of damages would be unfairly low. Instead, it is evaluated when compared with an area sixty times its size as explained.A se'ah is six kabbin. A kab is 1.376 kilograms according to Shiurei Torah. Thus a se'ah is 8.256 kilograms. The area where a se'ah of seeds would be sown is 50 cubits by 50 cubits.</i> What is implied? If [an animal] ate the amount of produce that would grow when a <i>se'ah</i> [of seeds] were sown in that field, we calculate the worth of an area in which sixty <i>se'ah</i> [of seeds] could be sown in that field, [evaluating] how much it would be worth [before the animal ate from it] and how much it is worth now. [The owner or the watchman] is liable for the remainder. Similarly, if the animal ate an amount of produce that would grow when a <i>kav</i> or a quarter of a <i>kav</i> were sown - [or even if it ate] one stalk of grain - the damages are assessed by comparison with a field sixty times the size of the crops that were damaged.",

[The following laws apply if an animal] ate the fruit of one date palm, or a person gathered the fruit of a colleague's date palm and ate it.

The Ra'avad maintains that by speaking of a colleague's ox, the Torah excludes one belonging to a gentile.

Our Sages, however, did not allow this, because a person who knew that the ox was consecrated, but did not know that it had gored, might see it being given to the person whose property was damaged and think that an animal that was consecrated can lose its sacred status without being redeemed. Instead, they required that the person whose property was damaged redeem the ox for a minimal fee and then collect his due from it (Maggid Mishneh).The Chatam Sofer (Choshen Mishpat, Responsum 165) notes that there appears to be a contradiction between this halachah and Halachah 4. From Halachah 4, it appears that the person can consecrate the ox and thus totally nullify the lien of the person whose property was damaged. From this halachah, by contrast, it appears that the lien remains.In resolution, the Chatam Sofer makes a distinction between the sanctification of the value of the ox (as in this halachah), in which instance the lien remains, and the sanctification of the body of the ox (as in Halachah 4), in which instance the lien is nullified.</i> [If the owner] slaughters the ox, [the person whose property was damaged] may collect his due from the meat.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> The Tur and the Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 407:2) state that if the slaughter causes the value of the ox to depreciate, the owner must reimburse the person whose property was damaged for the loss.</i> [If the owner] gives it away as a present, [the present] is binding,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> And therefore the recipient of the present may work with the animal.</i> but [the person whose property was damaged] may collect his due from [the animal].",

To what can this be compared? To an instance where a person claims that a colleague owes him wheat, and the colleague admits to owing him barley.

If, however, he took the matter to court, and the court ruled in favor of the defendant, as the Rambam states, and then the plaintiff seizes the defendant's property, he must return it.</i> If he did not seize possession [of such property], however, no money at all is expropriated from the person whose oxen caused the damage.",

[This is derived from the phrase:] \"The owner of the cistern will pay.\" [Implied is that the cistern] must have an owner, while this cistern is ownerless.

In this instance, however, the fact that the cover was not sufficient to support camels can in no way be considered a cause of the decay of the cover.The Maggid Mishneh's resolution is accepted by the Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 410:24).

Even if the injury is suffered during the day, the person is liable, because it is not common for a person to look carefully at the road on which he is walking.With regard to an injury suffered by an animal, the Rambam's ruling is the subject of a difference of opinion among our Rabbis. The Ra'avad maintains that just as the owner of the cistern is not liable for the death of a mentally competent animal that falls during the daytime, he is not liable for its injury.The Maggid Mishneh justifies the Rambam's ruling, explaining that although an animal may act with caution with regard to obstacles that can cause more severe damages, it will not be as sensitive with regard to obstacles that can cause lesser damages. The Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 410:20) quotes the Rambam's view, while the Tur and the Ramah follow that of the Ra'avad.

First of all, the Talmud explains that this matter is dependent on a difference of opinion between Rav and Shmuel. In Halachah 15, the Rambam rules according to Shmuel, while here his ruling appears closer to that of Rav. According to the Ra'avad, if the animal fell backwards into the cistern, the owner of the cistern is not held liable, but if the owner seizes property belonging to the other, it is not expropriated from him.The Rambam's interpretation of this passage is obviously problematic. In his Commentary on the Mishnah (Bava Kama 5:6), his interpretation also appears to differ from this halachah. There he writes that if the ox falls backwards into the cistern, the owner of the cistern is liable. If he falls backwards outside the cistern, the owner of the cistern is not liable. This understanding is reflected in the ruling of the Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 410:31).</i> If [the animal] fell forward outside the cistern because of the sound of the digging and died, the court does not hold the owner of the cistern liable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> For the animal died because of the blow it received from the land in the public domain, and not that of the cistern. The Ra'avad differs with regard to this clause as well and maintains that the property of the cistern's owner may not be seized. The Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 410:31) also follows that understanding.</i> If the person [whose ox died] seizes property [belonging to the owner of the cistern], it is not expropriated from him. If [the animal] fell backward outside the cistern and died or was injured, the owner of the cistern is not liable.",

            "When a fire spreads and harms a human being and injures him, the person who kindled the fire is liable for the damages, unemployment benefits, medical costs, pain and embarrassment suffered by the injured party,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> See Hilchot Chovel UMazik, ch. 1, for a detailed explanation of these five categories of compensation.</i> as if he had personally injured him. Although fire is one of a person's possessions, it is as if he caused him damage with his arrows.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> This is the subject of a difference of opinion among our Sages (Bava Kama 22a). Rabbi Yochanan maintains, as the Rambam rules, that kindling a fire is regarded like shooting an arrow. Resh Lakish differs and maintains that a fire is regarded no differently from a person's cistern or his animals. To explain Rabbi Yochanan's opinion: When a person shoots an arrow, he is considered to have caused damage with his person although the damage took place far from him. So too, when he kindles a fire, despite the fact that the damage occurs in a distant place, it is as if he caused the damage with his person. Note the Maggid Mishneh, who points to an apparent contradiction in the Rambam's rulings. For Rabbi Yochanan does not free a person of liability for articles that are buried. It is, however, possible to explain that the Rambam does not accept Rabbi Yochanan's perspective blindly. He accepts it in this instance, but follows the other interpretations with regard to buried property.</i> If, by contrast, injury to a man is caused by a person's animal or cistern, he is liable for the damages alone, as we have explained.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Chapter 11, Halachah 6, and Chapter 13, Halachah 2.</i>",

What is implied? If a person placed a stone, a knife or a burden on his roof, and it fell because of an ordinary wind and caused damage, he must pay the full extent of the damages. All these are derivatives of fire.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> For just as a person is liable when an ordinary wind spreads afire, so too, he is liable for any other damage his property causes that comes as a result of an ordinary wind.</i> If it was an uncommon wind that caused them to fall and create damage, he is not liable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Just as he is not liable when an uncommon wind causes a fire to spread (Halachah 7).</i>"
