            "On the other hand, if a man hired a murderer to kill somebody, or sent servants to kill him, or tied him up and put him in front of a lion or similar beast and it killed him, and also if an individual attempted suicide, each of these is guilty of shedding blood and bears the crime of murder; he deserves to die by an act of God, but is not executed by the court.",

This refers to one who commits murder himself and not through an agent. \"I will require your lifeblood\" (9:5) refers to suicide. \"I will require it of any beast\" refers to one who puts a man in front of a beast to devour him. \"Of man I will require a reckoning for human life, of every man for that of his fellow man\" (9:5) refers to one who hires others to kill his fellow man. The verb <i>require</i> is explicitly iterated in the three cases to show that the verdict is left with God.",

Accordingly, if he struck him hard enough to kill, and he was on the verge of death for twenty-four hours and then died, he should not be put to death on account of his slave, even though he died as a result of the blow, for it is written: \"If the slave survives a day or two, he shall not be punished, for the slave is his property\" (Exodus 21:21). The phrase <i>day or two</i> means a day that is like two, namely: twenty-four hours.",
            "But if a man struck a slave not his own, even if the slave died on account of the blow several days afterwards, the man is put to death, as in the case of any freeman, because he struck him hard enough to kill.",
            "It seems to me, that if a man struck his slave with a knife or a sword, with a stone or a fist, and the like, and the slave was considered to be fatally wounded and then he died, the law concerning \"a day or two\" is not applicable to him ; even if the slave died after a year, his master should be put to death on account of him. For this reason it is written : \"If a man strikes his slave … with a rod\" (Exodus 21:20), because the Torah has permitted him to strike his slave merely with a rod or a stick or a strap, and the like, but not a murderous blow."
