And the law is that there is no exile available for him due to his grave sin, and exile does not provide him atonement.  Sanctuary Cities are not meant for him as they exist only for those who have merited exile.  Therefore, if the Blood Redeemer finds him anywhere and kills him, the Redeemer is held not guilty.  "

            "...The roof is like every other thing that has danger in itself, and which is possible that a person will make a mistake with it and die. An example is having a pit in one's property, whether it has water or not - one is obligated to make a wall of ten tefachim (32 inches/80cm.) around it, or a covering over it, so a person won't fall in it and die. And so too any stumbling block in which there is a danger to life: it is a positive mitzvah to remove it, and to guard against it, and to be exceedingly cautious about it, as it is written \"take care of yourself and guard your life\" (Deut. 4:9). And if one has not removed the stumbling blocks that bring people to danger, one has cancelled a positive commandment and transgressed \"do not bring bloodguilt\" (Deut. 22:8).",
            "Our Sages forbade many matters because they involve a threat to life. Whenever a person transgresses these guidelines, saying: \"I will risk my life, what does this matter to others,\" or \"I am not careful about these things,\" he should be punished by stripes for rebelliousness."
