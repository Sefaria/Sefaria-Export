                "I heard from the master of our masters mentioned [above]: Once, R. Shalom from the Land of the West decreed a fast for rain in Jerusalem. He was very righteous and important, and he ordered that everyone should gather to one synagogue to pray as a large group. So he sent word to R. Gershon, who was mentioned earlier, that he should pray in front of the rostrum (as the prayer leader). And in Jerusalem, it was the custom that whoever would pray in front of the rostrum would need to say words of admonition. And the custom there was that the preacher would [quote] the Gemara, the Midrash or verses [from the Bible] as it was in its [exact original wording]; and if he changed the wording, he would be disgraced. So he prepared himself to preach and he reviewed the wording several times in order that he say it in its [original wording]. He did not sleep the whole night, and at the beginning of the morning his throat dried up. He told his son, R. Leib, mentioned earlier, \"My words are stopped up. Go to R. Shalom; tell him that I can not pray [as the  prayer leader].\" So the 'package was untied' and everyone prayed in their usual places. And R. Shalom was [also] in his place in his study hall, and someone else stepped down in front of the rostrum. But in the midst of the song, R. Shalom heard that R. Gershon's voice returned to him. So immediately after the silent prayer, he ordered that the one praying leave the [prayer] stand, and that R. Gershon go down and pray from the stand to pray the eighteen benedictions (<i>shmoneh esreh</i>) out loud and say the penitentiary prayers (<i>selichot</i>). And R. Gershon went down in front of the rostrum, and after the eighteen benedictions, he began to say the penitentiary prayers. So he said the opening, but [then] he walked away from the rostrum and did not want to say more penitential prayers. And his son, the aforementioned R. Leib, asked him why he did this. So he answered him, \"Because during the opening, the prayer flowed in my mouth and I could feel that if I would have said more penitential prayers, the rain would have fallen immediately, and I was afraid of [it leading me to] haughtiness. That is why I did not pray. As I know that rain will fall two or three consecutive days afterwards [even without more prayers].\" And so it was."

                "Another explanation: on Shabbat before Pesach, the Rav prayed Shacharit, and after prayer he removed the tallit and went outside. They thought he needed to use the toilet. When he was in the synagogue courtyard, he saw that they were bringing a bear, and youths were running after it as is usual. And he also went after it. After this, they brought the bear from the gate of the synagogue courtyard to the market. And he also followed. And it was very wondrous in the eyes of the people. And they brought the bear to the judge's house, and after this the bear broke the rope and seemed crazed. All the people who were following it fled because of the fear that it would run through the city and injure people.",
                "And the Rav stood in his place, and the bear ran through the judge's courtyard and entered its antechamber. And it opened the house's door by force, and the Ba'al SHem Tov immediately stood by the window to see what it would do to him. And many men, and the majority of the world, stood by the windows to see what the bear would do. Immediately the bear removed the table from its place, and picked up the floor, and dug in the dirt, until it found a dead mamzer concealed beneath the floor. And it took the mamzer from there in its two arms, and showed him to all. And the Rav cried that they were witnesses in Polish (\"pratest\", פראטעסט). For it was His will to bring forth evil mutterings on the Jews. And he returned to the synagogue to conclude the prayers. "
