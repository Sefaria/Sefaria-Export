                "In the commentary <i>Or Hame'ir</i> on Kohelet Rabbah, is written the following: There is a wonderful story in the name of the Baal Shem Tov of blessed memory, whose meaning is not explained. There once was a king, who had a servant who was able to play the harp with the utmost beauty. One tune, in particular, was most pleasing in the eyes of the king, and he instructed the musician to play it before him in the palace every day - even several times a day. And so it was. After some time, the tune seemed old to the musician, and he lost the passion and arousal that had previously burned within him. What did the king do to restore this arousal and emotional desire in the musician? Each and every time he wanted to hear his favourite tune, he would summon a person from the marketplace who had never heard the tune played before. Since this newcomer had just arrived, it rekindled passion in the musician! And so it was for many days. After time, however, the king took advice from his counsellors, in order to know what else could be done with the musician, for it was wearisome to summon a new guest each time the tune was to be played, just in order to arouse some passion. The advice they gave was this: order the eyes of the musician to be torn out, so that he be forever blind, never again to see the form of man. Now, any time the king wanted to hear his favourite tune, he would tell the musician that there was a new person in front of him, who has never heard your music before. Thus the passion was reborn each time, since the musician could not make out the form of the person before him, and truly believed that there was a new listener there. And so it was. This is the end of the story. "

Therefore when a certain thing breaks or is lost he should not worry at all, for he has elevated what was relevant to him and therefore it broke; and when it is lost and comes to another [person’s possession], presumably that thing also contains holy sparks that are also relevant to that person. Therefore when he has elevated from this what he needed, the thing came to another [person’s possession] for him to elevate what is relevant to him.” And see also in Vayikra, p.40b."

Let there rather be two people in one room, each secluding themselves with their Creator. Sometimes, when one is truly cleaving to Gd, they can seclude themselves even in a house full of people. See further on in section 47-48 which say that there should be no one present when wants to cleave to God."
