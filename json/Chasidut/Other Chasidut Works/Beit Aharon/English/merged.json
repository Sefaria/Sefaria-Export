                        "In the Mishnah (Yoma 85b): Rabbi Akiva said, \"How fortunate are you, Israel; before Whom are you purified, and Who purifies you? Your Father in Heaven, as it is stated (Ezekiel 36:25), \"And I will sprinkle purifying water upon you, and you shall be purified.\" And it states (Jeremiah 17:13), 'The mikveh (ritual bath) of Israel is God.' Just as a mikveh purifies the impure, so too does the Holy One, Blessed be He, purify Israel.\"",
                        "And we can say [about this] that the expression, who, applies when we ask about something that is possible to understand. It is just that I don't know what it is, so I ask about it, who. But it is not applicable to ask, who is it, about something that is impossible to understand! So this is the explanation of the Mishnah, \"How fortunate are you, Israel; before Whom are you purified: The explanation is that a person purifies himself and comes to this aspect before it is possible to ask, \"Who is He?\" And this aspect called, \"Who,\" purifies you, \"as it is stated, 'And I will sprinkle purifying water upon you, and you shall be purified.' And it states, 'The mikveh (ritual bath) of Israel is God.'\" Since, in the same way that a person must immerse himself in a mikveh, so too must he immerse himself in the Name of His Existence, blessed be He. And it needs to be 'water in water,' as it was before the creation of the world, so that he purifies himself before, \"Who.\" And this is the aspect of Who purifying him. And this is the intention of the mikveh, as a person must immerse himself in the four letters of His Existence, may He blessed and blessed be His name, so that there be 'water in water' (ed. see Zohar Bereishit 6:60). And it is found in the Midrash, \"'And they shall take a red heifer to you' (Numbers 19:2), etc. Such did Rabbi Tanchuma open [his teaching], '\"The righteous man lives blamelessly\" (Proverbs 20:7) - that is Avraham; \"happy are his children who come after him\" - everything that Avraham did to the angels was done afterwards to his children. He said (Genesis 18:4), \"Let a little water be taken and wash your feet\" - so do his children sprinkle upon themselves from the ashes of the red heifer, immerse themselves and become pure. For Avraham was truly the kindness of the world.'\" The explanation is that he gave to everyone everything they needed. And just like Avraham did kindness to the angels and purified them - as the angels [appeared as] three men, as is well known, such that they needed purification, so he purified with water which did not have any aspect of impurity, but was rather completely pure - so too, did he purify Israel with the same water at that time. It is written (Exodus 30:18-20), \"Make a copper basin, etc. When they enter the Tent of Meeting they shall wash with water (it can be read literally as, the water shall be washed).\" It is implied that the water itself needs washing. But ostensibly, how is it possible to wash water in water? But it is according to that which is found in the Gemara - water that has become impure and requires purification, we adjoin it to pure water. And this is [the meaning of] \"the water shall be washed\": That the lower waters must be adjoined to the higher waters. And this is the explanation of \"adjoining water to water.\" And this is the explanation of, \"before Who\": Before, \"Who,\" you purify yourselves; as they are waters that are completely pure. And these are the waters that Avraham gave to the angels to purify them. So any time a person purifies himself, he must purify himself with those waters, in order to adjoin 'water with water' - 'the mikveh of Israel is God' (referring to God's name, which is seen as combining the two waters). And the trait called, \"Who,\" is what purifies you. And this is [the meaning of] \"and they shall take a pure red heifer to you that has no blemish in it\" - that there should be no lack in it, but that it should be completely perfect; \"upon which a yoke has not come\" - for it is from the world of freedom. And that is the aspect called, \"'Who,' which purifies you.\" And that is the explanation of the verse, \"The righteous man lives blamelessly\" - this is Avraham who did kindness with everyone; \"happy are his children who come after him\" - just as he did kindness with everyone, in that merit, his children are also purified in the same waters."

And the Holy Blessed One said, ‘since your light is My light, and My light is your light, let us walk together and light up Zion’. This is as it is written, ‘arise, My light, for your light has arrived’”",
                        "It is written, “for with You is the source of life, in Your light we will see light” (Psalms 36:10). For every member of Israel must first awaken themselves through the light of the Blessed God that is within them. For each and every one possesses this, each according to their own state and level. But it is merely buried and covered up by nonsense and worldly vanities. And one must first awaken themselves with all their strength, to cause this light to shine, each according to their own level. And then, the light from above will reach them to cause them to shine more and more. And this is [the meaning of the words] “in Your light” (Psalms 36:10) meaning in the light of the Blessed God that is within us, “we will see light” (ibid) referring to the light of abundance that pours upon one from above. And [the Karliner Rebbe] spoke above this in terms of the statement from the Holy Zohar: “The white light does not dwell until there is a dark light below.” As we see, that the bottom of a candle is black, and there is a white light that rests upon the black light from above. And this relates to what is mentioned in a number of places in the Holy Zohar, “the darkness of the morning.” For before the light of day arrives, it becomes increasingly dark, as we see with our own eyes. And likewise within a person. For the arousal from below is called “a black light”, for a person needs to awaken themselves specifically in their time of darkness. As the verse says, “and she rises when it is still night” (Proverbs 31:15). And when one is roused sufficiently, then a white light from above rests upon them. And this is [the meaning of] “arise, My light” - the black light from below - “for your light has arrived” - the white light from above is ready to pour upon you. And what is the meaning of “arise” [kumi]? For a person needs to be a complete edifice [komah shleima]. And this is [the meaning of], “arise [kumi] My light” - you shall seek to cause your entire stature to shine.\n"

                        "And from the outset it is surprising: where were the students, that the text says that they arrived? Initially one would have thought that they were sitting with them, but this is the explanation: when the righteous ones were sitting on that night and telling about the Exodus they attained the life-force from the Blessed Creator until the night was illuminated in every aspect, as it was when the Jews came out of Egypt, that all became the aspect of memory, as it is known, since the receiving of memory is called night, and coming out of Egypt was through leaps, and a complete union happened as the night shone like the day. And this is the explanation that they were reclining in Bnei Brak, which is 30 flashings and clarifications, and they were telling the Exodus, meaning, through their telling they attained the life force of the Blessed Creator, that illuminated for them as clear as day, as we said. And this is the expression \"they were telling about the Exodus all through that night\" - that through them the complete union, an aspect of memory. And this is \"all through that night\": until they made the night become this aspect. And all is in the expression memory. Until the students arrived, meaning, that through their clarifications the students were able to attain the life force and the holy unifications too. The students said to them \"our masters, you illuminated for us also the upper lights that make up the night\", and they said \"time has come\" - that time has touched the reading of the morning Shema. Meaning, that they raised time, from this world until time touched the reading of the morning Shema. And what is the issue of reading of the Shema? Since the Exodus is itself the aspect of reading the Shema, as known. The reading of the Shema is mesirat nefesh (total dedication) and the Exodus was also mesirat nefesh. Since the essence is total dedication until all is unified on a simple unity, and this is the essence of the story of coming out of Egypt, that one comes out from the dominion of the Evil Inclination. And through me's speaking about the Exodus, one comes out from slavery to freedom, and all the night is illuminated. And this is why it is written \"after that\"."

                        "<b>And we can say,</b> that it is found in the Gemara, \"Man was the first in [God's] thought but the last in formation. For if he will merit, he is before everything. But if not, we say to him, 'A gnat was before you.'\" But how is this so? Rather the truth is like this: That [in] the spirituality of the Jewish people, they are first. For the powers of all the lives of all of the creatures in the world were given into man, so that he would be able to grasp [them], from the lowest and lowliest up to the most supernal and high, and from the highest to the lowliest, and refine them. And even in the later generations, when they were on the lowest and very lowly level - nevertheless, 'write this (<i>zot</i>) for the last generation.' That the aspect of <i>zot</i> (<i>Malkhut</i>, Kingship) should be written and connected to the last generation. It is like that which is written (Isaiah 2:2), \"And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established on the top of the mountains\" - it is not exactly last in time, but rather last in level: In the lowly days, it will be established on top (<i>rosh</i>), it will be connected to the aspect of <i>Rosh</i>. And that is Rosh Hashanah, as it is written (Deuteronomy 11:12), \"from the beginning (<i>reishit</i>) of the year to the end of the year.\" The explanation [of this] is like that mentioned above - that the beginning be connected to the end. As it is found in the Gemara, \"It is written, '<i>rashit</i> poor' - a year that is poor in its beginning, becomes wealthy at its end.\" <b>\"And a nation will be created that will praise the Lord\":</b> [The commentary] is missing. ",
                        "<b>\"O God, my Lord, the strength of my salvation, You have sheltered (<i>sakkotah</i>) my head in the day of weaponry\" (Psalms 140:8).</b> \"God, my Lord,\" is about the Days of Awe. And all of the service that we do on those days is to sweeten the constrictions (<i>gevurot</i>). So that is \"the strength of my salvation.\" And on Yom Kippur, during the time of the closing prayer (<i>neilah</i>), the kindnesses (<i>chassadim</i>) began to sparkle. Hence, at the conclusion of Yom Kippur, we say, \"The Lord is God\" (the name, Lord, being associated with kindness; whereas the name, God, is associated with constriction). And afterwards, \"You have shielded my head in the day of weapons,\" is Sukkot: \"In the day of weaponry,\" is the four species, which are tools of war, as is found in the Midrash. And this is [the meaning of], \"in the day of weaponry\" - \"And you shall take for yourselves, on the first day, etc.\" (Leviticus 23:40)."
