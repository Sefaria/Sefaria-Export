        "Introduction": [
            "The children of Issachar are those who possess  understanding to discern the times and know  what Israel should do (1 Chronicles 12:32). They were consecrated for specific times (Berakhot 49a), and they serve as vessels to receive their sanctity. Therefore, their souls are keenly aware of the changing times for the better, and their souls are filled with pleasant and harmonious bonds that flow with the abundance of holiness according to the beloved and pleasant order of times.",
            "They are the ones who receive the abundant gifts that the Holy One, blessed be He, bestows upon the souls of Israel, and they utilize them to do good for others. The humble will rejoice in the Lord and the poor among mankind will exult in the Holy One of Israel (Isaiah 29:19). It is the joy of the soul that delights in the sanctity of the \"hidden light\" that envelops the heads of the children of Israel, each according to their own preparation. It becomes sanctified, transcending its impurities from daily mundane sins, resembling the pattern of the World to Come, where each individual is rewarded according to their own preparation, as our Sages of blessed memory said, \"Every righteous person is handsome in the imprint of their friend's chuppah.\"",
            "Likewise, wisdom grants strength to the wise through the sanctity of time, according to their place and the hour that flows to them from the supernal holiness. Even though the entire congregation, including the Holy One, blessed be He, is holy, there is still no comparison or value in the equality of all souls in receiving. Therefore, our Sages of blessed memory said (and they learned it from Scripture): \"A person is obligated to receive the countenance of their teacher as a face-to-face encounter.\" For the sublime holiness that flows from the sanctity in time, the value of the teacher is not comparable to that of the student. Through receiving the countenance of their teacher, they become individuals whose faces are turned toward each other, influencing and receiving, becoming one flesh, like lighting one candle from another.",
            "And behold, the supernal sanctity that flows into the soul according to the times of the season is perceived through the letters of the Torah. For indeed, the soul itself is spiritual letters. Therefore, it is the custom of our ancestors to gather as a unique congregation during sacred times to receive the countenance of their teacher. This custom entails the teacher sharing words of Torah with them so that through the letters of the Torah, the abundance of the supernal holiness that flows into the teacher is transmitted to the congregants, and they, in turn, will receive from it as a flock of holy sheep.",
            "And these letters will serve as conduits through which the flow of holiness will be drawn. Consequently, the words of Torah that the holy teacher imparts to their disciples correspond to the sanctity of the time and the unique preparation of the soul. This time is not comparable to another time, and no soul is similar to its companion.",
            "And behold, the soul that delights in the holiness of the letters of the Torah, which flow to it from the higher realms through the sanctification of time, even on weekdays, it will have assistance, support, and benefit to walk in the path of Torah and fear of Heaven. This is similar to what is said in the holy Zohar regarding the interaction between a teacher and a student: \"Whoever gazes upon that word that his teacher says to him, his teacher and so on.\" From this, one can understand that the student constantly contemplates every matter from the words of Torah received from their teacher. Wisdom is called \"holiness,\" as you have said (Psalms 20:3), \"He will send you help from the sanctuary.\" With each instance, an additional level of wisdom is given to delve into one matter from within another matter.",
            "Similarly, the individual themselves, when they constantly contemplate those words of Torah that flow to them from the holiness during the sanctification of time, will also gain additional heightened wisdom on weekdays, which hints at holiness. Therefore, I have written this as a reminder for myself and for my children, all the things that have arisen in our memory regarding what the Almighty has prepared for us during sacred times.",
            "May our words be pleasing before the Lord, and may we merit complete redemption swiftly in our days, and may the Lord rejoice in His deeds."

                    "Blessed is the Holy One, Blessed is the One who gave us Torah. One should ponder on the relevance here of giving the Torah. It appears to me, however, that the letters of the Torah were also in exile in Egypt. And it was on account of the iron furnace that the exiles were able to leave their exile and come to the time of the giving of the Torah. This is what is meant by (Exodus 3:12) \"And this shall be the sign (<i>ot</i>)\" - meaning the letters (<i>otiot</i>) of the Torah. Now the 27 letters of the Torah are pure, (<i>zach</i>), and each of them consists of all of them. 27 multiplied by 27 is equal to \"Pesach, Matzah and Maror.\" Therefore these are the three things that Rabban Gamliel obligated us to declare on Pesach, in order to show the greatness of using the mouth to express the letters of the Torah which we are commanded to speak."

                    "And now, blessed are you by God, oh sweet reader. Be enlightened and understand that on this day began the revelation of the goodness of the Torah within which was hidden “the light that was good,” that light which allowed Adam to see from one end of the world to the other, and through which we can see the mysteries of the Creator. R’ Shimon bar Yochai was called “the holy lamp” because through him were revealed the secrets of Torah, that is the secret of “the light that was good” which is hidden in the Torah. Therefore his holy book is called the Zohar (lit. brilliance), meaning a light which shines from one end of the world to the other – the ‘good light’ which  is hidden away in the Torah. That is why this day is the best of days for the giving of Torah. This is when the good light in the Torah began to shone forth, as we have learned. And this day is the 33rd day of the Omer, Lag Baomer. This is the day of the hilulah (lit. rejoicing) of R’ Shimon bar Yochai, the very day on which he ascended to the highest heavens. It also makes sense to assume that he was born on this day as well, because the Holy One sits and completes the years of the righteous from day to day (Kiddushin 38a). The very day on which ‘the light that is good’ began to shine out from the Torah, that is the best of days before the giving of the Torah, is the very day on which the holy soul that would reveal the path of ‘the light that is good’ in Torah was itself revealed. That is why this holy soul was called “the holy lamp,” on the very day that he rose up to the highest heavens he commanded R’ Aba to write down all the storehouses of hidden knowledge which he had revealed in order to leave behind a blessing from the illumination of the hidden light (that is good, as it says “How abundant is the good that You have in store for those who fear You…” (Psalms 31:20)) It is preserved there for us and our children until the light of our righteous Messiah is revealed, speedily and in our day! It is as our Sages said “And God said, let there be light…” this refers to the light of the King Messiah (Pesikta Rabbati 36), in the merit of our occupation with ‘the light that is good’ which the holy lamp left behind as a blessing and life, and a light for all Israel."

And did we not know that it was another one? And it also fitting to contemplate why he told the first dream only to his brothers, but the second dream was also told to his father. And it appears that it can be explained that this dream was [truly] another, and not related to the content of the first. As the interpretation of the first one was that he would be appointed as ruler and governor in Egypt and that his brothers would come and bow down to him. And that was on account of the grain, since they came to buy grain from Egypt. Hence the dream was with the sheaves of the grain fields. And only his brothers bowed down to him then. Whereas the second dream was a different dream; that dream was with the heavenly retinue, the sun and the moon - when the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, the intention being to the future, may it come speedily in our days! Behold in his month, that is the month associated with his son, Menashe - being the month of MarCheshvan - in which the Temple will be dedicated in the future, all flesh will then come to bow down before the Lord on the holy mountain. And Yaakov, Rachel and the tribes of Yeshurun will also come to bow down. And this is [the meaning of[ of that which is written, \"bow down to me\": Meaning, in the month attributed to me, to my son, Menashe. And behold that is a different dream. Therefore he told this dream to his father as well, since the Third Temple corresponds to Yaakov, who called it a House. But behold, to dispel it from the hearts of his brothers, Yaakov said in wonder, \"Are we to come, etc. to bow down to you?\" For the intention is not only about your month. Therefore, \"his father guarded the thing.\" For he was discerning about the thing."

The discourse is called \"Oil for Lighting\": The reason why Hashem performed the miracle through oil is because the Greeks wanted to abolish the wisdom of the Torah and increase foreign wisdom, Greek philosophy. At the time of salvation, “The Jews had light” (Ester 8:16) - this refers to the Torah (Megillah 16b). Hashem performed the miracle through oil which is alluded to the wisdom of Torah, as Chazal say (Menachot 85b): “Yoav sent (a messenger) to Tekoa to bring a wise  woman from there” (Shmuel II 14:2). He sent specifically to Tekoa because the oil in Tekoa was second to none, and wherever olive oil is found, wisdom is found. (As I mentioned above several times)."

[But] is there like this in this world - people that appear with that body in the way you are appearing in that world?\" (Meaning to say, whether it once happened in this world that a person was clothed with this garments and the precious spiritual body that exists in the Garden of Eden.) He said to him, \"This thing they asked before the head of the yeshivah, etc. And he said to them, 'Indeed it has been so in this world.' From where do we [know it]? Since it is written (Esther 5:1), 'On the third day, Esther put on royal (<i>malkhut</i>) apparel.' She was clothed with that appearance from that world. <i>Malkhut</i> is the holy spirit. For behold the kingdom (<i>malkhut</i>) of the Heavens blows the spirit from the spirit of the air of that world, and Esther was clothed with it. So when she came before Ahasuerus like that and he saw that she was dressed in light, her appearance similar to that of an angel of God, his soul departed from him temporarily. (In this [manner], the verse, 'And it was (<i>Vayehi</i>), when the king saw Esther, etc.' is set aright. [Otherwise], why do I need, '<i>vayehi</i>,' which is an expression of distress? It should have said, 'And when the king saw.' Rather it is to make us understand that 'oy' and distress came - his soul departed temporarily from the great fright - so does it appear to me.) And Mordekhai was also like this, as it is written (Esther 8:15), 'Mordeakhi left the king’s presence in royal (<i>malkhut</i>) garments.' Certainly <i>Malkhut</i>) garments; it was the appearance of that world! And that is why it is written (Esther 9:3), 'since the fear of Mordekhai fell upon them.' The fear of Mordekhai, and not the fear of Ahasuerus?!?\" Rabbi Shimon said, \"How sweet are these words, fortunate is my portion! I knew that the righteous in this world are clothed by garments that are called royal (<i>malkhut</i>) garments, and it is certainly so!\"  He said to him, \"The air of the Garden of Eden blows the holy spirit which they are, and the righteous are clothed in the way that is the case in that world. And afterwards, the holy spirit sits upon the head of each and every one and crowns them, and it becomes a crown for him. And so it was with Mordekhai (in this world, so does it appear to me): As it is written, 'in royal (<i>malkhut</i>) garments' - the appearance of that world. And afterwards, 'with a magnificent crown of gold' - that is the crown that sits on the head of the righteous in that world. The Jewish people received the Torah in that fashion. As they had it until, etc.\" To here is [the Zohar]. And from here, behold 'what is yours is before you.' The custom of the Jewish people is [considered like something from the] Torah. They have followed the practice to change into different clothes during the joyful occasion in memory of the miracle and the wonder that God, may He be blessed, performed with Mordekhai and Esther. For they were clothed with precious spiritual garments that clothe the righteous in the Garden of Eden. And behold you see in the words of the Zohar that it was such with the Jewish people at the receiving of the Torah. And according to this, you can understand what our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Shabbat 88a), \"They received [the Torah] again during the days of Ahasuerus.\""
