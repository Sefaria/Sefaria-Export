            "And the essence of the trait of humility is that one contemplates that all the accomplishments that he has are not from the angle of his deeds and his wisdom, but rather that the Creator, blessed be He, effects this accomplishment from the angle of His kindness. And then he merits the aspect of inspiration from the Divine Presence, the aspect of prophecy. And that is [the meaning of] that which is written (Genesis 41:16), “Not I, God will address the peace of Pharaoh.” And Onkelos translates [it as], “It is not from my wisdom; rather the address to the peace of Pharoah will come from before God.” [Its] explanation is that Yosef had the aspect of humility, so he merited the aspect of inspiration from the Divine Presence, the aspect of prophecy.

        "Vayigash": [
            "And Judah approached him, etc.\" (Genesis 44:18). Behold, the inspiration of the Shekhinah is only in a lowly place, as our Sages say (see Sotah 5a, Zohar Ruth 98a, Berakhot 99a): \"The Holy One, blessed be He, did not rest His Shekhinah on Mount Sinai except because it is lowly, etc.\" This means that the Shekhinah only rests in a place of humility and meekness, as the Scripture says (Isaiah 57:15), \"I dwell with the lowly and the humble spirit,\" etc. It is also written (Deuteronomy 7:7), \"Not because you were more numerous than all the nations did the Lord desire you and choose you, for you are the fewest of all the nations,\" and our Sages say (Chullin 49b): \"Make yourselves small before Him.",
            "\"And the main creation of the world was in the beginning, for the sake of Israel, who are called 'reshit' (first/fruits) (Vayikra Rabbah 36:4). This is explained in the manner of the saying of our Sages (Pesikta de-Rav Kahana 12:21): 'Every day should be in your eyes as new,' meaning that every person, even if he serves the Lord constantly, nevertheless needs to reflect every day on his distance from God, and all his service is as nothing compared to what is required of him. In his eyes, it should be as if he has not yet begun to taste any pleasantness from the Lord, and he should be like a newborn today, starting to serve the Lord. He should gaze and seek to behold the pleasantness of the Lord, and he should pray to the Lord for help to begin and complete his service for Him. He should cry out for the good fortune to see the pleasantness of the Lord, and he should humble his heart greatly for the days and years that have passed over him from the day of his birth without benefiting at all from the pleasantness of the Lord. Moreover, this has greatly impaired him, and a barrier has been created that separates him from his Creator. As a result, he has distanced himself greatly from God. But from now on, let him read and pray to the Lord from a distance through a hint, like the example of a servant who is far from his master and cannot speak to him face to face, requesting his needs and the necessities of his life. Instead, he communicates with him from a distance through a hint, thereby alluding to his master and asking him to grant him his life needs. Similarly, when a person reflects on himself and finds that he is far from God, he should pray to the Lord only through this hint, which is called 'zimmurah.' As the Scripture says (Isaiah 24:16): 'From the ends of the earth we heard zimmurot,' meaning from a distance, we are heard only through hints, specifically using the language of zimmurot. This is called 'reshit,' for every day, in his eyes, is as if it is the beginning of his service to the Lord through the zimmurot. This is what Jacob said to his sons (Genesis 43:11): 'Take of the best fruits of the land,' meaning the aspect of zimmurot, as explained above.",
            "And this is the essence of the aspect of 'reshit,' the aspect of wisdom (which is called the 'revealed beginning' - Pardes Shaar 23, Roshit, 3), to contemplate within oneself the aspect of nothingness, as the Scripture says (Job 28:12): 'But wisdom, from where shall it be found?'"

            "<b>And it appears to me</b> according to that which I heard in the name of the great Maggid, may his memory be blessed for life in the world to come (it is brought in the Ohr HaMeir, at the beginning of the teaching on Rosh Hashanah):  As he said,  \"Before the sun darkens (<i>techshach</i>)\" (Ecclesiastes 12:2)\" - that [corresponds to] the fifteenth of Av. As the letters of  <i>techshach</i> are [the same as] <i>tash koach</i> (strength weakens). And on the fifteenth of Av, the strength of the sun weakens, as it is found in the Talmud (Taanit 31a). \"And the moon and the stars\" correspond to Rosh HaShanah and Hoshana Rabba. And also the holy Rabbi of Berditchev, may his memory be blessed for life in the world to come, said (Kedushat Levi, Likkutim, p. 477) that the fifteenth of Av is the beginning of the coming year regarding repentance. This is according to the approach of that which the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Sotah 2a), \"Forty days before the formation of the embryo, they announce, etc.\" For the world was created on the twenty-fifth of Elul; and there are forty days from the fifteenth of Av to the twenty-fifth of Elul. To here are his words regarding our topic."
