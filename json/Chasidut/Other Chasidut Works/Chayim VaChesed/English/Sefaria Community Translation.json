For it is is stated (Psalms 114:1), \"When Israel left Egypt, etc.\" [which is in the Hallel]. Hence that is called the Egyptian Hallel (Berakhot 56a). Yet that Hallel is not relevant to the other miracles, but rather the Great Hallel (Psalms 136). [Yet we read the Egyptian Hallel on all the holidays, and not the Great Hallel!?!] Rather the matter of Hallel is that we bring forth Kindness (<i>Chessed</i>) to the world and sweeten the restrictive forces (<i>gevurot</i>): Since we praise God, may He be blessed, He comes with pleasure. And because of that He brightens us within each person. And this is [the meaning of] what is written in it (118:5-9), \"From the strait, etc. He answered me in the broadness of the Lord. [...] It is better to take refuge, etc.\" So too, the other verses, such that they are the sweetening of the restrictive forces. And behold [the Sages], may their memory be blessed, said (Megillah 4a), \"One is obligated to read the Megillah at night and to repeat it during the day.\" That is because there are two restrictive forces, since every restrictive force is doubled. But this is not so with the forces of kindness (<i>chassadim</i>). For kindness is elemental, whereas restriction is doubled - since it is called restriction for the recipient."
