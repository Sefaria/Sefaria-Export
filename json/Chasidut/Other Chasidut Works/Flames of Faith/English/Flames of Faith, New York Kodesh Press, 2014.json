            "It is impossible to adequately thank all those who helped me in the development of this work. However, I must attempt to at least partially recognize those who helped turn the dream of an English introduction to Chasidus into a reality.",
            "No words can express my feelings of gratitude to Rav Moshe Wolfson, <i>shlit”a</i>. Rav Wolfson’s Torah ideas have shaped my perspective on life, and despite a busy schedule the <i>Mashgiach </i>made time to review this book and encourage its publication. Rav Wolfson made many important corrections to the manuscript. I am deeply humbled that the <i>Mashgiach </i>invested so many hours in this project. All I can say is a prayer, “May Hashem bless him to see much <i>nachas</i>, Jewish joy, from his children and students for many years to come.”",
            "Through Rav Wolfson’s synagogue, I met Rav Aharon Kovitz, Rav Leibish Lish, and Rav Efrayim Glassman, each of whom helped me with the content in this book.",
            "I am most indebted to Yeshiva University and its leadership for all they have provided to me. Rabbi Dr. Norman Lamm and Rabbi Zevulun Charlop deserve special praise for their efforts on behalf of Yeshiva and its students. They, together with Ms. Susan Wexner and Mrs. Bella Wexner, created the Harry and Bella Wexner Kollel Elyon. The Wexner Kollel was an intellectual home for me where I learned Torah from sages such as Rabbi Michael Rosensweig, Rabbi Mordechai Willig, and my father, Rabbi H. Reichman. In addition to Torah learning, the Wexner program provided classes in practical rabbinic skills, such as psychology, business practices, public speaking, and writing. Of all the instructors in the program, I owe a special debt to Professor Leslie Newman, the English writing coach. Professor Newman donated many hours of her time to refining this work.",
            "When the Wexners were honored for their generosity in creating the Kollel, Mrs. Bella Wexner, of blessed memory, charged the students to provide her with some <i>nachas</i>. Mrs. Wexner is no longer alive, but I pray that the inspiration Jewish hearts will garner from this work will provide much <i>nachas </i>and merit to her everlasting soul.",
            "In addition to training, Yeshiva provided me with the opportunity to teach the ideas that are in this book. I am most grateful to Rabbi M. Schmidman and Rabbi D. Rapp who first hired me to teach in the James Striar School of General Jewish Studies at Yeshiva University. The students in my classes helped refine the concepts in these lessons and have served as a source of inspiration and intellectual challenge. I am also thankful to the other leaders of Yeshiva, especially our President, Richard Joel, and Rabbi Dr. Hillel Davis.",
            "When I consider the great efforts the administrators of Yeshiva expend in developing this singular institution I am reminded of the traditional prayer for <i>oskim be-tzarchei ha-tzibbur be-emunah</i>, those who are faithfully involved in communal need, “May the Holy One provide them with their reward, and remove from them any illness, and heal their bodies, and forgive all their sins, and may He send blessing and success to all that they do.”",
            "Traditionally, a matchmaker was paid when a match he proposed was settled. If the matchmaker proposed a bride to a young man but the couple did not end up marrying each other he would not receive a fee. Chasidim relate that the <i>Divrei Chaim</i>, Rabbi Chaim of Tzanz, would pay every matchmaker, even those who suggested matches for his children that did not work out. The Rebbe explained that in Heaven, before a child’s birth, God declares the identity of the individual the child will eventually marry as well as all the proposed mates for the child. To arrive at the correct spouse one must first pass through all the suggested partners. A matchmaker who suggests a coupling helps to bring the real match closer and therefore deserves remuneration.",
            "In keeping with the tradition of the <i>Divrei Chaim </i>I thank the many individuals who helped develop this book at its various stages. I am most thankful to Rabbi Daniel Green, Rabbi Lavi Greenspan, Rabbi Rob Shur, Rabbi Feivel Smiles, Gavriel Bellino, David Sacks, Josh Marter, Yaakov Kaszemacher, Ezra Altman, and Emily Steinberg for their help.",
            "I have the privilege to serve as the Rabbi of the East Hill Synagogue of Englewood, New Jersey. The people I have met at East Hill have changed my life and the life of my family for the better. I am especially thankful to all of the members of the shul for their encouragement, probing questions, and friendship. Many members of the shul helped with various aspects of producing this book. Specifically I must thank Mr. Daniel Straus, Dr. Ron Strobel, Mr. Brian Haim, Mr. Elliot Maza, Dr. Ron Krinik, Dr. Harvey Rice, Mr. Mordy Dicker, Dr. Henry Anhalt, Dr. Larry Shemen, Moshe Greif, Mrs. Jodi Scherl, Mrs. Carol Levy, Mrs. Pam Machefsky, and Mrs. Rochelle Weisberger. Finally, special thanks to Mrs. Ruth Frommer, East Hill’s capable administrator who helped type drafts of this book.",
            "I am most grateful to Mr. and Mrs. Nader Bolour, Mr. and Mrs. Josef Bolour, Mr. and Mrs. Dan Weingarten, Mr. and Mrs. Jerry Gontownik, and Mr. and Mrs. Drew Parker for their financial help during this book’s initial phases. Last, Mr. and Mrs. Scott Korman provided the bulk of the funding for this book and as such are equal partners in the Torah that will be learned from it. May your acts of <i>chesed </i>and Torah support serve as a merit to your family and an example for all to emulate.",
            "This book was first published in 5764/2004. Ten years later, Rabbi Alec Goldstein, Kodesh Press, and Rabbi Chaim Laufer carefully reviewed and improved the text. I am most grateful to them for their efforts.",
            "This year our community lost our dear friend Mr. Mendel Balk, ע״ה. Mr. Balk was an exceptional leader, a passionate builder of Yidishket, deeply devoted to his precious family, and a soulful friend to me. He was a prime supporter of many Torah initiatives. I hope and pray that the Torah studied from this new edition will be a merit נשמתו לעילוי.",
            "No words of mine could ever begin to thank the Almighty for blessing me with a family and teachers who guide me to the path of Torah and Mitzvos. May it be His will that this book help us and the entire family of Israel reach higher levels of Torah learning, devotional prayer, acts of kindness, and love for fellow Jews.",

            "There was once a king whose only son was a source of enormous pride and joy. Then disaster struck. The young man contracted a mysterious illness, collapsed into a deathly coma, and none of the royal doctors could revive him.",
            "In desperation, a professor of herbal medicine was summoned to the palace. The specialist examined the boy and prescribed an unconventional remedy.",
            "“Grind a twenty-eight karat ruby gem-stone to a pulp, and then mix it with several common herbs and mineral water and feed it to the boy.”",
            "Many of the king’s attendants heard the professor’s words as quackery. The rare and precious stone he had requested was the centerpiece of the setting on the king’s crown. These skeptics felt that the king’s crown should not be destroyed on the directives of a charlatan. Other officials contended that their king certainly wanted his court to attempt every possible cure, regardless of cost or plausibility. The professor did not wait for the two groups to resolve their fight. He seized the crown, tore out the jewel that was its heart, and crushed the stone into granules. After feeding the potion to the prince, the boy immediately opened his eyes, and recovered fully.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This parable was related by Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi (1745-1813), one of the greatest thinkers of the Chasidic movement. His book, called the <i>Tanya </i>or <i>Likkutei Amarim</i>, is the essential handbook of Chasidic thought. He related the story to explain the timing of the appearance of the Chasidic movement.</i>",
            "The King in the parable is God, the Ultimate Sovereign. The Jewish nation is the crown prince, as we are called in the Torah, “children of God.” The Torah refers to our relationship with God in paternal terms (see Deut. 8:5). The wise professor who saved the prince was Rabbi Yisrael Baal Shem Tov,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He was born circa 1698 and passed away in 1760. The phrase <i>Baal Shem Tov </i>lit-erally means “master of the good name.” He had a good name for he always judged the deeds of others favorably, and his prayers for others brought about miracles.</i> known by the abbreviation “Besht,” who started a movement of ecstatic Jewish observance, Chasidus.",
            "In the mid-eighteenth century, the Jewish nation in Europe underwent a momentous change. After centuries of discrimination and suffering, sounds of civic, economic, and political emancipation began to resonate in small towns throughout Eastern Europe. Yet this emancipation engendered a debilitating spiritual infection, which struck the Jewish people and fully emerged once the Jews stepped beyond the strictures of the ghetto and took their place among the ranks of European citizenry. Jews began to forsake the traditions of their ancestors and assimilate into Gentile societies. To ingratiate themselves with newfound Gentile friends, millions of Jews forsook their identity and religious heritage. R. Yisrael Baal Shem Tov, the founder of the Chasidic movement, fashioned a unique remedy to this epidemic.",
            "He seized the initiative. He took the Torah, God’s crown, and extracted the wisdom of <i>Sod</i>, Jewish mysticism, the most precious jewel of the Torah. To enable the digestion of the stone, he ground it up; he translated mystical concepts into the realm of the common man; he explicated principles, popularized esoteric imagery, and encouraged spiritual practice for all. He organized the devotees of his lessons into a movement that is still vibrant in our times, Chasidus.",
            "The secrets from the inner meaning of Torah form the soul of the Chasidic movement’s thought. They inspire, revive, and inflame Jewish souls with a passion to constantly increase observance and devotion.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chasidic thought is an encounter with the depths of Jewish experience. Once your soul has been lit with the spark of Chasidus other sections of Jew-ish knowledge, such as Talmud study (in Hebrew called <i>Gemara</i>), will display similar flames. One usually considers Talmud study to be a cold, intellectual, endeavor. However, Rabbi Aharon Karliner (1736-1772), a contemporary of Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, would teach that the word “<i>Gemara</i>” means a “burning ember,” <i>gumra de-isha</i>. “For when someone learns Torah for its own sake, his heart burns with a desire to dedicate his entire being to the Master of the Universe” (<i>Beis Aharon</i>, pg. 5a). Rabbi Shraga Feivel Mendelovitz, of blessed memory, the founder of Mesivta Torah Vodaath, taught Chasidic thought to his American born students in Torah Vodaath for he felt that once inspired with the profundity of Chasidus his boys would experience Talmud study and mitzvah observance in a warmer, more passionate, and joy-filled manner (Rav Wolfson).</i> This ecstatic Jewish practice and belief has stood the test of time. For more than two centuries it has inoculated millions against the ravages of secularism and preserved the spiritual life of the Jewish nation.",
            "Chasidus emerged as a protection from the storm winds of modernity. Today’s Jewish community might benefit from a new look at the Chasidic movement’s beginnings and reflections. Intermarriage is rampant, and assimilation into American culture has become the norm. Even those Jews who fulfill their religious obligations frequently perform rituals in a lifeless and superficial way. Were we to discover the depth and soulful vitality that fill Chasidic literature, a renewed passion might flame our faltering Jewish experience with the warmth of Torah. Unfortunately, for many of my contemporary American Jews, access to the gem-stones of the Chasidim has been denied.",
            "Chasidic works are overwhelmingly in Hebrew, and few good translations exist. For the American Jew whose Hebrew is not fluent, these books are welded shut. Even those who can read Rabbinic Hebrew find Chasidic literature challenging for the Chasidic masters assumed that their readers were knowledgeable in basic mystical concepts and terms. Absent an introductory course, many try to absorb the warmth of Chasidic Torah and then give up in frustration when the texts do not seem to explain their basic assumptions.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Chasidic Masters</i>, Chapter 1.</i> This book is an attempt to fill that void. It attempts to provide an introduction to the basic terms and ideas of Chasidic texts so that once it is mastered the reader will be able to comprehend the works of the Chasidic masters directly.",
            "This book is written for the interested lay reader who may be new to Torah study. That is why I have endeavored to translate all terms into English.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">At times this book draws upon the depths of insight that emerge from the Hebrew language. Chasidus discovers inspiration through the etymology of Hebrew words. Many ideas in this book are derived from the meaning of words in different contexts. Further, the letters of the Hebrew alphabet have assigned numeric values. This book draws on the wisdom of “<i>gematria</i>,” calculating the numerical value of a word and phrase and explicating its relationship to other words or phrases that equal the same sum.<br>Another linguistic device is <i>roshei teivos</i>, different types of abbreviations, such as acronyms and acrostics. Lessons in this book might interpret a word as an acronym for a phrase with each letter representing an entire word that begins with that letter. For instance the Hebrew word <i>shevi </i>(שב\"י), “captive,” represents the phrase Shimon (ש) bar (ב) Yochai (י), Simon son of Yochai, one of the Talmudic teachers of Jewish mysticism. Since this book is designed to be understood by someone who is not fluent in Hebrew, I have attempted to explain, in plain English, all Hebrew word interpretations, so that everyone will be able to understand the ideas of this book.</i> It is also directed to the yeshiva student who is knowledgeable about Biblical narratives and Talmudic law but may be new to the world of Chasidus. Hopefully, these introductory lessons will open the door to new dimensions of observance, piety, and study."

                "The Talmud<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Niddah </i>30b.</i> teaches that the most exquisite moments of life are spent in the womb. The embryo gains insight, as it sits together with its own personal angel and is taught the entirety of Torah. A glowing candle allows them to see from one end of the world to the other. As the soul leaves the womb, the angel guides it in a final and irrevocable oath:",
                "I will be a <i>tzaddik</i>, a righteous individual. I will never take pride for virtue even if the whole world calls me a saint. In my eyes I will [always] remain like a <i>rasha</i>, a wicked person [who must still grow and improve].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibid.</i>",
                "Upon entering this world, the child is touched by his celestial mentor, and the illuminating candle, the doting angel, the Torah learning, and the solemn oath vanish from memory.",
                "Three questions arise from this Talmudic account: First, since we have no memory of this pre-natal oath, why were we led to accept it? Next, according to Jewish law, only the oaths of adults can create legal and binding obligations; therefore, why is an unborn child taking an oath? Last, considering that an oath usually serves as a guarantor to the truth of one’s words, why is the pure soul of the child not accepted as trustworthy without the oath?",
                "The questions may be answered as follows: an oath is not merely a verbal guarantee; rather it is a process that imbues an individual with added strength. We glean this understanding of the oath-taking process from two sources, the usage of such verbal commitments in the Torah and the etymology of the Hebrew word <i>shevua</i>, “oath.”",
                "<b>Oaths in the Torah</b>",
                "In the book of Genesis, after the death of Sarah, Abraham sends his trusted servant Eliezer to find a wife for Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham saw the rampant corruption among the indigenous Canaanites, and he sought a suitable daughter-in-law from a different society. Not satisfied merely to request that Eliezer avoid choosing a Canaanite, Abraham led him in an oath:",
                "I will make you swear by God, the God of heaven and earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from among the daughters of the Canaanites in whose midst I dwell. But you should go into my country and to my relatives and take a wife for my son for Isaac (Gen. 24:3-4).",
                "Abraham’s insistence on this oath is disturbing. Would he not trust Eliezer’s solemn commitment? Eliezer had been Abraham’s most loyal student.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Gen. 15:2 and the commentary of Rashi, s.v. <i>u-vein meshek beisi </i>and <i>Dammesek</i>.</i> The two had fought together and depended on one another in battle.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Gen.14:14 and Rashi’s commentary on that verse.</i> Abraham had trusted Eliezer’s loyalty to defend his life; why would he not trust Eliezer’s word? One might posit that Eliezer’s word was not trustworthy in the absence of an oath since he was not a member of Abraham’s family. This solution would not apply to a different circumstance of oath-taking in the Torah.",
                "According to Jewish mystics, Joseph was the paradigm of virtue and righteousness, the personification of <i>tzaddik yesod olam</i>, a man of such holiness that his merit sustains the entire world. Joseph was also Jacob’s favorite son, and they shared a special relationship.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Gen. 30:25 and Rashi’s comment on that verse; Gen. 37:2 and the respective Rashi; also Gen. 37:11, 37:35, 45:27-28.</i> When Jacob lay dying he called Joseph and requested burial in the Land of Israel. Although Joseph promised that he would ensure his father’s interment in Israel (Gen. 47:30), Jacob was not satisfied and demanded that an oath be sworn in God’s name: “And he [Jacob] said ‘Swear to me’ and he [Joseph] swore to him, and Israel [another name for Jacob] bowed back toward the head of the bed” (Gen. 47:31).",
                "Did Jacob really suspect that Joseph would not fulfill his final request? It is a Mitzvah to fulfill the last wishes of a dying man.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Gittin </i>15a.</i> Did Jacob fear that the paradigmatic <i>tzaddik </i>would not fulfill a moral charge? Did he think that his most beloved son’s word could not be trusted?",
                "Evidently, oaths function in the Bible as more than mere guarantees of truth-telling. They give the oath-taker added strength to attain what might otherwise be too difficult to accomplish. Abraham trusted Eliezer, and Jacob trusted Joseph, yet the goals that Joseph and Eliezer were charged to achieve were seemingly unattainable. To find a suitable spouse for his master’s son, Eliezer had to overcome his personal interests, having a daughter of marriageable age, and the opposition of both the boorish Bethuel (Besuel) and Laban (Lavan), relatives of Abraham who rejected Abraham’s mission.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Furthermore, Eliezer had to leave Abraham’s house. When Eliezer arrived to Bethuel’s home, Eliezer had to convince Bethuel and Laban to allow Rebekah (Rivkah) to marry Isaac. Abraham’s home was suffused with a spirit of sanctity, while the home of Besuel was a den of iniquity. Abraham feared that the atmosphere of Besuel’s home would affect Eliezer. In Aram, Eliezer would not be able to overcome his own biases, and he would falter and leave the task unfulfilled (Rav Wolfson).</i> To bury Jacob in Israel, Joseph had to overcome the opposition of Pharaoh, a tyrant who believed that Jacob’s physical presence in Egypt brought blessings to the land and prevented the recurrence of famine. Without their oaths, Eliezer and Joseph might have quit if their initial efforts proved unsuccessful. Perhaps they would have invoked the Talmud’s rule that “the coerced are not liable.” Their oaths called forth added strength from the core of their soul. The extra determination and fortitude enabled them to successfully complete their missions.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Or Gedalyahu </i>on <i>Parashas Vayetze</i>, contrasted with the <i>Sfas Emes </i>at the beginning of <i>Vayetze</i>. See also the <i>Sfas Emes </i>on <i>Parashas Mattos </i>(5634), who writes, “My teacher and master, my grandfather, explained the concept of <i>shevua. </i>When man accepts upon himself a commitment with his entire heart, [he swears and] this is the <i>shevua</i>, the gathering together of all the seven <i>middos </i>[character parts] within man. Once fully devoted, the name of God rests upon him.” In later lessons there will be a further explication of the seven character parts of man.</i>",
                "<b>The Words <i>Shevua </i>and <i>Sheva</i></b>",
                "Hebrew words are derivations and variations of three-letter roots. The root of the word <i>shevua</i>, “oath,” is also the root of the word <i>sheva</i>, “seven.” The verbal confluence reflects a connection between an oath and the symbolic message of the number seven.",
                "The number seven recalls the days of the week and also God’s creation of the world. On each of the seven days of creation, He formed a different elemental spiritual force. These spiritual forces devolved into the material world.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See further later lessons where the further depths to the creation narrative are revealed.</i> The number seven symbolizes these forces and the totality of the natural world’s origins.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the <i>Collected Writings of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch </i>(1808-1888), vol. 3, pgs. 96-111. Rabbi Hirsch develops the theory that the number seven represents completeness, as in the verse, “Wisdom has hewed out its seven pil-lars” (Prov. 9:1). The seven pillars of wisdom represent all the knowledge in the world. Rabbi Hirsch then symbolically interprets details of many laws such as the seven sprinklings of blood of animals offered as offerings, and the seven branches of the menorah as representing a totality.</i>",
                "How is an oath related to seven? Oath-taking invokes all of the natural forces within man. In critical situations a person may discover the enormous potential strength latent within him. A mother might manage to dash through flames to rescue her child who was trapped in an inferno. Caring relatives might spend weeks with inadequate nourishment and sleep to take care of a sick family member. During moments of trial, the adrenaline in our bloodstream increases to give us added vigor and enables us to perform at seemingly superhuman levels. Usually, in normal daily living, we utilize only a fraction of our physical strength, mental concentration, and spiritual capacity—that is, unless we enter into an oath.",
                "Oath-taking calls forth and dedicates every ounce of willpower and strength. If one swears in God’s name that a statement is true, that person is committing his or her entire being to the fulfillment of these words. An oath is a guarantor of truth because it arouses the most passionate of commitments.",
                "According to the Sages, when God declared in the Ten Command- ments, “Do not take my name in vain [through swearing],” the entire universe shook.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shevuos </i>38b.</i> Why did this command frighten the entirety of creation? Perhaps because a <i>shevua </i>summons all <i>sheva</i>, all the seven spiritual roots of creation, and invests them in the cause.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nachmanides writes, “The secret is that the word <i>shevua </i>is from the word <i>sheva</i>” (commentary to Num. 30:3). See further <i>Emunas Etecha</i>, <i>Parashas Chayei Sarah</i>, pg. 70 s.v. <i>ve-chein matzinu</i>.</i> A human is a miniature universe. Since I parallel the world, whatever I do with my soul causes a corresponding effect on the soul of the world.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See further Lessons Five and Six, where this concept is explained in greater detail.</i> When I swear I arouse all the parts of my heart; the physical world then finds all the sources of its existence aroused as well. A false oath weakens every root of mine, and that causes all the channels through which God pours life down to the world to shake with instability.",
                "Hebrew has a variety of letter sounds that are similar and therefore interchangeable. Commentators sometimes replace letters in a word with similar sounding letters in order to obtain an additional layer of meaning.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The name for this concept is <i>Osiyos Mischalfos</i>, letters which interchange. An example is the letters, <i>ayin</i>, <i>ches</i>, <i>heh</i>, and <i>aleph</i>, all of which are inter-changeable with each other. <i>Osiyos Mischalfos </i>is the guiding principle of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch’s analysis of the Hebrew language; see the Introduction to the <i>Etymological Dictionary of Biblical Hebrew </i>by Matityahu Clark. See also Rashi on Lev. 19:16, who explains that the letters <i>bet </i>and <i>peh </i>interchange, as well as the letters <i>gimmel</i>, <i>kaf</i>, and <i>kuf</i>; <i>nun</i>, <i>lamed</i>, and <i>resh</i>; <i>zayin </i>and <i>tzadi</i>.</i> One such interchangeable pair is the letters <i>bet </i>and <i>peh</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the <i>ktav ashuri </i>(Assyrian script) of Hebrew, within the black ink of the letter <i>peh </i>(פ), is a white letter <i>bet </i>(ב).</i> Through their interchange <i>sheva </i>acquires a relationship to the word <i>shefa</i>, an overflow of energy. Every <i>shevua </i>is really an awakening of a Divine emanation of spiritual energy and the source for renewed strength and commitment.",
                "<b>The Meaning of the Unborn Child’s Oath</b>",
                "The oath of the yet to be born child is a charge of strength that gives each human added energies and determination to succeed in this life’s journey. This world can be a house of horrors that is filled with trials and doubts that undermine faith. The wicked often seem to prosper and the righteous to suffer. Maintaining the inner faith that is harbored within our souls and following the faint voice of conscience despite the deafening protestations of lust and self-interest are most difficult feats. To resist the seductions of the profane and fully devote our energies to God’s work, we must commit all the spiritual forces within us. Before birth, we did not lift our hands onto a Torah scroll and swear, but every fiber of our being was charged with passion for our mission. We may have forgotten the encounter with the angel, but the invigoration from that parting persists. We have an enormous latent force, an overflowing river of spiritual energy, committed to the task to be a <i>tzaddik</i>.",

                "In Jewish practice, we continually renew the seven-fold commitment of birth through commemorating Shabbos, the seventh day. Shabbos resembles a <i>shevua</i>, an “oath.” On Shabbos, the silent devotional prayers contain seven blessings. These prayers are like an oath; they invigorate the seven parts of the heart and personality. In Chasidic literature, Shabbos is called Beer Sheva, a seven-fold well. Shabbos is similar to a well, a source of life-renewing water for the seven parts of the personality. Shabbos energizes every spiritual part of the soul so that we might redouble our efforts to serve God in this world.",

One time, while making his way through the forest between hamlets, the sky darkened and a winter storm erupted. The overcast sky soon disappeared in the black darkness of night and a thick layer of snow covered the forest paths. He lost his way and found himself alone with snowflakes and biting winds. As the hours progressed and he marched on helplessly, he lost all feeling in his fingers and toes, while his cheeks turned crimson red due to the frost. Suddenly, in the distance he saw a shimmering light. Realizing that the light must be a sign of human settlement he marshaled his final reserves of strength and made his way toward the beacon. He arrived at the light source and found that it was a travelers’ inn. He entered the motel and sat down next to the roaring fire. He then ate the dinner that was served and quickly fell asleep. The next morning, after a hearty breakfast, he received directions from the innkeeper to the next town. He then stepped out into the snow-covered forest confident that he would find his way.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Divrei Shmuel</i>, Shabbos Note 22.</i>",

He issued an edict that called on his subjects to provide him with precious stones from the different parts of his kingdom, for he desired to fashion a crown that would demonstrate to all the breadth of his rule. The loyal subjects scaled mountains and dug deep mines to find the many different types of gems in the king’s territories. A simple peasant decided that he would provide evidence that the king’s rule reached the depths of the ocean. He set out in a small boat to the middle of the sea. Then he dove into the frothing waters, to try and procure a pearl from the ocean floor. It was a dangerous dive, undercurrents swept him away from his goal, sharks lurked beneath the waves, and his lungs quickly felt as if they would burst from exhaustion. He had to rise to the surface and gulp air many times, yet he persevered and kept diving below. Eventually, he found a tiny pearl. Exhausted, he brought the pearl to the king. The king, touched by the peasant’s dedication, took the small and simple stone and made it the centerpiece of his crown.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sidduro shel Shabbos</i>, Part 5, 1:15.</i>",

His soldiers are looking for these infractions and eagerly punish those they catch; people are afraid of his men, Nevertheless, with a meager sum of two rubles I could display disobedience of this human king. You have neither policemen nor soldiers. You wrote in your Torah that Jews should not have <i>cha-metz </i>on Passover; and see, no Jew in Berditchev has a drop of <i>chametz</i>!

Similarly, the Shabbos is called a <i>shevua</i>; this is why the Torah was given to Israel on a Shabbos.

Rabbi Dr. Akiva Tatz described how a righteous face leads one to Divinity in the following passage:<br>There is a mystical idea that the highest level of the personality is crystal-clear and transparent, but the lower self, the ego clouds it. (Spiritual beauty is expressed as being transparent, Hashem’s [God’s] light shines through. When one sees a <i>tzaddik</i>, one perceives something of God; the limited human dimension has been clarified and a higher reality becomes visible. In fact the opposite of beauty, ugliness, is <i>caur</i>, the same root as <i>acur</i>, “opaque.”) (<i>Living Inspired</i>, pg. 104.)<br>Another application of this principle of the <i>Sefer Yetzirah </i>pertains to Yom Kip-pur, the holiest day of the year. The Torah calls this day <i>Shabbos Shabboson</i>, “the Sabbath of Sabbaths,” the source of all holiness. Just as there is a day, so too, there is a place that is the foundation of all holiness—the <i>Kodesh Ha-Kodoshim</i>, “the holiest of holies,” the innermost sanctum in the Temple of Jerusalem. Similarly there is a person who is filled with this type of spiritual energy: Aaron the High Priest, who is described in the verse as <i>kodesh kodoshim hu</i>, “he is holy of holies” (1 Chron. 23:13). On Yom Kippur a great unification occurs when the holiest of souls, enters the holiest place, at the holiest time. This union of themes arouses divine blessings for the coming year (<i>Arvei Nachal, Parashas Emor</i>).<br>Rav Wolfson points out that the connection between Aaron and the Holy of Holies may explain why Aaron passed away on <i>Rosh Chodesh Av</i>, the first of the month of <i>Av</i>. The first day of a month is called <i>rosh</i>, “head of the month,” for its function is like that of the human head. It expresses the essence of the month and contains in microcosmic form all of that month’s events and energy.

King David wrote that the Divine words that formed the Heavens still hover in the ether, since God renews the entire creative process every moment (see Ps. 119:89).

The holy city provides added strength and inspiration to every part of one’s being.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In truth, the entire Land of Israel parallels Shabbos. That is why in <i>Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer </i>it is written that just as God created six days of work with a seventh as Shabbos, He also created six important bodies of land, the six conti-nents, and a seventh important land, the Land of Israel. Based on this Midrash, a question of liturgical accuracy can be resolved. In the prayers for Shabbos, it is written <i>chemdas yamim oso karasa</i>, “You called it the most beloved of days.” Yet nowhere in the Holy Scriptures is Shabbos called “the most beloved of days.” In light of the above, Shabbos has the holiness and quality of the Land of Israel; adjectives about Israel are therefore true about Shabbos. The Land of Israel was called by God “most beloved” in the verse <i>Va-yimasu be-eretz chemdah</i>, “And they [the generation of the desert] rejected the most beloved land” (Ps. 106:24, <i>Tzion Ve-Arehah </i>pg. 23; see further the final lesson of the book).<br>On Shabbos each Jew receives an added soul. The Land of Israel has the holiness of Shabbos; thus, one who lives in Israel also possesses a dual complement of soul. Outside of Israel, Jewish law insists that each holy day (other than Shab-bos), such as the beginning of Sukkos, be observed for two days while in Israel the holy day’s duration is only one day. Since residents of Israel have a double soul they can internalize the holiness of the festival in a single day, Those out-side of Israel only posses half such spiritual capabilities, this is why they must observe the holy day twice to internalize its blessings (Rabbi Isaac Luriah).<br>Since the entire Land of Israel is like Shabbos, the <i>shefa chaim</i>, the “Godly life-flow for the entire world,” flows through the Land of Israel. Israel is to the rest of the universe what the heart is to the human body. The heart distributes nutrients to the limbs, and Israel distributes Godly nutrition to the rest of the world. On the level of soul, all countries are related to Israel, and that is why the nations of the world seek to stake out a claim in the holy land and refuse to accept that it belongs exclusively to the Jewish nation (<i>Emunas Etecha, Bereishis</i>, pg, 3, s.v. <i>u-va-zeh muvenes</i>).<br>The Talmud states that Israel is the highest land and that the Temple Mount in Jerusalem is the highest point within Israel. What is the meaning of this statement? From a geological perspective there are many mountain ranges that are taller than Israel. How can Israel and the Temple Mount be considered higher than the Himalayas? Rabbi Moshe Sofer (1762-1838) answered that Israel and Jerusalem as the starting points for creation are the keys to unlocking the meaning of the Talmud’s claim. Our earth and the universe as a whole are circles. The beginning of the circle can be called its highest part. Since the Temple Mount was the first place God created, it is the highest point along the circle of earth. Since Israel was created right after Jerusalem, when one compares Israel to the rest of the world’s lands it is the first and thus called the highest (heard from Rav Wolfson).<br>Both Jerusalem and the Land of Israel can be Shabbos. First, Jerusalem as the capital of the Land of Israel has within it a concentrated version of the entire Land of Israel. Furthermore, our sages teach that Jerusalem in the future will extend and fill the entire Land of Israel (<i>Shir Ha-Shirim Rabbah </i>7:10). It may be that the latent Jerusalem quality in the Land of Israel makes the Land of Israel Shabbos in place. Finally, Chasidus and Kabbalah are not attempting to draw fine distinctions. These disciplines seek to display underlying unity. They therefore highlight those aspects of institutions that bear a similarity, Thus, Jerusalem is the place of Shabbos when one compares Jerusalem to the rest of the Land of Israel, and if one compares the Land of Israel to the rest of the world, the Land of Israel is Shabbos and the other lands are the days of the week.</i> Through observance of the Shabbos in the dimension of time, we will be worthy of reclaiming the Shabbos of place, the rebuilt city of Jerusalem.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Midrash Yalkut </i>on <i>Parashas Behaaloscha </i>links Shabbos with the renewal of Jerusalem stating, “If you will observe [the obligation of] the lighting of Shabbos candles, I will show you the candle of Zion [the rebuilding of Jerusalem].” The blessing for lighting Shabbos candles, through which Jewish women enter into Shabbos, contains the phrase <i>ve-tzivvanu le-hadlik ner shel Shabbos</i>, “And has commanded us to light the candle of Shabbos.” The numeric value of the phrase is the same as the numeric value of the phrase <i>Li-Yirushalayim mevasser ettein</i>, “I will appoint a harbinger of redemption for Jerusalem.” Due to their innate congruence, observance of Shabbos will cause God to restore the glory of Jerusalem.</i>",

One of the elder Chasidim answered with a story:<br>A group of professional mountain-climbers decided to climb Mt. Everest. After several difficult days of climbing many hardened climbers tired of the challenge and left the group and only a small set of the most expert climbers continued with the climb. Eventually they reached the peak, where they discovered a young child sitting alone atop the mountain. They were astounded, “How did such a young boy climb a mountain that experienced rock-climbers could not scale?” The boy answered, “I was born here.”<br>The Chasid explained to the <i>Sfas Emes</i>, “Despite your youth, you can be our leader since you were born at the top of a mountain that your forefathers scaled.”</i> While the Talmud states that the angel of predestination<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the view of Rav Chanina, who taught that the angel <i>Lailah </i>(night) is the authority for conception. <i>Lailah </i>takes the seed and brings it before the Heavenly throne and queries the Almighty, “Master of the World, what will this one be, strong or weak? Wealthy or poor? Wise or foolish?” But he does not ask whether it will be a <i>tzaddik </i>or a <i>rasha</i>, for Rav Chanina taught, “All is in the hands of Heaven bar the fear of heaven, that is in the hands of man” (<i>Niddah </i>16b).</i> does not declare the spiritual level the child will attain because each individual must attain holiness through his own efforts, that is merely the norm.

                "Tzaddik yesod olam <b></b>(Prov. 10:25) is the verse that teaches that the <i>tzaddik </i>is the foundation of the world. The physical world that we see is sustained by the spiritual gifts and flows of blessing that God continually pours into it. This <i>shefa eloki</i>—divine abundance of good—comes through the purest human soul, the <i>tzaddik</i>. The <i>tzaddik </i>loves every Jew and all of God’s creatures with thoroughly dedicated affection.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Maharal (Rabbi Yehudah Loew of Prague, 1512-1609, a great Kabbalist, philosopher, and educator) in his commentary to the <i>Aggadah </i>explains that a Jewish leader such as the High Priest is the heart of the nation. All limbs are connected to the heart and receive their life from it, and all Jews are attached to the <i>tzaddik </i>and are nourished through him (<i>Makkos </i>11a). “The <i>tzaddik</i>, the leader and shepherd of Israel, is the very heart of the people of Israel” (<i>Chasidic Dimensions</i>, pg. 115, quoting <i>Tikkunei Zohar </i>21:50b).<br>The <i>tzaddikim </i>of all times share the common denominator of absolute attachment, commitment, and devotion to God, Torah and Israel. As such they follow and share in the qualities of the first and greatest leader and shepherd of Israel: Moses. In fact, they are regarded as extensions and reflections of Moses. Thus it is said that there is not a generation without a leader like Moses. This is not simply in terms of an analogy, but in a quite real sense: an extension and emanation of Moses exists in every generation, in every <i>tzaddik</i>….<br>This Moses-aspect goes further: Moses had a <i>neshamah kelalit</i>, a comprehensive soul. His soul was a root-soul which compounded all the souls of his generation: they were all rooted in his soul. Thus it is also with the <i>tzaddikim</i>-leaders of every generation: they, too, are comprehensive root-souls compounding the souls of their respective generations. In this sense they are the leaders and the shepherds of their generations in every respect that Moses was in his. For the head of the generation is the whole of that generation (<i>Chasidic Dimensions</i>, pgs. 101-102).<br>The <i>tzaddik</i>’s overwhelming love for creation leads him to be gentle to all. As a result, even when rebuking sinners he will express his displeasure in muted terms:<br>I remember that they once related to my father, of blessed memory, that when our great master, Rabbi Ahron Rokeach of Belz, may his merit protect us, was in Munkatch policemen came to arrest him. These evildoers beat him, pushed him, and treated him so roughly that he could not stand their evil, and he said, “They are slightly strange, these <i>Goyim</i>.” This was already a very harsh critique for his standards. I remember when they related this to my father he smiled slightly. This is the way of <i>tzaddikim</i>, they are good to all (Rabbi Yekutiel Yehudah Halberstam [1905-1994], the Rebbe of Tzanz-Klausenberg, in his book <i>Imros Tzaddikim</i>, pg. 22, Story 5).</i> His love of existence connects all of creation to the <i>tzaddik</i>, and they receive their life through him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Tanya</i>, Chapter 2. Even the sinners are connected to the <i>tzaddik</i>, and they benefit from him. The Almighty will periodically cause the <i>tzaddik </i>to sin, so that he can fall to the realm of sinners, connect with them, and then mystically elevate their souls with his subsequent return and elevation.<br>The Rebbe of Klausenberg explained that the <i>tzaddik </i>loves his nation; that is why his personal penances for his own misdeeds are performed for the sake of all the sinners in the nation, and thousands of souls are uplifted in a hidden and mystical manner through his personal improvement.<br>The true path of the Baal Shem Tov and his disciples was that they would perfect themselves first before they would pass judgment on others. When the Baal Shem isolated himself in the Carpathian Mountains, he rolled in the snow to atone for his misdeeds, and he broke the frozen ice atop the river in order to immerse himself in the waters beneath the ice. During those moments tens of thousands of Jews felt the removal of the foreskins covering their hearts and remembered their Maker. This is the meaning of the verse, “There is no speech and there are no words; their sound is unheard” (Ps. 19:4) and despite that, “Their line goes forth throughout the earth, and their word reaches the farthest ends of the land” (v. 5). In this manner the Baal Shem’s students made thousands of returnees to the faith. The masters R. Elimelech of Lizhensk (1717-1786) and Rabbi Aharon of Karlin (1736-1772) brought eighty thousand Jews back to observance. They accomplished this through the maxim of Hillel, “Love the creations and bring them closer to Torah.” They loved all. They knew to defend and find merit in the behavior of Jews, and they accepted all guilt upon themselves. As Rabbi Yishmael stated in the Mishnah, “Children of Israel, I am your atonement.” Through fixing their own internal minute flaws, they caused the entire world to be filled with a spirit of <i>teshuvah</i>, return to God (<i>Imros Tzaddikim</i>, pg. 23-24).<br>Our forefather Abraham brought people to observance through meeting them and impressing upon them the truth of monotheism. Our forefather Isaac was very restricted; he did not venture forth into human society, yet he too brought thousands of strangers under the rubric of observance. Isaac’s influence was affected in the <i>tzaddik </i>mode. When he learned Torah, or improved himself, these acts caused thousands of others to move closer to monotheistic belief and practice (Rav Wolfson).<br>Even as the <i>tzaddik </i>is the channel for the Divine effluences to the world in general, so he is also an intermediary for the people of his generation to ascend to Divinity.<br>A common denominator establishes a relationship. On the spiritual level, any commonality, even if limited to a single aspect, already establishes an inherent oneness. When joining different parts of water they become one for every species attaches itself to its own kind. So, too, the <i>tzaddik </i>is unified with those who became sanctified through his holiness and is able to raise them along with him. Moreover, as he is the comprehensive soul of his generation, he can elevate all and everything that is rooted in his soul. By means of his own good deeds and service of G-d he can elevate even the souls of the wicked.<br>In this context, the <i>tzaddik </i>will sometimes appear involved with mun-dane affairs. He is seen engaging in mundane speech or the telling of seemingly inconsequential stories, or otherwise dealing with the masses on their own level. This behavior would seem incompatible with his sub-lime status. Externally he appears to have lowered and degraded himself, to have stepped aside from his attachment to G-d. In truth, however, he is and remains in a constant state of <i>deveikus </i>[attachment to God] in all he does. His anomalous behavior is but for the establishing of a relation-ship with the simple and the lowly. Thus he is able to raise them to higher levels (<i>Chasidic Dimensions</i>, pgs. 109-110).<br>R. Aryeh Leib, the author of <i>Aryeh de-Bei Ila’ah</i>, once said,<br>When I was a young man I thought that I would lead the entire world to a path of holiness. As the years went by I realized, I cannot change the entire world, but I thought that at least I will change my entire hometown. Eventually I saw that this too was unattainable so I decided that I will correct my entire family. Now in my old age I say, “I wish and hope that I will be able to fix myself.” I believe that the meaning of this saying was that in his older years he recognized that when he learns Torah in holiness and purity he does not need to seek out sinners and impress upon them to return to observance, the holiness that shines in the world from his Torah will accomplish that job for him (<i>Imros Tzaddikim</i>, pg. 32).</i>",

This is analogous to entering a perfumery: though one will not sell or buy anything there, nonetheless, when leaving the shop he and his garments will have absorbed the pleasant scent, and this good scent will not depart from him all day long. Likewise, he who associates with <i>tzaddikim </i>is influenced by their ways and good deeds (<i>Chasidic Dimensions</i>, pg. 94, quoting <i>Pirkei de-R. Eliezer</i>, Chapter 25).</i>",

The essence of the <i>tzaddik </i>is his abnegation of self, his <i>mesiras nefesh</i>. The <i>tzaddik </i>does not perform Mitzvos for material benefit nor for spiritual rewards. He has nullified any sense of self and is exclusively dedicated to servicing the Almighty for Divine reasons. (See <i>Imros Tzaddikim </i>pg. 23, story 2, where the Klausenberger Rebbe related an example of the dedication of <i>tzaddikim</i>. The son of the <i>Divrei Chaim </i>would wholeheartedly express and manifest a willingness to suffer enormous pain and hardship of the sake of God at every moment of his life. See also <i>Chagigah </i>12b. The Talmud teaches that <i>tzaddikim </i>are constantly offering all that they possess, including their lives, to God. This sacrifice continues even after their earthly passing. In the next world, every day they offer their souls to God again.) As a result, the <i>tzaddik </i>is willing to sacrifice all, from physical pleasure to spiritual delight, for the sake of God’s commands. A businessman attached to the <i>tzaddik </i>will receive a divine <i>shefa </i>of wealth that first went through the <i>tzaddik </i>(while belonging to the <i>tzaddik</i>, the <i>shefa</i>-gift was in a sensitive form and not necessarily wealth). Since the <i>tzaddik </i>is always giving to Heaven, the businessman’s wealth is charged with the character of the <i>tzaddik</i>.

We may have been created with the potential of a <i>beinoni </i>and do not have an innate ability to reach the level of a <i>tzaddik</i>, who is not even attracted to misdeed. Man’s purpose is to provide pleasure to the Divine through living a life of Torah. God may not want of us to be a <i>tzaddik</i>.

At the height of passion, we may reach the level of <i>tzaddik</i>. The material is repulsive, God’s infinite love and generosity fill us with a burning passion to come close to Him, to cleave to Him and feel Him in every fiber of our being.",
                "<i>Tzaddik</i>-hood is also relevant due to <i>ibbur neshamah</i>, “soul impreg- nation,” which happened to Pinchas. According to the <i>Zohar</i>, Pinchas was impregnated with the souls of Nadav and Avihu<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">94</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Zohar</i>, <i>Parashas Pinchas</i>, pg. 213b. See also the writings of the Ari, <i>Sha’ar Ha-Gilgulim, Hakdamah </i>32, that Pinchas really had four different souls within him: he was born with one soul, then he received the soul of Nadav and Avihu, later on he received the soul of Eliyahu Ha-Tishbi, and the soul of Elijah from Benjamin.</i> as a reward for his bravery that saved the Jewish nation. The Torah, therefore, describes him as “Pinchas son of Elazar, son of the priest Aaron.” The seemingly misplaced comma after the word Elazar indicates that Pinchas was the son of Elazar by virtue of his own soul and also the son of Aaron the High Priest due to the souls of Nadav and Avihu (Aaron’s sons who had died earlier) that had entered his body.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Another example of <i>ibbur neshamah </i>is found in the writings of the <i>Me’or Enayim </i>(Rabbi Menachem Nachum Twersky of Chernobyl, 1730-1797). The <i>Me’or Enayim </i>explained that the reason why there is a powerful urge to share good news is <i>ibbur neshamah</i>. At the moment when one brings good tidings, the soul of Elijah the prophet, the <i>Mevasser Tov</i>, the person who will bring the news of the ultimate redemption, enters into one’s soul.<br>Using this principle one can understand why Serach bas Asher was counted as two individuals in the count of the members of Jacob’s family that went down to Egypt (see <i>Bereishis Rabbah</i>, <i>Parashas Vayigash </i>94:9). Since she brought the good news of Joseph’s survival to Jacob, she had two souls, her own and the soul of Elijah, so she was counted twice. Perhaps it was this soul of Elijah within her that caused her to enter Heaven alive, as Elijah did. (The <i>Targum Yonasan</i>, <i>Parashas Vayigash</i>, writes that Serach entered Heaven while still alive.)<br>Serach’s added soul teaches an important lesson about exile. Exile is not a permanent state. At the onset of Jewish subjugation a member of the community harbored the soul of Elijah, the harbinger of redemption. Thus the light of redemption started to glow with the beginning of exile to comfort the Jews and inform them that their salvation was already set in place, and it only had to be revealed. The full spelling of the letters of Serach’s name is <i>sin</i>, <i>yud</i>, <i>nun</i>, then <i>resh</i>, <i>yud</i>, <i>shin</i>, then <i>ches</i>, <i>yud</i>, <i>tav</i>, which has the <i>gematria </i>1288, same as the phrase, <i>Yittaka be-shofar gadol u-vau ha-ovdim</i>, “[On that day the ultimate redemption] will be heralded through a great shofar and the lost ones will come [to God’s home in Jerusalem]” (Isa. 27:13). This correlation further indicates that Serach had the soul of Elijah who, like the great shofar, sounds the call of the ultimate return to Israel (<i>Emunas Etecha</i>, <i>Parashas Vayigash</i>, 5756).</i>",

Even when every act, feeling, and thought, is pure, see yourself as a <i>beinoni</i>, with lusts and desires as virulent as those of a <i>rasha</i>, and this way you see yourself as if you were evil but not actually a <i>rasha</i>.

                "Man is composed of two opposing components. He has a body that was initially formed from dust and is coarse like the physical world. Man is also the guardian of a soul, a fragment of Divinity, which God “blew” into Adam.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Midrash (<i>Bereishis Rabbah </i>12:8, Rashi’s version) describes the composite nature of man in the following text.<br>Great is peace, for when God created His world He made peace between the higher [spiritual] creations and the lower [physical] creations. On the first day He created in both realms, as is written, “In the beginning God created Heaven and Earth.” On the second day He created in the spiritual realm, as is written, “And God said: Let there be a firmament.” On the third day He created in the lowly realm, as is written, “And God said: Let the earth sprout grasses.” On the fourth day He created in the Heavenly realm, as is written, “And God said: Let the Heavenly lights appear.” On the fifth day He created in the lower realm, as is written, “And God said: Let the waters swarm.” On the sixth day He wished to create man. God then said, “If I create Him from the Heavenly, then the spiritual will exceed the physical by one creation and there will be no peace in the world. If I create him from the lowly then the physical will be one more than the spiritual and there will be no peace in the world. Therefore, I will create him from the higher and lower realms for the sake of peace.” This is what is meant by the verse, “And God formed man dust from the earth”—[man is] from the lowly, and, “He blew in his nostril a soul of life”—[man is also] from the Heavenly.<br>Hebrew names manifest the essential nature of an item. The essence of man can be found in his name <i>Adam</i>. The letter <i>aleph </i>is a composite of three letters, two letters <i>yud </i>(one on the right and the other to the left) and a <i>vav</i>. The <i>gematria </i>equals 26, which is the numerical value of God’s name of being (<i>yud </i>then <i>heh </i>then <i>vav </i>and <i>heh</i>). The <i>aleph </i>of <i>Adam </i>recalls <i>Alufo shel olam</i>, “The Master of the world,” for man has a part of Divinity within him. The remaining two letters spell the word <i>dam</i>, “blood.” Blood is the home for the animal soul of man. Thus man is a union of Divine Soul with animal flesh (Rav Wolfson).

The next town was only a few miles away, but he could not walk, and he could not afford to pay for a horse and buggy to transport him.",

Eventually, they started talking to each other, and the invalid realized that he and the blind man both sought the same destination.",
                "He recommended that the blind man carry him.

The soul knows that we are on earth in order to display the Divine’s rule and thus mend His world. The soul sees ultimate reality, what truly matters and what real pleasure is. Alone, the soul is an impotent invalid. For its <i>tikkun</i>, to accomplish its mission of performing Mitzvos and learning Torah in this sphere of existence, it needs a body.",

If the blind man had ridden atop the invalid, he would not have been able to see afar in order to protect the invalid from robbers who lay in ambush, nor would the invalid with his atrophied legs have been able to carry the blind man’s weight.

                "<b>The Differing Attractions of the Body and the Soul</b>",
                "Everything in nature seeks to return to its root. So as well is a child always attracted to his parental home. Home as the source of one’s life has the quality of a root, and branches are attracted to their roots. Consider the strength of the bond between father and child. The father is the source of the son, he is a root, and the son is an offshoot. Since the attraction to source is so powerful the son seeks to emulate his father and earn his father’s approval.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tzion Ve-Arehah</i>, pg. 31.</i> Similarly every man is attracted to his wife, and when single he feels forlorn and incomplete. This too stems from the need to reconnect to one’s roots. Before birth each soul is a duality, with a male half and a female half. When we are born, only half of a soul enters the world at a time. There is another half, of the opposite gender, that is born into another family. The urge for marriage is a desire to return to the perfect state, the most natural form in which we were originally created. Marriage is not a union of disparate individuals; it is a reunion of the halves that were initially one soul.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See further <i>Made in Heaven</i>, pg. 1, note 1. The primordial unity of souls is hinted at in the verse <i>hemmah me-hevel yachad</i>, “They are together from mist.” Since the point of mere soul mist, male was together with female. Perhaps this concept can explain a difficulty that is found in Rabbinic sources about mar-riage. Legal authorities stress that marriage should be performed with symbolic omens of blessing. For instance, ideally one should marry at the beginning of the lunar month when the moon, the symbol of the Jewish nation, is growing in luster. Second, there is a widespread custom to place the wedding canopy under the stars, the artifact of God’s blessing to Abraham that Jews will be as plentiful as the celestial lights. Yet the Rabbis derived the laws of marriage from the purchase of the <i>machpelah </i>cave, the Tomb of the Patriarchs, where Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, and Jacob and Leah are interred. Can a cemetery and death be a good omen? The answer is yes, the <i>machpelah </i>cave indicates the heights of union married individuals can reach. Marriage is not merely a partnership of bodies and lives, it is a reunion of souls. As a result it does not have to end. The body stops living at the point of death but the soul lives on and a marriage where husband and wife are fully connected to each other, continues after death. Even in the next world the two souls are fused. That is why our patriarchs and matriarchs were buried as couples in the same cave, to indicate that during their lifetimes they had fully fused their person-alities, and therefore the bond fully continued on a soulful level after death. Perhaps the name <i>Chevron </i>(where the <i>machpelah </i>cave is located) reflects this concept, since <i>Chevron </i>stems from the word <i>chibbur</i>, “connection.” Deriving the laws of marriage from the purchase of the <i>machpelah </i>cave is a wonderful omen, showing that in marriage an absolute unity can be achieved during the lifetime of the couple and that union can continue after physical death (<i>Emunas Etecha</i>, <i>Parashas Vayetze</i>, pg. 86).<br>Every nation’s root is their homeland; that is why Englishmen are loyal to England and Americans are loyal to America. The root of the Jewish nation is the Land of Israel. That is why Jews are innately attracted to the Land of Israel. In the realm of person, the roots of the Jewish people are our forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. God introduced Himself to each with commandments about the Land of Israel. God’s first words to Abraham were <i>Lech lecha</i>, “Leave your land, birthplace, and family and go to the Land that I will show you [Israel]” (Gen. 12:1). To Isaac, He said, “Do not go down to Egypt; reside in the land that I will command you to stay there. Stay in this land [Israel]” (Gen. 25:2-3). And Jacob’s first message was, “I am the God of Abraham…. The land that you are lying on will be given to you and your descendants” (Gen. 28:13). Since the land of Israel is the root of the nation in the dimension of space, in the dimension of people our roots first began their relationships with God through hearing of the bond to the land (<i>Emunas Etecha</i>, <i>Parashas Lech Lecha </i>5759).<br>The ultimate redemption will return Jewry to their land and thus will return us to our root. Since marriage is also a return to the root, marriage is the symbol of the redemption. That is why in the blessings celebrating marriage the seventh blessing requests the ultimate redemption. At a time of return to a root it is fitting to pray for the ultimate return to the Source. Thus, the prophet Jeremiah promised, “Once again it will be heard in the cities of Judea and in the outskirts of Jerusalem the sounds of joy and gladness, the sounds of groom and bride, the sounds of people declaring, let us thank God” (Jer. 33:10-11).</i>",

Every human has a body that is his animal or turkey part, and a soul, that is a prince as the son of God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">113</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On the verse, <i>Ve-gam ha-nefesh lo timmalei</i>, “And the soul as well will not be satisfied” (Eccl. 6:7), the Midrash compares the relationship of body and soul to a marriage of unequals:<br>It is like a village peasant who marries the king’s daughter. Even if he were to bring her many luxurious items they would be worthless in her eyes since she is the daughter of the regent. He can never provide for her according to what she expects. So too the soul is the daughter of the King; even if the body brings her all the physical pleasures of the world she will not be satisfied, for she is Heavenly.</i> We should stress our soul and the fact that we are the children of the King of Kings. Yet the prince thinks he is a turkey. We so often immerse ourselves in bodily concerns that we view them as the sum of our essence. Physical desires become our needs and the body’s urges our obligatory behavior. We are the prince who is certain that he is a turkey.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Song of Songs (1:9-10), King Solomon compared the beloved to the chained horse of Pharaoh’s chariot. The work <i>Afikei Yehudah </i>explains the verse to refer to the themes of Rebbe Nachman. The horse is the body, and the charioteer is the soul. When the chariot leaves the stable, the horse is in the lead and it imagines that it is the master. The body, since man is aware of it first, thinks it is the master and the essence of life. A few minutes after the stable doors open, the viewer will see the charioteer and the ropes that control the horse. An individual who controls his body displays his soul as his truest self (quoted in <i>Limmudei Nisan</i>, Part 1, pg, 322).</i>",
                "The wise man used the turkey misconception to heal the prince and free him from his delusions. As a turkey, the prince had to act like the other turkey (the wise man), since turkeys cannot be different from each other. Guided correctly, the body itself, its physical urges, can further the cause of holiness and eventually become saintly.",
                "Rebbe Nachman’s lesson can serve as a source of comfort. Even if I feel that I am lost in a morass of physical urges and I am naked of my spiritual dignity, there is still hope. I can be rescued by a wise man, a <i>tzaddik</i>, who will descend to my level and attach himself to me. The <i>tzaddik </i>will then show me how to channel my physicality and turn a turkey into a prince of God’s kingdom.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">115</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Wolfson did not quote this story of Rabbi Nachman in this lesson.

                "The inner wisdom of Torah teaches that the relationship between the physical body and the Divine soul is like that of a garment; the body clothes the soul. In mystical terminology, <i>oros</i>, “lights,” is the term for soul-like forces,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">117</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mystics use the term “light” to describe the soul and other spiritual enti-ties. Light is one of the least physical of items in our material world. It cannot be grasped and held, thus it represents the spiritual, non-tangible, entities. Light also provides a clear field of vision and is a universal symbol of purity. Further-more, it spreads out quickly just as spirituality causes a person to spread himself out and do acts that bring honor to God. Additionally, light was the first creation and thus it represents the source of existence. Rabbi Yechiel Bar Lev suggested that light represents an extremely strong degree of connection to root. If you cut a branch off a tree, the branch will no longer grow but it will not disappear; it continues to exist. However, if you sunder a ray of light from its root, for example by closing a window, thus separating the rays from the sun, the room will become dark because light detached from its root ceases to exist. Light represents the spiritual dimension since we must be totally connected to the root and if we are not connected to the Divine we cannot exist.

                "Consider a lamp in your living room as an example of <i>oros </i>and <i>keilim</i>. Light in the elemental form is soul-like. It is the <i>or</i>, “light.” Essential light is clothed in the <i>keli</i>, “vessel,” of the light bulb. Light itself—pure, absolute, and unlimited in any way—would be so bright that no one would benefit from it. In a light bulb, light is restrained so that it can be appreciated. This is the function of all <i>keilim</i>. They limit the <i>oros </i>to enable benefit.",
                "The light bulb is an <i>or</i>, a soul-like light, relative to the lamp shade, its <i>keli</i>—vessel. The light bulb on its own would be too bright for anyone to benefit, the shade around it reduces the glare so that its rays are soft and helpful. Body is light to clothes as its vessel. The clothes conceal the body so that it is not seen in its naturalness.",
                "The soul is light to the body as vessel. The soul on its own is like pure unlimited light. It is overwhelming. Just as a light fixture limits absolute radiance and cloaks it in a manageable form, the body obscures the light of the soul.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">118</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Another pair of terms that describe this relationship is <i>chomer </i>and <i>tzurah</i>. <i>Chomer </i>literally means “matter,” and it is body-like or vessel-like. <i>Tzurah </i>liter-ally means “form,” and it is the soul or light to matter. Within man the soul is the <i>tzurah</i>, and the body is the <i>chomer</i>. See further <i>Yedid Nefesh </i>1:5.</i> Body as vessel to soul as light seems to mean that the two are opposing forces since concealing is the opposite of revealing.",
                "The soul is the source of life; it is what gives life. The body receives life from the soul. The body is a receiver to soul as a giver. Here again, body and soul are opposites for taking is the opposite of giving, just as dimming is the opposite of illuminating. A deeper look will reveal that the definition of body and soul as light and vessel is the reason why study of the body can teach about the soul.",
                "We can delve deeper. A vessel need not always dim the light. Sometimes the vessel becomes pure and radiant. Then the vessel itself becomes light-like. For instance, a lampshade can become translucent so that the light bulb shines through it without being dimmed at all. In such cases the lampshade is indistinguishable from the bulb, and one might say that the lampshade produces light, for it loses its identity to the light bulb. The body is the vessel of the soul, yet once the body is purified it will not oppose the soul nor will it hide the soul.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“The body should reflect the <i>neshamah </i>perfectly; [it] should serve the soul in perfect loyalty. Never should the body stray after its own desires. It should be a vessel, a tool which obeys its control dimension totally selflessly. It should be like a vehicle driven only from within, its very existence justified only as a loyal servant. At the Creation, the body of Adam was just that. It was an ethereal, luminescent structure which revealed the spiritual content” (<i>Living Inspired</i>, pg. 118). “The garments of the world, the covering of Adam before he sinned were of <i>or</i>, ‘light.’ After the sin, the covering became skin. The root <i>or </i>has the silent <i>aleph—</i>it is light, spiritual, all revelation. The root [for the Hebrew word for skin] spells not only “skin” but “blind” too—the covering which revealed has become a covering which obstructs” (<i>Living Inspired</i>, pg. 120). When one purifies his body he is, in some measure, returning to the state of Adam before the sin.</i>",

Royal robes cover the king, but they reveal his royalty.

Thus the body obscures the soul and reveals the soul.</i> Every <i>keli </i>can become an <i>or</i>, and the ability to become a light is constantly latent within it.

                "Lust is the body’s strongest impulse. At the same time, lust is a mask of a Heavenly and soulful force, <i>chesed</i>, the desire to spread out and connect with others.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">121</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Lev. 20:17, the Torah states, <i>Ve-ish asher yikkach es achoso bas aviv o vas immo... chesed hu ve-nichresu le-einei benei ammam</i>, “A man who marries his sister, daughter of his father, or daughter of his mother... it is <i>chesed</i>, and they will be cut off before their nation. ” The Baal Shem Tov explained that the verse included the word <i>chesed </i>to teach that lowly lustful desires are a misapplication of the Heavenly drive for <i>chesed</i>. The verse is bemoaning the disgrace saying, “Lust? How could you do that, to misapply <i>chesed</i>, the most radiant and important of character traits?”</i> Lust is when I seek to connect with them for my own selfish pleasure. <i>Chesed </i>is the elevated form of this urge; the desire to connect with others in order to give and to help them and an urge to attach oneself to God. Lust as the most virulent bodily desire teaches that generous giving is the most powerful urge of the soul. The body’s lust drive is enormously powerful; that should teach us how deeply the soul desires <i>chesed</i>.",
                "Perhaps the following thought might help one overcome improper drives: The animal soul is ascendant when lust is actualized. If one acts according to the dictates of selfish desires one is little better than the beasts of the wild. On the other hand, the Heavenly soul shines through the body when one displays selfless giving. When experiencing lust temptation, the body is reflecting a fallen urge of the soul. It is a moment to engage in <i>chesed</i>—selfless giving to other humans and to the cause of holiness.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Raising lust is a very high level of service of the Almighty. When overcome with such feelings contemplation that at its root it is a desire for divinity and turning those passions towards feeling love towards Him or His children is a difficult task. Chasidim demanded it of themselves.<br>The Baal Shem Tov taught that God created human emotions to teach man how to serve his Master. The Besht explicitly said, “Man must believe that when an evil lust falls into his heart it was sent to him from God, for the time has come for him to serve God with love of Holiness. Heaven is hinting to him, ‘Turn love to the love of God.’ Once the heart is already in a state of desire it is easier to reach love of Divinity. Similarly, when a great fright falls upon man, he should know with certitude that this fear was sent from Heaven to tell him, ‘Now is the time to arouse your own innate fear of God.’ So it is with all the emotions” (<i>Divrei Shalom</i>, <i>Purim</i>, pg. 38; see also <i>Degel Machaneh Ephraim, Parashas Eikev</i>)<i>.</i></i>",
                "The reason for the centrality of lust and generosity is that <i>chesed</i>, the Divine and elevated form of this drive, was the foundation of the world; as scripture states, <i>olam chesed yibbaneh</i>, “The world was built on <i>chesed</i>” (Ps. 89:3). God’s creation was an act of total love, and he placed <i>chesed </i>as the foundation of a Heavenly personality.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\"></i>See <i>Pachad Yitzchak </i>on Rosh Hashanah for his discussions of <i>chesed</i>, and see the <i>Kuntres Ha-Chesed </i>in <i>Michtav Me-Eliyahu</i>.",
                "Even the physical form of the body can teach lessons about the <i>nefesh Elokis</i>, the Godly soul. Look at the body; from the form of the body, and the various functions its parts fulfill, you may learn about the nature of the soul. For instance, the tongue is the vessel for speech. The tongue has unique characteristics. It does not have a bone. It can easily be burnt and damaged. This is a lesson about the soul. Soulful speech is soft and delicate. Soulful rebuke is delivered to others through a context of love and in an oblique manner that does not offend.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See further <i>Mishbetzos Zahav</i>, <i>Parashas Noach</i>. The tongue has two uses: it enjoys taste that no one else will enjoy, and it reveals to others insights through oral communication. This teaches that some ideas, such as lessons of the revealed Torah should be shared, while other concepts, such as the secrets of how God created the universe are to be hidden and each individual should enjoy them by himself (see further <i>Pachad Yitzchak </i>on Rosh Hashanah, <i>Ma’amar </i>1).<br>The Maharal explains that the reason why the human body is naturally straight and we do not walk on all fours with our head to the earth is that God wanted to send a message to man through the human form. “Because God’s presence is not visible in this world, it is easy for people to come to sin. God compensated for this physical blind-spot with the spiritual ability to perceive and fear God. Our erect human posture directs our gaze upwards to the Heavens. There we observe God’s presence... and we are less inclined to sin” (Maharal of Prague on <i>Pirkei Avos</i>, pg. 81; see further <i>Derech Chaim</i>, end of the commentary to Mishnah 2:1).</i>",

The Torah contains 248 <i>mitzvos aseh </i>and 365 <i>mitzvos lo ta’aseh</i>. Performance of the <i>mitzvos aseh </i>draws life to the limbs from the “white” of the soul, while observing the prohibitions of <i>mitzvos lo ta’aseh </i>brings added strength and purity from the “red” of the soul.

The color red represents <i>din</i>, “harsh justice.” <i>Mitzvos aseh </i>require us to take actions; we must extend ourselves to express our love for God. What we do is the basis of who we are; thus our deeds provide added life to the white bones, the body part that frames a person’s form and shape. <i>Mitzvos lo ta’aseh </i>are injunctions, forbidding acts that are injurious to our spiritual well-being. Observance of these laws entails constriction, pulling oneself in, and refraining from what our sensory urges seek. Scrupulous adherence to the commands of <i>Mitzvos lo ta’aseh </i>is thus an exhibition of <i>din</i>—fear and justice—setting boundaries and rigorously maintaining them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our forefather Abraham was the ultimate paradigm of <i>chesed</i>, Heavenly giving and love. Abraham even sought to perform kindness with idolators and the sinners of Sodom (see <i>Parashas Vayeira</i>).

Isaac’s greatest moment was when he allowed himself to be bound on the altar, an act of remarkable discipline and withdrawal. Isaac is the personification of <i>mitzvos lo ta’aseh</i>. As a result, when God first appeared to him and gave Isaac a Mitzvah to live in the Land of Israel, it was phrased as a prohibition, “Do not go down to Egypt, stay in this land…” (Gen. 25:2). (<i>Emunas Etecha</i>, <i>Lech Lecha</i>, 5759.)</i> The goal of <i>Mitzvos lo ta’aseh </i>is to preserve the spiritual well-being of the person; thus they parallel sinews that tie the muscles to the bones and maintain the person.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>nefesh </i>part of the soul is the part that has 613 “pieces” that correspond to the various body parts.

A simple Israelite outside the Holy Land can study the Torah’s discussion of the Mitzvos of priest-hood or of the Land of Israel. Intellectual thought of these commandments and discussing their laws are partial fulfillments of these Mitzvos. Another way for each individual to fulfill all 613 obligations is through love.

His body is constantly being purified through the Mitzvos that he performs and it becomes a vessel like the translucent lampshade. It does not oppose the soul; rather it reflects God’s glory to all.

If you shake the gloved hand of a friend, you would not characterize it as “touching Jake’s glove.” Rather you would describe the event as, “I shook Jake’s hand.” Since the glove pales in importance to the hand it covers. Similarly, the body is merely the clothing of the soul. It should pale in importance to the soul. Where there is a conflict between the will of the body (the <i>nefesh ha-bahamis</i>) and that of the soul (the <i>nefesh Elokis</i>), the needs of the soul should come first, and in truth when we think of ourselves we should immediately think of our essence, our soul and not the clothes, the body.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">132</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>gematria </i>of the word <i>ahavah</i>, “love,” is 13, the same as for the word <i>echad</i>, “one.” Total love demands singular devotion. One can only truly fully love one spouse or ideal. If so, how did the Torah demand love for fellow Jews once we were already commanded to love God our Lord? If the heart is filled with love for God where will there be room for love of fellow men? The answer is that the Torah demands love to one subject, God. If one sees souls and not bodies, then one sees the Divine in others and that Divinity is what is beloved. If one loves someone he loves that person’s children who are extensions of the beloved. “You are children to God,” according to the Torah, therefore, love of God demands love for the Jewish soul that emerges from Him (<i>Yismach Mosheh</i>).<br>The <i>gematria </i>of the Biblical verse for love of fellow Jews, <i>Ve-ahavta le-re’acha ka-mocha ani Hashem</i>, equals the verse, <i>Ve-ahavta es Hashem Elokecha</i>, “Love the Lord your God,” for it is all one devotion. The <i>Zohar </i>teaches that God, Torah, and Israel are one. In truth, God clothed himself in the thoughts and words of Torah, and Jewish souls are pieces of the Divine as well; thus Torah, Israel and God are linked in an intrinsic manner, Rabbi Levi Yitzchak of Berditchev (1740-1810) explained a Scriptural ambiguity with this principle:<br>“As God commanded Moses, He counted them [the Jews] in the Sinai desert” (Num. 1:19): One can ask, it should have written, “He counted them in the Sinai desert as God commanded Moses”? Behold, God gave the Torah to the Jewish people, and the souls of Jews are the essence of the Torah, for there are 600,000 Jewish souls and 600,000 letters in the Torah scroll. In fact, the name <i>Yisrael </i>is an acronym for <i>yesh shishim ribbo osiyos la-torah</i>, “there are 600,000 letters to the Torah.” Therefore, Jews are the Torah, for each Jew is a different letter in the Torah. When Moses counted the Jews he was learning Torah. This is why the verse changed its usual formulation to hint, “As God commanded Moses He counted the people,” like the Torah that God commanded Moses was the [experience of] counting of the nation (<i>Kedushas Levi</i>, <i>Parashas Bemidbar</i>, s.v. <i>ka-asher</i>).<br>A classic Chasidic tale tells of Rabbi Moshe Leib Sassov’s devotional midnight prayers. (The <i>Tikkun Chatzos </i>prayers were instituted by the Kabbalists to be recited at midnight in mourning for the loss of the Temple in Jerusalem.) One wintry day Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Zhiditchover decided that he had to witness his teacher’s devotions, so he hid himself under R. Moshe Leib’s bed to observe how R. Moshe Leib recited <i>Tikkun Chatzos</i>.<br>Shortly before midnight R. Moshe Leib awoke and dressed in the clothes of a Ukrainian peasant and left his house; Rabbi Zvi Hirsch surreptitiously fol-lowed. He walked out into the forest and chopped down a tree, he then carried this tree to a small shack at the edge of the town. He entered the shack, and turning to the poor Jewish widow who was shivering in the cold, he offered to sell her the extra log that he had on his back. The widow related how cold she was but she could not afford to pay for timber. Rabbi Moshe Leib responded that she could pay him at some other time, “Just go to the village square and ask for Ivan the Ukrainian. They will get me, and you will then be able to pay.” While chopping the wood and warming the widow’s home, Rabbi Moshe Leib recited <i>Tikkun Chatzos</i>.<br>Rabbi Moshe Leib was a transcendent <i>tzaddik</i>. He saw Divinity everywhere. His act of connecting to a fellow Jew through charity was an act of connecting to a soul, to a piece of God. Prayer is also a process of attachment to the Divine. Rabbi Moshe Leib linked his attachment to God through words of Psalms with attachment to Divinity of helping souls, for in truth souls are a piece of the Divine as well.</i> The <i>tzaddik </i>reaches this level; he only sees souls; all he sees is the <i>nefesh Elokis</i>—the Divine within others.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">133</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See further <i>Mishbetzos Zahav</i>, <i>Shabbos Ha-Gadol </i>5753.

This area is called <i>sitra achra </i>because like two sides of a sharp divide, one can only stand in one section. It is impossible to straddle the fence and place one’s feet in both areas.

His uncle, Rabbi Zvi Hirsch of Zhiditchov, was afraid that his spiritual gifts might lead him to weakness in the realm of fear of Heaven, and as a result, at age six he lost his ability to see “from one end of the world to the other.” He authored many important Chasidic works such as <i>Heichel Ha-Berachah</i>, <i>Derech Emunah</i>, <i>Otzar Mitzvosecha</i>, <i>Zohar Chai</i>, and <i>Megillas Setarim</i>.</i> related that his entire life, starting from age nine, when he would see a woman he would immediately see the name of God of <i>aleph</i>, <i>dalet</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>yud</i>, which is the Godly manifestation that gives life to the feminine.",

Rabbi Hirsch explains the very first verse of that psalm in the following manner: <i>Havu la-Hashem kavod va-oz</i>, “The verse may also be read in the accusative form; i.e., ‘Bring unto the Lord, attribute and ascribe to Him everything that you admire as being endowed with strength. ‘” See further Rabbi Hirsch’s <i>Commentary to the Psalms</i>, pgs, 204 -210.</i>",
                "After the <i>tzaddik </i>truly abhors physical pleasure, his <i>nefesh ha-bahamis </i>transforms and he finds Torah and Mitzvos appealing, exciting, and delightful in a physical manner. He feels the infinite pleasure that can be accessed within the performance of Mitzvos, experience of genuine <i>tefillah</i>, “prayer,” and the joy of comprehending the Divine through Torah thought.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">137</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Chasam Sofer explained that the eating of an apple dipped in honey on Rosh Hashanah is a prayer that our good deeds, symbolized by an apple, should be sweet and enjoyable.

He was a student of the Maggid of Mezeritch, and after the pass-ing of the Maggid (19 Kislev 5533; December 15, 1772) he served as the leader of Ukrainian Chasidus. He was a man of great love of God and love of Israel who would argue with Heaven, during his prayers, advocating blessings for all members of Israel. His work <i>Kedushas Levi </i>is one of the classics of Chasidic literature.</i> lighting of the menorah was a public event. Students of Rabbi Levi Yitzchak, other great sages, and simple townsfolk would all gather to witness his devotions when he would kindle the Chanukah flames. One year, right when Rabbi Levi Yitzchak was to begin, the Rebbe (Grand Rabbi) seemed to needlessly delay. Eventually, Chatzkel the unsophisticated attendant of the Poritz (the Russian landowner) entered the room.",
                "“Chatzkel, where are you coming from?” R. Levi Yitzchak called out. “I just arrived from the home of the Poritz.”",

                "“Oh, life is good for him. He has expert chefs from Germany, Italy, and France who prepare for him the finest delicacies. And his table, what a table! The cutlery glitters and shines, and his plates are the finest china,” Chatzkel enthused.",
                "“How does the Poritz sleep?” continued the Rebbe, “Wow! The Poritz sleeps well. He has it good,” gushed Chatzkel. “Rebbe, you sleep on a pile of straw. The Poritz has a mattress like the czar and a beautiful bed, with beautiful sheets, warm blankets, and soft pillows. And what a room! The floor is covered with antique Persian rugs, the walls are adorned with antique art and tapestries, and the ceiling supports the most exquisite chandeliers, Rebbe, the Poritz has it good!”",
                "Finally, Rabbi Levi Yitzchak asked, “Does the Poritz light Chanukah candles?”",
                "“Of course not,” replied Chatzkel with a laugh.",
                "Rabbi Levi Yitzchak grew animated and shouted with fervor, “The Poritz stuffs himself with food, and sleeps with feathers instead of hay? That is the good life? Without Chanukah candles!? We have it good! We have the joy of God’s menorah!”",
                "With that, Rabbi Levi Yitzchak began to shout with delight the words of the blessings for lighting the menorah.",

                "Rav Aharon Karliner’s Poritz loved sleigh-riding. One summer he brought thousands of bags of sugar (a rare commodity) to simulate snow and he rode in his sled on the mounds of the confection. A Chasid once wistfully told the Rebbe about the pleasure the Poritz must experience when riding a sled in the heat of August. The Rebbe responded, “That pleasure is not nearly as powerful as the enjoyment I feel when I recite on Shabbos the prayer, <i>Nishmas kol chai tivarech es shimcha Hashem Elokeinu</i>, ‘The souls of every living creature will bless your name God our Lord.’”",
                "According to the Talmud, holidays are times when half of one’s day should be spent for oneself, engaged in physical pleasure, <i>chetzyo lachem</i>. The other half of the day should be dedicated to God and His service, <i>chetzyo la-Hashem</i>.",

                "R. Uri’s body had been transformed. After all the years of battling his urges, he experienced prayer as a sensory pleasure. To him, eating was difficult and was an obligation performed solely because Jewish law demands food ingestion on the holiday. That is why in his holiday experience the prayers were the physical enjoyment while eating was the spiritual duty.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">141</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Wolfson added that R. Moshe Leib of Sassov was also a <i>tzaddik </i>who experienced the spiritual as physically pleasing.<br>R. Moshe Leib was renowned for his dedication to redeeming Jewish prisoners. He would also frequently fast and pray for success in his dangerous exploits. One day, after a long and exhausting fast, he went to a Russian nobleman who was holding a Jew captive. When he entered the room the nobleman’s lunch was brought in as well. Weakened with hunger, Rabbi Moshe Leib swooned at the aroma of the nobleman’s food. He felt an overwhelming desire to request a taste of the dish. Intellectually, however, he knew that the food was not kosher. To overcome his hunger he thought of Shabbos. His spiritual feelings were so potent that considering Shabbos and the recital of <i>Nishmas </i>brought him so much pleasure that his body no longer hungered for the Gentile’s meal (Rav Wolfson).</i>",
                "Some <i>tzaddikim </i>reach an exalted state. They are personifications of an <i>atzilus</i>-type existence. <i>Atzilus </i>is a Heavenly universe whose name is derived from the word <i>eitzel</i>, “next to.” In this world light and vessel are one.

                "The human soul was created in a unique manner. All other creations were formed through command; God declared and the item appeared. For example, of the sky, Scripture states, <i>Bi-dvar Hashem shamayim na’asu</i>, “With the word[s] of God, Heavens were created” (Ps. 33:6).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">143</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew language and the letters of the alphabet have a unique holiness since the world was created through God’s speaking Hebrew. For instance, God said <i>shamayim</i>, and out of the letters <i>shin</i>, <i>mem</i>, <i>yud</i>, <i>mem</i>, the heavens eventually emerged. The Hebrew letters are the spiritual root of the world. A great <i>tzaddik </i>only sees these letters. (See page 82, where a story from the Kamarna Rebbe illustrating this concept is recorded.) When he sees the skies he sees the Hebrew word <i>shamayim </i>since it is the spiritual source of the physical heavens. Perhaps King David referred to this perception when he said in Psalm 29, <i>Kol Hashem ba-koach, kol Hashem be-hadar</i>, “The sound of the Almighty is within strength, the sound of the Divine is within glory.” David was a <i>tzaddik</i>, and he was describing his perception of reality. All strength comes from the Almighty. God gives energy to the powerful. In truth they are impotent, and only God’s force is significant. David also wrote, <i>Shivisi Hashem le-negdi tamid</i>, “I have placed the Almighty before me always.” David only saw the Divine essence. This Divine essence is letter combinations of the holy language. The combinations spell out Divine names; that is why he proclaimed that he constantly had the Divine before his eyes, for he constantly perceived the Divine source. See further the Commentary of Rabbi S.R. Hirsch to Chapter 29 of the Psalms, <i>Bereishis Rabbah </i>18:4, and R.

                "God does not recite words. What is meant by the image of God declaring the existence of a physical dimension? As we learned in Lesson Five, breath is the life of a person. Human speech limits breath, modulating it with the mouth and limiting it to particular sounds. Speech is a process in which the essence of man is clothed and limited. God’s creation resembles human speech, the created world is a cover for God, His Essence was limited many myriad of times until He was clothed within the world. The image for the creation of the soul is one of direct breath, for the soul contrasted to the created world is like blowing versus speaking.

The glassblower then pushes the air through his lungs to his mouth and releases the breath out of his lips. The breath turns into a mini-wind. It enters the heated glass and changes its form. As the wind settles, the glass’s shape is solidified.",

It is the level of soul that parallels God’s decision to create a being. <i>Yechidah </i>is God’s will before He has even conceived of the form of man. It represents God’s desire.",
                "The different parts of the soul are concentrated in distinct body organs. <i>Nefesh </i>is in the blood. The Torah characterizes blood as <i>nefesh </i>when it prohibits the ingestion of blood, <i>Ki ha-dam hu ha-nefesh</i>, “for the blood is the <i>nefesh</i>” (Deut. 12:23). The blood of a person is his source of organic life. If blood stops flowing to a limb in the body, the limb will atrophy and waste away.

A relationship can develop, can flourish, because deep communication is possible by means of speech. In the Torah “speaking” is a euphemism for intimacy (“They saw her speaking with one...”) this is not usage borrowed from a distance; the parallel is intrinsic.<br>At a deeper level, speech represents the connection between higher and lower worlds. Speech is the mechanism by which an abstract idea which exists only in the higher dimension of thought can be brought down into the material world: when I speak, I transform ideas into the physical medium of sound, which is tangible enough for you to hear with the physical tools of hearing (<i>Worldmask</i>, pgs. 128·129).</i> Speech also connects people to each other.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">155</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See further <i>Derech Ha-Melech </i>on <i>Parashas Vayetze </i>5690.

He forbids, they abstain.<br>AI Khazari: I asked you about a pious man, not a prince.<br>The Rabbi: The pious man is nothing but a prince who is obeyed by his senses, and by his mental as well as his physical faculties, which he governs corporeally, as it is written, “He that ruleth his spirit is better than he that taketh a city” (<i>Kuzari</i>, Part 3, quoting Prov. 16: 32).</i> Frequently, we reverse the order. Our lusts lead. For example, we desire someone else’s money, or we are lazy and seek to avoid performing a moral duty. We then arouse our heart to love that path and we employ our mind to rationalize and justify misbehavior, saying, “He did not need that money anyway. I will use it for better purposes than he,” or, “The duty will be performed by someone else, I can safely ignore it.” In these instances our livers were really first, followed by the heart, and then the mind.

Even animals and the inanimate earth violated nature’s law. Lions copulated with bears, and a man would plant peach seeds only to reap apples. As a result of the pervasive corruption, God sent a deluge of water that destroyed almost all of humanity, the animals, plants, and several feet of topsoil. Only man has freedom of choice.

David would awake and rise to study Torah until the morning.”<br>This story sounds too fantastic to be true. Can a wind play tunes on a harp? The story is not to be understood in a literal manner; rather the Talmud is utilizing allegorical imagery. The harp above the bed is really David’s heart, and the northern wind is the song of the souls of <i>tzaddikim </i>who reside in the northern part of the Garden of Eden. The righteous begin to sing at midnight. David’s heart was perfectly attuned to the souls in the Garden of Eden.

                "Our physical world is controlled by a spiritual world. Each blade of grass, for instance, has a spiritual channel, an angel that provides for its life. Jewish mysticism details the makeup of this spiritual dimension. In a broad sweep, this spiritual dimension is comprised of five spiritual universes.",
                "Why is there a need for a spiritual dimension? Can’t God direct us personally without any intermediates? The answer is that man’s feeble physical and spiritual nature would be overwhelmed by the presence of God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">170</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When the Torah was given at Mt.

                "God’s essence is so overpowering that it does not allow for anything to exist independently before It. The spiritual universes are the steps in which God has limited His essence so that an independent existence can emerge. The key terms in understanding these steps are <i>tzimtzum</i>, “constriction,” and <i>Or Ain Sof</i>, “Light without End.”",
                "Consider light. Light usually enables sight, yet too much light can blind.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">171</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The same is true with noise. A whisper can hardly be heard. Only if one raises the volume of speech is it audible. However, if one shouts at the top of his lungs, the heightened noise renders the words inaccessible.</i> Similarly, God is called Infinite Light (<i>Or Ain Sof</i>), with no end and no beginning. He is the ultimate Reality. His life and vitality is so powerful, it overwhelms all other existing items that face Him directly. To allow for creation God acted with <i>tzimtzum</i>—He pulled in His light. He then emanated from Himself a light that was less bright than His essence. Even this light was too much for existence, so out of this light He caused another further limited light to emerge, and then another and another. At the last stage of limited light a physical universe emerged out of the spiritual lights. <i>Olam </i>is a universe, and the words <i>he’elam </i>and <i>ne’elam</i>, “unknown” and “hidden,” share the same Hebrew root. A universe is a “hiding of the Infinite,” a diminution of Divine light. The process of limiting the light and turning the spiritual into a progressively more physical creation is called <i>seder hishtalshlus</i>, the “order of development.”",
                "<i>Hishtalshlus </i>shares a root with the word <i>shalsheles</i>, “chain.” Creation is a chain for two reasons. First, in a chain each ring leads to another, and creation is a process of cause and effect, greater lights producing lesser lights, out of which are formed even smaller forces.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">172</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“The <i>Nefesh Ha-Chaim </i>and many other sources tell us that there are many interlocking levels to the Creation. In an infinitely stretching chain beginning at the very Source of existence, many worlds are connected in sequence. Each of these higher worlds infuses the level below it with existence and energy; each is ‘male’ with regard to the world below it which is relatively speaking, ‘female,’ and together they ‘bring out’ yet another level below them. This process continues with myriad complexity until finally our finite world results” (<i>Living Inspired </i>pg. 71). This process is called the <i>seder hishtalshlus</i>.</i> Second, in a chain, the rings interlock, the end of the first ring’s airspace has within it the beginning of the second ring, and in the spiritual dimension each level is interwoven with the next level. For instance, the lowest level of the universe of <i>atzilus </i>(the first universe), is also the highest level in the universe of <i>beriah </i>(the second universe).",
                "The different stages of the <i>seder hishtalshlus </i>are the universes that are the soul parts of the physical universe. The first supernal universe is so high that it too is a light that is almost infinite.

                "Prayer is a soulful sojourn through the universes. <i>Atzilus </i>is represented by the extremely righteous in their <i>Shemoneh Esreh </i>(Silent Devotional) part of prayers. For the silent devotion, one takes three steps forward to enter into a new dimension in which the prayers are recited silently. At this point of the service the petitioner is standing next to God, and that is why all can talk with Him in the hushed tones of an intimate whisper. Furthermore, according to <i>halachah </i>ideally this prayer should lead to leaving the physical self and getting lost in rapture of the Divine. During the silent prayer the <i>tzaddik </i>achieves <i>deveikus</i>, “absolute cleaving.” <i>Deveikus </i>means becoming one with God. Oneness cannot be described nor defined; it can only be understood through the experience of a sensitive heart. Loss of all bodily sensation and absolute union with the Infinite is a human sensation that is <i>atzilus</i>-like; it is a sense of a wholly new dimension. The sense of absolute oneness with the Divine is an out-of-body experience that emerges from <i>atzilus</i>, the universe that is above our world and serves as a <i>makkif</i>, an enveloping light, to our physical dimension.",
                "<i>Atzilus </i>is all good and it produces the <i>chayah </i>part of the human soul. <i>Chayah </i>is the source of <i>deveikus</i>, devotional oneness, and what <i>chayah </i>is in the human is what <i>atzilus </i>is to the cosmos.",
                "Out of <i>atzilus </i>a further diminished light emerged, the world of <i>beriah</i>, “creation.” <i>Atzilus </i>experientially is felt as a loss of self-hood. It is called <i>ayin</i>, a sense of nothingness. <i>Beriah </i>emerged out of it; thus <i>beriah </i>is a manifestation of, and the place of, <i>yesh me-ayin</i>, something coming out of nothing. In this world, there is a possibility of evil although good is the majority. This world parallels the section of prayers that speak of accepting God’s yoke, reciting <i>Shema </i>and its blessings. This world is also termed <i>Olam Ha-Kissei</i>, “the universe of God’s throne.” Symbolically the Almighty “sits” there. That is why there is a widespread Jewish custom to sit during the prayers of <i>Shema</i>. <i>Beriah </i>produced and parallels the <i>neshamah </i>part of the soul. The <i>neshamah </i>is located in the mind and expressed through thought; in the world of <i>beriah</i>, thoughts are tangible and real. The depths of <i>neshamah </i>can be felt when all of one’s thoughts are holy, centering on Torah knowledge and Mitzvah fulfillment.",
                "<i>Beriah </i>let out a lesser light that became the world of <i>yetzirah</i>. <i>Yetzirah </i>implies <i>yesh mi-yesh</i>, “something from something,” to form an item out of a primordial matter. In <i>yetzirah</i>, evil has even more presence and is equal to the amount of good. This world is represented by the <i>Pesukei De- Zimra</i>—verses of praise—part of the morning prayers. <i>Zimra </i>also means to prune, the verses of praise are pruning shears—they cut away the forces of evil and allow man’s prayers to enter before God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">175</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See further, <i>A Call to the Infinite</i>, pg. 67, quoted from Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla.</i> This universe let off the <i>ruach </i>part of the soul that it parallels.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">176</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>yetzirah</i>, the forces for good and evil are equals.

Feelings are as tangible in the world of <i>yetzirah </i>as objects are in our universe.",
                "Finally, there is the universe of <i>asiyah</i>, where the majority is evil, and it parallels the <i>nefesh </i>part of the soul, as well as the prayers of <i>korbanos</i>, the sacrificial order that purified and provided the spiritual merit for this world.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">177</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See further, <i>A Call to the Infinite</i>, pgs. 74-75, quoted from <i>Derech Hashem</i>, 4:613-14.</i> Good deeds performed on this earth reach the world of <i>asiyah</i>.",

The world of <i>asiyah </i>and the soul part <i>nefesh </i>are expressed through righteous deed. If you put a coin into the hand of a poor person without any care for his welfare nor a thought about why it is correct to give charity, then it is exclusively in the realm of <i>asiyah</i>. <i>Domeim </i>bears a trace of <i>asiyah</i>. An act without feeling or thinking is like an inanimate item, the doer was a block of wood during its performance, no better than a machine. The world of <i>yetzirah </i>is the source for <i>ruach </i>and feelings and resembles <i>tzome’ach</i>. Most of what I feel is internal; only a small fraction of my love or hate can be seen by others. I cannot see the tree moving up when it grows. However, I do see a small fraction of the growth process, and by regular monitoring of a plant I can stay abreast of its development. Animals have some intelligence, thus <i>chai </i>corresponds to <i>beriah </i>and <i>neshamah</i>, the sources of thoughts. <i>Chayah </i>and <i>atzilus </i>is total connection to God, thus corresponding to <i>medabber</i>, the human, who, through speech, can experience union with Infinity.</i>",

In the process of creating life, the masculine contributes the first seed, while the feminine receives that seed within her. She then hides it within herself for nine months and develops it into a new being. In Jewish thought the masculine represents giving while the feminine represents humility, to be empty, and receive. In conception, after receiving the first spark, the feminine eventually develops it into a child, thus returning something far greater than what she received.

In the world of <i>yetzirah </i>there is less waste, but it is a place of much waste, and it is where good and evil reign together. In the world of <i>beriah </i>good rules over evil, and there is very little chaff. <i>Atzilus </i>is total and absolute holiness. This is why an individual who emerged from the world of <i>atzilus </i>[i.e., the <i>tzaddik</i>] has no sin, and no sins occur because of him, for in this universe the <i>sitra achra</i>, the forces of evil have no hold. Because of the four universes there are four Torahs: the Torah of <i>atzilus</i>, the Torah of <i>beriah</i>, the Torah of <i>yetzirah</i>, and the Torah of <i>asiyah</i>. The simple meaning [<i>peshat</i>] is from <i>asiyah</i>; the hinted meaning, <i>remez</i>, is from <i>yetzirah</i>; the interpreted meaning, <i>derash </i>is from <i>beriah</i>, and the secrets of Torah are from <i>atzilus</i>. Corresponding to these, man has <i>nefesh</i>, <i>ruach</i>, <i>neshamah</i>, and <i>chayah</i>. <i>Nefesh </i>is from <i>asiyah</i>, which is why it tends to sin, to physical urges. One must be vigilant and purify one’s <i>nefesh </i>through avoidance of prohibited food and ritual impurity, and be careful even with Rabbinic prohibitions. One must be very exacting on one’s limbs, eyes, and mouth to ensure they do not perform misdeeds in order to attain and preserve the Godly <i>nefesh</i>. If one does not preserve one’s <i>nefesh </i>one will be unable to access <i>ruach</i>. One who maintains the saintly level of his <i>nefesh </i>might then attain <i>ruach </i>and might fully comprehend the hinted meanings of the Torah.

Only those with the highest level of soul will fully comprehend the secrets of Torah” (<i>Ma’or Va-Shemesh</i>, <i>Parashas Yisro</i>).<br>The Torah has five types of numbers: singles, tens, hundreds, thousands, and ten thousand. These correspond to the five universes and the five levels of soul. Thus, when the prophetic leader Devorah asked for ten thousand Jews to join Barak in battling the Canaanite tyrant Sisra, she was really attempting to arouse the full complement of the Jewish soul. Jews were being asked to reach down to the level of <i>yechidah </i>and dedicate all for a war to save the Jewish people. Furthermore, this symbolic number was intended to arouse the merit of all the parts of the soul and all the positive effects that Jews had produced in all the universes. These merits would be reason for a miraculous routing of Sisra’s armies (<i>Resisei Lailah </i>pg. 48).<br>The Chasam Sofer explains the reason why in the count of the Jewish nation in the Desert, each tribe’s total was completed in the hundreds column (such as 57,400 for Zevulun and 59,300 for Shimon). These groups of Jews had fully perfected their <i>nefesh </i>and <i>ruach</i>, and they were seeking to perfect that which is rooted in the world of <i>beriah</i>, the realm of <i>neshamah</i>, which corresponds to the hundreds.</i>"

Solomon intended this verse to serve as a statement about his father David who lived in five worlds and in each, sang a special song to God. He lived as a fetus within his mother’s womb and sang, <i>Barchi nafshi</i>, “My soul will bless God, and all of my insides will thank His holy name” (Psalm 103). He emerged from the womb and he looked upon the stars and their constellations and said, “Bless God, O His angels, strong warriors who fulfill His word…” (ibid.). He nursed from his mother and sang, “My soul, Bless God! Do not forget all the good that He did for you.” This refers, according to Rav Avahu, to the placement of the body’s repositories of milk at the place of wisdom [the heart]. He saw the fall of the wicked and he sang, “All sin will disappear from the earth, there will be no more sinners, my soul shall thank God. Hallelujah!” (Psalm 104). He looked at the day of death and sang, “My soul shall bless God, God my Lord, You are most exalted.”",
                "The five worlds David lived in correspond to the five spiritual universes and the five parts of the soul. The universe of <i>asiyah </i>produced <i>nefesh </i>and is felt through the physical performance of a Mitzvah. This was the world of his mother’s womb. At this point all the child has is blood and simple physical existence. Looking at the stars was an emotional experience, it corresponds to the world of <i>yetzirah</i>, the place of angels where King David’s <i>ruach </i>sang to God for the wonders that his heart sensed. Nursing from his mother was an experience akin to the world of <i>beriah </i>and the soul level of <i>neshamah</i>. Food contributes to intellectual understanding, and once the child nurses he or she begins to comprehend. The world of the fall of the wicked corresponds to the sense of <i>chayah </i>or an <i>atzilus</i>-like experience. In <i>atzilus </i>all is good; there is a loss of any bodily sensation. Thus witnessing how wickedness will dissipate and only good remains is an <i>atzilus</i>-like experience.

R. Tzadok Ha-Cohen in his book <i>Dover Tzedek </i>(pg. 6b) points out that the Talmud calculates that the average individual has twelve and a half years to dedicate to the service of God in his life. The reason for this number is the five parts of the soul. In Jewish law three years are needed to fully acquire title to an item. Each of us must fully acquire the level of <i>nefesh</i>, namely, all our deeds should be Mitzvos. We also must internalize the level of <i>ruach</i>, that all our feelings should be holy. We must reach the level of <i>neshamah</i>, all our thoughts saintly. And we must acquire the level of <i>chayah</i>, constant attachment to Heaven, and the level of <i>yechidah</i>, to completely lose all sense of self and to become fully one with the Almighty.<br>Therefore, man should need fifteen years of life to fully attain each level of soul. However, in the spiritual dimension, levels interlock. Once you reach the top of <i>asiyah</i>, you are already at the lowest rung in <i>yetzirah</i>. That is why once you complete two and a half years of acquisition for a particular level, you then progress to the next level. 2.5 times 5 equals 12.5, the years of life.</i>",

                "The spiritual domain reflects its maker—the single, united, Creator. A close examination of spiritual entities reveals unity.

For the fetus’s body to develop, its soul must first travel through forty stops, four universes with ten levels to each. Hence forty days of formation, for on each day a different level of soul is received. The Torah’s multiple layers of meaning were redacted over forty days, so that Moses would understand forty levels of Divine Thought, and every level of Moses’ soul and personality would be filled with Torah thought.",
                "The greatness of Torah sages is that they revealed the existence of a hidden voice within the Jew. They taught that even the sinner who proclaimed, “I am sinning even though I know that it violates God’s command,” is not all bad. He did not defile every day of his formation. He may have seemed to sully all the letters of God’s name, but in truth he did not dirty the crown atop the <i>yud</i>, the fortieth level, the highest point.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">214</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the supernal realm is constructed as a chain, the highest level of <i>atzilus </i>is really also the lowest level of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>.

That day of his formation, or innermost point in his soul, did not agree to the misdeed. This point, colloquially called a <i>pintele yid </i>always advocates sanctity.

                "The verse has thirteen Hebrew words. Through threefold repetition a total of thirty-nine words are recited. Perhaps this custom is an expression of the following thought. The sinner seemingly deserved forty lashes, but due to the Almighty’s compassion God looked deeply and acknowledged the voice of <i>yechidah</i>, and the sinner is only to receive thirty-nine blows.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">217</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The scriptural source for the punishment of lashes contains a warning prohibiting excessive punishment. “He should be hit forty times, no more, lest you increase the amount of blows over these a great deal and your brother will then be embarrassed before you” (Deut. 25:3). Since the Rabbinic tradition revealed that the real limit is thirty-nine blows, the verse is referring to the fortieth blow, warning that forty blows is <i>makkah rabbah</i>, excessive. The <i>gematria </i>of <i>makkah rabbah </i>(65+207=272) is the same as the value of the words <i>ve-hu rachum </i>(18+254=272). This indicates that the compassion of God (represented by the words <i>ve-hu rachum</i>) is the reason for the liberal definition of <i>makkah rabbah</i>.<br>The Torah introduces the law of flogging with, <i>im bin hakkos ha-rasha</i>, “If the guilty party has incurred the penalty of lashes” (Deut. 25:2). The <i>gematria </i>of <i>im bin hakkos ha-rasha </i>(41+52+431+575=1099) is the same <i>gematria </i>as <i>nefesh</i>, <i>ruach</i>, <i>neshamah</i>, <i>chayah</i>, <i>yechidah </i>(430+214+395+23+37=1099). This is an indication of the lesson mentioned above. At the moment of flogging all the parts of the soul appear, the blows are then reduced, since the pure <i>yechidah </i>is present (<i>Emunas Etecha</i>, 5757, pg. 7).</i>",

It appeared that the Jewish nation was fully complicit in the sin of the spies, and it was decreed that the generation of the desert would die over forty years. However once the fortieth year was reached, <i>yechidah </i>was revealed. God looked at the deepest desires and saw that in the innermost recesses there had been a will to be good. Due to the revelation of <i>yechidah</i>, in the fortieth year all the Jews were deemed righteous and the community suffered no further punishment.",
                "2) As a result of Adam’s sin (eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil), he was punished with the world, receiving thirty-nine curses.

These types of work are performed during the six days of the week and are prohibited on Shabbos.",

                "Generally, touching <i>yechidah </i>is only possible for the very righteous. However, on the fortieth day, through rigorous prayer and repentance, everyone can touch it. That is why Rabbi Mendelovitz said that every Jew is obligated to reach his personal level of <i>yechidah </i>on Yom Kippur.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">225</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Perhaps the most appropriate moment to reach <i>yechidah</i>, the fifth part of the soul, is during <i>Ne’ilah</i>, the final prayer of Yom Kippur, which is the fifth prayer of the day (ZR).<br>The Purim holiday that celebrates Jews being miraculously saved from a genocidal decree in the Persian Kingdom is also a day of <i>yechidah</i>. The <i>Zohar </i>links Purim to Yom Kippur, stating that the Day of Atonement is a <i>yom ke-purim</i>, “a day like Purim.” The name Purim is a derivative of the term <i>pur</i>, “lot,” for Haman cast lots to decide when to kill the Jews. Yom Kippur as well is a time of lots, as the key ceremony that creates atonement is one in which the High Priest draws lots to determine which goat is a sacrifice and which is sent to the desert.<br>On Yom Kippur the innermost will is revealed through a mortification of the flesh, on Purim it is revealed through indulgence of intoxicating alcohol that causes the innate essence of an individual to emerge. The symbolism of drawing a lot and then sending a goat out into the wilderness represents that our sins are not our essence, our sins are our external voices. The innermost “I” is a sacrifice to God, fully committed to His service. This concept transcends logic, hence the lots, a trans-logical means of decision making. Purim too is a day that celebrates the innate nature of a Jew that is fully committed to God, which is why its name is <i>Lots</i>.<br>In fact, the reason why the Talmud requires that the Purim reveler drink alcohol to the depths of a stupor is that the light of <i>yechidah </i>is shining on this day. The light of the <i>yechidah </i>is far beyond our world, which is why <i>tzaddikim </i>would get drunk in order to be able to contain such a powerful life force. Most of us, however, do not sense the light of <i>yechidah </i>as it comes to our world. That is why it is inappropriate for us to drink excessively on Purim.<br>The Talmud, in <i>Megillah </i>12a, relates a discussion between Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his students as to why the Jews of that era were deserving of a genocidal decree. “They bowed to an idol,” Rashbi taught, “Yet since they only did it in an insincere manner, since at their essential core they desired to serve God fully, the decree against them turned out to be hollow as well.” Purim came about because God looked at the essential core of the Jew, saw his pure intentions, and therefore forgave (Rav Wolfson).

                "4) According to Jewish law, many forms of ritual impurity are removed by means of fully immersing oneself in a <i>mikveh</i>, the immersion pool. A <i>mikveh </i>is a gathering of forty <i>seah </i>(a Talmudic liquid measure, approximately two gallons) of pure water (either rainwater or spring water that has not been transported in a man-made vessel). The purifying quality of a <i>mikveh </i>is <i>yechidah</i>. Once one is covered by the fortieth <i>seah </i>of water, the fortieth level of the soul, the <i>yechidah</i>, is awakened. At that point there was never sin or misdeed, resulting in purification.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">226</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Tzvi Elimelech of Dinov, the author of the work <i>Bnei Yissachar</i>, explained that the days of repentance (the month of <i>Elul </i>and the first ten days of <i>Tishrei</i>) are in fact a <i>mikveh </i>in the dimension of time. Yom Kippur as the fortieth day is the fortieth <i>seah</i>, the water that fully covers the body. On that day we are fully immersed in holiness, which results in forgiveness and spiritual cleansing.

Perhaps that is why the chapter of the laws of <i>yechidah </i>equals <i>be-rachamim gedolim akabtzech</i>. It is God’s great love and compassion that cause Him to acknowledge the <i>yechidah </i>within man, and He will reveal that good to man during the ultimate redemption.</i>",

                "A mere five days after the holiday of Yom Kippur, Jews celebrate the holiday of Sukkos. During Sukkos we have the opportunity to lift the four species.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">239</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The four species are a palm branch, three myrtle branches, two willow branches and the citron fruit.</i> On each day during the seven-day holiday, four species of agricultural products<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">240</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See further <i>Horeb</i>, Chapter 31. Rabbi Hirsch explains that the four species represent the different parts of the natural world. The willow is plain wood that does not have a special scent or taste; it represents those items in nature that are merely raw materials, and human effort is needed to transform them into something useful. The palm branch represents food without smell, namely items in nature that have inherent benefit to man, yet he must expend some effort to release that benefit. Food is the symbol of these items for most food must be processed out of its natural form (e.g., grinding wheat to produce bread). The myrtle branches have a beautiful smell but have no taste. They represent the parts of nature that are perfectly suited for human consumption even without any human effort. Air, sweet smelling roses, and water are prime examples of those parts of nature that provide benefit to man even before he changes them at all. The citron fruit represents total perfection as it is both a food and a fragrance.</i> are lifted and waved around in praise to the Almighty. Rabbi Isaac Luria taught that these four species represent the four letters of God’s name. The <i>hadas</i>, “myrtle branches,” represent the <i>yud</i>. And the <i>aravos</i>, “willow branches,” represent the letter <i>heh</i>. The <i>lulav</i>, “palm branch,” represents the <i>vav</i>. The <i>esrog</i>, “citron,” is the final <i>heh</i>. Bringing all four species together is a symbolic unification of God’s name and a symbolic discovery of the Divine in all realms. Waving the four species in all directions indicates that God’s name fills all the dimensions of reality, and the Almighty can be found everywhere.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">241</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See further <i>Innerspace </i>pg. 109.</i> This raises a question; the letters in God’s name parallel the parts of the soul, and there are really five parts of the soul, for there is also <i>yechidah</i>. <i>Yechidah </i>is represented by the apex of the <i>yud</i>. What part of the four species parallels the apex of the <i>yud </i>and the <i>yechidah </i>part of the soul?",
                "On Yom Kippur each Jew discovers within himself a bit of his personal <i>yechidah</i>, and Sukkos is a continuation of Yom Kippur.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">242</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See further <i>Horeb </i>23:170. Rabbi Hirsch points out that Yom Kippur has two qualities: <i>kapparah </i>(atonement) and <i>taharah </i>(purification). The day brings atonement—namely a defense against physical punishment due the sinner—and purification—spiritual cleansing of the soul that was sullied with sin. Sukkos and its concluding holiday of Shemini Atzeres emerge from these two qualities. Sukkos is a celebration of physical survival and completes <i>kapparah</i>; Shemini Atzeres is a celebration of spiritual survival and thus completes <i>taharah</i>.<br>See further the Vilna Gaon’s commentary to Song of Songs 1:4, s.v. <i>ve-daled pesukim elu</i>, and <i>Avodas Ha-Gershuni </i>on Song of Songs 3:4, s.v. <i>ve-shamati mi-dodi ha-gaon he-chasid me-vilna</i>. The Gaon answers the <i>Tur</i>’s question why the holiday of Sukkos, meant to commemorate the clouds of glory with which Israel exited Egypt, is observed during <i>Tishrei </i>and not <i>Nisan</i>, the time of the Exodus. He explains that the full exit from Egypt was when the Jews merited having the Divine presence (the <i>Shechinah</i>) among them. Initially they had the Divine presence, and the intimate relationship between Creator and His children was symbolized by Heavenly clouds that surrounded the people. However, once the nation worshipped the Golden Calf (on 17 <i>Tammuz</i>), Moses broke the stone tablets of the commandments, the Almighty distanced Himself, and the clouds disappeared. The people engaged in a massive <i>teshuvah </i>campaign that started on the first day of <i>Elul</i>. They prayed for thirty-nine days, and on the fortieth they fasted. God forgave them, and on the fortieth day Moses returned to the people with a second set of tablets. Ever since then, the fortieth day (Yom Kippur) became a day of fasting, prayer, and forgiveness (<i>Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer</i>). To complete the process of forgiveness and Divine reconciliation, on Yom Kippur Moses told the people that God had commanded the erection of a sanctuary. Its construction and inauguration would bring the Divine Presence into the camp for a permanent stay. On 11 <i>Tishrei </i>an appeal for gifts needed to construct the sanctuary was made. On the twelfth and thirteenth, the people brought all the raw materials necessary for the building. On the fourteenth, Moses announced that the community had donated sufficient materials and no further donations were needed, and he apportioned raw materials to different craftsmen. On the fifteenth, the construction began and the Divine presence returned. Thus, the fifteenth of Tishrei is the day when we celebrate the return of the clouds of glory. It emerges from this analysis that Sukkos is really a celebration of the completion of the forgiveness attained on Yom Kippur. See further <i>Zeman Simchaseinu</i>, Article 1.</i> On Yom Kippur each Jew touches the depths of his or her heart (<i>yechidah</i>). On Sukkos, the apex of the <i>yud </i>is the heart of the Jew that joins the four species in completing God’s name.",
                "This may be an added meaning to the verse about the four species.

Genesis deals with the foundation of the Jewish people, with our patriarchs, and it does not detail many laws that we must obey.

Observance is a battle. Consider lust— if I lust for a piece of property that is not my own, it is a wall I must scale.

There are three great gifts that God has given to the Jewish people: Torah, the Land of Israel, and the World-to-Come, and they are all given through suffering and travails (<i>Berachos </i>5a). The world was created in a manner in which darkness was created first only afterwards light appeared (<i>Shabbos </i>77b). For this world (that is linked with the spiritual world of <i>asiyah</i>) is mostly evil (<i>asiyah </i>is mostly evil with a minority of holiness, <i>yetzirah </i>has an even split between the forces of holiness and their opposite, <i>beriah </i>is mostly pure and holy with a minority of evil, and <i>atzilus </i>is all good with no evil at all) that is why initially what one sees is the evil, the sorrows and difficulty, yet if one perseveres one will see the tranquility, the good” (<i>Tzidkas Ha-Tzaddik</i>, note 170).

                "“After every wall there were rewards.” Mitzvah observance is innately rewarding, and every step along the path to the Divine brings added blessings. “Each wall was progressively more difficult.” The Talmud teaches that one who has a greater level of virtue has more challenging temptations. As climbers scaled more walls they achieved higher and more powerful feelings of holiness thus becoming greater. Hence, the more trying next step. “The king’s son felt an inner calling to overcome all the barriers and reach his father while the knight stopped after the fifth wall.” The Jewish nation is named in the Bible, “Children to God your Lord” (Deut. 14:1). All of us innately, and <i>tzaddikim </i>actually, sense that the King is behind the walls, and we are to struggle with all the seemingly insurmountable mountains to embrace our Father. The knight represented individuals who pursue a life of virtue due to desire for reward and fear of punishment. “The knight scaled five walls.” Motivations of suffering and benefit may lead to a high level of spiritual achievement, but at some point before the apex such a seeker will stop climbing. “The King’s son insisted on scaling all of the walls.” Those who feel that they are children of God are motivated by love and as a result will scale all the barriers to arrive at God’s door. “The king responded to his son’s complaints by showing him that the walls were gone.” Once the righteous individual reaches the heights of spiritual attainment, he turns back and all the struggles vanish. After years of challenge, virtuous behavior becomes second nature. Furthermore, moral behavior becomes immensely rewarding and pleasurable, thereby denying material concerns the ability to tempt.",

There are walls in our lives, periods when we are tempted or when God seems to be missing. But the King is waiting for us to scale them, and once we succeed, all the pain will melt away. Apply this lesson to human suffering, evil in history; it is a wall hiding the Creator. Break the wall.

If one can imagine that God is detached, then one might imagine that people are detached and that we do not share a common soul that unites us.

The walls also successfully ferreted out the insincere, preserving a relationship with the king for those who truly deserved it. A shell has many benefits—it preserves the fruit. Without the shell one would never have been able to enjoy the fruit, for the elements or the animals would have consumed it first. Evil is a shell, and it too has beneficial qualities.",

Perhaps this is also the reason why God revealed to Abraham the exiles that his descendants will undergo while Abraham was in a sleeplike trance. Abraham’s trance symbolized that exile and suffering is a dream and the ultimate redemption will be so real that it will cause the sorrows of the present to fade like dreams (see further <i>Emunas Etecha</i>, <i>Parashas Lech Lecha </i>s. v. <i>vayehi</i>, pg. 23).</i>",

When the materials were brought to his ship he discovered that they were letters and diaries written in German. He realized that the ship was carrying German nationals. He radioed all the Nazi ships in the area to take care not to torpedo the ship since it carried their countrymen. After the passengers disembarked in Australia, he tracked the <i>Dunera </i>on its return home and he sank it with a torpedo blast.<br>When the letters and heirlooms were thrown overboard Moshe had thought it was a horrific tragedy.

As a result their jokes caused an increase in Divine feelings within the students and the sparks within the <i>kelippah </i>were redeemed. However, for those who use comedy to waste time, or to consider inappropriate thoughts and ignore Torah study, their <i>nogah </i>act is being utilized in a way that renders it evil. The act is then like the three impure <i>kelippos</i>—it will increase a sense of arrogance, coarseness, and physicality.",
                "Eating pig is very different from enjoying comedy. Pork belongs to the class of the three impure <i>kelippos </i>and its <i>nitzotz </i>cannot be raised. Even if one eats from the pig, the energy the pork provided will inevitably lead to misdeed, not holiness. On the other hand, kosher meat is in the category of <i>nogah</i>. One can recite a blessing before eating and thus raise the sparks in the food through turning the moment of eating into an occasion to acknowledge the Almighty.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">301</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a Chasidic custom that on the Yahrtzeit (the date of a person’s passing) food that was purchased from the deceased’s money is served, and those that eat it say, “Let the <i>neshamah </i>[soul] have an <i>aliyah </i>[ascent].” The explanation of this custom is that within a person’s property are special <i>nitzotzos</i>, sparks, that relate to that person’s soul. When a blessing is recited with correct intent prior to the eating of food, its spark is raised. On the day of the soul’s passing, its level in Heaven is reevaluated by the Heavenly court. Eating food that belonged to the soul, and reciting a blessing beforehand to raise the spark, can serve as a merit for the deceased and the soul will then ascend to a higher level of enjoyment in Heaven.</i> Even if one did not sanctify the act beforehand, after one eats, it is possible to use the strength gained for study of Torah. In such cases, after the eating, the sparks within the food are raised and the <i>nogah </i>becomes holy. According to the Jewish tradition, after one enjoys food a blessing thanking the Almighty is recited. This reflects the fact that the <i>nitzotz </i>in the food can be raised after the eating. On the other hand if one eats a forbidden food, one may not recite a blessing before it nor after its ingestion, because the sparks are tied and they cannot be released.",

He then added, “As we grow more distant from Sinai and the Temples of Jerusalem the spiritual level of the generation decreases. We have less spiritual strength than our ancestors. They could raise the sparks in those foods, we cannot, and that is why God guided our custom to develop a prohibition forbidding those foods.”",

The forward march of history is a downward slide of spirituality.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">303</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Chasidic literature, our era is called <i>ikvasa di-meshicha</i>, “the heels of the Messiah.” In a body, the head is the highest point while the heel is the lowest. All Jewish souls can be viewed as a single body. The generation that left Egypt and received the Torah was the head. That is why they were called <i>dor de’ah</i>, “the generation of understanding.” The generation of King David was the heart of the Jewish body. King David was the epitome of his generation. In Jewish literature, King David is called the sweet singer of Israel, for he was the greatest master of emotional expression in Jewish history. Our present era, since the sixteenth century, is the heels of the body. We are at a very low spiritual level. Yet we will play the most momentous role. Our meager spiritual accomplishments are to be added to the great achievements that earlier generations wrought. Our service to God will complete all the merits needed to usher in the world of Redemption. Thus we are a heel, but this heel will bring the Moshiach. We are <i>ikvasa di-meshicha </i>(Rav Wolfson).</i> We have reached a low level; as a result, even items in <i>nogah </i>that were redeemable in the past are now prohibited by Jewish law and are treated as if they belong to the three lower <i>kelippos</i>.",

Today, the scientist speaks of solids (<i>afar</i>), liquids (<i>mayim</i>), gasses (<i>ruach</i>), and energy or electricity (<i>aish</i>).",

It is a world where the majority is evil, sadness, and tragedy.</i> The four elements of the physical world therefore represent concepts that resemble the four <i>kelippos</i>. Water, dust, and wind (which can be felt in a balloon) are physical, tangible items and they parallel the lower three <i>kelippos</i>. Energy or electricity is qualitatively less tangible, for there is a strong spiritual streak in energy.

While God prohibited its consumption to man on the sixth day, the <i>Or Ha-Chaim </i>(Rabbi Chaim ben Attar) explains that it was a grape vine and God intended for Adam to use its wine for <i>Kiddush </i>(the sanctification blessing) on Friday night. Like all <i>nogah</i>, the tree of good and evil had the option to be bad or good. Adam was impatient and he ate from it on Friday afternoon when it was prohibited, instead of exercising patience and using it that evening for Shabbos. The Jewish nation had an opportunity to rectify Adam’s sin when we received the Torah at Sinai. Receipt of the Torah entailed spiritual heights, the Evil Urge was silenced and all Jews reached an exalted level of prophecy. Then Moses was late returning from the mountain. The nation lost patience; they despaired, and constructed a Golden Calf. Instead of rectifying Adam’s sin we repeated it.<br>Judaism seeks to lead us to correct Adam’s failing. That is why patience is so important in our tradition. We wait patiently for the coming of a better age, even though this wait has lasted millennia, for we will correct Adam’s sin.

                "It is no wonder that four is such an important number in this world, for this world was created with the Tetragrammaton, the four-letter name of God. All fours evolved from those four letters.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">307</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Energy (<i>aish</i>) emerged from the letter <i>yud</i>.

(<i>Anatomy of the Soul</i>, pg. 34.)<br>In Lesson Ten, we learned that due to the apex of the <i>yud </i>there are five parts to the Tetragrammaton. Therefore, there is really a fifth element that is hidden in the world like the apex is hidden in the <i>yud</i>. The ancients called this element the <i>koach ha-galgalim</i>, the spheres that caused planets to rotate. Today’s science identifies this fifth element as the <i>koach ha-moshech</i>, the force that attracts, gravity. Gravity is a hidden element that causes all the other forces to move. Thus, it parallels the apex of the <i>yud </i>out of which a hidden life force that animates others emerged (heard from the Stitchiner Rebbe).</i>",
                "One God created this multifarious world. A deep look at reality will find many common denominators. Therefore, within every item, even though it is classified as a solid or a liquid, all four elements are to be found.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">308</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our world is a series of repeating patterns. A broader perspective reveals one pattern, but within each individual element the same pattern is revealed. A good illustration of this is the stones from Mount Sinai. All stones from Sinai have a unique rock structure whereby a picture of a bush, a main branch with twigs emerging, is on the stone. Cut the stone and try to only have offshoots, you will have a smaller picture of a bush. No matter how small you cut the stone you will still have a bush. Or, consider the fern tree. The fern is broad at its base and it narrows as it rises. Cut the tree at the narrow top and the piece one might hold will also be wide at its base and narrower at its top. Wherever along the fern you cut, you will have the same structural pattern. Similarly, while there are four elements in the broader sense, in the narrower sense each of the elements has all four elements, and within that it is repeated again and again. This principle is also true in regards to generations. From the perspective of all of Jewish history, the first generation was a head and our generation is a heel. Yet if one cuts a piece off of the picture, if one considers our generation by itself, one will find individuals who are the head-souls, others who are heart-souls, and others who are heel-souls. Within the era of <i>ikvasa di-meshicha</i>, the times of the Ari were the head relative to our times which are clearly the heel part (see further <i>Anatomy of the Soul</i>, pg. 34).<br>The technical term for this concept is <i>bechinah</i>, “relative value.” Wood com-pared to water is <i>afar </i>to <i>mayim</i>, yet when the parts of wood are compared to each other there is a <i>bechinah </i>of <i>mayim </i>in wood and a separate <i>bechinah </i>of <i>afar </i>in wood.</i> For example, a log of wood is classified as <i>afar</i>, a solid. A deeper look reveals more to the wood. Light the log, why does it burn? Because the fire element (energy) within it is unlocked when it nears revealed fire. While burning, it will cackle due to the water element (liquid) in it. Smoke and steam will emerge from it due to the <i>ruach </i>(gasses), within the log, and it will turn into ash because of the <i>afar </i>(solid) element within.",
                "The entire physical world can be understood in terms of the four elements.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">309</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Nachman of Breslov (<i>Likkutei Moharan </i>1, Lesson 4, Paragraph 8) points out that the physical world can be divided into four types of items, inanimate beings such as wood or air (called <i>domeim</i>), growing items such as fruit and trees (called <i>tzome’ach</i>), living creatures such as animals, fish and fowl (called <i>chai</i>), and humans who speak (called <i>medabber</i>). These four groups display the same pattern as the four elements; in fact the spiritual root for the four elements (the four letters Y-H-V-H) is also the spiritual cause for the four classes of physical items. The energy element (that has within it a strong spiritual streak) corresponds to humans (who possess a soul), the wind element to living beings, the water element to growing items (who all need water to grow), and the earth element is the source for the inanimate items. See further <i>Razei Ha-Bosem </i>pg. 177, Paragraphs 7-8.</i> Even personality traits can be seen as expressions of the elements. For example lusts and desire for pleasure stem from the liquid element. Water is the source of all pleasure in this world; in the personality it becomes a desire for pleasure. Wind is empty, and it can fill a balloon with nothingness; similarly the desires for meaningless prattle, cynical laughter,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">310</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cynicism states that no matter is important, no person is sincere, and no activity is meaningful.

Fire and energy leap ever higher and the desire for haughtiness and anger stem from that part of the personality.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">312</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ancient science felt that the human personality is determined by the four liquids (“the four humors”) within the body. These too correspond to the four elements. The black liquid (foul fluid) corresponds to inanimate items and the earth element. The green bile corresponds to the growing class or the water ele-ment. The red blood corresponds to the wind element and living creatures. The white liquids correspond to the energy element and the human class (<i>Anatomy of the Soul</i>, pg. 34, and <i>Likkutei Moharan </i>Lesson 4, Paragraph 8).</i>",
                "Some people have a physical soul that emerged from the lower <i>kelippos</i>. These people can never elevate their physicality. Within such people the physical urges for haughtiness, anger, and wasteful speech are evil and fully selfish. Even human mercy and empathy that they naturally feel is tinged with self-interest and is not fully for God’s sake. For example, they will give charity so that when they eat at night they will not feel guilty at their own luxurious lifestyle. These individuals can attain great spiritual heights through destruction of the physical, but their four elements and the personality they spawn are irredeemable. Others have physical souls from <i>kelippas nogah</i>. They too have a desire for pleasure, anger, prattle, and laziness, and physical empathy and concern for others, yet these desires have an admixture of selflessness within them that is virtually apparent. These people will sometimes give money to the poor solely for the poor man without thinking of themselves.

These examples are representatives of the four elements (burning = fire, throwing to the ocean = water, crumbling into the wind = wind, nullification = dust). <i>Chametz </i>represents arrogance, the foundation for the entire world of <i>kelippah</i>; as a result, it must be destroyed in all the four elements of the physical world.",

This law can be understood with our analysis. Since the essence of evil is arrogance, when one recognizes its emptiness, one has directly confronted it and it can be overcome. Peels might think that they are important, yet in truth relative to the fruit they are worthless. Similarly, evil thinks it is something, but if you recognize its emptiness, you will undoubtedly overcome its charms.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">314</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a tradition that Abraham’s war with the four kings occurred on Passover.

The earth he threw would miraculously turn into spears, arrows, and swords that pummeled the enemy. Perhaps the symbolic import of Abraham defeating the four kings with dust was the following lesson: The four kings represented the four <i>kelippos</i>, they sought to encourage a life of sin, and the most effective way to combat them is dust. Consider how empty evil is, recognize how its pleasures are so transient and its claims so spurious, and you will defeat evil.<br>The four <i>kelippos </i>stem from what <i>chametz </i>represents.

No one knows what he is holding, and he accosts each one, saying, “What do you suppose I have in my hand?” Each one imagines that the closed hand contains just what he desires most. They all hurry and run after the prankster. Then, when he has tricked them completely, he opens his hand, and there is nothing in it. The same is true of the Evil One. He fools the world, tricking all into following him. People think that his hands hold what they desire most, but in the end he opens it, and it is empty. No desire is ever fulfilled.

Other creatures, since they only have one spiritual source, will always respond instinctually, in the mode of their spiritual root, to a given situation. A lion that is suddenly threatened will never respond with generosity and compassion. A lion will always fight when he is attacked.

That is why they restrain themselves and engender fear in others. Usually, they will act in accordance with the characteristics of fear. For example, when faced with a perceived infraction they will get angry and cause others to withdraw. However, as humans, they have latent within them all the Divine forces including, for instance, Heavenly love. Sometimes they will summon forth love and treat the violator of the rule with tenderness.

The Temples that stood in Jerusalem and the mobile tabernacle the Jews constructed in the Desert were places that were filled with these seven Lights. That is why Betzalel, who constructed the tabernacle, knew the secrets of creation, because he had to bring down the same influences that fill the physical world (See further <i>Innerspace </i>pg. 57). This is also the meaning of the verse about Solomon’s temple, <i>va-yivnehu sheva shanim</i>, “And he built it seven years” (1 Kings 6:38). It does not say, “he built it for seven years,” rather “he built <i>it </i>seven years,” for the building was a manifestation of the seven emanations that are symbolized with the term, seven years. We mourn for the destruction of Temples of Jerusalem on the ninth of <i>Av</i>. During the subsequent seven weeks, on each Shabbos, we read a different prophecy of consolation. The seven prophecies of consolation correspond to the seven lower <i>Sephiros</i>. During each of those seven weeks, a different <i>Sephirah </i>light appears.

The Bible states here that <i>chochmah </i>and <i>binah </i>are the basic components of creation. In a divine sense, <i>chochmah </i>constitutes the axioms which define the world while <i>binah </i>is the logical system that connects these axioms. All the laws of nature are essentially axioms, and the simplest axiom contains several levels. For example, the fact that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line means that a point exists, straight lines exist, space exists, the concepts of existence, of shortness and length exist. All of these categories exist in <i>chochmah</i>. In <i>binah </i>they interplay logically and emerge as a coherent system of laws.”<br>The Stitchiner Rebbe explained how <i>chochmah </i>is the foundation of the world in the following manner. <i>Chochmah </i>is the grasping of a concept. When God conceived the need for an item He thought of the entire item and the need for it, as a result of having arisen in Divine thought, the item then immediately appeared.</i>",

In a human relationship, the male essentially provides the sperm and the female takes it, holds it in her womb for nine months, after which she delivers a fully developed child. In the same way, <i>chochmah</i>, ‘wisdom,’ is a series of facts which we can put into the womb of <i>binah</i>, ‘understanding,’ in order to develop an entire logical structure. The paradigm of this is mathematics. If we take ten digits from zero to nine and a few axioms, put them in the womb of <i>binah</i>, and let them gestate, we can obtain the whole corpus of mathematics” (Aryeh Kaplan, <i>Innerspace </i>pg. 58-59).</i> The Kabbalists refer to <i>chochmah </i>as <i>abba</i>, “father,” and to <i>binah </i>as <i>imma</i>, “mother.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">364</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Perhaps the idea in the Talmud that women have added <i>binah </i>relates to this analysis.

Initially, man sanctifies himself, and at the end, God dedicates man.”<br>The effort entailed in man’s sanctification is that he detach himself entirely from materialism, and he must attach himself fully, at every moment, to His God. This level caused the prophets to be called angels, as was written in regards to Aaron, “For the lips of the priest preserve <i>da’as</i>, and Torah will be sought from his mouth, for he is an angel of the Lord of Hosts” (Mal. 2:7). Even at moments when he is involved in material acts that are needed for his body, he feels a sense of attachment with the Divine.<br>“It is impossible for man to reach this level on his own. Man is a material being composed of flesh and blood, which is why I said that the end is a gift. Man can attempt to pursue <i>da’as </i>of truth and constant appreciation of the saintliness of deeds. However, successful attainment of these levels comes from God who will lead man down the path he has chosen and He will place upon man His holiness and He will sanctify man” (excerpted from Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, <i>Path of the Upright</i>, Chapter 26).</i> Feeling fully connected to the ideas that are father and mother (wisdom and understanding) causes them to fully enter one’s personality and to create emotions.",

He does not wish to give to others. Such a man will definitely treat his family in the same manner, he will demand his own benefit and ignore the needs of his wife. This attitude will cause him to bring his wife as a <i>sotah </i>to the priest, for where there is no peace between the couple, the wife might look elsewhere.”<br>The Stitchiner Rebbe explained the relationship between loving (<i>ahavah</i>) and giving (<i>chesed</i>) in the following manner. Love is in the internal and emotional realm of man what giving is in the external dimension of behavior. Giving is spreading myself and what I possess outward, these acts reflect an inner reality. My soul seeks to spread toward the recipient.</i> Giving is when I spread myself out into the recipient and feel a part of myself within the recipient.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">370</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Frequently, we give to those who we feel are an extension of ourselves, who are united with us. See further Rabbi Shimon Shkop’s introduction to his work <i>Sha’arei Yosher</i>. Rabbi Shkop explains that the Torah’s demand of love to our neighbors is really a requirement that man have an expansive view of self. A lowly person sees his body as the extent of his being. A higher understanding recognizes that my soul is part of who I am, and I must act in a manner that helps my soul. I cannot only further the desires of my body. An even higher level sees the “I” as encompassing all the members of my family. A spiritual person sees the “I” as totaling his entire nation. He does kindness to a fellow man for his friend is connected to him, just as all the branches are extensions of and connected to the same tree.<br>We usually think it is love which causes giving, because we observe that a person showers gifts and favors on the one he loves. But there is another side to the argument. Giving may bring about love for the same reason that a person loves what he himself has created or nurtured: he recognizes in it part of himself. Whether it is a child he has brought into the world, an animal he has reared, a plant he has tended, or even a thing he has made or a house he has built—a person is bound in love to the work of his hands, for in it he finds himself (Rabbi E. Dessler, <i>Strive for Truth</i>, pgs. 126-127).</i>",

Even after a surgery at the age of ninety-nine, Abraham went out of his tent and sat at the doorway waiting for guests, When he saw a trio of pagan earth-worshippers, he ran out of his tent and begged them to come to his home for refreshments. Furthermore, when God told him that He planned to destroy the wicked inhabitants of Sodom, Abraham prayed with utmost dedication and entreated God to save them. Abraham’s giving was unconditional. Absolute love motivated him to perform favors even for sinners and pagans who opposed his life’s mission of teaching ethical monotheism.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">372</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Da’as Tefillah </i>writes:<br>The purest form of giving has no admixture of harshness or justice.

For <i>chesed </i>comes from Him, from the fact that He seeks to do good.” Pure kindness is done because the giver is innately good and seeks to spread himself out, not because of the recipient (<i>Da’as Tefillah </i>pg. 92).<br>That is why Abraham who was connected to Heavenly levels of generosity sought to benefit even those who did not deserve favors.</i>",

A deep analysis of the Divine creation reveals that God’s purpose in creating us was to perform an act of love, to give pleasure to mortals.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">374</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan writes:<br>God had absolutely no need to create the world. God Himself is absolute perfection, and He has no need for anything, even creation. Thus, to the best of our understanding, we can say that God created the universe for the purpose of bestowing good upon man. God Himself calls His creation an act of goodness. It is for this reason that, at the end of the first six days of creation, after making man, the Torah says, “And God saw all that He had made and behold it was very good” (Gen. 1:35). We are being told that the creation of the universe was an expression of His goodness (<i>Innerspace</i>, pg. 9).</i> Since love is God’s purpose for this world, all forms of love, the righteous forms such as generosity to the poor or love for God, and the wicked forms like lust and selfish pleasure-seeking, are potent.",
                "The Jewish nation bears the mission of humanity, revealing the holiness that is latent within the physical world. The physical world’s first pillar was God’s love.

                "<b>The Opposite of <i>Chesed</i></b>",
                "The opposite of love is <i>gevurah</i>—strong restraint. This emotion has several names; it is also called <i>yirah</i>, “fear,” and <i>din</i>, “justice.” When I am afraid I recoil and withdraw. Justice also demands a withdrawal. The judge must stay within the bounds of the law and prevent his feelings of compassion from bursting out of his heart and tainting his legal decisions.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">375</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Kaplan writes further:<br><i>Gevurah</i>, “restraint,” parallels <i>din</i>, “law.” In interpersonal relationships of <i>chesed </i>and <i>gevurah</i>, if one person relates to another with <i>chesed</i>, he could pour out his most personal feelings. If he related to his friend with <i>din</i>, however, his relationship with him would become totally structured and restrained within very narrow limitations. A judge, for example, cannot say, “I like this man and I want to do him a favor. I want to be altruistic to him.” A judge cannot be altruistic; he has to be very delineated. Hence, <i>gevurah</i>, “restraint,” is <i>din</i>, “judgment” (<i>Innerspace </i>pg. 62).</i> Love is focused on others; it is the desire to spread out. Fear is the opposite movement, focusing on oneself and pulling all inward. A being that is fearful or induces fear in others bears a trace of this <i>Sephirah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">376</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Gevurah </i>literally means strength. One might question why restraint is called strength. Why isn’t it called <i>tzimtzum</i>, constriction? Couldn’t love have also been called strength, for sometimes you must overcome inhibitions and obstacles to practice giving? The answer is that restraint conflicts with the core of creation. The essence of creation is something from nothing, namely it is a process of revealing Divine forces into an empty space. Restraint is a process of hiding one’s self and personality, the opposite of the very nature of existence. To embody restraint one must go against the grain of existence, hence the term <i>gevurah</i>—it requires added strength (heard from the Stitchiner Rebbe).</i>",
                "The second day of creation revealed this force. God then created a barrier, the firmament in the Heavens, to divide the spiritual waters from earthly waters. He pulled the spiritual into its domain, and the physical recoiled into its dimensions. The personality who inculcated fear of God into the Jewish soul was our second father, Isaac. Isaac’s relationship with the Almighty is called in the Torah, <i>Pachad Yitzchak</i>, “the fear of Isaac” (Gen. 31:42).",
                "Abraham was creative, while Isaac excelled in staying within the bounds of the behavior his father had modeled. Isaac dug his father’s wells that the Philistines had sealed. During famine he did as his father did—he traveled to Gerar and presented his wife as his sister. Isaac’s finest moment was when his father brought him atop Mt.

Isaac had not heard such a decree, and nevertheless Isaac held himself back. He displayed enormous strength and restraint when he did not stir with a single protest as his father tied him for slaughter.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">378</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Kaplan writes:<br>Concerning the relationship of the Patriarchs with the <i>Sephiros</i>, we saw that Abraham is the paradigm of <i>chesed</i>, “love.” He is the pure altruist. Isaac is the person who totally subjugates his ego. In fact, you see this to such a degree, that after being bound upon the altar, Isaac’s life becomes a perfect parallel of Abraham’s life. He digs the same wells that Abraham dug; he goes down to the Philistines and calls Rebecca his sister, just as Abraham had done with Sarah. The reason for this is that Isaac is a person who totally gives up his ego. Abraham is the initiator; <i>chesed </i>is essentially initiating a new idea. Whereas Abraham initiates the new movement, Isaac sees himself as a transmitter. He is a perfect disciple (<i>Innerspace</i>, pg. 63).</i>",
                "In religious practice, <i>chesed </i>and <i>gevurah </i>find expression in Judaism’s twin pillars of service, love of God and fear of Heaven. Abraham is the first father of all Jewish souls. He filled himself with absolutely divine <i>chesed</i>, and all Jews have within their souls an innate desire to love God as a genetic endowment from him. As descendants of Isaac all our souls harbor an innate fear of Heaven. Jewish practice does not demand behaviors that are foreign to one’s nature. All one must do is draw forth feelings that are latent within the Jewish personality.",

The right hand is usually more active, and since <i>chesed is </i>linked to spreading and doing, it is represented with the right.

                "In Jewish law the right is preferred to the left. For instance, when performing the service in Jerusalem’s temple the priest had to turn to the right side whenever he ascended the altar. Furthermore, when arising in the morning, we begin the process of washing our hands with our left hand serving the right through pouring water on it. When getting dressed we are to first put on the right shirtsleeve and right shoe. Since the right symbolizes <i>chesed</i>, preferring the right is a reminder to ourselves, and a prayer to God, that love should dominate fear.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">379</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Perhaps this was the symbolism of the binding of Isaac. Abraham, the paradigm of love, had to assert supremacy over the limitations of fear, so that more Divine Love would flow to this world than Divine Recoil. The reason why the first Mitzvah in the morning is washing the hands with water might also be an expression of the supremacy of love. Water emerged from the <i>Sephirah </i>of <i>chesed</i>; pouring water over the hands is a symbolic act that arouses love to become manifest and proceed before all other emotions (Rav Wolfson).</i>",

There is no harmony or beauty in each one by itself, but as soon as I take black and white and mix them together I can make all kinds of beautiful pictures, not by merging, which would just give grey, but by a blending of the two. Again with pure <i>chesed</i>, you can take a whole pail of paint and just pour it on the canvas.

A true king is someone who has fully internalized the fact that he is a mere ray from the Almighty, he demands no honor for himself and is entirely subservient and nullified before the Almighty.

They usually hate their king and curse him in their hearts. External leadership is appropriate for the manifestations of the <i>kelippah </i>forces, the evil copies of the saintly realm. <i>Malchus </i>of holiness entails total nullification, or truly absolute leadership.

Since the plague of hail corresponded to <i>malchus </i>during the downpour of physical stones, there was also a spiritual flow from on High of <i>yiras shamayim</i>—fear of Heaven. Due to the special appearance of a Divine spirit that caused all to accept His rule, the Torah writes that even Egyptians had true fear of Heaven. Numerology confirms this thesis.

It provided the water that allowed for life in Egypt. In fact, the Nile was a supreme authority to many Egyptians, and they viewed it as a god. When <i>malchus </i>of holiness appeared, the kingship of evil was stricken. The plague of frogs corresponded to <i>yesod </i>because it entailed excess procreation. <i>Yesod </i>of holiness means that one displays an unbridled passion for Mitzvos. The practitioner of a holy <i>yesod </i>has an ever increasing, vigorous commitment to God. <i>Yesod </i>is called a river of blessings, for a river symbolizes constantly replenishing waters, and blessings symbolize a state of eternal growth and receipt of new gifts.

The first order, <i>Zeraim</i>, which contains agricultural laws, corresponds to <i>chesed</i>, and <i>Mo’ed</i>, the order of holiday law, corresponds to <i>gevurah</i>. The fourth order is <i>Nezikin</i>, tort law. This order details how observant Jews are obligated to safeguard the property of others and ensure that no damage occurs to others from one’s ox or flames. <i>Nezikin </i>corresponds to <i>netzach</i>. Since in holiness, <i>netzach </i>is expressed as ensuring that one’s animals not damage others, when the force of <i>netzach </i>was revealed in the world, it caused animals to damage the property and persons of the realm of evil.<br>The plague of pestilence was a plague of death and it corresponded to <i>tiferes</i>. <i>Tiferes </i>entails balance and harmony, and it is also called <i>rachamim</i>, “compas-sion,” and <i>emes</i>, “truth.” Truth requires a balance. A man of truth will sometimes display <i>chesed</i>, and at other times he must display <i>gevurah</i>. Truth is eternal and everlasting. The hallmark of falsehood is its transient nature. Our forefather Jacob, the paradigm of <i>tiferes</i>, was a man of truth. According to our sages, our forefather Jacob never died. Since pestilence corresponded to <i>tiferes </i>it caused death in the realm of evil.<br>The plague of boils corresponded to <i>gevurah</i>. Fire is a display of <i>gevurah</i>.

The healing is therefore through song, which brings joy” (Cf. <i>Likkutei Moharan </i>24). “The ten songs were also alluded to in the ten sounds of the shofar. On Rosh Hashanah the shofar is sounded in the following manner: <i>tekiah shevarim teruah tekiah</i>; <i>tekiah shevarim tekiah</i>; <i>tekiah teruah tekiah</i>.

Thus, <i>keser </i>corresponds to <i>yechidah </i>and the <i>kutzo shel yud</i>. <i>Chochmah </i>corresponds to <i>chayah </i>and the <i>yud</i>. <i>Binah </i>corresponds to <i>neshamah </i>and the first <i>heh</i>. <i>Chesed</i>, <i>gevurah</i>, <i>tiferes</i>, <i>netzach</i>, <i>hod</i>, and <i>yesod </i>correspond to <i>ruach </i>and the <i>vav</i>. Finally, <i>malchus </i>corresponds to <i>nefesh </i>and the final <i>heh</i>.</i> are the personality maps that teach man how to become a <i>tzaddik</i>. It is hard to become a <i>tzaddik</i>; there are many barriers that must be broken. Yet if one asserts the mind over the heart, or if one engages in holy emotional activities, or if one employs internalization that corresponds to innate will, one can defeat the <i>kelippos </i>and become a <i>tzaddik</i>. A <i>tzaddik </i>uses his personality in holiness thus embodying the holiness of the <i>Sephiros</i>. That is why he, like Shabbos, is the channel through which life for the world flows.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">476</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Lesson Twenty-Four we learned that Shabbos and the <i>tzaddik </i>display all ten <i>Sephiros</i>. That does not contradict the text. The first three <i>Sephiros </i>do not appear fully in our world. A mere echo of their sound resonates in our world. The seven lower <i>Sephiros </i>are more fully expressed. Thus, Shabbos and the <i>tzaddik </i>fully display the seven lower <i>Sephiros </i>and posses only a meager revelation of the top three.</i>",
                "<b>Song and Return</b>",
                "In holiness, due to the chain-like nature of creation, every level is linked with the stage above it. Thus, the seventh note of music has within it traces of the realm of eight. Lessons Seventeen and Eighteen revealed that the number eight is associated with the fiftieth year, the force of <i>Yovel </i>that returns all to their roots. After the seven lower <i>Sephiros</i>, there is the intellect of <i>binah</i>. <i>Teshuvah</i>—returning to God—stems from the universe of <i>binah</i>. The light of <i>Yovel </i>is a display of the <i>Sephirah </i>of <i>binah</i>. Hence, the lesson of the Rebbe of Modzhitz: the palace of return, the level of eight, is the palace of song, the level of seven. For when one reaches a complete experience of the seven lower forces one finds oneself already in the realm of the level of eight, the world of Return.",
                "King David wrote that in the future, when the Messiah will have come, we will sing to God a “new song” (Ps. 98:1). Perhaps the Talmud’s lesson about David’s harp is the deeper meaning of that new song. The Talmud teaches that in the Temple in Jerusalem, King David used to play a seven-stringed harp. When the Messiah will come, David’s harp will have eight strings. In the World-to-Come it will have ten.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">477</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Eirchin </i>13b.</i>",
                "The <i>Sephiros </i>are the significance of these strings. In our dimension of reality only seven <i>Sephiros </i>are fully revealed, hence a seven-stringed instrument. The Messiah will return all to their root. He will personify Bethlehem, the place of <i>Yovel</i>. During his reign, a great light of <i>Yovel </i>will glow—the <i>Sephirah </i>of <i>binah </i>will express itself. As a result, music will change. A new note will appear, all tunes will be enriched, and David’s harp will possess eight strings. In the ultimate future David will have a ten-stringed harp. Then the fullest revelation of all ten <i>Sephiros </i>will be with us.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">478</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Land of Israel was controlled by ten nations before the Jews conquered it. These peoples were the shells covering the lights of the ten <i>Sephiros</i>. When Joshua entered Israel, the Jews only conquered seven of these nations. The territories controlled by the Keni, Kenazi, and Kadmoni were not conquered. We only received the land of the seven nations, for only the seven lower Sephiros have emerged fully in our world. Once the Messiah arrives, we will inherit the land of Keni, Kenazi, and Kadmoni, for in that era all ten <i>Sephiros</i>-like lights will appear (see further <i>Tzion Ve-Arehah</i>, pgs. 49-51, 149-157).<br>There are three <i>Shabboses </i>in the summer months when the readings from the Prophets are predictions of destruction. After the ninth of <i>Av</i>, for the next seven <i>Shabboses </i>we read sections of consolation. The first three readings correspond to the Three Intellects. Since our world has not merited a true and full display of those Heavenly lights, those readings are of destruction, and the time of year is a time of mourning for the destruction of Jerusalem and Jewry’s subsequent exile. Since our world has a revelation of the seven lower <i>Sephiros</i>, we read seven readings of consolation. Each reading helps restore one of the <i>Sephirah </i>lights which dimmed with Jerusalem’s fall. When Messiah will come there will be ten readings of joy, for then there will be a display of all ten <i>Sephiros </i>(adapted from <i>Mishbetzos Zahav, Parashas Nitzavim-Vayelech</i>. 5753, pg. 283).</i> A new world will exist then; in that Messianic world, there will be ten different notes in the musical scale. The <i>Sephiros </i>will then be fully revealed in the world and internalized within man.",
