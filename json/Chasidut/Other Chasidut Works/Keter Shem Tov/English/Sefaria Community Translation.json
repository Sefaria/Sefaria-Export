The explanation: For true knowledge is that one does not know. However, there are two types of not knowing. One is that one immediately doesn't enter to probe and to know after [the fact is] that is impossible to know. The second [way of not knowing] is that one probes and seeks until he knows that it is impossible to know. The difference between this and that one [can be understood] with a parrable. There were two people who wanted to know the king. One of them entered into all the rooms of the king and benifited from all the rooms and halls of the king. After this he was not able to know the king. [In contrast] the second one said that after it is impossible to know the king he didn't enter into the rooms of the king at all."

                "[A teaching] from [Rabbi Israel] the Master of Good Name, in the name of Rabbi Saadia Gaon: As the main purpose of the creation of the human in this world is to break their naturally [formed] negative characteristics, and in this they raises the rank [of an attribute of their soul] which is called \"your nature\" in the higher world which is called the world [olam] similar to the term concealed [helem] and hidden. And [for] this [reason] the verse states: \"Go forth for yourself, from your land, and from your birthplace, [and from your father's house, to the land I will show you]\" (Genesis 12:1). This refers to the natural [inclination] that one is born with. And [one must] see to it that it is broken as described above. [And as the verse continues] \"And from your father's house\" - As \"your father\" [corresponds to the divine aspect] that is called \"Wisdom\" or \"Father\", and \"your father's house\" [corresponds to the divine aspect] of \"Understanding\" [or] \"The World of Thought\". And the intention [one must have] is that one must see to it that the negative thoughts are repaired. And this [is why] the verse states: \"And your father's house\" - that one must recognize [the need] to separate [the holy] that had fallen [into] the thought [that stems] from one's \"father house\" in order to return them and to raise them [to the realm of the holy]. And though this [act of repair] one will merit higher \"land which I will show you\" - that I will make \"your nature\" known in the [higher] world."

This constitutes one's healing. This is not the case with the mystery of hiddenness, as in the verse \"I will surely hide [My face]\" (Deuteronomy 31:18), which is when one is not aware that one is spiritually ill. Then one does not [experience] the healing of one's personal affliction."

As it says of Torah, \"the Torah of God is whole\" (Psalms 19:8) -- and that which it says \"You shall be wholehearted\" -- even in engagement with Torah, \"you should be with the Lord your God.\" And do not say \"Isn't the Torah itself called 'Torah of God'?\" [and that this suffices for one's relationship with God].
