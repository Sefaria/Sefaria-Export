                "<b>The Principle of Service is based on Knowledge</b> <br> <small>In this first chapter, R. Gershon Henokh discusses the centrality of knowledge in the path of serving God. This knowledge, however, has several aspects. On the one hand, it means exoteric knowledge: the knowledge of the Torah and its commandments, which enables a person to live a committed Jewish life and worship God according to the Codes of Jewish Law. On a deeper level, R. Gershon Henokh equates knowledge with faith; for the knowledge of God’s unity provides faith in times of adversity.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the sense that knowing that all of life’s occurances – both bad and good – comes from the single source of God’s unity and love.</i> Finally, in keeping with hasidic tradition, knowledge – <i>da’at</i> – also means an inner enlightenment, a direct awareness of Divinity.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reader should notice how the author moves seamlessly between these different approaches, apparently seeing them as part of a single type of knowledge.</i> Thus, he refers to hasidism’s great principle: “In all your ways, know Him.” This is not merely the knowledge of how to serve God in all of life’s details – as defined by the Codes – but how to actually unite with His eternal presence, even as it manifests itself amidst the mundane aspects of reality. The goal of acquiring this knowledge reflects another important aspect of R. Gershon Henokh’s approach; that is, the descent of Divinity from the highest realms to the lowest, and the role of man and Torah study for investing the lowest levels with supernal wisdom, thus spreading the knowledge of God on earth.</small>",
                "I thank God with all my heart,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This opening is based on the verse in Tehillim (111:1).</i> In the counsel<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Sod,” in Hebrew, means both counsel and mystery. “In the counsel of those who remain,” “<i>b’sod</i> <i>hanisharim</i>” in Hebrew, is a play on the words of Psalm 111, “<i>b’sod</i> <i>yesharim</i>,” “in the mystery of the upright of heart.” This leads us to the simple principle that the unknown becomes known through proper counsel, which is the aim of this treatise. It is also an allusion to the four major works penned by this author, collectively called <i>Sod Yesharim</i>, as mentioned in the introduction. As is often the case regarding the titles of Hasidic works, the numerical equivalent of the phrase, “<i>sod yesharim</i>,” is “Gershon Henokh.” (=630) It may be that this equation is the least significant of the mysteries contained in the pages of this book. </i> of those who remain<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Those who remain and those who love,” refers to members of each generation who yearn for Divine truth. It is as though, at this point in the opening of the work, the author is inviting the souls of the great Torah masters of the past; for he is entering into a battle of the spirit, and not going alone. His polemic is not only armed and positioned with a regiment of prophetic spirits, but with the prophets themselves and the One who speaks to them. All God fearing men who enter into a dialogue with the soul and the “penimiyut,” or internal aspect of the Torah are a part of the counsel, and all who revere the message and morals of prophets and kabbalists and are worthy of the mystery.</i> and those who love, <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">cf. Megilla 6b, “אוהבי שרידים יושבי רקת”. According to Rashi, “lovers of Israel.”</i> Those who thirst for God’s word, Those love His Torah with truth and wholeness. They do not learn the Torah as a woodsman sharpens his axe, in order to earn a living.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Pirkei Avot, 4:5, Nedarim 62a, where the Sages speak sharply against those who use the Torah in order to gain honor or riches. </i> Nor do they adorn themselves in it like a fur coat.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">כאדרת שער, cf. Bereshit 25:25, “And the first came out all red, like a hairy garment.” Esav, the hunter, the man of the field, would put on the act of righteous to win his father, Yitzhak’s favor. Those who, “adorn themselves in the Torah as one wears a fancy coat,” were religious men whose saintliness was more an expression of self-aggrandizment than inner dedication. The author was known as a bold fighter, and not afraid to compare many of the self-styled scholars and holy men of his generation to Eisav.</i> Yet they bend their ears to hear the words of the sages. Their hearts yearn to know the truth.",
                "They are shamed and disgraced due to [their love of Torah]. Yet, those who shame them will be put to shame, and those who scorn them shall be scorned! And as for us, we are shamed daily, by the voice of the reviler and the insulter, the enemy and the vengeful.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is not clear whom R. Gershon Henokh is refering to here. Who were his revilers? It should be noted that R. Gershon Henokh was imprisoned for twelve days by the Russian government, perhaps for what they considered insedious activities. However, even the leaders of contemporary Izhbitzer Hasidism do not know the true reason for his imprisonment.</i> Yet, regardless of all we suffer from them, we have not forgotten the Torah, for it is the covenant that God has forged with us.",
                "Even though their envy of the Torah has consumed us, and the humiliation of those who blaspheme her have fallen upon us, and they mock us, by saying, “What will you gain, and what will your study of the Torah add for you? You will gain more if you reduce your efforts, for is not God’s Torah already perfect?”",
                "All of these descend upon us, and not only from our enemies. We are insulted even by our brothers, masters of the Talmud.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Perhaps this refers to the Gerer Hasidim, from whom he suffered attacks (as mentioned in the introduction), and whom were known as outstanding Torah scholars. Even if his words do not refer to that specific group, from the context, we can discern that they are individuals who rejected the study of <i>sod</i>, who studied Torah in an abstract way (an approach he rejects much later in the introduction), who failed to bring their learning down to the level of observance, and who clearly had a personal vendetta against him.</i> They too sully our name, saying, “What business do you have digging to the depths of the Torah? The plain meaning is enough! Why should we contemplate and seek to understand that which is hidden?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There have been many opponents throughout Jewish History to the way of Kabbalah and the Hasidic movement, established by Rabbi Yisrael Baal Shem Tov. The Gemara recounts incidents of great and holy mystics who damaged their souls in their quest for God’s mysteries (see Talmud, Chagiga, 14b). Among those closest in time to R. Gershon Henokh generation was Sabbatai Tsvi, who was initially accepted by his generation as the Messiah (as to what extent, see Sholem’s biography entitled Sabbatai Tsvi ); yet whose converstion to Islam caused great anguish among the Jewish World. Aside from his already unstable psyche, his use and misuse of Kabbalah was undoubtably a significant influence on his failure. It was the debacle caused by this incident that led the Ashkenazic Rabbis who lived just after that time to impose greater limitations on the study of Kabbalah, such as restricting it to those forty years of age and older. (See Moshe Idel, …” Find source in Shulchan Aruch) Later, in Chapter 30, R. Gershon Henokh argues that such restrictions no longer apply. The author regarded this reactionary movement against Kabbalah – expressed not only by secular enlightenment rationalists, but also from the Lithuanian yeshiva world of his day – as a self-inflicted wound to the Jewish soul, based on a misunderstanding of Kabbalah’s real meaning. (See Maggid, Hasidism on the Margin, ch. 2) In contemplating the claim of “those who sully our name,” it is fair to say that not all opponents of Kabbalah studies denied outright the deeper meanings of the Torah; it is just that they felt that most people are not worthy of its sublime, and potentially dangerous, knowledge. [I’m pretty sure this is the claim of Alan Nadler, <i>The Faith of the Mithnagdim: Rabbinic Responses to Hasidic Rapture </i>(Johns Hopkins Jewish Studies) if you want to quote an academic source) Later, the author himself will agree that not everyone can penetrate to the Torah’s depth. Yet, in that he sees the entire thrust of Jewish history as the <i>bringing down</i> of supernal knowledge to the lowest level, he sets this as the goal of all true Torah scholars – a goal that was eminently achieved by his grandfather, Rav Mordechai Yosef, founder of the Izhbitzer hasidic dynasty, and the latter’s successors.</i>",
                "They pay no attention to that which the Torah admonishes us (Devarim, 4:39), “You shall know this day and take unto your heart that Hashem is Elo-him,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This famous verse expresses the deepest mystery of life, and is among the central tenets of the Hasidic movement. Although this verse was taught by Moshe on the very last day of his physical life, to the Hasidic master, the words are eternally relevant: “know <i>this day</i>.” This knowledge is not merely of the fact of revelation, but the very ongoing <i>act </i>of revelation. Thus, the knowledge is not merely intellectual, but mystical. It is the awareness that the Transcendant God is also immanent, and that the All-Powerful has the capability to reveal something of Himself through the vessels of finite creation. For R. Gershon Henokh, this verse is also the source of faith, which, to the Hasidic masters, was a trans-cognitive faculty that enabled one to breech the opposites of God and reality, infinity and finitude. As R. Gershon Henokh will explain below, faith is the realization God’s mercy and compassion, represented by the ineffable name YHVH is itself E-lohim, representing God’s judgment. God’s Judgment is God’s Mercy. Faith in God’s Goodness in the midst of adversity is the sign of a truly believing person. For God to ask man to know that Hashem is E-lohim requires man to know that there is a spiritual wisdom beneath or beyond the surface of the hard facts of life. This depth of belief opens up the ability to know mysteries of God and the Torah. The notion that God’s judgment is God’s mercy is termed in the Zohar as, “the mystery of faith,” as will be more fully discussed in chapters seven and eight. </i> in the heavens above and on the earth below, there is no other. And you shall guard his statutes …”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, knowledge of God’s unity, in heaven and earth, in good and bad, leads one to guard His statutes.</i>",
                "So too, are we cautioned (Devarim, 32:47), “And he said to them, take to your hearts all that I testify to you today, that you shall command your children to guard all the words of this Torah in order to do them. It is not an empty thing for you, for it is your life.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse tells us that the Torah is not an empty thing. To R. Gershon Henokh, studying the simple meaning of the Torah, without also delving into its esoteric dimension, makes the Torah “an empty thing” – a body without a soul. It is interesting to note a comment of Rabbi Elyahu, the Gaon of Vilna, on Proverbs (2:9): “When one understands the secret clearly, he will understand everything clearly – including the simple meaning, the hint, and the allegory. Yet all the while he does not know the secret, he can not yet understand even the simple meaning with total clarity.” R. Gershon Henokh would clearly concur with this opinion.</i> And in this you may increase your days …”",
                "This is as David HaMelech said to his son, Shlomo HaMelech (Divrei HaYamim 1, 28:9), “And you, Shlomo my son, know the God of your fathers and serve him with a whole heart and a willing soul. For all hearts seek God, and all intellects understand (this principle). If you seek Him, you shall find.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Reshit Chochmah</i>, the classic work of Kabbalistic piety by Elijah DeVidas, a student of the Arizal, uses this same verse – “Know the God of your father and serve him” – to explain the prerequisite of attaining knowledge for divine service. The <i>Dor Yesharim</i>, the official family history of the Isbitza-Radzin dynasty, records that Rabbi Gershon Hanokh Lainer always kept a copy of the Reshit Chochmah on his bedside table, and his grandson, the author of the family history, writes that his grandfather would learn the Reshit Chochmah by candlelight when he would wake in the middle of the night. </i>",
                "Indeed, the essense of serving G-d depends upon the level of one’s knowledge.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Knowledge precedes all other accomplishments. According to R. Gershon Henokh, service, love, and fear only exist when one “knows.” </i> Prayer is called “the service of the heart,” as the Gemara (Ta’anit 2a) asks on the verse (Devarim, 11:13), “If you heed My mitzvot … to serve Him with all your heart.” “What is considered the service of the heart? This is prayer.” For in order to serve God, one needs two qualities – the love of God and the fear of God,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“יראת השם” (<i>yirat Hashem</i>), translates as the “fear of God.” It can similarly be understood as awe, reverence, or awareness of God’s presence, which to varying degrees, affects one’s behavior and concern for the proper adherence to God’s laws. </i> as it states in the Zohar (Shlach, 165a), “One who serves God with joy fulfills the verse (Tehillim, 100:2), ‘Serve God with joy,’ and one who serves God with fear fulfills the verse (ibid, 2:11), ‘Serve God with fear.’” Clearly it is impossible for a person to serve, fear, and love something that he does not know.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The author argues that one needs knowledge in order to begin to serve God. It is clear from the above mentioned teaching in the Talmud that prayer is one of the main forms of the service of God – “service of the heart.” Prayer obviously requires belief. A person cannot pray full-heartedly unless he believes that God is listening to him. But the author is saying more. Even an animal will obey its master only if it has some fear of punishment for disobedience, or show dedication in its actions if it feels love for his master. How much more so, a human being. The deeper man’s fear and love is for God, so does he strengthen his dedication to fulfilling God’s will. Do develop these feelings, he needs to put his mind and heart on the nature of God and the intimite role God plays in his life at all moments. All the good man receives, whether it is health, children, knowledge, honor, wealth, or wellbeing, is bestowed upon him by God. And all suffering – no matter how small – can be considered some form of Divine chastisement. The more man strives to know God in all of his walks of life, the more God will respond in kind and reveal Himself on a deeper level. </i> We find in the introduction to the Tikunei Zohar (5b): The tenth level<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Zohar describes two levels of fear of God: a lower and a higher, depending upon their correspondances in the <i>sefirotic</i> tree. That is, classic Kabbalah views reality in terms of a gradual ten-step descent from the infinite Godhead to the physical world. Each step, or <i>sefirah</i>, dims and colors the Divine Light, until it can be perceived in our world. These ten stages are further divided into four worlds, known as <i>Atzilut </i>(Emanation), <i>Beriyah </i>(Creation), <i>Yetzirah </i>(Formation) and <i>Asiyah </i>(Action). Furthermore, these correspond to the Tetragrammaton – the four letter Name of God – .י – ה – ו – ה The “tenth level” discussed here is the <i>sefirah</i> of <i>Malkhut</i> (Sovereignity). Being the lowest and furthest step from the Godhead, it is also the <i>sefirah</i> of greatest concealment and constriction. On this level – as it corresponds to the human psyche – fear is the product of a <i>lack </i>of true knowledge, and means simply “fear of punishment” for transgressing Divine law. Such an attitude reflects a distance from God, and a relationship to Torah’s laws as external, imposing commandments.</i>  in the fear of God is as follows. There is fear, and there is fear. Not all expressions of fear are the same. One person’s fear of God may be largely motivated by the fear of Divine punishment. Of this it is taught (<i>Pirkei Avot</i> 2:5), “An unlearned person cannot fear sin.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, a person ignorant of the Torah does not have the basic information to know what to fear.</i> A higher level of fears derives from the Torah itself, which is <i>Tiferet</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tiferet</i> (Beauty) is the <i>sefirah</i> of harmony and balance. In the center of the <i>Sefirot</i>ic tree, it connects all points on the map: above and below, right and left. Kabbalistically, <i>Tiferet</i> corresponds to the Torah, which also connects and harmonizes all levels – man and God, man and his fellow, man and himself. Knowledge of Torah brings one into connection with the <i>sefirah</i> of <i>Tiferet</i>, which results in a higher type of fear: not the fear of punishment, but an awe and recognition of God’s glory, which automatically causes a person to cling to and fulfill the commandments.</i> called the “middle column,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The ten <i>Sefirot</i> are organized in three columns, right, left, and middle. The middle column joins the right and the left together. It is closely related to <i>Tiferet</i> (see previous note.) </i> which is the name <i>Havay’ah</i> (the Tetragramaton,י-ה-ו-ה). Because of this, the authors of the Mishnah taught, “Great is the Torah in that it brings a person to action.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Torah is the middle column, whose action essentially joins all of the ten <i>Sefirot</i> together and enables communication between them, and hence, generates action. In the same way, true fear of God is the first impetus for all Divine service.</i> If a person does not know the Torah, or the reward for keeping its commandments and the punishment for transgressing its commandments, nor is he aware of the One who created the Torah and gives it to Israel, how can he fear God and guard His commandments? For this reason David said to his son Shlomo, “Know the God of your fathers and serve him.” For if one does not know the one who gave him the Torah and commanded him to guard it, how then can he fear Him and fulfill its commandments?",
                "Similarly, we find in the Midrash Sochar Tov: “How may a young man make his path pure? By serving according to Your word” (Tehillim 119), Shlomo said, “In all your ways know Him.” If you know and are conscious of God in all that you do, He will straighten the paths before you. Thus, it is said (Tehillim, 16), “Make the path of life known to me.” So too, Moshe said to God (Shemot, 33), “Now, if I have found favor in your sight, let me know Your ways.” And also (Tehillim, 25), “Lead me in Your truth, and teach me, for You are the God of my salvation.” And (Tehillim, 86), “God, teach me Your way.” And it is written (Yermiyahu, 6), “Stand on the roads and see, and ask about the ways of the world, and see which is the good way. Then walk in it, and find rest for your soul.” Look at the path that Avraham took, and look at the path that Nimrod took, and see who succeeded. So too did David say, “And you, Shlomo my son, know the God of your fathers, and serve him.”",
                "The following passages of the Zohar express the central principle that knowledge is the prerequisite to any true Divine service. Everyone who goes to the next world without knowledge will be thrown out of each and every gate of that world, even though he has many good actions to his credit. (Zohar Chadash, Shir HaShirim, 77a) If a person is in this world, and does not strive to know Him, it would have been better had he never been created. For this reason, be seen before the Holy King, in order to know Him in this world. Strive to serve God in the mystery of faith, as it is written (Devarim 4), “You have been shown in order to know that Hashem is Elo-him, there is none besides Him.” God brought man into this world precisely in order to know that God is Elo-him. This is the principle of every secret of faith in the entire Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Notice how this passage of the Zohar equates knowledge with faith – two concepts usually considered to be opposites. To R. Gershon Henokh, however, true knowledge means the realization that the compassionate and loving God, referred to by the name Hashem (Y-H-V-H) and the God that brings upon human beings trials and adversity (E-lohim), are really one, and that even life’s afflictions are an expression of God’s love and compassion. He will return to this theme later, in chapters six and seven. On a related note, the Mei HaShiloach explains that human beings suffer, due to a lack of knowledge. That is to say, if a person truly understood the meaning behind the fulfillment of the commandments, then there would be no suffering whatsoever in the service of God.</i> (Terumah, 161b)"
            ],
            [
                "The Purpose of Knowledge <br> <small>Having established the centrality of knowledge in the service of God, R. Gershon Henokh now adds another element: True knowledge includes an understanding that God created the world in order to bestow goodness upon man, and that God desires that we make our own efforts in order to receive this goodness. The opposite approach – receiving God’s goodness as an unearned gift – would engender feelings of shame in the receiver. Thus, God gives man a path of action – mitzvot and good deeds – which allow him to deserve His bounty. However, since the greatest gift we can receive from God is further knowledge – which means, in this case, a direct, mystical experience of Divinity – so a circle is formed: intellectual knowledge of God’s Torah and an understanding of His plan for creation leads us on the path to its fulfillment, which ultimately results in a deeper, direct spiritual knowledge of the Giver of the Torah Himself.</small>",
                "It is written in the Zohar (Zohar Chadash, Shir haShirim, 77a): “What kind of wisdom does man need? One kind is the wisdom to know and look into the mystery of his Master. One kind is the wisdom man needs to know himself, to know who he is, how he was created, from where he came and to where he is going, the nature of the rectification of his body, and how in the future he will have to stand in judgment before the Master of all. One kind of wisdom is the ability to know and look into the mysteries of the soul … and after this, the supernal secrets of the upper world, in order to know his Master. Man can see all of these in the secrets of the Torah.” A person needs to know his Creator and his Creator’s attributes. Furthermore, whatever we are permitted to know about Him must be used to serve Him. For any knowledge of Him that does not add to His service is considered “too wondrous” for us to know.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The author is connecting the knowledge of G-d with the worship of Him, and by this, dismissing purely abstract knowledge of the Divinity. There are many sources in the Torah that speak about levels of knowledge and awareness that are above human cognition, and are thus forbidden to delve into. Here, the author defines those levels as those that cannot enrich a person’s religious practice.</i> This is as the Gemara says (Chagiga, 13a), “Do not seek that which is too wondrous for you, and that which is hidden from you do not investigate.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Following the sages of the Talmud (Hagiga, 13a), Rav Gershon Henokh sees a danger in delving into the outer realms of God’s mysteries. Yehezkel saw, “A form over the heads of the angels, a firmament like the awesome ice.” And the sages warned, “You are permited to speak up until this point. Beyond this point you are not permitted to speak. Thus it is written in the book of Ben Sira, ‘Do not seek that which is too wondrous for you. Do not investigate that which is concealed from you. Contemplate only what you are permitted to contemplate, for you have no business in hidden things.’ “ Rashi explains, “That which is too wondrous for you are matters that are divided and separated from you. God did not want to reveal these matters to you.” </i> However, we are permitted to contemplate matters that lead to the knowledge of God’s existence and attributes. We may meditate upon how He created and arranged the creation to its final ends. How He created good and evil, and gave man the power to choose good and life. For this one needs to contemplate the nature of good and how God desires to bestow benevolence upon His creatures, as it is written (Tehillim, 89:3), “I said, the world shall be established on benevolence.” This is God’s intention for His creation, which we are permitted to contemplate. The intention from the very first moment of creation came forth from His simple will, as primordial as God Himself, with no initiative from the side of the creation at all, for nothing had yet been created that could bring about such an awakening.",
                "<small>From the moment of creation and onward God desires that man receive his reward based on his own efforts</small>",
                "Indeed, from the moment of creation and onward, God desired that man receive reward based upon his own efforts and (what the psalmist calls) “the work of his hands.” This is as it is said in the Midrash,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Midrash Kohelet, 4:6, on the verse, “Better a handful of quietness, than two fistfuls of labor and striving after the wind.”</i> “Man’s efforts are called striving – and then eating.” For this reason man was given free choice. This is as it is written in the Tikunei Zohar (70, page 137b): When the Torah says, “let us make a man,” it means that man needs to fulfill the commandments of the Torah, and exert himself in the Torah, “to work it and to guard it.” From this he will be rewarded and gain mastery over the angels. This is (Yeshayahu, 60), “the bud of My planting, the work of My hands in which to glory.” We find that although the supernal angels are mighty in strength and perform God’s word, still they are not mighty in the service of the Holy One, blessed be He. This is because they are forced to serve Him, and face no obstacles like the physical body or the evil inclination.... For this reason it is said, “let us make a man (who overcomes these obstacles by using his power of choice, to serve God out of his own volition).” For this reason man will rule over the angels.",
                "God desires that man receive his reward based on his own efforts. Then it will be called (Tehillim, 128:2), “You will eat based on the work of your own hands, fortunate are you, and it will be good for you.” This is as the Jerusalem Talmud states (Orlah, 1:3), “Someone who receives his food from another is ashamed to look his benefactor in the face.” One who receives a free gift cannot receive it face to face. This is as it is said in the Gemara (Pesachim 118a), “What did David have in mind when he said, ‘His mercy endures forever’ twenty-six times?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Psalm 136.</i> They correspond to the twenty-six generations from the creation of Adam until the giving of the Torah, which were all sustained purely on God’s benevolence.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, until the generation that the Torah was finally given (the 26th from the creation of Adam), human beings were sustained through G-d’s benevelence, and not in response to their own deeds. This state, however, does not fulfill G-d’s intention for the world, and were the Torah not given, the world would not have been able to continue.</i>",
                "For this reason we find that up until the time that Avraham served God through active performance in deed, namely the covenant of circumcision, he could not look face to face at the <i>Shekhina</i>, the Divine presence, as is mentioned in the Midrash Tanchuma (Lech, 20).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On a simple level, R. Gershon Henokh means that Avraham could not behold the Shekhina until he performed some act of commandment: in this case, the ritual of circumcision, which gave him the merit to behold G-d. On a deeper level, the idea is that the removal of the foreskin corresponds to a “spiritual circumcision” of the consciousness, allowing the mind to perceive the previously hidden God, and gain a deeper connection to the Almigthy. In this way, brit milah is a paradigm for all forms of religious devotion. R. Gershon Henokh will make this point below, in chapter 4. See, also, the Chasidic work <i>Ma’or VaShemesh</i>, <i>Vayera.</i></i> This is why the Torah was given to the community of Yaakov, in order to bestow upon, for by serving God through the power of free choice and running after the knowledge of God through the Torah, they merit knowing God, which is in itself the reward. Then, they will be worthy of eternal life, eating of the fruit of their own efforts and receiving God’s light face to face.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Gershon Henokh is providing the reader with a way to reveal God’s presence in the world and God’s hand in human events. To fulfill a command, one must first defer to a higher wisdom, and then exert one’s own efforts to behave in a way that this wisdom deems worthy. In this way, one then looks at this wisdom, “face to face,” in a sort of “meeting of the minds,” between man and God. Looking at God “face to face” means having some knowledge of the Divine order and concern. In this way, efforts to fulfill God’s commandments, based on an appreciation of God’s wisdom and benevolence, is the key element in fostering a close relationship with the Almighty. As will be stated later, the ability to see God’s goodness, hidden even in the darkest of places, is the mystery of faith.</i>"

The question now arises: how did individuals serve God before the Torah was given, when the knowledge of His service had not yet entered the world. R. Gershon Henokh explains that from the time of Adam, there were books and mystery schools in which this knowledge was studied.</small>",

Supernal impressions were imprinted in this book, holy wisdom, and seventy-two kinds of wisdom were explained in three hundred and seventy engravings of supernal mysteries. He left this book to his son Shet and all his descendants until it reached Avraham. By means of it, Avraham knew how to gaze upon the Glory of his Master. This has been explained. Similarly, Adam gave a book to his son Hanokh, from which he looked upon the supernal Glory.”(Zohar, Bereshit, 55b) Come and see! From his childhood, Noah saw the actions of man and how they sinned against the Holy One, blessed be He. So he hid himself, and occupied himself with the service of his Master … If you ask, what book did he use to contemplate Divine service? He studied the book of Adam and the book of Hanokh in order to know how to serve his Master. (Zohar, Bereshit, 58b) Rabbi Shimon said, if I had been alive at the time when the Holy One, blessed be He, gave the book to Hanokh and to Adam, I would have made great efforts that they not become accessible to people. (Zohar, Noah, 78b)",
                "Rabbi Shimon said, “I raise my hands in prayer to He who created the world (see Bereshit, 14:22). Even though our predecessors have revealed hidden supernal knowledge in this verse, one would do well to look into and contemplate the secrets of the book of Adam, because this is the source of the hidden book of Shlomo HaMelech.” (Zohar, Yitro, 70a) Thus we find that Shem and Eiver<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Whom tradition identifies as pre-Sinaitic Torah scholars, living from the time of Noach until the days of Yaakov. </i> had a house of study. When Rivkah was pregnant and the twins were fighting in her womb, it says (Bereshit, 25:22), “She went to ask of God.” The Midrash Rabbah (Bereshit, 63) notes that she went to the house of study of Shem and Aiver. The Gemara teaches us that Yaakov hid himself from Eisav in the house of Aiver (Megillah, 17a).",
                "Similarly, we find that the generations of the Bible produced several oral traditions of the mysteries of the Torah that were received as valid by our sages. It is accepted that one of the classic Kabbalistic texts, “Raziel HaMalakh” is the same as the book of Adam HaRishon and the book of Hanokh. But clearly, when we look at the version of the book, “Raziel HaMalakh,” that exists today, we see many additions from later sages – from the, “letters of Rabbi Akiva,” to the “Chapters of Rabbi Eliezar,” to the manuscripts of the Geonim.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Geonim (coming from the phrase [Tehillim, 47:5], “<i>ge’on Ya’akov</i>,’ meaning, ‘the pride of Ya’akov’) were the Torah leaders who lived in Babylon immediately after the end of the Talmudic period, from roughly 700 C.E. To 1000 C.E..</i> Additional material was added by each of the sages of the following generations who possessed this text. This was true with many ancient texts. Each one who had the book would add to it, both the great and the small, according to their levels. Certainly we no longer know the identity of many of the contributors to these books. We attribute the <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i> (the Book of Formation) to Avraham. It contains five chapters. The <i>Magen Avot</i> of R. Shimon bar Tzemach z”l, the “Tashbetz,” mentions this in reference to the statement in the Gemara (Avoda Zara, 14b), “The text of Avraham Avinu’s version of the tractate of Avoda Zara contained of four-hundred chapters, and ours contains only five.” That is, what remains is our <i>Sefer Yetzirah.</i> He counts five chapters, because the sixth is contained in the fifth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, the version of the <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i> in our hands contains six chapters.</i> <i> </i>The “Tashbetz” explains that all of these (missing chapters) dealt with the removal any concept of physicality from the supernal forces, which are ultimately only created entities. This was so that human beings not be deceived into thinking these forces to be godly. That which remains (of the missing chapters) in our possession is the <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i>. This is the knowledge that man needs in order to serve God, which entails separating the holy way of serving G-d from the Divine service from the invalid ways. This is as it is written in the <i>Sefer Yetzirah </i>(Chapter One), “Understand with wisdom, and be wise with understanding, and establish the matter with clarity, and return the Creator to His base.” "

                "<b>The Torah of Avraham </b><br> <small>Even though an esoteric knowledge was passed down the generations from the time of Adam, with the arrival of Avraham, a new stage in this process occurred. Prior to Avraham, the knowledge of God was attained primarily through mystical contemplation. Man ascended to God by transcending this mundane world. Furthermore, esoteric knowledge was the privilege or mission of a select few righteous individuals, and not the property of humanity at large. A further point, which the author mentions later, is that pre-Sinaitic man was ruled by his <i>mazal</i>, or fate. At Sinai, God freed man from his fate – provided that he serves the Almighty through the way of the Torah.<br>Avraham introduced a new paradigm in serving G-d, and thus initiates what the Talmud calls the “two thousand years of Torah” (despite the fact that the Torah was not actually given at Sinai until five hundred years later.) Avraham revealed how God’s presence could be found on earth, and could be perceived even through the contemplation on one’s very physicality. In this way, Avraham’s efforts resembled the goal of the Torah, which is to bring a revelation of God down from heaven to earth, from the abstract to the tangible. This was a considerably higher level of realization that what had preceded it, and was passed on to Avraham’s descendents – the Jewish people – and the generation that received the Torah at Mount Sinai.</small>",
                "From the days of Avraham began the, “two thousand years of Torah.” This is as it says in the Gemara (Sanhedrin, 97a), “Two thousand years of chaos, and two thousand years of Torah.” The Ramban comments on the verse in Bereshit, “and God blessed the seventh day,” that the two thousand years of Torah began with Avraham. Likewise, we find in the Midrash (Bereshit Rabbah, 2), “‘And the earth was chaos and formless, and darkness on the face of the void’ – these are the first generations. ‘And God said, let there be light’ – this is Avraham.” Avraham began to illuminate the world with the understanding that God does not exist only in heaven, but also on earth. Noah’s son Shem is identified as Malki Tzedek, the king of Shalem. (See Bereshit 14:18) Malki Tzedek addressed God as <i>El Elyon</i>, “the supernal God.” The verses identify him as, “a priest to <i>El Elyon</i>,” and he himself said, “blessed is Avraham to the <i>El Elyon</i>, and blessed is <i>El Elyon</i>, who has delivered your enemies into your hands.” <i>Elyon</i> – Supernal – represents that which is above man’s comprehension. Before the giving of the Torah, the acts of studying Torah and serving God were accompolished through tremendous self-nullification, trials, and suffering. This led them to an understanding of G-d’s existence, and the knowledge of the One who rules His world in the aspect of, “the Supernal God.”",
                "Avraham, however, understood that God, “fills the whole world with His glory.” He removed the <i>orlah</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Orlah</i> means “foreskin.” The author is stating that Avraham’s removal of concealment of G-d paralleled his own act of circumcision.

Thus we find after he was given the commandment of circumcision (<i>milah</i>) it is said (Bereshit, 21:33), “And he called in the name of <i>Hashem</i>, the God of the <i>world</i>.” This means that God’s existence became apparent in all aspects of the creation, as the Midrash Rabbah (Vayera, 48) states, on the verse (Iyov, 19:26), “‘From my flesh I shall see God’ – Were it not for the act of circumcision, how could God have been revealed to me?” That is, he saw God’s light in every detail of creation. When Avraham said, “I raise my hands to the <i>Supernal</i> God,” it was before the circumcision.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the <i>Beit Yaakov </i>in parshat Lech Lecha, 33.</i> Similarly, we find that the Patriarchs taught the Torah to their sons.

The pre-Sinaitic esoteric works where accessible only to a select few. With the giving of the Torah, two things changed: (1) God descended into creation. That is, no longer did the relationship with God require a human being to transcend the physical world (as in the case of Malkei Tzedek, mentioned above), and (2) a means was now provided for even the lowest individual to enter into a relationship with God. Thus, R. Gershon Henokh interprets the “voices” heard at Mount Sinai as the voice of Jewish people’s own, inner revelation. Meaning to say, with the Giving of the Torah, Divinity became accessible to each and every person.<br>The author further explains that while the Torah does not expect a person to do more than he is able – for God does not make His commandments impossible to fulfill – nonetheless, the obligation to learn the entire Torah still applies to every person, since only then can he fully incorporate the Divine Presence in his life.</small>",
                "It is said of the giving of the Torah (Shemot, 19) that, “God descended on Mount Sinai.” This is as it is said in the Zohar (Yitro, 82a): We have learned that at the time God revealed himself at Mount Sinai, all of Israel saw as one would see with a lantern, and in this light, each one saw even that which the prophet Yehezkel did not see. What is the reason? It is because these supernal voices were revealed as one, according to our explanation of the verse in the account of the giving of the Torah, “all of the people saw the voices.”",
                "This “voice” is the inner voice. It was then revealed to Israel that the entire world is filled with God’s glory, and that He gives life and being to everything, at every moment. Consider the following passages in the Zohar:  Rabbi Shimon said, come and see! The voice of the shofar is the place of the voice. To explain this, consider the verse, “for on all that comes out of God’s mouth does man live.” What is, “that which comes out of God’s mouth?” It is the voice of the shofar.",
                "(Yitro, 81b) And according to them David mentioned seven “voices” in Psalm 29, “Ascribe unto God, ye sons of the mighty,” and of these seven it is said, “not on bread alone does man live, but on all that comes out of God’s mouth does man live.” (Tikun 69, page 117b) Why is the Torah called “Torah?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The root of the word for “Torah” is related to both the word for teaching – <i>hora’ah</i> – and the word for light – <i>ohr</i>. Thus, the Torah’s teachings are like a light that reveals the mysteries hidden in the darkness of creation. </i> Because it teaches and reveals that which was hidden and not known. (Metzorah, 53b)",
                "Therefore, from the moment the Torah was given, the world is no longer solely sustained by God’s benevolence. At the giving of the Torah, God showed even greater kindness, which is called, “eating from the effort of your hands” (Tehillim, 128:2).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, human beings were not in a give-and-take relationship with God, and the life and vitality that He bestowed upon creation was an expression of His gratuitous love. However, with the giving of the Torah, mankind could now earn God’s goodness through fulfilling the Torah – “the effort of your hands.” This allows for an even greater degree of closeness.</i> Even though everything still comes from God’s benevolence, it was God’s desire that with the giving of the Torah man should perform actions which enable him to be conscious of God’s light and the knowledge of God’s existence in this world. This is called, “the effort of man’s hands.” The Torah is the sum-total of all of the creation. With the Torah, every person capable of arriving at the entire level of understanding that God allotted for his creation. This is as it is said in the Zohar (Yitro, 83b): All of the later generations were summoned there, and they all received the Torah at Mount Sinai, each one as befit him. Everything in the Torah is applicable to every individual person. This is as the Zohar says (ibid.): “And God spoke all of these words, saying…” (Shemot, 20:1, directly before the Ten Commandments). “Spoke all of these words,” means – all of these meanings, all of these secrets, all of these mysteries, decrees and punishments. “Saying” – means in order for it to be a uninversal inheritance, as it is written (Devarim, 33) “Moshe commanded the Torah to us as <i>an inheritance</i>.” A story is told in the Midrash Rabbah (Vayikra, 9:3), “Rabbi Yannai saw a man who was finely dressed in the manner of a scholar. He invited him home, and in the course of the conversation discovered that he had no Torah knowledge whatsoever, not in the Gemara, Mishnah, or the Chumash. When the man wanted to lead the Grace following a meal, as is the custom for a guest, Rabbi Yannai said, ‘You may do so by saying these words: “A dog at Yannai’s bread.’” The man seized Rabbi Yannai by the collar and said, ‘You are withholding my inheritance!’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, “you are denying me a relationship to the Torah.”</i> Rabbi Yannai said, ‘What is your inheritance?’ The man said, ‘Once I was walking past a school, and I heard the children saying, “Moshe commanded us the Torah, an inheritance of the community of Yaakov.” The Torah does not say, “An inheritance of the community of Yannai,” but rather, “An inheritance of the community of Yaakov.”’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The continuation of the story: “Rabbi Yannai then wanted to know in what merit this man was eating at his table. The man said, ‘In my entire life, I always kept silent upon receiving an insult, and I never saw two people arguing and did not make peace between them.’ Embarrassed, Rabbi Yannai said in shame, ‘You possess such good behavior, and I called you a dog.’”</i>",

                "Even though not everyone can fathom everything with a complete understanding, nonetheless, everyone can understand <i>according to his</i> <i>level</i> even the secrets of the Torah. As it is summed up in the Zohar (Yitro, 83b): If you were to contend: it reveals mysteries that are not relevant to everyone, to this it is written, ‘<i>Anochi</i> – I am Hashem you God.’ Just as I am hidden and concealed, so too will these words be hidden and concealed in you hearts. Hinted in the Torah is God’s divine conduct of all generations down to the end of all generations. Everything that is gleaned from the Torah is advice designed for every person. It is written in the Zohar (Beha’alotcha, 152a): Rabbi Shimon said, “Woe is the man who says that the Torah is just a collection of stories and mundane information. The story of the Torah is the garment of the Torah. To the one who says that the garment is the actual Torah, I say, may he breath his last! He has no share in the world-to-come. For this, David said (Tehillim, 119), ‘open my eyes, that I may behold the wonders of Your Torah.’ Meaning, may I see that which is beneath the garment.” A person needs to contemplate the Torah in its entirety, for it is the life of the world and the life of every man. The entire Torah is essential for everyone in order to serve God, may He be blessed. A person needs to consider how every story found in the Torah teaches a path in the service of God.",
                "We find written in the Midrash on Mishlei (end of section 10): Rabbi Yishmael said, come and see how difficult is the Day of Judgment! In the future, the Holy One, blessed be He, will judge the whole world in the valley of Yehoshephat. When a Torah scholar comes before Him, God will ask him, “Did you study the Torah?” He will answer, “Yes.” God will then say, “If this is as you say, tell me what you have learned.” For one who has learned the Five Books of Moshe but has not learned the Mishnah, God will turn His face away from him. Then the forces of persecution will surround him like a pack of wild hounds and take him off to <i>Gehinom</i>. When one who has studied two or three orders of the Mishnah comes before Him, God will say to him, “My son, why did you not learn the laws by heart?” When one who has learned the laws comes before the heavenly court, God will say to him, “My son, why have you not learned the <i>Torat Cohanim </i>(halachic Midrash on the book of Leviticus)?” When one comes before Him who has learned the <i>Torat Cohanim</i>, God shall to him, “Why have you not learned the five books of Moses?” If one comes before Him who has learned the five books of Moses, and God will say to him, “Why have you not learned <i>aggadah</i> (legends of the Torah)? For at the time when a rabbi sits before his students and teaches the <i>aggadot</i>, I forgive and atone for all the sins of Israel!” If a soul comes before God who has learned the aggadot, God will ask him, “Why have you not learned the Talmud? For it is said (Kohelet, 1), “All the rivers run into the sea, and the sea is not full,” referring to the Talmud. When another one comes before God who has learned the Talmud, and God will ask him, “Why have you not glimpsed at the Holy <i>Merkava</i> of Divine Mysteries? For I experience no pleasure in My world like the time when the sages sit in the study of the Torah, and glimpse, look, see, contemplate the great Talmud of Divine Mysteries, knowing how My Divine throne of glory stands!” ",

                "Even with <i>Ma’aseh Merkava</i>, (the knowledge of the Mysteries of the Torah), one needs to learn with the goal of doing. This is as it is said in the Tractate Chagiga (14b), after Rabbi Elazar ben Arach had just cause the trees and mountains to sing, from his teachings of the Divine mysteries, “Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai said of Rabbi Elazar ben Arach, Blessed is the God of Israel who gave a son to Avraham Avinu who knows how to understand and teach the <i>Ma’aseh</i> <i>Merkava</i>. There are those who are good at explaining but cannot do. Then there are those who know how to do, but cannot explain. Fortunate are you, Avraham Avinu, that Rebbi Elazar ben Arach descended from you, who knows both how to teach and how to do!” From this we see that even with <i>Ma’aseh</i> <i>Merkava</i> one needs not only to know, but needs to perform and uphold. In the case where one knows how to do, but does not know how to learn, every soul of Israel who performs the Mitzvot in all their details is intending the very depths of God’s will. Then God considers it as if he has fulfilled all of the mystical intentions (<i>kavonnot</i>). So too, one who prays with the utmost simplicity and a pure heart, and knows nothing of the <i>kavannot</i> of the Kabbalists, also intends to fulfill the depths of God’s will, and God considers this as if he has prayed with the most lofty of <i>kavanot</i>. It is written in the Zohar (Vayehi, 243b): Rabbi Yossi and Rabbi Hizkiya asked Rabbi Shimon, ‘We are taught that one should begin by praising God, and then make his request. What about someone who wants to pray but his heart ill at ease, and is so disturbed that he can not properly praise God before asking for his needs?’ Rabbi Shimon answered them, ‘His prayer is no less, even if he cannot enter into the optimal frame of mind in order to praise God. He should make his praises even in his current state of mind. Then he should go ahead and ask. … However, a person who has the ability and the proper frame of mind to properly praise God before praying, yet does not, of him is it said (Yeshayahu, 1), ‘Though he pray much, I will not heed him.’ But for one who simply cannot collect his mind and achieve <i>devekut</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Devekut </i>means intense cleaving to God.</i> God nevertheless accepts his prayer and his divine service. The Zohar says that this is (Tehillim, 17:1), “Hear the right, O God, attend to my cry, hear my prayer.” This is an example of, “one who knows how to do, but does not know how to explain.”",

In R. Gershon Henokh’s eyes, this defines the mystery of faith, for true faith is the ability to perceive God’s light and providence in each detail of creation. In the chapter following this one, R.

Further in the Zohar, it is written (Terumah, 161a): Rabbi Hiya spoke after him and said (Devarim 4:35), “It was shown to you, so you may know that Hashem is God, there is none other besides Him”; (Devarim 4:39) “And you shall know this day, and take into your heart, that Hashem is God, in the heavens above and on the earth below, there is none other.” The entire mystery of faith depends on these words.

This relates to the Zohar’s statement (Shemot, 15b): Rabbi Akiva said to him, what is the meaning of the verse (Shir HaShirim, 7:11), “I descended to the <i>egoz</i> (nut) garden to see the fruits of the brook”? Why does this verse say, “I descended”? It is just like the way we say, “he descended to the <i>Merkava</i>.” (When our sages describe one who is involved with <i>Ma’aseh Merkava</i> <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or, one who speaking in a prophetic experience (רוח הקודש) (Rav Moshe Cordevero).</i> they refer to it as “descending.” This Zohar compares the Merkava to a nut in a number of ways, one of which is that they both have a <i>kelipa</i> (outer shell or peel). The chariot of Yehezkel was surrounded by the <i>kelipot</i> of the storm wind, cloud, and fire.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yehezkel described the Divine chariot as being surrounded by concentric circles. The outer layers correspond to the four “kelipot,” or “forces of evil.” Three of them – the storm wind, cloud, and fire – are pure evil and can not be rehabilitated for the good. One of them, however, called <i>nogah</i> (or, “brilliant light,”) has the capability of being rehabilitated. Within these four circles of kelipah, are holy, divine entities - the angels. In the center, God Himself resides in His hidden Glory. </i> The meaning is, when one descends, and sees God’s glory even in the lowest of places, this it <i>Ma’aseh Merkava</i>. In this there are different levels. The knowledge one receives the garden of Torah knowledge depends on his ability to receive. Concerning the knowledge that is beyond man’s ability to receive, the Talmud says (Chagiga, 13a), “Do not seek that which is too wondrous for you, and that which is hidden from you do not investigate. These mysteries are not for you,” and other verses that imply his knowledge of lack."

                "<b>Knowing Evil</b> <br> <small>The mystery of faith is the true secret of God’s unity. With the mystery of faith, one can understand how God runs the world with loving-kindness, even when one sees the righteous suffering and the wicked prospering, for the mystery of faith allows us to look beyond the garments of this world. One of the central, and most controversial, tenets of Izhbitzer Hasidism is the idea that God’s unity can be found even in its extreme opposite – in sin and evil itself. Thus, in R. Gershon Henokh’s terms, the greatest mystery of faith is that God can even be found where He ostensibly is not. In this chapter, R. Gershon Henokh cites several sources that allude to this mystery. Understanding this truth was the goal of many great figures in the past. For instance, the Talmud states that during the reign of King Solomon, the moon was always full. In this case, the “moon” is a metaphor for this world, which receives its light from God (like the moon receives light from the sun). Shlomo desired to reveal God presence in all aspects of life. Thus, the “full moon” is a metaphor for complete revelation, without any dark or “diminished” aspect. Thus, Shlomo declared in Shir HaShirim: “I descended to the egoz” – into the kelipot or “impure shells” of negativity – to seek God there, as well.</small>",
                "It is written in the Zohar (Yayehi, 223b): Since Shlomo HaMelech inherited the moon in its state of completeness, he needed to inherit it in its state of deficiency. He strove to understand spirits and demons (i.e. the forces of evil) in order to inherit the moon in all its aspects. For this reason, in the days of Shlomo HaMelech the moon shone in all its aspects. And in the Tikkunei Zohar (Tikkun 26, p. 71b): Clearly The Holy One, blessed be He, and His <i>Shekhina</i> have not changed. Yet from an outside perspective, they do change. That is to say, (in this world) they are concealed in layers of garments and shells. This is why Shlomo HaMelech said (Shir HaShirim, 7:11), “I descended to the <i>egoz</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Egoz</i> means “nut,” in Hebrew.</i> garden.” He had a complete knowledge of the kelipot (impure shells), which gave him a thorough knowledge of all forms of sorcery. The faithful shepherd<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The faithful shepherd, here, is the Messiah. The Zohar also refers to Moshe Rabeynu as <i>Raya Mehemna</i> which means, “the Faithful Shepherd.” One of the books that is included in the Zohar corpus is also called the “<i>Raya Mehemna</i>.”</i> will break all of the kelipot, bringing forth the essence which the shell conceals, meaning the Tetragrammaton (YHVH).” And in the Zohar (Ta’azria, 47b): “And I saw the superiority of wisdom <i>from</i> folly.” (Kohelet, 2:13) From folly itself emerges something of benefit to wisdom. If it were not for the existence of folly, wisdom and all its extensions would not be known. We have learned that together with wisdom, it is incumbent upon man to learn something of folly, for in knowing it, it serves to benefit his wisdom. In fact, the knowledge of folly or evil is a component of none other than the mystery of faith. It is written in the Zohar (Bo, 34a): It is proper for man to know good and to know evil, and to return himself to the good.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here the Zohar is speaking about King Shlomo, whose great wisdom certainly allowed him to know the good. But how did he “know evil?” Referring to a king, the Torah commands (Devarim, 17:17), “he shall not have too many wives, and his heart shall not turn away.” Yet, of King Solomon, the verse states: “…” The queens of King Solomon encouraged him to study and practice idolatry. When King Shlomo wrote, “I descended into the nut garden,” he was telling us how he had become intimately acquainted with the force of evil in the world. </i> This is the mystery of faith. The more one can find the good hidden in evil, the more he will understand how, “God created one over against the other.” (Kohelet, 7:14)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse reads, “On a good day, be in the good, and on a bad day, see that also God made one over against the other.” The Biblical commentor, Rashi, explains: “This is the good and its reward, versus the evil and its punishment.” The commentary <i>Metsudat David</i> explains, “Know that the evil itself was sent from God. The degree of evil has a corresponding punishment.” In Kabbalistic writings, the verse generally means that for every force of good, God created a parallel force in the realm of evil. In view of the quote from the Zohar, Parshat Bo, “see” could mean to recognize the evil, but realize that “God made one over against the other” – that we must choose the good in response. Hasidic teachings take an even further, unified approach. They seek to find the good within the evil itself. This is the Baal Shem Tov’s idea that evil actually provides a setting, or “throne,” for the good (רע כסא לטוב). For without a knowledge of evil, it would be impossible to recognize the good. Thus, evil actually plays a role in revealing God’s goodness, and is thus a part of the Divine unity itself. “See that also God made one over against the other,” would mean to see the good within the evil itself. </i> This is as it said in the Zohar (Shemot, 15b): Rabbi Akiva said, why did Shlomo HaMelech say, ‘I descended to the <i>egoz</i> garden.’? This is just as we say, “he <i>descended</i> to the Merkava (Divine chariot).’ Rabbi Akiva asked, what does the dirt that is found in the shell of the <i>egoz</i> represent?”",
                "And the Zohar answers (Pekudei, 233b): “Just as the nut has a shell which surrounds the fruit (the inner essence), so it is with everything possessing <i>kedusha</i>, where the <i>kedusha</i> is inside and the force of evil surrounds from the outside.”"

                "<b>The Difference Between Yeshayahu and Yehezkel</b> <br> <small>Yehezkel’s vision of the chariot was one of several, similar prophetic visions, recorded in Scripture; the others being Yeshayahu’s vision of God sitting upon a throne (Yeshayahu 1), and Eliyahu’s encounter with God’s “still, small voice” that followed a vision of a storm wind, cloud, and fire (I Kings 19). Of all of them, Yehezkel’s vision is the most detailed. R. Gershon Henokh explains this to have been due to the needs of his time. The First Temple had just been destroyed, and the Jewish people were going into exile as slaves. At that moment, God suspended the decree that prophecy could only occur within the land of Israel, and allowed Yehezekel to reveal to them the meaning of suffering. Yehezkel’s vision of the Merkava – that is, the revelation of God upon earth – would provide support for Israel in the Diaspora, and grant them the faith that God was with them even in all the hardships they were sure to encounter.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The vision of the Merkava, and the mystery of faith, were not only relevant to the generation of the exile. The idea will be discussed in greater depth at the end of the book, when R.

                "It is written in the Zohar (Shemot, 2b): We must ask, if Yehezkel was a faithful prophet, then why did he reveal all that he saw in his prophetic vision? If the king invites someone into his private chamber, is it proper for that person to divulge all he saw there to the press? Yet it is clear that Yehezkel was a faithful prophet. He had permission from God to reveal all that he did. Furthermore, everything he revealed was <i>necessary</i>. The Zohar concludes that all that Yehezkel revealed was necessary for the people of Israel to know in order to survive the ensuing exile. They were accustomed to great delights while living in the land of Israel, and the Babylonian exile was going to be harsh. Therefore they needed to receive the knowledge of <i>Ma’aseh</i> <i>Merkava</i> dressed in this form, as the Gemara says (Hagiga, 13b), “Yeshayahu was like a townsman who saw the king, while Yehezkel was like a country person who saw the king.”",
                "How would the knowledge of <i>Ma’aseh</i> <i>Merkava </i>help the Jews to survive in exile? Yehezkel saw how the furthermost garments and most external and distant realms are also concealing God’s light and are under God’s providence.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yehezkel was the only prophet besides Moshe to receive prophecy outside of the land of Israel. Because of the incredible suffering of the Babylonian exiles, it was crucial to reveal to them these awesome mysteries, in order for them to find meaning in their pain. </i> This is the essence of <i>Ma’aseh</i> <i>Merkava</i>, as explained above. It is hinted to in Yehezkel’s vision of “a storm wind coming from the north, a great cloud, a burning fire, and the light of <i>nogah</i> surrounding it.” Though these are the <i>kelipot</i>, he taught us that God conducts the world through them, as wellas it says (Tehillim, 148:8), “the storm wind performs God’s word.”",
                "Of the storm wind, the Zohar says (Pinchas, 127b), “This is the wind which agitates man’s body. Eliyahu managed to subdue the storm wind, as it is written (Melachim 2, 2:2), “And Eliyahu ascended to heaven in a storm wind.” In the Liqutei Torah of Rabbi Chayyim Vital, on the 38th chapter of Iyov, he mentions that God showed Iyov how He, may He be blessed, rules over the serpent,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Symbolizing the forces of evil.</i> and how the storm wind performs His word.",
                "This matter is hinted at in the Zohar (Bamidbar, 118b) on the verse (Bamidbar, 2:2), “every man shall make his camp by his flag.” It says: Yet it is so, that within the holy supernal tree God sealed them with His seal, as we have established earlier. It is written (Yehezkel, 1:1), “and the form of their faces was the face of the man, and the face of the lion to the right, etc.” That is to say, the face of man was included in all four faces on the chariot. Their faces faced the four directions, each face different from the others, yet all included the face of man. Mikhael to the right, Gavriel to the left, Uriel to the front, Rafael to the back, and the Shekhina upon them. Hinted at in this passage from the Zohar on the <i>Merkava</i> is the entire matter of Israel’s connection to God, God’s providence through His management of the world, and the order behind His dispensation of effluence and life. Eventually it describes how God conducts the world through the outer garments. There the Zohar concludes (119a): Rabbi Yehuda said, “with Israel this is certainly so. But why do I also see this among the other nations?” He said to him, “Certainly you spoke well.” He opened his discourse with the verse (Bamidbar, 23:8), “What shall I curse that God has not cursed? Shall I send my wrath on that which God has not sent His?” “Come and see! The way things are above, so are they below. Above, there is right and there is left. Below, there is Israel and the nations. Israel holds onto the right, in the sanctity of the Holy King. The idolatrous nations hold on to the left, the side of impurity. They are all below, from all the levels of the left. All levels hold one to each other, until we see that they are all connected to the head. And wherever the head moves, the tail follows. Why is this? It is because the tail is holding on to the head. Thus, it is similar with the idolatrous nations who operate on the side of impurity. … Bilaam used all of the lower levels. He would look at the lower level, which is the tail, and is necessarily led by the head. This is why he said, “What can I curse that God has not cursed?” I cannot go against God! The supernal head was not giving out harsh judgments on those days.” … Rabbi Elazar cried and opened, saying, “Her sound is like that of a snake on the move.” (Yirmiyahu, 46:22) For now that Israel is in exile, surely the Shekhina moves like a snake. When the snake puts his head in the dust, his tail goes up and bites all that comes before him. It is the same way in the exile. The head is down in the dust, and the tail rules. Who causes the tail to go up, rule, and attack? It is the head, bent down below in the dust! Still, who is it that leads the tail, deciding which way it will go in its travels? The head! Though it is down in the dust, it leads the movements and wanderings of the tail. This is why it is said, “Her sound is like that of a snake on the move.” … Rabbi Yitzchak came and kissed his hands, and said, “If I had never learned anything save the answer to this question, it would be enough! Now I know how God leads the nations.” Here Rabbi Yitzchak understood how God conducts the world through the concealment of His presence, which is all hinted at in Yehezkel’s chariot. The description of the chariot mentions the storm wind, the great cloud, and the fire, which are all expressions of the concealment of God’s light. Yet none of these are mentioned in Yeshayahu’s vision of the chariot, for it was unnecessary at the time, as we explained above. One who understands allusions will realize why Yehezkel was compelled to reveal matters that Yeshayahu was not. The only things that the Torah reveals are matters which man needs to know in order to serve God, and to strengthen his trust and faith in God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In summary, the mystery of faith is simple simple to express in words, yet difficult to obtain and live by. It means knowing that God’s judgment is really a vehicle for His mercy, in that it furthers His desire to bestow, and His overall plan for creation. God wisdom understands and decrees the ultimate good for His creation. The secret of the Merkava is the ability to see God’s light even in the outermost “garments” of creation, and in the realms furthest away from Divinity. In this way, the two mysteries – of faith and the Merkava – go hand in hand. The real secret is that the Divine Chariot is not some vision in the sky only beheld by a biblical prophet. The Chariot is in the world around us, both in times of redemption, and in exile. While this may not make the suffering any easier to bear on a day to day basis, it does mean that if a person looks upon the world with enlightened eyes – with the mystery of faith and the Merkava – he can, at least, find overall meaning in his suffering. This consciousness, passed from generation to generation, witnessed in the visions of the prophets and guarded in the wisdom of the sages.

At first, esoteric and exoteric knowledge were taught together. However, as time passed, as the holiness and wisdom of the generations declined, the people were less able and less fit to receive the secrets of the Torah. This also accounts for differences in the nature of prophetic revelation, as well as discrepancies between scriptural passages of similar nature. By the era of the Talmud, the Sages chose to conceal the deepest secrets of Torah in stories and parables, rather than teach them outright.</small>",
                "At the time when the Torah was given to Israel, the <i>pshat </i>(simple meaning) and the <i>sod</i> (secret) were given together. Each person understood the <i>pshat</i> and the <i>sod</i> according to his particular level. This is as it is written in the Zohar (Yitro, 83b): All of the various meanings, secrets, mysteries, decrees, and punishments, were all given as an inheritance to all of Israel. This is learned from the words preceding the Ten Commandments (Shemot 20:1), “and God spoke all of these words,” (meaning the <i>pshat</i> and the <i>sod</i>, for the specific purpose,) “<i>to say</i>” (meaning in order to be said and given as an inheritance to all of Israel). The knowledge of the Torah increased in the generation of the desert, for we call this generation the, “<i>dor de’ah</i>” meaning, the generation of knowledge, or the generation of the consciousness of the Torah. With the death of Moshe Rabeynu, the light of the written Torah receded, as it is written in the Zohar (Terumah, 156a), “At the time Moshe died, the sun was darkened in the midst of the day, and the written Torah, which is the <i>aspaclaria d’meira</i> (illuminating mirror),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">אספקלריא דמאירה – “A clear lens” means a perfectly lucid source of illumination, a level of clarity unique to the prophecy of Moshe Rabeynu, as the verse says (Shemot 33:11): “And God spoke to Moshe face to face.” This is contrasted with the אספקלריא דאינה מאירה – an unclear lens, or imperfect source of illumination, which is the level of all subsequent prophets, who received their prophecies in visions and dreams, and expressed them using metaphors. Nor were they consciously aware of their own prophecy, as was Moshe.</i> was sealed and locked.” The sanctity of the prophets is inferior to the sanctity of the Torah. This was the beginning of the illumination of the <i>Torah She’ba’al Peh</i> (oral tradition). The <i>Torah She’ba’al Peh</i> is compared to the moon which receives its light from the sun. As long as the sun is shining, we do not see the light of the moon. When the sun sets, then the light of the moon is revealed. The prophets illuminated the light of the <i>Torah She’ba’al Peh</i>. This is as it is written in the Zohar (Kedoshim, 82b): There is a difference between receiving from one’s master, and receiving from the messenger of one’s master. What is the difference? It is written in the beginning of the Pirkei Avot, “Moshe received the Torah at mount Sinai and delivered it over to Yehoshua.” He received it, and then afterwards, transmitted it to everyone. When one receives from another, it is like the reception of the moon from the sun. The light of the moon is entirely a received illumination of the light of the sun.",

This is because there is a difference in the sanctity of the prophets and the sanctity of the writings. It is said in the Zohar (Vayehi, 215b): “Whenever David HaMelech did not speak from under the wings of the Shekhina, but rather prophesized of things to come, it is called <i>zot</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As it is written (Devarim 4:44): “And this – <i>v’zot</i> - is the Torah.” The feminine form of the pronoun “this” - זאת -- implies that the prophetic spirit was initiated from below (through David’s prayers or meditations).

                "Thus was the order of the reception of the inner nature of the Torah. The word <i>Kabbalah</i> means reception, or more precisely, the reception of the <i>penimiut</i> – inner secret nature – of the words of Torah. This is the way it is said in the Tikkunei Zohar (Ch. 12, page 58a): When you go to it (<i>Holekh</i>) to receive it, it is called <i>Halakha</i> (the law). When you receive from it (<i>Mekablah</i>), it is called <i>Kabbalah</i>. This is to say, the inner point of <i>Knesset Yisrael</i> (the Divine presence which dwells with those who guard the Torah) follows this pattern. Before the light of God’s effluence is received, and exists only under the covering of garments, it is called <i>Halakha</i>, or the law. The law is the garments of the words of Torah. When you receive the inner light and understand the <i>penimiyut</i>, it is called <i>Kabbalah</i>. Kabbalah is more closely related to the written Torah (the Pentateuch, Prophets, and Writings) than the garments of the words of Torah (the Oral Torah). Kabbalah comes to explain how the Oral law is found within the Written Torah. This is why the Zohar introduces an explanation with the words, <i>ta hazi</i> – “Come and See!” whereas the Talmud introduces an explanation with the words, <i>ta shma</i> – “Come and Hear!”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The author draws a distinction between the esoteric dimension of Torah (the Kabbalah), and the exoteric dimension (<i>Halakha</i>). The exoteric dimension serves as a covering and concealment over the inner dimension. In other words, under the surface of Judaism’s revealed aspects – the laws, the Talmud – lies a vast mystical dimension. The Zohar invites the reader into its discussion of mystical secrets with the words “Come and see,” because seeing represents a direct, non-intellectual grasp of the material. The Talmud, however (which is the root of <i>Halakha</i>), begins its arguments with “Come and hear.” This is because hearing is a more linear way of processing information (one word after another) and requires a degree of constructive thinking. Accordingly, the Written Torah is actually closer in nature to esoteric wisdom, since it is a product of a direct revelation of God to man, and not the result of deductive reasoning, as is the Oral Torah.</i> All who stood in the line of the tranmission of the Torah aslo received its esoteric teachings (as is explained in the introduction to <i>Brit Menuha</i>, which traces the order of transmission of the secrets of Torah, that is, Divine Names, from Adam HaRishon to Shimon Bar Yohai. Even the Geonim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Torah Scholars and leaders from soon after the closing of the Talmudic period: 800 CE to 1000 CE. </i> delved deeply into the secrets of God, according to their wisdom, as is written there).

Each one understood the mysteries of the Torah according to his level and ability. Yet when the spiritual level of the people fell, and they no longer gave honor to the Torah, when sin became widespread (as mentioned in Kiddushin 71a), the sages found it necessary to conceal the secrets of the Torah, as is mentioned there. We find it recorded in the Zohar (Lech L’cha, 86b) that Rabbi Abba once revealed one of the secrets of the Torah. Rabbi Shimon said to him: I decree that the one you revealed this secret to will be exiled together with this teaching among our fellowship in Babylon. Rabbi Shimon said to him, God forbid that they are to be punished! Yet since the mysteries are so greatly revealed among us, thus he should be exiled among our fellowship, and learn their ways, and the secrets shall be concealed among us. In this way, the mysteries will be revealed only among us, as God has agreed. This means that in Babylon, they knew how to hide the mysteries in garments, as the Zohar states (Vayehi, 224b): Rabbi Shimon said, “When I am among our fellowship in Babylon, they all gather around me, and learn these things openly. After the mysteries are revealed, they take them and lock them in an iron box, concealed from all sides.” This is the nature of the Babylonian Talmud. It is said in the Gemara (Sanhedrin, 24a), “It is written in the scroll of Eicha (3:6), ‘He has placed me in darkness like the eternally dead.’ This is the Babylonian Talmud.” For in Babylon, the Torah was hidden beneath garments. They seem on the outside like simple matters, simple garments, yet they are all in order to hide the mysteries of the Torah in garments of this world.

To prove this point, the author discusses the use of the word shamayim – “heaven” – as a valid appellate for God. Whereas certain Talmudic sages allowed its use, R. Shimon forbid it.

He was on such a level that Eliyahu HaNavi visited him during his years of hiding in the cave, and revealed to him the secret knowledge. This is recorded in the Zohar Hadash (Ki Tavo, 65a) and the introduction to the Tikkunei Zohar. The Zohar (Ahari Mot, 61a) says that he merited the level of Moshe Rabeynu, of whom it is written, “I will speak to him mouth to mouth, I appear to him in clear prophecy and not in puzzling visions.” Anyone who ascends to the level of knowing the secrets of the Torah does so only through the secrets revealed by Rabbi Shimon Bar Yohai. As it is written in the Zohar (ibid.): Rabbi Shimon Bar Yohai governs in the realm of wisdom over all mankind. Anyone who goes up to his level does so only to reconcile with his knowledge. This passage in the Zohar concludes (Ahari Mot, 61a): From the day the world was created, Rabbi Shimon was standing ready before the Holy One, Blessed be He. God would call him by name. The nature of the revelation of Torah that was revealed to Rabbi Shimon was on the level of <i>Torah SheBichtav</i> (The Written Torah). And there is nothing in the world that exists outside of the Torah, for all comes from the Torah. This is as it is said in the Zohar (Ha’azinu, 187a): Rabbi Yehuda said, the Holy One, Blessed be He, is called, <i>“Shamayim</i>” (Heaven). Since He is called “<i>Shamayim</i>,” when all of the firmaments that are included in this name join together as one, they are called “<i>Shamayim</i>” and are called the name of God. What are these firmaments that we speak of? We are taught that there are seven kinds, such as <i>vilon</i> (veil), <i>rakiya</i> (firmament), <i>Shehakim</i> (skies), etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The names of the seven firmaments are וילון, רקיע, שחקים, זבול, מעון, מכון, וערבות.</i> We learned this in the <i>aggatada</i> of Rabbi Hamnuna Saba. The teachings of Rabbi Hamnuna are numerous in this manner.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Baal HaSulam notes that they speak of physical things as allusions to higher realities, such as the seven firmaments, which allude to the seven divine spheres of Zeir Anpin and Malkhut.</i> Rabbi Shimon said that these teachings of Rabbi Hamnuna contain the following. Over against the seventy crowns (Sefirot) of the king, we find the seven firmaments and the seven planets that run and go forth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or, that orbit. </i> Even though they are all hidden in the firmament, still they are called by the name of the physical planets.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">75</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, the names of the physical planets teach about the spiritual planes. </i> The seven planets are Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and the Moon. These (seven Sefirot) are used to receive the names of these seven planets, and this is in order to cover the matter (of the spiritual planes). This is as it is written (Yeshayahu, 47:13), “let them stand up and save you, O astrologers and star diviners.” These names are only an external covering. We use these names even though they are not in the way of Torah. Yet the path we take is the path of the Torah. This is as it is written (Bereshit, 26), “He called them in the names that his father had called them.” We proceed according to the way God speaks. We go with Him, as it is written (Devarim, 28:9), “You shall go in His ways.” Rabbi Yehuda called God, <i>Shamayim</i>, or Heavens, because the entirety of the firmaments is called <i>Shamayim</i>. This is a name of God, may He be blessed. Then Rabbi Yitzhak mentioned the teachings of Rabbi Hamnuna which say that entire expanse of the cosmos, the hosts of galaxies and the like, all contain seventy crowns (Sefirot), seven firmaments, the constellations, and all their servants."

Shimon rejected the use of the word <i>Shamayim</i> as an appellate for God (and thus, corrected R. Yehuda’s statement, above). Several instances in which the word does seem to apply to God are explained and dismissed. Ultimately, only those Names which reveal the absolute light of God, without even the subtlest materialization, may be used; for only these reflect the absolutely clear perception of R. Shimon Bar Yohai.</small>",
                "Though it is true that God runs the world through the medium of the planets and stars, as we say in the Sabbath prayers, “He gave them power and strength to exert their rule over the earth,” yet still, their names are not mentioned in the Torah. Therefore, they are not even considered terms (or metaphors) for God. This is as it is written in the Gemara (Shevuot, 35a), “If one says, ‘I swear to you on the heavens and the earth,’ then his vow is disqualified.” The Gemara goes on to explain that if one swears in the name of “The Merciful,” or, “The Compassionate,” his vow is valid even though these are names that one may erase without penalty. Surely he is swearing in the name of God who is called “the Merciful,” or, “The Compassionate.” It is unlikely that he means anything other than God who is the source of mercy or compassion. However, when he swears in the name of the heaven and the earth, he could easily mean the physical heaven and earth, and not the Creator of heaven and earth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And thus, his oath is invalid.</i> So to is it written in the Bereshit Rabbah (parsha 1), “If the first verse in the Torah had been phrased differently and had said, ‘בראשית ברא ה’ שמים וארץ, In the beginning God Heaven and Earth created,’ it would have implied that the heaven and the earth were gods, creating just as God does.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The grammatical function of the direct object את (<i>et</i>)<i> </i>is to signify the object of the verb. The absence of the את creates an ambiguity, where the verse could mean either, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth,” or, “In the beginning God, the Heavens and the Earth, created.” </i> Therefore the verse reads, בראשית ברא ה’ את השמים ואת הארץ” – “In the beginning, God created <i>the</i> Heaven and Earth.” It says in the Sefer HaBahir (at the section which begins, “Rabbi Berachia explained the verse, “take for Me and offering.”), “From were do we know that the word ‘Heavens’ signifies God? Shlomo HaMelech said (Melakhim 1, 8:32), ‘and may You, O Heavens, hear.’ Clearly Shlomo is not asking the physical heavens to hear his prayer, yet he his praying to God who is called in the name of the Heavens.” It says in the Zohar (Midrash Ne’elam, Bereshit, 11): ‘And You, O Heavens, hear!’ Sholdn’t the verse say, ‘May You hear from the heavens’? Rabbi Yohanan said that the verse is implying something not expressed. There is a spiritual firmament Shamayim (Heavens) is a kind of half way station that receives the prayers before the Holy One. In the Zohar, (Ha’azinu 287a) Rabbi Shimon concluded the discussion in this way: Rabbi Shimon said, ‘I raise my hand in prayer to the Supernal Holiness, and ask that my words be clear and revealed in the Upper world, just as they are revealed in my heart. We do not go in the way of other teachings<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pre-Sinaitic teachings discussed <i>sefirot</i> and divine knowledge using the metaphors of the stars. Yet we learn only from the names revealed in the Torah, as the transmission of the pre-Sinaitic teachings, though initially correct, was corrupted and ended up leading to idol worship.</i> . We go in the ways of the Torah!’ Rabbi Yehuda said, ‘We don’t find anyone with wisdom greater that David HaMelech or his son Shlomo HaMelech, and these “other teaching of the ways of Torah” use the crown on these two great kings (meaning their language). David HaMelech called righteousness “the moon,” for it possessed righteousness. This is as it is written, “Open for me the gates of Righteousness, I will go there and thank God.” Shlomo HaMelech did this also. The moon was called righteousness, and these teachings called the sun both “Brit (covenant),” and “Justice.” Rabbi Shimon said, ‘For how long will my fellowship use these words? For us, we go after the Holy One, blessed be He! We know these things. And we possess knowledge that was not revealed to the generations before us!’",
                "",
                "Rabbi Shimon admits the awesome sanctity of the teachings which preceded him, such as the Sefer Yetzira, the Sefer haMalbush, and the Sefer of Hanokh. Rabbi Shimon was expert in them and quoted them many times in the Zohar. In the Zohar (Pinhas, 217a) Rabbi Shimon mentions the holy covenant called, “Shemesh (sun).” Elsewhere in the Zohar it says (Shemot, 3b), “Sun and shield (from Tehillim, 84:12) is a holy covenant.” So too, the Zohar calls the attribute of Malkhut (Divine Sovereignty), “Tsedek (righteousness).” “‘He met righteousness wherever he set his foot,’ (Yeshayahu, 41:2) this is the lower firmament. (Lech Lcha, 86a)” See also the Zohar, Parshat Nasso (145b), “The word <i>v’Zot</i> (and this) is called righteousness.” In all of these instances, when the Zohar uses these expressions for God, it is doing so only in the context of a homily, or to hint at something. In the early teachings, however, they were expressions for God. Before the giving of the Torah, God’s names were not yet revealed. At this time, God would reveal his name according to the level of the particular generation. This is as it is said (Shemot, Ch. 6), “And I appeared to Avraham, Yitzhak, and Yaakov as ‘E-l Shaddai (the Almighty).’ “ This is because the appearance of Avraham in the world heralded in what our sages call, “the two thousand years of Torah.” Truly, there are many discourses in the Tikkunei Zohar on why God is called, “Shamayim (Heavens),” and it is learned from this very verse, “And I appeared.” Yet in these discourses, no active Godly force is ascribed to the name, “Shamayim.” Notwithstanding, we know that God’s name is hidden in every force. Yet for something to be called a name of God, meaning a name which expresses the force of God, the light must be totally revealed and seen clearly as separate from any created force. That is to say, God’s name represents a direct expression flowing from God’s essence. Anything that hides God’s light, and could be considered as a separate force cannot be termed as a Godly force or a name of God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This chapter is essentially clarifying the difference between Monotheism and idolatry. Idolary is defined as identifying any created force as the source of power or object of veneration. The author taking great care in this passage as a misunderstanding of verses like, “Your God is a sun and a shield,” could be problematic if not properly understood. </i> This is why the Talmud only mentions the term, “Shamayim,” referring to God in a context where it does not want, for some reason, to mention God’s name directly. When the Talmud discusses the transgression of mentioning God’s name in vain, or for no good reason, it calls it, “mentioning the name of Heaven (Shamayim) in vain.” Here the Talmud does not say God’s name out of respect. From this, it is well for one to admonish those who are accustomed to saying, “Heaven help me.” In a situation where one is simply mentioning God, it is fitting to say, “Heaven.” Yet it is forbidden to call God, “the Heavens,” in a context where one is evoking God’s force of power and influence, because the Heavens are not Godly. One could instead say, “may He be merciful <i>from</i> the Heavens.” “From the Heavens,” is referring to God who dwells in the Heavens, and not to the Heavens themselves. It seems that there is an error in understanding the above mentioned Zohar where Rabbi Yehuda says that the Holy One, blessed be He, is called, “The Heavens.” Yet it must be clear that when Rabbi Shimon concludes, “we are not following these early teachings, we are following the way of the Torah,” he was correcting the statement of Rabbi Yehuda."

                "“<i>Anan orcha d’oraita naktinan</i> - We are following the way of the Torah.” This is exactly how Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai said it. Rabbi Shimon revealed how all mysteries are within the Torah. God enlightened him to the knowledge that the Torah contains all Divine names and chambers. The Torah contains the order of the concatenation of the spiritual worlds. All Sefirot, holy names, and names of angels are derived from its verses. It is clearly stated in the Tikunei Zohar (Tikkun 57, page 91b), “every angel has a verse in the Torah.” The mysteries of the pre-Sianitic teachings are not based on the verses of the Torah, for the Torah had not yet been given.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">However, all pre-Sinaitic teachings are hinted at in the Torah, as the Torah includes everything, as will soon be explained.</i> From the days of Rabbi Shimon, the Holy One, blessed be He, revealed the knowledge that it is all in the Torah. Therefore it is said in the Zohar (Aharai, 61a), “All who aspire to ascend levels into the realm of mysteries, do so only in order to complete themselves in the knowledge of Rabbi Shimon.” Even that which was taught in the book of Adam HaRishon was again reviewed and taught to Moshe in the Torah. Concerning this, it is written in the Zohar (Yitro, 70a), “Rabbi Shimon said, I raise my hand in prayer<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Referring to what Avraham said to the king of Sodom in Bereshit 14:22.</i> to the One who created the world. Even though our forbears revealed great mysteries in this verse, it is well for us to delve deeply into the secrets of the book of Adam HaRishon, for this knowledge found itself in the hidden book of Shlomo HaMelech. This book reveals the secrets of man’s generations. It is a tree which reveals the generations of man and bears the fruits which bring them into the world. This is the book of the knowledge of hidden and profound wisdom, which was delivered to the physical Adam HaRishon. This same wisdom was given to Shlomo HaMelech, who recorded it in a book. We have learned that Moshe has great difficulty learning these matters, until the Shekhina came and taught it to him … Then Moshe learned this wisdom, and internalized it.” From here we see that Adam HaRishon had the book of the knowledge of mysteries, and God later imparted this knowledge to Moshe. This is hinted at in Parshat Tetsave (Shemot, 27:20). It is also hinted at in the realms of <i>Ma’aseh Bereshit</i> (The mystery of Creation) and <i>Ma’aseh Merkava</i> (The mystery of the Chariot). “And God created man in His image, in the image of Elo-him,” These are two good points – which are male and female. (Zohar, Nasso, 122b) Just as there is a good spiritual form on the Tsaddik, which leads him in the proper behavior whereby he merits the world-to-come, so too is there an evil form on the head of the wicked, which leads him in his evil behavior, whereby he inherits hell.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This “form” (heb. <i>tselem</i>) is the medium through which the good or wicked individual receives his power to act.</i> Come and see! The actions of man are a testament to that individual’s spiritual form, and is revealed on his face, as it is written (Yeshayahu, 3:9), ‘the form of their faces witnesses against them.’ The form of a man’s face reveals the nature of the angel which accompanies him; whether it is the lion, or the ox, or the eagle, or the man of the chariot of the Holy One, blessed be He, and His Shekhina. … Or perhaps it is from the chariot of the four elements of the earth … This is the secret of (Bereshit, 1), ‘Let the earth bring forth particular species of living creatures.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word for living creature, חיה, is the same as the word for angel.</i> ‘ … Come and see!

                "So too, all of the heavenly chambers, Sefirot, and names of angels that are mentioned in the teachings that preceded the giving of the Torah were then placed and installed in the verses of the Torah.

Understand the following precept. The name of every angel is rooted in a particular Sefirah, and the name of each angel is based on a corresponding verse in the Torah. Each one receives from a certain verse in the Torah. It is through the Torah that God effuses the angel its energy. This is because the entire creation was done through the Torah. Yet it was only with the giving of the Torah that it was revealed how everything in the creation is fixed in the Torah. The Zohar discusses in many places how God looked into the Torah and created the world. We find that from the very moment that God gave the Torah to Israel, everything was already included in the Torah. This necessitates that all the study of Israel needs to be in the Torah of Moshe, as it is said in the Zohar (Yitro, 86b), “ ‘And this is the Torah that Moshe placed before the children of Israel,’ we speak of the Torah which Moshe placed, and not of a Torah which Moshe did not place.”",

Each level would receive from the level above it, and effuse to the level below. The final recipient of this concatenation of effluence was man. Thus man received God’s effluence by way of the stars and constellations. Whether man received good or the opposite was subject to the nature and governance of his star. This was the way in which the entire creation received its effluence. However, when Israel received the Torah, they were raised above the stars and constellations. This was because they were now in possession of the Torah, and the world was created through the Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">89</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rashba notes (Teshuvot, 19) that one who observes the Torah is free from the dominance of the stars, yet one who does not observe the Torah is subject to the dominance of the stars.</i> This is hinted at in the Zohar (ibid): “We learn this from Avraham, since his children would later receive the letter Hei<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hei - ה - is the number five. </i> in Avraham’s name, which represents the Five Books of Moses.

So too do we find several statements in the Gemara telling us that the mysteries are hidden among the select few of the generation. Granted that all of the sages of the Gemara possessed knowledge of the mysteries of the Torah, yet each one knew according to his own level. It is said in the Gemara (Hagiga, 13a), “Rabbi Ami said, the secrets of the Torah are only imparted to an individual who possesses five qualities, ‘The captain of the fifty, the honorable man, the counselor, the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.’ (Yeshayahu, 3:3)” We find that the masters of the Talmud would teach the Torah’s mysteries only with great trepidation.

For one the Gemara (Eruvin, 54b) honors with the title, “<i>Mara D’Ara D’Yisrael</i> – the master of the land of Israel,” it is inconceivable that he did not know the secrets of the Torah. Yet there are different levels in the knowledge of the mysteries.

For the most part, in philosophy, the extraneous is prevalent over the essential.

Most of such explanations lack the source of the intention simply because the language of philosophy is not sufficient to convey its content. Philosophy is verbose, using a great deal of explanation to convey what the Kabbalah does in a few words. This would include passages in the Guide to the Perplexed that dwell at great length to explain the doctrine of eschewing the physical or concerning the names of God, which the Zohar manages to explain in a few concise words.",

                "Below I will present several details in the writings of the Rambam which prove that he had received an authoritative tradition. The Rambam wrote the Guide in the language of philosophers, and quoted the opinion of the classical philosophers. Several sages after the Rambam, such as the Akeidat Yitzchak and Rav Yitzchak Abarbanel, followed suit. They did not do this in order to somehow arrive at a proof of the existence of God as a result of their philosophical analysis, for their faith in God was far more central to them than their discursive investigation. Their goal was only to instruct the perplexed in the proper understanding of the Torah, and they quoted the philosophers in order to serve this goal. If they had not included the opinions of the philosophers, then the intelligencia of their day would not have found their books sufficiently interesting to spend time reading. In their day, the vision of consciousness was greatly hidden. Anyone who wanted to investigate and understand matters of faith, spirituality, and providence, would turn to works of philosophy. This is noted in the Responsa of the RaShb”A (siman 414), who was compelled to make a legal decree forbidding the study of secular philosophy. There the RaShb”A tells us that the “searching” public would put their trust in Aristotle the way one trusts his local baker. Therefore, The Rambam and his spiritual descendants quoted the philosophers as a kind of “bait” to lure the reader in, only to disprove their theories and then enlighten them to the understanding of Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf, the story of Rebbe Nachman, “the Master of Prayer.” </i>",

                "Indeed we find an authoritative tradition in their words. We have seen how they are infuriated over the Guide as it has erred in matters of Divine providence. They claim his words are meaningless in that he does not believe that God watches over all details of creation, but rather has a general providence over the creation as a whole. The source of their erroneous understanding is their hasty reading of the Rambam. In their intellectual arrogance they would see one passage, and then smugly proclaimed it a focal point for their attack. Yet they took no notice of the letter that the Rambam wrote to his student Rav Yosef Shatz ben Rav Yehuda Ibn ‘Aqnin, where the Rambam states that the <i>Guide</i> is made up of several different matters, and can not be understood from a reading of just one of them. Only when you study a number of different passages can you then put them together and understand the meaning. We see this in chapter 73 of the first section of the <i>Guide</i>, sixth introduction, where he disproves the notion of those who say that throughout the entire creation and Divine governance thereof, that substance exists, and God continually creates, destroys, and recreates accidents. Similarly he confronts the belief of the Mu’tazilah that there is no natural existing force of any other agency (but that everything is being newly created at all times.). The Rambam disproves such assertions. Truly, from God’s point of view, He constantly renews the work of creation at all times. Yet concerning the ability God gave man to perceive and understand the creation, here He created definite laws and durations which are immutable. Yet from God’s point of view, both existing forces in nature and the constant renewal of accidents are actually one and the same. That is to say, God’s will for fixed natural laws and His will in the constant renewal of creation are all clearly revealed before Him."

                "<b>Maimonides and the Zohar on Providence– Great Souls think Alike</b> <br> <small>One of the central teachings of the Baal Shem Tov – and by inference, of all Jewish esoteric thought – is the idea that God’s providence extends to the smallest details of creation. A leaf does not fall in the forest that is not under God’s complete will and control. However, on the face of it, this was not the position of Maimonides, who seemed to claim that God ran the natural world with a general, overall providence. God did not oversee the life and death of creatures in the natural world. Divine providence only applies to human beings, who are endowed with intellect, and to the degree that a human being develops his intellect, he merits receiving a greater portion of Divine providence. In the following section, R. Gershon Henokh tries to reconcile the two approaches: he cites passages from the Zohar that also state that God’s providence is greater upon a person who clings to Him spiritually. At the same time, for the sake of this person, God oversees even the smallest details of creation.<small></small></small>",
                "We need not dwell at length on this subject in order to show that the Rambam’s opponents did not understand his intentions. In the third section of the <i>Guide</i> (Ch. 17) he provides the five prevailing views on the subject of Divine providence. The fifth is the view of the Torah. There he says that he does not believe that a leaf falls from a tree under the watch of God’s providence, or that when the spider catches a fly in its web it is a result of the Divine decree. When these statements are read in haste it seems that the Rambam does not believe in individual Divine providence. Yet in that which he says after these statements the Rambam provides us with a hint at the nature of Divine providence. There he continues, “In my opinion, and according to what I see, Divine providence is drawn after Divine effluence, and the same beings that are benefited to the latter so as to become intellectual, and to comprehend things comprehensible to rational beings, are also under the control of Divine providence, which examines all their deeds in order to reward or punish them.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This statement is from M. Friedlander’s translation of the <i>Guide</i>.</i> In these words he hints at his conclusions in Chapter 52 of the third section, where he reveals his true views on the subject of Divine providence. There he writes, “I have arrived at an understanding of Divine providence that will remove all doubts concerning the subject, and reveal the Godly secrets. This is as we have explained in the Chapters on Divine providence (mentioned above), that God’s meets out His providence according to the intellectual level of the individual. For one who possesses a perfect understanding and does not remove his consciousness from God, God’s providence will be with him continually. The man of perfect understanding who occasionally turns his mind away from God, will experience God’s providence only when his mind is concentrated on God. Yet when he is occupied with other things, the providence will depart from him. Yet it will not depart from him in the same way as one who has no intellectual ability to contemplate God whatsoever. It will only be decreased from the intensity of the providence he had previously attained when he was actively concentrating on God.” In this way he explains the entire subject. The Rambam’s words are suited to the words of the Zohar (Vayeira, 103b): “Yet certainly, ‘her husband is known in the gates.’ (Mishlei 31:23) ‘Her husband,’ is the Holy One, blessed be He. He is ‘known’ and connected to every one according to how much a person estimates God in his heart. (The word for ‘gate – <i>sha’ar</i>’ is the same letters as the word for estimation – <i>sha’er</i>.) God is known in a man’s heart in direct correspondence to how much he cleaves himself to God in the spirit of wisdom.” This will be explained later in our introduction. There it will be explained that everything happens according to Divine providence only based on the extent to which one believes in and serves God, and this includes the leaf which falls from the tree. The Rambam himself expresses this view in his introduction to the Mishnah (Seder Zera’im, part six). There he describes a man who pays some builders to build a stone wall on a certain piece of land that will last many years. He knows, of course, that if the same foundation and wall were to be made of straw, it would not last very long. Is there any nonsense greater than this (building something that will not last)? … He commands his builders to make him a beautiful palace, and to plant a substantial vineyard beside it. … Later, in the end of days, long after the man had died and his palace left empty, a righteous man passed by during a storm, and took refuge in the building, whereby saving his life. Another time, another man passed by the vineyard and prepared a medicine from the wine to save the life of another honest and whole individual. … The point is, the whole purpose of this building lasting so many years, with God’s Providence watching over it all the while, was for the benefit of God’s beloved friend in years to come. So too, the whole purpose of God directing His providence over the vineyard was for the specific purpose of saving the honest fellow when the time would come.” In this way, it is written in the Gemara (Avoda Zara, 40b), “Rabbi suffered from gastroenteritis. He then found a flask of apple wine aged seventy years in the deep delved earth. He drank it and recovered. Whereupon he exclaimed, ‘Blessed is God who entrusts his world to watchers!’ “God’s Providence was upon this wine from the moment it the apple tree sprouted, and through the entire span of its preparation and aging. It was God’s Providence that its owners did not drink it all those years, considering that after seventy years it was no longer in the possession of its original owners. It was all a result of God’s individual providence.",
                "",
                "Truly, from God’s point of view, everything in His creation exists under God’s individual providence. It is only from the point of view of the creation where the nature of God’s providence corresponds to the quality of the vessel of reception. Yet from God’s point of view there is no difference. As the Rambam explains in the <i>Guide</i> (Part Three, Ch. 17), “Even according to this view, I am not obliged to ask why God’s providence extends to humans and not to animals. One who has this question must ask himself why God gave the intellect to man and not to other animals? The answer must be, because God wanted it this way, or because it was thus decided according to God’s blessed wisdom. These are the answers to his question. I do not believe that anything is hidden from God, or that God has any weakness<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Weakness, meaning that there would be any limitation on God’s providence where He could not watch over any element of His creation.</i> . Yet I do believe that God’s providence is in accordance with the level of intellect, and cleaves to such an intellect.”",
                "The idea that for the individual who has achieved spiritual wholeness, yet at times turns his mind away from God, the Divine providence will only be upon him when he concentrates on God, is also found written in the Zohar (Shemot, 17b): Once Rabbi Yossi was quietly musing over worldly matters [instead of studying Torah]. With him was Rabbi Aha, who was contemplating the Torah. Suddenly Rabbi Yossi saw a dangerous snake running after him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">104</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Not a physical snake, but a spiritual force coming to punish him.

He fell, and when he got up blood was dripping from his nose. He heard that they were saying (Amos, 3:2), “Only you have I known among all the families of the earth, and therefore I will be exacting with you for your sins.” Rabbi Yossi said, “If I was punished in this way for because of one moment, imagine the punishment for those who give up completely!” Rabbi Yossi opened and with the verses, “For God has blessed you in all the work of your hands, He knows how you went into the great wilderness these forty years, God has been with you all the while, you have lacked nothing. (Devarim, 2:7)” “He leads you into the terrible wilderness, a place of venomous snakes and scorpions…” He explained, “Why does the verse say, ‘venomous snakes’? This was to exact punishment from Israel for any time that they separate from the Tree of Life, as it is written (Devarim, 30:20), ‘For (the Torah) is your very life and the length of your days.’ “"

                "There are those who criticize the Rambam for his commentary on the <i>Ta’amei HaMitzvot</i> (the meaning of the commandments), for at first glance it seems to give weak explanations. They dwell at length with such accusations. Besides that which is known to anyone possessing understanding, that the Rambam would conceal the depth of his intentions in the beauty of his language, and the depth of meaning is far more than what it seems to be in its external form, yet in addition to this, there is nothing irregular or strange about his words even at their face value. We have a principle, that all teachings on the Torah and mitzvot are dressed in the meager garments of this world. Who do we have who is greater than the RaDbaZ (Rabbi David ben Zimra, 1480-1573), who was both a master of the Talmud and a tremendous kabbalist, a leader of his generation? And in his work on the <i>Ta’amei HaMiszvot</i>, he introduces each commandment by quoting the Rambam’s explanation of its meaning as the basis from which to begin understanding. Then, for most of the mitzvot, the RaDbaZ explains the meaning provided by the Rambam according to the true inner meaning in the Kabbalah. Anyone who possesses understanding will clearly know that simple revealed meaning and the inner mystery are one, and join together as one. Anyone who asserts that the inner mystery is something other that the <i>pshat</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">פשט - Simple revealed meaning.</i> of him it is said (Bereshit, 49:6), “let my soul not come into their council.” Even in a place where the RaDbaZ differed in his explanation from the Rambam, still he did not reject the Rambam’s words.

However, when he arrives at the table and the Showbreads, he says, “yet as for the table and the Showbreads that were constantly upon it, to this day I do not know what meaning to ascribe to it.” The RaDbaZ in the Metsudat David found this surprising. There he asks why the Rambam did not say that the commandment of the Showbreads is rooted in the source of Divine effluence which sustains us through the life giving energy in food? This is further surprising, because on the surface it seems that the Rambam is content to provide concise meanings for all of the Mitzvot, so why did he not give such a brief explanation for the Showbreads? The commentaries on the Rambam did explain meanings for this. That the Rambam refrained to explain this meaning is itself proof that all his explanations of the Mitzvot are given according to the mysteries, yet with the table and the Showbreads he wholly and unashamedly admitted that he did not know the meaning. It is interesting to note that the Arizal himself, the master Kabbalist of all time, wrote in his poem for the Friday night Shabbat meal, “God shall reveal to us the meaning of the twelve loaves of the Showbreads.”"

However, by citing other statements of the Rambam, R. Gershon Henokh reveals his true understanding, which corresponds to Kabbalistic teachings on the nature of reality. In this case, the “Workings of the Chariot” is a description of all reality, from the spiritual to the physical. (See chap. … above). Furthermore, the Rambam’s depiction of the world as being composed of coincentric spheres corresponds well with the Arizal’s teachings of essence, vessels and garments.

Many angry words of derision were heaped on the Rambam for this statement. One who reads the Rambam carefully will see that he writes explicitly in the beginning of the third section of the <i>Guide</i> that it is entirely possible that he is wrong, and is giving no definitive word on the subject. It could also be that he didn’t reveal his true intentions. He claims that he is explaining the Divine Chariot according to what he has learned from Scripture and the explanations of the sages, as well as his own philosophical principles. However, if we were to believe that his intention is to say that his explanation ends with the simple meaning of the verses, this would lead to the contradictions with the root principles provided by the Rambam. Don Yitzhak Abarbanel, in his commentary on the <i>Guide</i> (end of the third section), notes that if we were to say that Yehezkel’s understanding was limited to the plain meaning of the verses, it would closely resemble the understanding of the astronomers, so why then were the sages so intent on keeping its meaning hidden? The Rambam himself warned anyone who understood the meaning of the Chariot to take pains to keep its meaning hidden, and he himself published works on astronomy. Furthermore, the Rambam reveals much in the field of astronomy in his explanation of the sanctification of the new month, as well as in chapters 8-11 in the second section of the <i>Guide</i>, where he provides much information about that which he had warned to keep hidden.

The true imprint of the <i>Merkava</i> is apparent in all of existence. This idea was expressed by the holy Arizal in the seventh section of the <i>Ez Hayyim</i> (<i>heichal ABI”YA</i>) in introduction to the <i>sha’ar tsiyur ha’olamot</i> (gate of the picture of the worlds). He says, “We now find that this lowly planet earth, which contains people and animals, and all the vessels of the physical world, is the most external of all the worlds.

The Lurianic cosmology describes the entire existence is an alternation of levels of <i>Iggulim</i> and <i>Yosher</i>. However, when the Zohar discusses <i>sefirot</i>, or how God sends his power down and communicates with mankind, it mostly refers to the three column “human” arrangement of the ten <i>sefirot</i> called, “<i>yosher</i>.” Simply put, the author regards the Rambam’s understanding of the Divine Charriot and Arizal’s order and flow of Divine effluence as one in the same. </i> which translates as the encompassing light of the <i>iggulim</i> (“concentric circle arangement”) of the physical universe. (And the Infinite Eyn Sof surrounds everything.)” (This was found earlier in the Tikkunei Zohar (introduction, page 3b), “and above all, He illuminates in the ten Sefirot of the word of emanation (<i>atzilut</i>), and (then, after in) the ten Sefirot of the world of creation (<i>beriyah</i>), and in the ten groups of angels in the world of formation (<i>yetzirah</i>), and in the ten spherical firmaments if the physical world (<i>asiyah</i>).

The essence (<i>atzmut</i>) is dressed within the vessels.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The author now refers to an alternative depiction of reality. Rather than thinking of God as surrounding reality from without (with physicality being the densest, center point), we can also think of God as within; that is, at the heart of creation, with successively dense layers of creation “covering” and concealing Him from without. Both models are true, depending upon one’s perspective. </i> There it is also explained that in each of the worlds, the essence is divided into the five levels of soul (in order from lowest to highest), <i>nefesh, ruah, neshama, haya, yehida</i>. Each garment covers an inner soul. Yet each garment is also the inner soul for that which clothes it from the outside. Here we find it stated explicitly that the planets of the solar system are themselves the vessels in the World of <i>Assiya</i>. It is further explained that the Divine Chariot is found in all of the worlds, vessels, essence, and soul-levels of<i> nefesh, ruah, neshama, haya, </i>and<i> yehida</i>. Though we find it said in the Etz Hayyim (Sha’ar Klipat Nogah, Ch. 2) that the Divine Chariot is in the World of Formation (<i>yetzirah</i>), yet this means that it is perceived from <i>nogah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A spiritual level even lower than the World of Assiyah. Again, the point here is to dispel any notion that the Rambam understood the Holy Chariot as mere astronomy. More likely, the Rambam was hiding the true, hidden meaning from the unworthy, for the workings of astronomy hint at the deeper reality. A person of great spiritual sensitivity can look at astronomy and see how it is actually a garment for the spiritual realms of Godliness, which are constantly sustaining the physical world. This world is just a parable waiting to be solved by “the moral of the story,” according to true wisdom. </i> in the World of Assiyah until its root in the World of Yetzirah. This is clearly explained in all of the chapters mentioned. We explained above that because of the Babylonian exile, it was necessary to reveal the mysteries of the Divine Merkava to Yehezkel, in order to show him that God’s sovereignty is in all governing forces. (See Tehillim, 103:19) Therefore, Yehezkel saw from the very source of understanding until the place where he needed to see, namely the place which is the source of the power of Divine concealment, meaning until the world of formation (<i>yetzirah</i>). It is explained in the Etz Hayyim (Sha’ar haKlipah, Ch. 3) that in the world of emanation (<i>astiloot</i>, the highest of the four worlds) in the realm of holiness, good is prevalent over evil. This is also true in the world of creation (<i>beriyah</i>, second highest world). Below, in the world of formation (yetsira), the amount of good and evil are equal. This is why the power of the concealment of God’s presence begins in the world of formation. Thus it was necessary to show the prophet Yehezkel that the source of the power of concealment is in the hands of God, as mentioned in the Zohar quoted above (Shemot, 2b, Bamidbar, 118b.)",

These true matters are merely hidden in the beauty of his language.",
                "",
                "When the Rambam explains the visions of the Divine Chariot, in the sixth chapter of the third section of the <i>Guide</i>, he explains why Yehezkel revealed more details about his vision of the Divine than did Yeshayahu. There he quotes the Talmud (Hagiga, 13b), “Yeshayahu saw all that had been seen by Yehezkel. Yeshayahu is like a townsman who sees the king, Yehezkel is like a countryman who sees the king.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There it is written: “The townsman, seeing that his neighbors know well how the king rides, simply tells them that he saw the king. But the villager, wishing to tell his friends that which they do not know, relates in detail how the king was riding, describes his followers, and the officers who execute his order and command.” </i> The Rambam writes, “The generation of Yeshayahu did not require the detailed description. It was enough for him to say, ‘I saw God.’ The generation of the Babylonian exile needed to hear all of the details.” This is exactly according to the words of the Zohar (Shemot, 2b) quoted above.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See chapter 9 on the difference between the visions of Yehezkel and the visions of Yeshayahu.</i> So if all the verses describing the Divine Chariot are only explaining the workings of astronomy, for what reason could Yehezkel have possibly had in thinking that knowledge of astronomy was more useful or of more interest to the exiles in Babylon? From this it clearly follows that the Rambam had possession of a true tradition of the mysteries of the Torah. Here is not the place to dwell on this point. Yet suffice to say that all who study this matter with a clear mind will know that he possessed a true tradition of Kabbalah. The Rambam claimed that there are four planets. The Abarbanel responds to this in saying that everyone knows that there are nine planets. How, the Abarbanel asks, could the prophet Yehezkel have made such a great error? One who studys the Eytz Hayim, in the introduction to the <i>shaar tsiyoor haolamot</i>, shows how the ten are divided into four sections. This is in line with the view of the Rambam. Further, the <i>Guide</i> (Section Two, Ch. 10) hints at the meaning of counting four planets. There you can find an answer to the query of the Abarbanel. Also, in the <i>Pirkei Hatslaha</i> printed in the responsa of the Rambam called, <i>Pe’er haDor</i>, he wrote to his student Rav Yosef Aknin, he explains how the Cherubs on each side of the Ark of the Covenant spread their wings. There he wrote, “just as breath is essential to the life of the heart … so do the Cherubs that jointly spread their wings over the Ark of the Covenant are really two. And know that the sanctuary of your heart is the Ark which holds within it the two Tablets of the Testament.” This exact idea is explained in the Zohar in the section of the <i>Raya Mehemna</i> (Zohar, Pinchas, 235a): For the heart is the seat of judgment, and the four Hayot who are its messengers are the two lungs and the two kidneys. The lungs are the secret of (Yehezkel, 1:11, “and their faces and wings were divided upwards,” reaching up to receive the king … … and the breath of air descends into the heart to cool off its heat, so it does not burn up the body. And when the breath descends, it descends in several directions, like a king and his soldiers. And the lungs receive the breath, which is king over it. This is as it is written (Yehezkel, 1:11), “and their faces and wings were divided upward,” (Shemot, 25:20), “and the wings of the Cherubs shall spread upward.” And in the Tikkunei Zohar (third additional chapter at the end, 140b): Of the lungs it is written (Shemot, 25:20), “and the wings of the Cherubs shall spread upwards, overspreading the covering (of the Ark) with their wings,” this is the covering of the heart.

                "It seems quite clear from several places that the Rambam had possession of a clear tradition of the mysteries of the Torah. Another example is the following. He wrote in the Guide in chapter 45 of the second section, that the eleventh level of prophecy involves, “seeing an angel speaking to one in a vision, as experienced by Avraham Avinu during the binding of Yitzhak. In my opinion this is the highest of the degrees of the prophets – with the exception if Moshe Rabeynu - whose states are attested by the prophetic books, provided he has, as reason demands, his rational faculties fully developed.” In this the Rambam is saying that the level of prophecy experienced by Avraham is the highest degree of prophecy. It follows that the prophecy (of Avraham) recorded in the Torah is of the highest degree known to mankind, save that of Moshe himself, who possessed the absolute highest prophetic perceptions ever. This is what is meant when God describes Moshe by saying (Bamidbar, 12:8), “I will speak to him mouth to mouth,” which attests to the fitness and worthiness of Moshe’s soul. The <i>Mishnah Torah</i> further explains the difference between the prophecy of Moshe and all other prophets.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">113</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Mishnah Torah, Hilchot</i> <i>Yesodei</i> <i>HaTorah</i> (7:6), which spells out the difference between Moshe and other prophets. According to the Rambam, the difference lay in the degree to which the imaginative faculty played a role. When other prophets experienced God speaking to them, they did so through the power of the imagination. Moshe, however, had a direct, intellectual perception of the Divine, without the intermediary of the imaginative faculty, as the verse implies: “And God spoke to Moshe face to face…” (Shemot 33:11) </i> When studying the passages of the Torah concerning prophecy, it is understood that the highest level of prophecy is that which is emanates from the supreme source of prophecy. This is in line with the following passage in the Zohar (Idrat Nasso, 130a), “We have leaned that the name of Atika (the Ancient Holy One)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Atika is one of the highest of the Divine Partsufim (modes of God’s governance) representing absolute and total compassion, beyond the distinctions of good and evil.</i> is hidden above all the rest. It is nowhere explained in the Torah save one place. This is in God’s promise to Avraham (Bereshit, 22:17), where the Lord says, ‘I swear on <i>Myself</i>, saith the Lord.’ <i>Myself</i> is Atika, meaning Ze’ir Anpin<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">115</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ze’ir Anpin is the lower more accessible of the Divine Partsufim. It is a level where God’s concealment is broken only through the performance of Mitsvot, prayer, and ethical behavior. </i> swore on Atika.” This is explained in the Beit Yaakov (haKollel, parshat Vayeira, sec. 57)."

                "The Rambam writes in the Sefer HaMitzvot (Third <i>Shoresh</i>), in the enumeration of the mitzvot (positive commandment 34), and in the <i>Mishnah Torah</i> (<i>hilchot klei hamikdash</i>, 2:12) that the <i>Cohanim</i> shall carry the Ark of the Covenant upon their shoulders. In the Sefer HaMitzvot the Rambam exerts himself to justify why this is a mitzvah for the <i>Cohanim</i>, since the Torah only mentions this mitzvah as being performed by the Levites. Commentaries on this statement of the Rambam bend over backwards to explain his reasoning. The truth is, the Rambam knew the deeper meaning, yet found it necessary to hide it in the beauty of his literary style. The careful student of the Rambam will clearly see that the Rambam knew the true meaning of this mitzvah, which we find in the Zohar (Vayeitse, 148b): It is written (Tehillim, 132:9), ‘Your Cohanim shall dress in righteousness, and your pious ones shall sing.’ Technically, the verse should say, ‘Levites shall dress in righteousness and sing,’ for the Levites are the ones in charge of bringing pleasure to the King! Here David decided that the Cohanim and pious ones shall be in charge of the King’s pleasure. From here we learn the following. One who is in his own house enjoys the privilege of arranging his own affairs according to his own mind. Yet if he is invited elsewhere he will acquiesce to the will of his host, and accept the way the host arranges things for him. When David HaMelech removed the Levites from this function, and put Cohanim in their stead, God fulfilled the matter according to David’s mind. Likewise, many took the Rambam to task for his explanation in the <i>Guide</i> of the meaning of the incense offering (section 3, Ch. 45). There he says that because so many animals were slaughtered in the Temple for the sacrifices, there would have been the undesirable effect of a bad odor. The pleasant scent of the incense offering<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">116</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Talmud says that the incense offering produced such a powerful and pleasing scent that it could be smelled as far away as the twon of Jericho – some twenty miles away from Jerusalem. The archeologist Wendell Jones claims that he found a jar containing some of the incense from the Temple. Upon treating it in a laboratory, the incense emitted such a powerful fragrance that its scent filed the entire block where the laboratory was situated, and its scent was absorbed in the clothing of everyone in the building for days to come.</i> in the place of the slaughtering was in order to rectify this situation. Yet this statement of the Rambam fit perfectly with the words of the Arizal in the Pri Etz Hayyim (Sha’ar haKarbanot, Ch. 5) where he says that the incense is in order to nullify the force of evil.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">117</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is an etymological connection between the word ריח (reyakh) – smell, and רוח (ruakh) – spirit.</i> The source of the Arizal’s statement is in the Zohar (Vayikra, 118b-119a)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">118</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Zohar says (Vayikra, 219a), “Why is the incense so beloved of the Holy One, blessed be He? Because the incense has the power to remove any contamination and purify the Tabernacle, so that it is all illuminated, cleansed, and connected. By reading the verses of the incense offering before the prayer every day, one can remove contamination from the entire world. This is why God loves the incense.” </i> . It is clear that the Rambam knew this, and by seizing on the “simple garment,” of this mitzvah, he was touching its very source. This is particularly accurate especially in light of the statement in the Zohar (Balak, 186b), “all filth and mire goes to the force of evil.” Further, the Zohar in parshat Pekudei (242b) states that there is a component of the sacrifices which is given over to the side of evil, and in Parshat Bo (33a) we learn that the side of evil has control over flesh. In order to counteract all of this, so as not to channel power to the side of evil in the very physical act of offering animal sacrifices, we have the incense offering which removes the contamination in the very physical act of making a good scent."

                "The Rambam makes the following claim in the <i>Guide</i>, “The impossible has a stable nature, one whose stability is constant and not made by a maker; it is impossible to change in any way. Hence the power over the maker of the impossible is not attributed to the Deity.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Maimonides offers several examples of impossibilities that God Himself can not change. In the field of geometric impossibilities, for instance, he mentions the impossibility of a square having a diagonal that is equal to the length of one of its sides, or an triangle that contains three right angles. In the realm of theology, he mentions limitations on God’s power of creation, namely that God cannot create a being equal to Himself, or annihilate Himself, or become a body. There are different opinions among philosophers as to whether God can create an accident which exists alone.</i> Concerning this statement, Rav Abonnot Avraham responded in his letter printed in the responsa of the RaShb”A (418) that in the future it will be clear that this view of the Rambam’s is not consistent with the view of the sages. Indeed, these kinds of statements are misleading for those who seize them in their outer form. Yet for one who looks into their inner meaning will see that the Rambam in his inimitable style has already hinted at this idea a number of times. Remember that he wrote in a letter to his student that his complete view is found in several different places, and the reader cannot understand his view from reading just one place. The careful student of the Rambam who remembers where he previously hinted at this idea and joins it to the above statement will see that there is nothing corrupt or faulty in his view. The introduction to the Guide also mentions that his view is only understood from a complete reading. When the Rambam says, “the impossible has a stable nature, one whose stability is constant,” he also hints in these words that there are other places where one has to dig for its meaning, as he found it necessary there not to reveal it outright. In chapter 27 of the second section he writes that the entire order of nature was created. In chapter 28 he writes that it is God’s will that nature should not change, save for the occurrence of miracles. In chapter 29 he explains that our sages viewed miracles as something built into nature at the time of creation, and waiting to occur at the proper time. In this way, a miracle is not really a change in nature. Then in chapter 20 of the third section the Rambam really shows his hand on the whole matter. There he says that all that was written in the above mentioned chapters is only true according to human knowledge, or from the perspective of created beings. However, the Creator’s knowledge cannot be compared whatsoever to man’s knowledge. There he writes that “God’s knowledge is His essence, and His essence is His knowledge … for the selfsame incapacity that prevents our intellects from apprehending His essence also prevents us from apprehending His knowledge of things as they are. For this knowledge is not of the same species as ours so that we can draw an analogy with regard to it, but rather a totally different thing.” It follows from this that all he had written with regarding to how the Deity had no power over the impossible is true only according within the limitations of human knowledge. God, however, from His perspective, is not obliged by the human intellects definitions of the possible and the impossible. This is further explained in the Beit Yaakov itself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Beit Yaakov (HaKollel), Parshat Vayeira, section 57.</i>"

                "In the Mishnah Torah, in the second chapter of <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i>, the Rambam writes that there are ten different names of angels, corresponding to ten different levels of angels. His words are well suited to the view of the Zohar on this matter, (Bo, 43a), with the exception that he replaces <i>Elim</i> with <i>Keruvim</i>. A study of the Zohar in Parshat Pinchas (235a-b) will show that it is really the same thing. And in the Zohar Hadash (Bereshit, 6b), the enumeration of the order of angels is precisely as is found in the Rambam, mentioning <i>Keruvim</i> in the place of <i>Elim</i>. That which he wrote concerning the tenth and lowest level of angels called <i>Ishim</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ish</i>, in Hebrew, means man.</i> who speak to the prophets for their stature is close to the status of man’s consciousness, is also the view of the Zohar (Lekh, 81a): (The Zohar is discussing how the new soul is drawn into the desire at the time of intercourse.) Through the desire, and together with the soul (<i>nefesh</i>) that is drawn there, another force is also drawn below. This force comes from the level of angels called <i>Eeshim</i>, and all enters from the drawing of the seed. The body of the newborn is built from them. This is the first and most primal level of soul, called <i>nefesh</i>. The Zohar Hadash (Bereshit, Midrash haNe’elam, 6b) enumerates the ten classes of angels from below to above. Here the Zohar Hadash also says that the lowest of the ten level is Eeshim. Rav Tordos haLevi, the author of the Otsar haKavod, argues against the Rambam on his treatment of the angels. However, he admits that the Rambam had true intentions in general, yet wonders how he could have said this.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The author is saying that the Rambam was correct in putting Ishim last, which is the view of the Zohar Khadash, and that the <i>Otsar haKavod</i> did not know this.</i> Also we find many other places in the Rambam that hint both in particular and in general that he possessed a true tradition of the mysteries of the Torah. In the tenth chapter of section two of the Guide, the Rambam makes reference to the special usage of the words brass (<i>nehoshet</i>) with regard to the angels; in Zecharia (6:1), “and the four chariots came out from between the two mountains, which mountains were mountains of brass.” And in Yehezkel (1:7), “burnished brass (<i>nehoshet kalal</i>).” There is no explanation of these phrases in <i>pshat</i> (the plain meaning). Here the Rambam is making an explicit reference to the treatment of this phrase in the Zohar (Teruma, 139a), “In the book of Shlomo HaMelech there are lofty secrets surrounding the brass altar. With the altar, we find it said, ‘make me an altar of earth.’ This secret is well and good. Yet brass is mentioned when other mountains rule, and she (malkhut) must nourish them. This is when she colors herself in the color of brass in order to sustain them, and she is called the mountains of brass.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">125</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the <i>Hadrat Melech</i> of R.

                "The language of the Arizal as it appears in writing was only truly understood by his own students, as most of his teachings are delivered in short. Truly, the Arizal only spent a short time on this planet teaching his students. He only taught in public when he lived in Tsfat, and he was in Tsfat for a total of one year and seven months. Notwithstanding, he managed to deliver the basic ideas of all of the mysteries to his student Rabbi Hayyim Vital, as described in the story of the Arizal in <i>Shivhei HaAri</i>. Due to the brevity of their time together, the RaHu received the teachings in a telescoped form. There are two reasons for this. The first is that in order for the Arizal to describe any one idea to its full extent in a way that could be understood by all it would have taken much more time than they had together. And the second is that the generation had not yet come where anyone could open the writings of the Arizal and understand them. Rabbi Hayyim Vital records that the Arizal had told him that only in the generations immediately preceding the final redemption would his teachings be truly revealed and accessible to the masses. Therefore, all who are truly involved in the holy study of the teachings of the Arizal with a whole and willing heart, wanting to build a structure on the foundation of his words, will indeed find it very difficult. This is because each one concept is expressed by several names, and one who sees the names without understanding the inner foundation of the idea will come up against many contradictions. All the more so if the student wishes to create novel concepts based on the Arizal’s foundations, and the novel interpretations are put up to the scrutiny of in-depth analysis, he will then find himself tangled in contradictions. Then if the student wishes to take his new understandings as a basis for teaching his fellow who possess intelligence in this area, his fellow will no doubt point out numerous contradictions and inconsistencies in the former. This all stems from a greatly limited understanding of the Arizal’s holy words. For example, if one is studying the idea of the sanctity of the Shabbat, and based on this wishes to discourse on the idea delights of Shabbat, he will invariably find terms appropriate to his subject like love and benevolence (Hesed). Then when he figure the actual commandments of Shabbat, including all of the prohibitions of different kinds of work which are in effect on Shabbat, he will find that they are all related to attributes like fear, dread, and strength. If he truly prepares his heart, he will find all of the attributes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">133</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word he uses is <i>midot </i>(מדות), meaning the seven lower divine emanations or attributes: Benevolence, strength, Beauty, etc.</i> included in the mitzvot of the day of Shabbat.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">134</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And thus come against real contradictions.</i> In this way he will not find any clear path in which to deliver his discourse or make his point. The Zohar (Vayakhel, 204a) writes that all of the attributes are included in Shabbat. The teachings of the Arizal have been explained in many different countries, each one in own language and according to its own logic. In Italy the teachings of the Arizal have been reprocessed into the language of philosophy, as was done by Rav Avraham Herrera in his books <i>Beit Avraham </i>and <i>Shaar HaShamayim</i>. These have even been translated into Italian. Rav Ya’akov Abuhav translated them back into Hebrew. In Germany the explanation of the Arizal’s Kabbalah have taken a different direction. There the scholars introduced additional terminology, gates, and discourses based on those gates. In Yemen and the land of Israel the scholars have kept to the language of the Arizal. Due to the approach in Germany, many angry accusations have been exchanged between scholars, each one accusing the other of heresy. The funny thing is, none of them have even made it to the entrance to the garden. It must be know that none of these attempts have been successful."

He sought out the knowledge of God’s perfect Torah, and prepared his heart to explicate and discourse on the hidden realms of wisdom. In his days, he managed to bring the sublime secrets of wisdom down into the boundaries of human understanding. He succeeded in making the Torah accessible to the masses of Israel. For the Torah was not given to God’s holy angels, but to the seed of Yaakov whom God had chosen,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">137</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is referring to the famous story in the Talmud that relates and angel’s complaint, when God gave the Torah to Israel. In defence of God’s decision, Moshe asked the angels, “What is written in the Torah? ‘I am the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt.’ Did you go down to Egypt? Were you enslaved to Pharaoh? Do you worship idols, kill or steal? Why then should the Torah be yours?” From here, concludes the Midrash, we see that the Torah is meant for man, not for angels. In R. Gershon Henokh use of the image, he means to say that even the highest realms of Torah – the secrets of Kabbalah – is meant for the masses, and not merely elite scholars.</i> and it is essential for every soul of Israel to reach everything that is written in the Torah and bring it within the boundaries of his mind’s grasp and knowledge. And even for our generation, a generation of lowly status and little knowledge, did God send him with the perfect language necessary to teach, understand, and come close to even the most sublime of the Torah’s mysteries.

All of his teachings were passed on to us in the writings of his students and student’s students in the generations after his death. Why didn’t the students of the Baal Shem Tov write down his teachings in his lifetime? All of his students were holy geniuses, and when each one would hear his Rebbe’s words, he would expand upon it from his own knowledge. In this way each one operated, according to the qualities of his own soul and spirit. Due to each student’s great sanctity and driven persistence in his Torah study and Divine service, they could not find the time to properly commit the Baal Shem Tov’s teachings to writing.

                "<i> </i>The students of the Great Maggid spread out to many different locations and were known as seekers of the knowledge of God. They were all masters of the mysteries, and all holy. Each one taught a path in the service of God according to his own particular qualities, using this path as the central method in his students. Among the Baal Shem Tov’s students, there were those who taught a way of Divine service based on great fervor in the fulfillment of the Torah, together with the nullification of worldly existence and the unification with the <i>mysterium tremendum</i> during prayer. There where others who emphasized the centrality of the love and unification of all of Israel, in order to draw Divine effluence and blessings down to the Jewish people. Their great love gave them strength in order to unite the hearts of Israel, inspiring them with words that drew their students to follow in the path of God. There were still others who taught a mystical form of exegesis, with discourses full of hints, numerical equivalents, acronyms, revealing holy names in the words of the Torah. There were even those who taught the Torah in an enigmatic language, even though they were disciples of masters whose entire aim was to explain and elucidate the Torah, bringing it within the borders of man’s intellect. Those who saw fit to hide their language did so due to the root of their souls and their particular locations, in seeing so many students and wary of the real possibility of misunderstanding, took care not to explain their teachings in a revealed language. Even though they spent much time in this holy and protective manner, there was a great lack of understanding on the part of their listeners. Such is the case when the mystery is wrapped in the enigma and expressed in a hidden language. Due to this, their opponents would incorrectly interpret their words. These students of the Baal Shem Tov were using all of their powers to instill the faith in the hearts of Israel to know that God fills the whole world with His glory, using the perfect words of Torah such as those found in the Zohar, which shows us how God fills all the worlds and surrounds all the worlds.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">149</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Zohar, Parshat Pinchas, 225a.</i> So their opponents found a dark and narrow place in which to explain his words as the same as one of the foreign concepts in the belief in God’s providence that the Rambam quotes in the <i>Guide</i> (Section 1, Ch. 73) as, “the view of some of the Mutazilites.” They believed that existence and the absence of existence are accidents newly created at every moment. However, anyone seriously studying this matter in the <i>Guide</i> would see how at the end of the sixth argument of that same chapter the Rambam refutes their view, a belief that would do away with any need for Divine service or prayer. So of course neither the Rambam nor the disciple of the Maggid under discussion ever intended to claim that this foreign view is in agreement with the view of the Torah. This is not the direction any Torah leader such as the Rambam would take. Just as the Rambam, the disciple of the Maggid confronted these foreign ideas as a result of being exiled in a place of evil waters,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">150</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Zohar compares the study of secular philosophy to drinking “bitter and cursing waters,” as described in the section of the Torah that deals with the suspected adulteress.

Gershon Henokh alludes here to a major theological debate between the Hasidim and their opponents. To the Hasidim, God’s present not only “surrounds” the worlds (that is, creates it and directs it from above), but actually “fills” the worlds; meaning, the entire world is filled with Divinity, one only needs to remove the veils that conceal it. To the opponents of Hasidism, since God is exalted <i>above </i>creation (as it were), one can only serve Him by transcending the mundane, and choosing those paths and practices given specifically by God to man to this end – the Torah and mitzvot. However, to the Hasidim, God’s presence was immanent in creation; thus, He could be served <i>even</i> through mundane acts, such as eating, drinking, singing, and dancing.</i> But in making such a misguided comment he is in fact voicing the view of the idolaters mentioned in the Talmud Menahot, 110a), “They call God, ‘god of the gods.’ “ This view is contrary to the view of the Torah, for our Torah says, “know that I am God who makes you holy.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">153</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shemot 31:13.</i> “ Yet do not cast aspersions on these opponents. Their attacks are just a result of an inferior understanding of the fundamentals of these matters. They merely dressed their language in ill-fitting garments, totally unsuited for the one wearing them.

Though he was a weak physically, often ill, suffering from bronchitis, he never took care of his physical well-being.

To do this, he immersed himself with all the books of Kabbalah in his local house of study, until he was thoroughly versed in their teachings. He was imbibed with God’s Torah, full with the Bible, Mishnah, Gemara, Halacha, Midrash, and the holy Zohar. He knew the entire Mishnah by heart. When he first met Rabbi Simha Bunem, he said to Rabbi Mordechai Yosef jokingly, “come let us stand back to back and see who is taller.”. Then Rabbi Simha Bunem laid his hands upon him and said, “at present, I am bigger than you. Yet you are still young, and with the yoke of years, you will grow.” And of course, he was not talking about physical size. It is known that Rabbi Simha Bunem was a great strapping man, both in size and in Torah knowledge, and Rabbi Mordechai Yosef, though great in Torah, was of a small, slight physique. I heard this story from his holy mouth. My grandfather also told how Rabbi Simha Bunem compared him to the Mei HaShiloach, the spring of Shiloah which flows from under the Temple Mount in Jerusalem down into the City of David. “Flowing slowly,” (Yeshayahu, 8:6) yet reaching down to the greatest depths.

He removed their confusion and clarified their uncertainties which required explanation. His teachings were like finely sifted flour, explaining the words of our sages which were dressed in garments that concealed their light. He taught all the fundamentals in the thought of the sages, in the mountains of sanctity, spreading the knowledge of Torah to the many, until they were capable of understanding the teachings of the Rash”bi and the Ariza”l as one understands simple laws. Notwithstanding, his teachings were never written down in his lifetime, and had we attempted this in his lifetime, there would not have been enough ink and paper to contain all his teachings. And still, his teachings were instilled so deeply in the hearts of his students so much that the little that could be collected after his passing was contained in the book, the Mei HaShiloach. It includes <i>ta’amei haMitzvot</i>, biblical exegesis, explanations of the Talmud, both of the revealed and secret aspects, explanations of the festivals, and the path of ethical Torah behavior signified by love and fear of the Creator. And yet, since it is written in a highly concise manner, presenting the main ideas without references and lengthy explanations, the book manages to present most of his teachings. These are a distillation of the actual discourses that he delivered. His actual discourses brought the knowledge from the Source of Life in its original pristine form. That is to say, he gave functional explanations of all of his ideas. However, when I collected these teachings, my hair still dripped with the dew of youth, and I only felt confident to write down the teachings exactly as they were transmitted from those who had heard them. A minority of the teachings are those which I had actually heard from the Rebbe, and those are adequately explained. However, the majority of the teachings in the Mei HaShilaoch were transmitted from several of his students who had not completed their studies, and remembered only the outline of the teachings. Therefore they are not written in a complete way, and many passages are not clear to one who was not accustomed to his way of speaking. I have in my possession many manuscripts of teachings transmitted by the Rebbe, and will publish them, God willing, along with a more detailed explanation of the more obscure passages in the Mei HaShilaoch. From there you will see and understand the depth of his holy words, matters that are clear and lofty. May God allow me to publish them in the merit of my holy forefathers.

                "I heard directly from the <i>Admor</i> (the Isbitzer Rebbe), that he noticed scholars of his own generation who had believed that they had devised an original Torah innovation, and were later disappointed to find that it had already been written down somewhere in the tradition. I myself will not let a word of Torah pass my lips until I have seen its source in writing. The Zohar states (Vayeitse, 163a): Rabbi Elazar opened and said (Mishlei 9:12), “If you are wise, you are wise for yourself, and if you have scorned, you alone shall bear your sin.” “If you are wise, you are wise for yourself,” woe is to the wicked of the world, who do not know and do not see the words of the Torah! And when they look into it, since they have no sense, it seems to them as if the words of Torah are empty and of no use. This is all because such people are devoid of consciousness and understanding … every word written in the Torah is mare precious than pearls, there is nothing in the world equal in value to a single word of the Torah! And when the closed-hearted fools see the words of the Torah, it is not enough that they do not know, but they say that the words are blemished and useless. Woe to them, when the time comes for the Holy One, blessed be He, to render judgment for the disgrace of the Torah, and meets out punishment for those who rebelled against their Master. We find that the Torah says, “it is not an empty thing for you,” and if it is empty, the emptiness comes from you. For the Torah is filled with all manner of precious gems and pearls … and how could one say that it is empty? King Shlomo said, “If you are wise, then you are wise for yourself,” because if one has been clever in the Torah, the fact remains that it is still impossible to add so much as one letter to the Torah. “And if you have scorned, you shall bear your sin,” because the honor and praise of the Torah has not been reduced whatsoever, the scorn is only upon the scoffer, and remains with him to cause him to disinherit this world and the next. It is clear from the Zohar that the two matters are one. One who boasts to himself and claims that he can add words of Torah that he did not receive as a tradition, is equated as one who derides the Torah, for he does not take the Torah seriously. [This does not include one who gives an insightful explanation into the words of the sages, if he received it from his Rav then it is accepted as being authentic. We assume that his Rav received an authentic tradition and trusted source. This is as we find in the Zohar (Vayeishev, 192a), “One who looks into that which he learned from his Rav, and looks at it <i>with this wisdom</i>, can then further add to it in the same spirit.” The point being, only when he looks into the words of his Rav. Similarly, the Zohar says of Eliyahu and Elisha (Vayeitse, 154a), “from here we learn that through the revealed, man arrives at the hidden.” This means, that if he understands the revealed matters deeply he will then see the hidden knowledge concealed within. And still it is improper to invent teachings that lack a trusted source and strong foundation.]",
                "The Zohar makes several mentions of statements that lack a foundation or accepted tradition from one’s Rav. (Yithro, 87a): Rabbi Yitzchak opened (Kohelet, 5:5), “Do not let your mouth cause your flesh to sin.” How greatly does man need to be careful not to err in the words of Torah, and not to derive explanations of the Torah that he did not receive from his Rav. He who says a word of Torah that he did not know or receive from his Rav, of him it is written, “Do not make an idol or any image.” The Holy One, blessed be He, will exact punishment from him in the world-to-come. At the time when his soul wants to ascend to its place, it will be pushed outside, and will be destroyed from the binds of eternal life of all other souls. The Zohar then compares illegitimate innovations to fathering a bastard. As it is taught (in the continuation of Kohelet 5:5), “Why should God be angry at your voice.” “Voice,” is man’s soul. Rabbi Chiyya said, therefore it is written, “Hashem your God is a jealous God.” For what reason? It is because He is jealous for His name’s sake in everything. If it is because of the form of the face, (of the bastard) He is jealous for His name, since it is lying in His name. And the same is true for the Torah, (when one teaches that which he does not know and did not receive from his Rav.)”",
                "This hints at what is written in the Midrash Rabbah (Nasso, 9), “Rabbi Abbahu told a parable about a painter who was painting the image of a king.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">159</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When he was at the point of finishing the painting, they told him that the king had died, and another king was ruling in his place. When the painter heard this, he became despondent and said, “What shall I do with these drawings? Should I finish the painting in the form of the first king or of the second? In this way he was he uncertain. Thus it is when a man has marital relations with his wife, the Holy One, blessed be He, fashions the embryo in the visage of his father. But when the adulterer comes upon her, all the fluids are mixed. This is as it is written (Hosea 4:2), ‘There is swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break all bounds, and blood leads to blood.’ What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He went back, so to speak, and changed the form of the embryo from the father to the adulterer. This was to fulfill what is written (Iyov 24:15), “(the adulterer) hides his face.” (That is, God “hides” the face of the adulterer in the embryo.) This is as we have said (Devarim 32:18), ‘you were unmindful of the Rock that bore you, and you forgot God who gave birth to you.’ “ </i> The passage of the Zohar that we are dealing with finishes: If it is because of the Torah (that is, he is giving inauthentic interpretations to the Torah), it is taught that the entire Torah is a name of the Holy One, blessed be He. There is not a word in the Torah that is not included in the Holy Name. For this reason it is imperative to exercise extreme caution so as to not err with regards to the Holy Name … Rabbi Abba said, it is written, “do not make a carved image (<i>pesel</i> - idol).” In another place it is written, “<i>p’sol</i> - carve for yourself two tablets of stone.” “Do not make a carved image” means do not transmit another Torah that you did not know, and that your Rav did not tell you. What is the reason? “I am Hashem your God, a jealous God,” I am the One who will exact punishment from you in the world-to-come, at the time when the soul desires to go up before Me, there are some souls that are destined to deceive, and be cast into hell.”",

                "<b>The Principles of Interpretation</b><br><small>Returning to the theme of authentic Torah transmission, the author now rejects those who proffer false and misguided interpretations of the Torah, both individuals of his time and of previous generations. Whereas humankind has been given a free hand to interpret the Torah, there remain limitations as to how far this freedom can go. The author rails against those deny the truth of the statements of the sages, or who draw conclusions that would lead to the abrogation of halachah. Most likely, his attack was directed against the maskilim and Jewish reformers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, who sought to remodel Judaism into something other than the traditional path of the Written and Oral traditions, and who were particular opposed to the more fantastical elements of Rabbinic lore and Kabbalistic tradition. On another level, however, the author may be defending his own interpretive line, as well. The teachings of his grandfather, R. Mordekhai Yosef, were very controversial in their time, particularly his claim that “all is in the hands of heaven, including the fear of heaven”; meaning, that Divine providence rules over every aspect of human life – including sin and transgression. Such an antinomian approach could easily be misused to justify sinning as a fulfillment of God’s will. R. Gershon Henokh may well be saying that despite the radical nature of Izhbitzer thought, it never actively preaches the abrogation of halachah or Jewish tradition.</small>",
                "In the middle ages there were scholars whose far-fetched interpretations were tantamount to building altars to their own intellects. They reversed to intention of the writings, giving false interpretations of words and combining verses in ways not following their meanings. It became easy for such scholars to build their ideas into structures according to the winds of their fantasies. So too did they find it easy to coin terms and values based on loose associations and similarities. Of this it said in the [Talmud] Yerushalmi (Ma’asrot, ch. 3 Mishnah 4) that Rabbi Zeira lambasted those who incorrectly explained the <i>aggadot</i> (legends of the Talmud), calling them tellers of fairy tales. Concerning these medieval scholars, it reached such an extent that they were making the sacred profane and the profane sacred, turning the pure into impure and the reverse. Even concerning holy names, they mixed up the sacred and the profane, and did not even refrain from offering interpretations contrary to the <i>halacha</i>. It is true that the Torah is given to interpretation, and even for one who is not intending to reach the depth of the Torah’s mysteries. Yet with one ventures into the hints and hermeneutic interpretations, it is crucial that he not miss the target whether in secrets or in <i>halacha</i>. And if he does not err, all is given to interpretation and the innovator is worthy of reward. This is as it is said in the Yerushalmi (end of Berachot), “all talk is idle, and the words of Torah are good.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">163</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meaning the only meaningful words are the words of Torah.</i> Why? As it is said in the Midrash and the Zohar numerous times, “there are seventy faces to the Torah.” Yet still, each face, each interpretation, must coincide with <i>halacha</i>, and not, God forbid, contradict <i>halacha</i>.",

                "I have seen those with expressions of consternation coming before me, and in their interpretations turn the sacred into profane to such an extent that they explain the names of idols as holy. I refer you to what the Shaar Efraim writes in his responsa (siman 64-65) concerning those who interpret the sacred as profane, and all the more so those who interpret the profane as sacred, that it is tantamount to brining idols into the Holy Temple God forbid. We even find in the Talmud (Chaggigah, 14a) that in response to his interpretation, Rabbi Yossi haGalili says to Rabbi Akiva, “Akiva! For how long will you make the Shekhina profane!” It is written in the Zohar (Pinchas, 234b), “Since there are <i>elohim acherim</i> (false gods) on this it is said (Shemot, 22:19), ‘he who offers sacrifices to any god, save Hashem alone, will be utterly destroyed.’ This is in order not to mix up <i>Elohim Chayiim</i> (The living God) with <i>elohim acherim</i> (false gods).” It is said in the Talmud (Sanhedrin, 38b), “(Shemot, 24:21) <i>al tamer bo</i> (do not provoke Him), and read this as, ‘<i>al tamireini bo</i> (do not exchange Me for him.).” On this it is written in the Sefer Chasisdim (siman 936), “Do not change the Name into something mundane, for we are taught that you may not make an exact scale replica of the any part of the Hoy Temple.” The legal authorities discuss the law if a ritual scribe errs, and while writing, inadvertently sanctifies a mundane name. They equate this with dedicating a blemished animal to the altar. In the Midrash Tanchuma (Terumah, 3), we find Turnusrufus asking Rabbi Akiva why he called his dogs in the name of Turnusrufus and his wife. Rabbi Akiva answered, “What is the difference between you and my dogs? You take sticks and stones and call them by the name of the Holy One, blessed be He.” This blunder is a result of not adequately receiving the knowledge of our Rabbis, and to such an extent that they have built altars to themselves and their forms, for they assume that their own ideas represent the teachings of the Torah.",
                "The Rishonim (the Torah sages from the 10th to the 15th century) were adept at interpreting the Torah. However, when more recent interpreters confronted the words of the early and later sages of the Gemara, their fondness for their own intellects led them far afield in their understanding, and they departed from the proper explanation of the Torah. It was an, “every man for himself” kind of interpretation. Then it became easy for them to say whatever suited their minds when they simply did not understand the words of the sages. They said things that the sages would never have said, and interpreted in ways that are, God forbid, not arriving at the truth of their words. See how we are sitting in the dust before His pride and calling His Great Name, He upon whom all honor depends! A sycophant cannot come before God, and does not even take interest in the words of the Tanaim and Amoraim. All of his admirers agree to his words and proclaim his holiness, and feel they are justified in their agreement. For a sycophant cannot come before Him, and will not even take note of awesome wisdom of the early sages, not even realizing that the sages were speaking against him. Do we not find the halacha instructing us that even concerning one’s Rabbi, even if he is not greater than him but whom he simply learned from, that when he sees the Rabbi transgressing a rabbinical commandment it is forbidden for him to say that the action is forbidden, but should rather say, “I learned it this way, Rabeynu.” This is as is codified in the Tur (Yorah Deah, 246), where if his Rabbi made a clear mistake, even concerning a verse, you should simply say, “this is the way the verse goes in the Torah.” So too have we found it said several times in the Gemara, (rather than contradicting him), “read to him this verse,” since he does not want to correct him overtly. How much more so when later generations are confronting earlier generations. We find a great difference between each generation – the Acharonim are far from the Rishonim, as are the Rishonim from the Amoraim and the Amoraim from the Tanaim. But all together they build the corpus of the Talmud. Concerning this difference it is written (Yoma, 9b), “a fingernail of the early sages is worth more than the belly of the later sages.” So too is it said (Shabbat, 112b), “If the early generation of sages are sons of angels, then we are sons of men. And if you say that he early sages are men, then we are as donkeys, but still inferior to the donkey of Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair! (who, though he was a donkey, was careful to refrain from eating untithed fodder.)” And how much more so in our own generation, what is our life, what is our power? We are as ivy on the walls. We are like a mosquito before Seraphim! It is only in the light of the Rishonim that we see light! And in a place where we do not understand their words it is incumbent upon us to know that the deficiency lies within us and the great limitations of our minds. The deficiency and guilt is upon us.",
                "",
                "The <i>Reshit Chochma </i>dwelt on this point at length (<i>shaar hakedusha</i>, ch. 12). These are his holy words. “Just as we are required to believe in the whole Torah of Moshe, so are we required to believe in the words of the later halachic authorities (<i>divrei sofrim</i>), and in what they explained concerning the legends of the Torah (<i>agadot</i>). And even if one thinks that it is impossible, we are to ascribe the deficiency on our own understanding and not on their words. Anyone who derides any of their words shall be punished. This is as is written in the Gemara (Eruvin, 21b), ‘Rav Papa said in the name of Raba bar Ula, whosoever derides the words of the sages shall be sentenced to a hell of boiling dung.’ So too do we find in told in Gittin (57a) that a student of Rabbi Yochanan was punished for scoffing at Rabbi Yochanan for saying that in the future the Holy One, blessed be He, will bring precious gems thirty by thirty cubits in size.” In mentioning this Gemara, the <i>Be’r haGolah</i> (be’r 6, Rosh HaShanna, ch. 15) said, “how many piles of bones were made of this scoffer, in punishment for all that he did not believe.” When a man finds the words of the sages strange, he may then go on to assert that they are inventions. If a student were to ascend from level to level until God showed him the supernal angels, he would certainly believe in the words of the sages and their explanations. Yet he did not even believe in the simple meaning of their homilies. He rather turned them around in his mind to fit a certain intention, so Rabbi Yochanan gazed upon him and reduced him to a pile of bones. It would be well to see the Mahar”shal’s explanation of this story, who said that this man who did not believe was a heretic until he saw the angels. And so, a man must believe that even the simple explanations of the words of the sages are true. This is as the Ramban wrote in his <i>Sefer Emuna V’Bitachon</i> (ch. 9), “When the sages said that any given verse does not depart from the simple meaning, this does not mean that it can only be interpreted according to its simple meaning. We have leaned that though there are seventy “faces” to the Torah, not one of them may contradict the simple meaning.” This is just as the Ramban explained in his <i>Hasagot</i> on the <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, that all that is written in the Torah, its explanations and the explications of its explanations which flow from a faithful source, are all expressing the truth of the Torah at all levels of truth. And our entire hold on the tradition of the Torah requires that we grasp the hem of the mantle of the Rishonim. For if we know and recognize that the Rishonim were like angels, then we are like men. And if we are to contend that the Rishonim were merely men like us, and therefore we can give our own critique and opinion of the validity of their teachings, then we are like donkeys, but not as the donkey of Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair.",
                "",
                "Consider the way our Torah predecessors gave great honor to the unique among them, even though they were all holy individuals. We find a certain <i>agadata</i> in the Talmud (see Megilla, 15b) is interpreted in nine different ways, and Eliyahu haNavi agrees that all of them are true. “Raban Shimon ben Gamliel said, ‘still, we need the Moda’ii.’ “ Though the interpretation of Elazar HaModa’ii was different from the rest, he still found it essential to honor him and include his words. This being so, how could anyone in our generation have the audacity to do away with the opinion of Rabbi Elazar haModa’ii? I will give the order to punish those guilty of this rebellion and trespass. They do not know the great implications of their sin. Suffice that the heavens shall reveal it, and the earth below will rise up against them. It is a grave offence. He is like one who waits to ambush others, but in the end he will afflict his soul with pennitentiary fasting until his teeth turn black. We find this in the Gemara (Chagiga, 22b), where Rabbi Yehoshua once claimed that he was ashamed that a certain opinion of Beit Shammai concerning the laws of purity had ever been stated, claiming that it did not make sense. After Beit Shammai’s opinion was properly explained, Rabbi Yehoshua threw himself on the graves of Beit Shammai to beg forgiveness, and it was said that in the coming years his teeth turned black from penitential fasts he endured for this incident. In another passage concerning the laws of purity Rabbi Akiva taught that coming into contact with two halves of a revi’it of blood from two separate dead bodies imparts ritual impurity. The Sages disagreed with this opinion, claiming that only a complete revi’it of blood from one body departs impurity. Rebbi taught in the name of Bar Kapara, “do not count the ruling about the revi’it of blood among the rulings that Rabbi Akiva retracted.” Rabbi Shimon then jeered at this by saying, “as long as he was alive he ruled that it makes one impure, but whether or not he retracted it after he died, I am not sure.” The Gemara says that eventually Rabbi Shimon’s teeth turned black from fasting, and that he would fill his eyes with clods of earth from the floor of Rabbi Akiva’s house of study. [However, when the Gemara says (Chullin 24a), “even if Yehoshua bin Nun had said it, I would not have accepted it,” – it is a case where the law had been accepted a certain way, and no opposition can change it. This is how the law is established in the Shulchan Aruch (Yore Deah, 242:36), “One who says of his fellow, I would not accept the law from him even if he was like Yehoshua bin Nun, is worthy of niddui (excommunication, shunning). This is not so when he says this of an opinion contrary to a law that is universally accepted.” (The Rambam explains this his introduction to seder Zeraim, part 2.)] The disregard for the words of any of the sages is a result of a limited understanding and an insufficient tenure in the house of study. This is as the Zohar say (Balak, 193b), “When one praises himself, it is a sign that he does not know anything.” Such misguided people err in the very method of the sages of the Gemara. They are mistaken in that they believe that each sage would explain as he saw fit and however his spirit moved him. They do not know that our holy predecessors did not say anything from their own minds, but only taught that which they had received in the tradition from a faithful source. Who would have the audacity to offer his own opinion in a place where he does not understand their words? “For I am more boorish than a man, and I do not have the understanding of a man. I have not learned wisdom,” and I do <i>not</i> have the understanding of the holy. (Mishlei 30:2) Furthermore, the words of Rabbi Elazar HaModa’ii are also found in <i>Targum Yonatan</i> (one of the Aramaic translations of the Torah), and the <i>Targum</i> claims that when one thinks he is doing a great service to explain difficult passages with contrived solutions not based on tradition he is only making them more incomprehensible.

                "Rabbi Mordechai Yosef was a central figure among the followers of Rabbi Simcha Bunem of Pshiske. He was a dedicated servant, and did not depart from the tent of Torah.

Then, in the year 5600, the word of God came to him,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">165</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Tehillim 105:19, where Yosef was in prison until the word of God came and refined him, calling him to his mission as a leader. </i> and he was Divinely inspired. This was the time hinted at in the teachings of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai in the Zohar (Vayeira 116b), “when the the sixth millennium arrives, which is the secret of the letter Vav (ו) (six).” The Zohar continues (117a), “In the six hundredth year of the sixth millennium, the gates of wisdom will be opened above, and the wellsprings of wisdom below … then the rainbow will be seen in its brilliant colors.” And further in the Zohar (118a), “Rabbi Shimon said to them, God does not desire to greatly reveal himself in this world. Yet when the days of the Mashiach come close, even little children will reveal the secrets of Torah wisdom.” This means that man will finally attain a clear apprehension of the Torah’s wisdom, through the understanding that all matters of Torah are necessary for each individual of Israel in order to serve God. It is said in the Gemara (Chagiga, 14b), “even concerning <i>Ma’aseh Merkava</i>, the mysteries of the Torah, there are those who are adept at explaining, and those who are adept at performing.” That is to say, man will understand that in order to serve God through the words of Torah, the foundation of his soul needs the most precious and sublime Torah knowledge. This being so, God will send His salvation from the heavens, His steadfast love and truth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">166</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Tehillim, 57:4</i> When we see the fulfillment of Rabbi Shimon’s prophetic vision that the, “wellsprings of wisdom will be opened below,” do not be wary of the many warnings in the Zohar against revealing secrets to those who are not worthy of their power, for then the times themselves will demand such a revelation. Rabbi Elazar ben Arach hinted at this in the Midrash Ne’elam (Zohar, Toldot, 140a), “Who will be worthy of this time? Who will remain and uphold the law during this time?” Rabbi Elazar ben Arach understood the redemption would start in the year 6000. Yet based on his understanding of Bereshit ch. 23 (the children of Cheit) he ascertained that the resurrection of the dead would not be complete until the year 6408. Rebbi Yehoshua resolved this contradiction saying that the perfectly righteous would be resurrected in the beginning of the ingathering of the exiles, at the fortieth year of the sixth millennium. However, the less perfect, depending on their level, would be resurrected in the ensuing years up to 6408. Rebbi Elazar ben Arach was troubled that many may slip into degradation in those years, and forsake the Torah. "

This is clear from the books that were written in those days, as they made great efforts to confront and rebuke ideas foreign to the Torah. This is as it is said (Hoseha, 14:10), “the righteous will walk in them, and the sinners shall stumble in them.” Therefore the sages of Kabbalah found it necessary to include in their mystical teachings proofs and philosophical foundations so those learning their words would do so in the way of faith.

He explained them all in a clear fashion, to the extent where while under his guidance, all these areas of Torah were open books to all who entered their gates. The incisiveness of his intellect in the area of <i>Halacha</i> was an awesome wonder to behold. With every law, he revealed its inner depths, and its clear connection to the source in the Talmud. I saw how whenever a student came to him who did not understand the nature or source of a law, R. Yaakov did not hesitate for a split second, but revealed its exact meaning and its source in the Talmud Bavli, Yerushalmi, Sifri, or Sifra on the spot. I never again witnessed a mind with such a tremendous hold on the meaning of the law and its way of learning. So many matters that he explained are recorded, yet not one of his numerous Torah innovations, and there are so many Torah matters included in his innovations. He was an ever flowing spring of Torah, each day increasing more wisdom and knowledge, both in the revealed and hidden studies. All who saw him witnessed this. He provided numerous clear expositions of the mysteries of the Torah, as to clarify the deepest depths and open the most closed of secrets. His teaching were a veritable highway for all who wanted ride on the way of truth in the hidden mysteries. Among them are many annotations on the obscure passages of the Zohar and the writings of the Ariza”l, all explained with wondrous understanding and wisdom, as all who look into this book will clearly see.",

The very little that was written down properly was that which he instructed me to write. In the first years he did not want to disturb my study of <i>Halacha</i> by asking me to transcribe his teachings. He once told me, “if I were to explain to you the true inner meaning of any matter in Torah, you would no longer want to learn <i>Halacha</i>. At that point in your studies, if I reveal the mysteries of the Torah, you will then be prematurely illuminated, only wanting to dwell in the realm of the mysteries and no longer study the revealed Torah. This is because you will see that the simple meaning of the Torah’s teachings are just a garment, and the inner essence is the <i>neshama </i>(soul). First occupy yourself with Halacha, and eventually you will understand that within the revealed Halacha are all of the inner mysteries. Then you will take joy in learning both aspects of the Torah.” At the end of his life I transcribed his commentary on the Eyts CHayyim of the Arizal.

This is the messianic process, which strives for the day when “the earth will be filled with the knowledge of God as waters cover the sea” (Isaiah 11:9). It was the goal of the Baal Shem Tov and all his followers, who sought to invest quotidian existence with an awareness of God, and it was realized, above all, in the line of Izhbitzer Hasidism, whose founder and disciples explained the most recondite Kabbalah concepts in a way that was universally understandable and applicable.

                "<b>Preparing the Vessels - Fear and Faith</b> <br> <small> In this first chapter, R. Gershon Henokh discusses the interrelationship of faith, fear of God, and the Torah. Faith, he explains, underlies the fear of God, while the fear of God provides a setting for one’s faith. On the simplest level, this means that the belief in God leads one to fear him, which motivates a person to observe the Torah’s commandments. Seen from a different perspective, fear of God delineates a person’s actions, and helps him express his faith. However, the fear that the author posits here is not mere fear of Divine punishment or retribution, whether in this world or the next, which the Zohar defines as a lower type of fear. Rather, it is a fear born out of an awareness of God’s absolute transcendence. Thus, it would more accurately be called an “awareness” or “awe” of Divinity. The Zohar identifies this as the “higher” fear. This awareness is the first step toward the higher goal of enlightenment. </small>",
                "“The beginning of wisdom is the fear of God.” (<i>Tehillim</i> 111:10) The consciousness called the fear of God is the vessel a person needs to receive the Torah,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">178</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On a simple level, “receiving the Torah,” means “observing the commandments”; on a deeper level, it means perceiving the very root of the Torah, which is a revelation of God.</i> as it is written (<i>Yeshayahu</i> 33:6), “The fear of God is His storehouse,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">179</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, the fear of God holds and stores something; in this case, the Torah.</i> and, as the first part of this verse says, “He shall be the stability (<i>emunah</i>) of your times.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">180</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The entire verse reads: “He shall be the stability of your times, a store of salvation, wisdom and knowledge, the fear of God is His storehouse” (Yeshayahu, 33:6). The Talmud (BT Shabbat 31a) regards each of the attributes as hinting to another order of the Mishnah: “Stability-Faith” - <i>Zera’im</i> (Seeds); “Your times” – <i>Moed</i> (Festival); “Strength” – <i>Nashim</i> (Women); “Salvation” – <i>Nezikin</i> (Damages); “Wisdom” – <i>Kodoshim</i> (Holy Things) and “knowledge” –<i>Tehorot</i> (Purities). The order of <i>Zera’im </i>deals with the laws of planting, harvesting, tithes, etc. It is alluded to by the word “<i>emunah</i>” (meaning both faith and stability) because a person with faith in God will plant. (See, <i>Tosefot, </i>ibid., who cites the Jerusalem Talmud.) There is a deeper relationship between these two uses of the word, as well. In Judaism, in general, faith is not necessarily an abstract feeling or concept, but a level of stability and unwavering commitment, in the sense of “faithfulness.”</i> “Nevertheless,” says the Talmud, “without the fear of God as a storehouse, one has nothing.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">181</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The last statement, “The fear of God is His storehouse,” does not hint at a particular body of knowledge or tract, but rather to the key ingredient needed in order to preserve the knowledge of all the preceding categories. Without the fear of God, or the intense awareness of God’s conduct of the world, joined with an understanding that God both rewards and punishes, the treasures will be lost. In other words, without the fear of God one cannot truly fulfill the Torah. </i> The first consideration is faith,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">182</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse from Yeshayahu begins with a reference to <i>emunah </i>(stability, faith) and ends with a reference to fear of God (the storehouse). This alludes to the author’s statement above, that faith precedes fear, while fear gives context to faith.</i> which is the root of the fear of God, whereas the fear of God is the vessel which holds faith. But what kind of faith are we talking about? It is the kind in which a person believes that God is all-powerful and exalted. On this, the Zohar writes:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">183</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Introduction, 11b.</i>“In the beginning God created…” This is the very first commandment, which is called, “Fear of God.” The fear of God is called, “the beginning,” as it is written, “The beginning of wisdom is the fear of God,” and (<i>Mishlei</i> 1:7), “The fear of God is the beginning of knowledge.” It is the gate one must enter in order to arrive at faith.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">184</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reader may notice a contradiction here. Above, R. Gershon Henokh stated that faith preceeds fear of God; here, the Zohar states that fear of God precedes faith. As will become clear below, there are two types of faith: a deep, inner certainty in God’s existence, which leads to fear andn awe of Him, and a higher type of faith, which actually transcends the limited intellect and the duality of this world, which is the result of this type of fear.</i> In this way, the whole world depends on this commandment. There are three aspects to the fear of God. The first two lack a correct foundation, which the third one has. The first kind is when a person fears God in order that He not bring harm upon his children,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">185</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In retribution for the father’s own sins.</i> or in order not to personally suffer physical retribution or financial loss.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">186</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Such as on account of his transgressions.</i> He fears God constantly for these reasons, yet his fear lacks a foundation. The second kind is when person fears God in order not to suffer punishment in the world-to-come or in Hell.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">187</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Gehinom</i>, more accurately translated as purgatory.</i> These two kinds of fear are not true expressions of the fear of God. The third and true expression is when person fears God solely because He is the Great and Sovereign Ruler of the universe, the root and source of all the worlds, and that everything is considered as nothing before Him, as it is written (Daniel 4:32), “All the inhabitants of the world are considered as naught before Him.” One should place all of his desire on this place which is called “fear.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">188</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Notice how the author, using this passage from the Zohar, has changed the definition of fear. It is no longer centered upon the human being and his concerns, reducing God’s greatness in the process; rather, it opens a person to the absolute transcendence of God and takes him beyond his petty concerns – ultimately into a Divine realm that transcends logic and duality, as we will see below. </i>",
                "",
                "This passage from the Zohar discusses the highest level of the fear of God, which is the third form mentioned above.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">189</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To fear God purely because He is the Great and Sovereign Ruler of the universe, knowing that all is in His hands, etc.</i> But it also says that the fear of God is the beginning and the gateway. For one who does not attain this fundamental level of the fear of God must still make supreme efforts in the development of [lower levels of] fear, until he attains it; for the highest level can only be attained after earnest inner work and striving. The Tikkunei Zohar (5b) also enumerates the levels of the fear of God from below to above. In the Zohar’s discussion of the tenth level, it says:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">190</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The following passage appeared in the first part of the introduction (chap. 1), and was explained at length there.</i> There is fear, and there is [a higher] fear. Not all expressions of fear are equal. One person’s fear of God may largely be motivated by the fear of Divine punishment. Of this it is taught (<i>Pirkei Avot</i> 2:5), “An unlearned person cannot fear sin.” A person ignorant of the Torah does not have the basic information to know what to fear. A higher level is one who fears God based upon his knowledge of the Torah, which is <i>Tiferet</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">191</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The central <i>sefirah</i> on the Kabbalistic “Tree of Life,” corresponding to the Torah and the Tetragrammaton.</i> This kind of fear is equal to the Torah itself. For this reason, not all forms of the fear of God are the same. Thus, fear of the Lord is God’s own sovereignty and contains within it all of the commandments of the Torah, since it actually comes from the Torah itself, which is called the, “Middle Column,” which is the name, <i>Havay’ah</i> (the Tetragramaton, י-ה-ו-ה). Because of this, the authors of the Mishnah taught us, “Great is the Torah in that it brings man to action.” If man does not know the Torah, or the reward and punishment for keeping or transgressing its commandments, or the One who created the Torah and gives it to Israel, how then can he fear God and guard His commandments? For this reason David said to his son Shlomo, “Know the God of your fathers and serve Him.” For if one does not know the One who gave him the Torah and commanded him to guard it, how then can he fear Him and fulfill its commandments?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">192</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here, we see fear as motivating the observance of the commandments (as noted in the preface to Part 2, chapter 1, above). Later, though, R. Gershon Henokh will explain that it is precisely through the practical observance of the commandments that one can access a type of <i>emunah</i> that transcends the limitations of the intellect, and brings one into an incounter with God above the limitations of this world.</i> "

                "<b>Human Deficiency and Human Perfection</b> <br> <small> After discussing the necessity of fear in one’s relationship with God, and the various types of fear – from lower to higher – the author now discusses genuine versus false fear. Whereas genuine fear (awe) frees a person from his limitations and brings him into a direct encounter with God in an act of faith, false fear is born of personal limitations and is the underlying cause of idolatry. According to Rav Mordechai Yosef of Izhbitz, fear is always related to a sense of lack.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">193</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Simply put, one who lacks funds will fear the tax collector; one who lacks self-confidence, will fear public speaking.</i> Psychologically speaking, human beings tend to set as personal goals or absolute truths one particular trait or approach to life.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">194</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For instance, a strong person, who unbendingly believes in the use of force to solve disputes, will fear conflict resolution through peaceful means. A person who sets compassion as an absolute value will fear the use of cruelty – even when correct and necessary. (R. Gershon Henokh will offer this example below.)</i> Yet this attitude invariably causes an individual to be deficient in alternative approaches, and he subsequently fears and represses their manifestation in his life, lest they disrupt his self-image and perfection. Idolatry results when this fear of deficiency is projected outwards, onto the figure of the idol, whom the individual then fears.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">195</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, according to the Izhbitzer Rebbe, idolatry does not begin with the objectification of one’s values and beliefs, in the case, for instance, of making an idol out of money, but in the projection of one’s fears and deficiencies, since the whole purpose of an idol is to be saved from them.</i> The idolater does this in the hopes that the idol will alleviate his fear – even though it is powerless to do so. Thus, the idolater’s faith in and fear of his idol begins with the projection of his own<i> </i>imperfection. The opposite approach is embodied by the Jewish people. The faith that R. Gershon Henokh spoke of in chapter one is really the affirmation of God’s absolute transcendence. Even though human beings are lacking, they need not fear that lack. Rather, they can use their own sense of deficiency to realize, by implication, the absolute perfection of God. In other words, our lack opens us to God’s completeness. This is the fear and faith that allows for the acceptance of the Torah, mentioned above, which brings a person into a state of balance, and frees him from the fear that leads to idolatry. </small>",
                "The true foundation of the fear of God is faith. Only by understanding and consciously believing in the supreme lofty heights of God, and then actively fearing Him, does fear become complete. Man’s normal experience of fear usually stems from an awareness of his own deficiencies. Of this it is said (Yeshayahu, 44:17), “He makes himself an idol and bows down to it.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">196</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, he makes <i>of himself</i> an idol, which he bows down to.</i> This kind of fear is called by the Zohar (Vaeira, 29a), “<i>their</i> fear.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">197</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, their own personal fears, which they project outward, upon the idol.</i> Since idolaters are deficient, they believe that by prostrating themselves to an idol and expressing their fear, stemming from a recognition of their own deficiency, the idol will emit a flow of energy to fill their lacks.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">198</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Using the example in note 177, above, we can say that a strong person fears being weak. He therefore prays to an idol to save him from weakness, although all he his really doing is projecting his own inner fears outward, and fearfully worshipping them.</i> And even though the idol is actually powerless to do so, the idolater still believes that by projecting his fear outward, he himself will become complete. Ultimately, he is only worshiping the very deficiency that he fears. This is called, “bowing down to <i>his</i> idol.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">199</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, to the particular trait or idea that he has idolized.</i> The word for idol in Hebrew, “<i>pesel</i>,” is connected to the word for <i>pasul</i>, which means “invalid” or “deficient.” Further in the <i>Beit Yaakov</i> it will be explained that the fear of the idolater, expressed in a place where he knows he is lacking, takes on two forms. The idolater will either erect a form of the lack itself, or a form of the fulfillment of that lack. A weak person will worship either the image of a hero, or the image a weakling. This will all be explained. The service of Israel, however, is different. For we recognize the awesome heights of God precisely through our own deficiencies,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">200</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is opposite the process that leads to idolatry. Here, the awareness of one’s own deficiencies leads to an awareness of God’s grandeur and exaltedness, engendering a fear of God’s own greatness – not the projection of one’s own deficiencies onto an idol.</i> as it is written (Iyov, 19:26), “From my flesh (meaning my limitations and deficiencies) I shall see God.” It is written in the Zohar (Emor, 90b): “I will dwell among the downtrodden and low of spirit.” (Yeshayahu, 57:15) This is the place of the greatest wholeness. When one brings himself low so that the awesome pride of the Supernal One, the Pride of all, may rest upon him, this is a place of wholeness.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">201</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One’s personal sense of lowliness brings about a revelation of Supernal Pride; that is, lowliness itself engenders a sense of a wholeness in that it connects one to God.</i> This is mentioned in the introduction to the Tikkunei Zohar (5b): The seventh level in the fear of God is one who lacks nothing,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">202</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note the subtle shift of approach the author makes with this passage of the Zohar, as well the following one. Previously, R. Gershon Henokh juxtaposed the fear of idolators, which is born out of their sense of personal lack, to the rectified fear of Israel, in which a sense of lack produces an appreciation of God’s completeness. Now, the author begins to discuss a type of fear that is the result of completeness. Based upon this and other Izhbitzer texts (see <i>Tzidkat HaTzaddik </i>212), he seems to mean the following: Because of Israel’s belief (<i>emunah</i>) in God’s utter transcendence, the sense of lack they feel does not result in idolatry – which is the transference of personal lack onto the divinity. Rather, Israel’s lack proves the very opposite – that God is wholely complete and transcendent, as R. Gershon Hanokh interprets the verse, “From my flesh, I see God” – “from my limitations, I deduce the Divine.” In other words – ironically – the idolaters desire for wholeness only exacerbates his weakness, whereas Israel’s acceptance of their weakness allows them to partake of the Divine wholeness. The author further explains that the correct means by which to assuage one’s sense of lack is Torah study. For Torah study frees a person from being fixated on a singular value or truth; thus he does not experience the fear resulting from a sense of personal deficiency in its loss. What is left is a sense of Divine transcendence, which engenders awe. (See note 195.)</i> as it is written (Tehillim, 34:10), “Fear God, His holy ones, for there is nothing lacking to those who fear Him.” He is not one of those of whom it is said (Mishlei, 11:24), “Another withholds unduly, but only comes to lack.” If he is a Torah scholar, he shall not be lacking in Torah, for without Torah, there is no fear of God. This is as it is said (Pirkei Avot, 2:5), “An unlearned person does not fear sin.” Just as there is no Torah without the fear of God, similarly, there is no fear of God without the Torah.",

When a wise person sees the king’s face shining, he says, “Certainly the king is complete in all aspects; his knowledge is complete and his completeness is above all others. In this shining light of his face I see that he is judging more than I see, yet it is covered.” … So too, the Holy One, blessed be He, is ever complete … For this reason, one must take great care to guard himself from Him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">208</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meaning to honor God and adhere to His commandments. </i> Fear that is not rooted in the Torah can fall to the low level of the fear of deficiency, as mentioned above. This is as the Tikkunei Zohar, above, explained the verse, “Another withholds unduly, but only comes to lack.” However, the true fear of God, rooted in the Torah and based on faith, is called, “the completion of holy faith.” This is as it is written in the Zohar (Yitro, 79a): What is the meaning of the verse (Bereshit, 28:17), “And Yaakov feared, and said, how awesome (<i>norah</i>) is this place!” What did Yaakov see that he could only describe as dreadful and awe-inspiring (<i>norah</i>)? He saw the absolute completion of holy faith which existed in that place, just as it is above in the upper worlds. Every place that is at such a level of perfection is called, “awesome (<i>norah</i>).”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">209</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, perfect faith results in an exalted type of fear, more correctly known as “awe.”</i> The Torah is the straight path, and is called the “book of <i>yashar</i>,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">210</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yashar</i> means straight, direct, even.</i> as it is written (Shmuel 2, 1:18), “Is it not written in the book of <i>yashar</i>?” The Torah comes from the middle column,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">211</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are three columns in the array of the ten <i>Sefirot</i> – right, left, and middle. The middle column joins and synthesizes the opposing forces of right and left, .</i> and is whole, for one who grasps onto the Torah lacks nothing. This is because it straightens and balances a person’s attributes so that he is not steeped in any one extremity, which is what brings him to deficiency. If a person is subjugated to any one of his attributes, and thereby lacks the strength of mind to balance its power and prevent it from becoming extreme, then the attribute is deficient, even if it is a good trait that could otherwise be the source of good behavior. If this attribute is taken to its extremity, and then becomes an involuntary mode of behavior, without any reckoning or deliberation, then the attribute, albeit good, will be used in the wrong way.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">212</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This relates to the teaching of the Izhbitzer that there are no bad attributes, only bad applications of good attributes. For example, as R. Gershon Henokh explains here, kindness is neither an inherently good nor evil trait. Used correctly, it is good, but used improperly, as in the case of one who shows kindness to evil-doers, the trait becomes a sin. (This explains the Izhbitzer’s vindication of the sins of various biblical characters. According to him, they never intentionally sinned, but only mistimed the use of certain attributes.) The goal of the Torah is to produce perfected and balanced human beings (symbolized by Yaakov, Tiferet), who always know how to use their character traits in the right way, according to the needs of the situation. An imbalanced person, on the other hand, becomes stuck in a certain mode of behavior, and is unable to deviate from it, even when the situation calls for an alternative approach. This person is deficient in the other traits – a lack that engenders within him a fear of situations in which his innate character trait cannot apply. (See note 177, above.) According to Rav Mordechai Yosef, this person may objectify his lack in the form of an idol, which he will fear, though what he is actually fearing is his own, innate deficiency (his “dark side”). Thus, in praying to the idol to be saved from that which he fears, he is really only praying to his own fear and deficiency. This approach is most likely a Hasidic interpretation of the Kabbalistic concept of the death of the seven Edomite kings (based upon Genesis 36). Each king symbolizes a different trait, or <i>sefirah</i>, used by God to create the world. Nonetheless, these traits were flawed, inasmuch as each one sought to be an exclusive conduit for God’s creative energy: be it <i>Hesed</i> (Love), <i>Gevurah</i> (Severity), or <i>Tiferet</i> (Mercy). This led to the “breaking of the vessels,” and the current, fallen nature of reality, which demands repair. Each “king” said, “I, and only I, will rule.” However, the verses in Genesis do not record the death of the eighth king, Hadar, and they also mention that he had a wife (Meheitavel). In other words, he was the only one who made room for another perspective; thus he did not “die” (i.e. the trait did not shatter), and represents the attribute of “tikkun,” or rectification. This led to the new emanation of the <i>sefirot</i> in which each one contains all ten: love contains wisdom; understanding contains balance, and so forth. In this way, by adapting and being flexible, the vessels could contain God’s light and the world could survive. In the psychological terms used by R. Gershon Henokh, a person on the level of the seven kings will exhibit an inflexible commitment to one particular character trait, and lack the ability to negotiate situations that are not suited to that attribute; whereas the rectified approach means using the whole variety of shades of love, fear, etc, and adapting and relating to the plethora of stimuli one encounters in the world.</i> Take, for example, the trait of kindness, which is clearly a good attribute. However, when it is used indiscriminately and bestowed generously upon cruel people, it becomes destructive; for there is no greater evil than acting kindly toward the cruel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">213</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is based on the aphorisim of the Midrash (<i>Kohelet Rabbah</i> 7:16): “One who is kind to the cruel will eventually be cruel to the kind.” </i> One who errs in this way upholds and even strengthens destructive forces in the world. Clearly, every attribute must be used with clear and conscious deliberation, at the proper time and in the proper place. In this way, he may “establish equity”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">214</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As in the verse from Tehillim, 99:4, cited above. </i> in every aspect of his behavior, according to the approach of the Torah. Then, he will be complete and lack nothing.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">215</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lacking nothing, he will be free from the lower level of fear. His actions will all be balanced and in line with God’s will. His fear of God will be like that of Yaakov – <i>norah – </i>an expression of awe and faith.</i> Above all, the greatest deficiency a person can have is a lack of <i>emunah</i> (faith). On this it is written in the Zohar (Vayikra, 16b): “And it shall be, because he has sinned and is guilty…” (Vayikra, 5:23). Because of this, God withdraws from everything; then God, so to speak, does not exist in creation, and Knesset Yisrael<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">216</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Knesset Yisrael</i> means the “Congregation of the people of Israel,” and is synonymous with the <i>Shechinah</i>, the <i>sefirah</i> of <i>Malchut</i>, the attribute of faith, and<i> </i>the Divine presence which rests upon the Israelite nation. One could say, “God/the <i>Shechinah</i>/faith is hidden from that place.” </i> has left her place. This is as it is written (Yeshayahu, 7:28), “<i>Emunah</i> has perished.” That means that Knesset Yisrael has perished.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">217</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meaning, separated from her place.</i> Of this it is said (Tehillim 92:3), “To speak of Your <i>emunah</i> in the nights.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">218</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Speaking of your faith at night,” means that if one has true faith, then even after the sin, when man sits in darkness, so to speak, he can still amend his ways and return to God. </i>"

Without these intermediary forces, God’s light would be too intense for creation to bear.<br>Furthermore, these forces are not something external to man, but are part of the makeup of his very consciousness, and by means of them, he can perceive something of the Divine Being – prophecy being the highest level of perception.

However, it is one of the central principles of Izbhitz Hasidism that even the mitzvot of the Torah can be abrogated, if God so wills it. One frequently given example is the sacrifices offered by Eliyahu, the prophet, on Mount Carmel, in his contest with the priests of Baal. Such sacrifices – offered when the Temple was standing in Jerusalem – were technically prohibitted by the Torah; however, because God decreed them at that time, they were as valid as any commandment. </i> In line with the previous chapter, the belief that such truths exist is the root of idolatry. The correct response is to live a life of faith, which, as the author previous explained, is the existential realization of one’s own lacks, and the subsequent recognition of God’s perfection and transcendence.</small>",
                "It is written in the Zohar, Parshat Shlach (166a): \"Rabbi Shimon opened the discussion and said, “Better is the man who is lightly esteemed and has a servant than one who primps himself and lacks bread.” (Mishlei, 12:9) One who lacks bread, lacks faith, as it is written (Vayikra, 21:22), ‘the bread of God.’”\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">221</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Interestingly enough, this verse is mentioned in the Torah’s discussion of the blemished Cohen, who, though he may not offer sacrifices in the Temple, may nevertheless eat of the sacrifices, the “bread of God.” Deficiency does not prevent man from the connection of faith, to the contrary, it can strengthen it. </i> If a person is whole in his <i>emunah</i>, then his fear and love of God are also whole.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">222</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We explained above that one who fears God becomes whole in his character traits. Here, we see the reverse: wholeness of faith leads to wholeness of fear. On the other hand, a deficiency in faith would lead to fallen fear, or idolatry.</i> On the other hand, deficiency in <i>emunah</i> is called “heartless.” Of this, the Zohar writes (Kedoshim, 80a): \"What is “heartless?” It is one who lacks faith. One who does not learn the Torah has no faith and is thoroughly blemished.\" Shlomo HaMelech had this in mind when he asked (Mishlei, 17:16), “What is the value of wisdom in the hands of a fool, seeing as he lacks a heart?” <i>Emunah</i> contains the fear of God. When a man has<i> emunah</i> that God is the source and root of all, he then possesses the knowledge that was expressed by the members of the Great Assembly in the prayer, “You, God, existed before the world was created, and You exist after the world was created.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">223</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This prayer is found in the introduction to the morning service, in the <i>Adon Olam </i>prayer.</i> That is, from God’s point of view there is no difference between before the world was created and afterward.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">224</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, faith is that which transcends the limited vessels with which God created the world, as discussed above.</i>",

Everything was established only in order to create the appearance of separate entities in the world, with each being acting on its own accord, based upon the consciousness that God has granted us. Still, we need to know and believe that our own human knowledge does not come close to the root of God’s knowledge. We may only contemplate that which we are permitted to know. Even the prophet’s knowledge is limited by the way God created him and the power of comprehension granted unto him. His prophecy is only according to his knowledge, as it is written (Hoshea, 12:11), “I have multiplied their visions, and I shall use images through the prophets.” This idea is found in the Tikkunei Zohar (Tikkun 19, page 40a). When God wants to draw prophecy into the world, then all of the Sefirot are included in a man, and he is called a prophet. The Sefirah of Malkhut (sovereignty) is a representation of all of the Sefirot. This is as it is written, “I shall use images through the prophets.” And as it is written (Hoshea, 12), “I have spoken to the prophets,” where Malkhut is like a mirror in which you can see all of the various faces.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">227</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>sefirah</i> of Malkhut is the lowest in the arrangement of the <i>sefirot</i>. Thus, Malkhut serves as a sort of catch-basin, or mirror, that receives and reflects the potencies of the upper <i>sefirot</i> that descend into it. The prophet attains this consciousness, and is therefore able to receive God’s word, as it filters down through all the upper worlds and spheres.</i> Similarly, all of the Sefirot show their power and forms to the prophet according to his ability to perceive the upper realms. In the same way it is enclothed below in the Throne of Glory, in all of the angels, the Ofanim, the holy Hayot, in all of their firmaments and thrones, and in all of the angels that are dependent on them. There are many levels of angels, one above the other, as it is written (Kohelet, 5:7), “For there is a higher one who watches over him that is high, and there are yet higher ones over them.” So too, with every Cherub and <i>mazal</i> (astrological force), as it is written (Tehillim, 145), “His sovereignty (Malchus) is in every dominion.” This is, “I shall use images through the prophets.” Each one sees the images (from the beyond) according to his power, which is his soul. It is said in the Midrash (Rabbah, Ta’azria, 15), “Even when <i>Ruah haKodesh</i> rests upon the prophets, it does so only according to a defined measure.” “To make a scale for the wind (spirit)” (Iyov, 28:25). This is all to say that the understanding of the prophets is also a force created by God and allocated to each prophet and sage according to God’s wisdom. His prophecies all follow the specific power of understanding granted at the root of his soul. All of man’s ability to understand is a force that God created and distributed to mankind.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">228</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The point here is that human wisdom – even the highest, prophetic wisdom – is a creation of God, which God emanates in accordance with the level of the prophet’s soul.

However, even here, the references are to stages after the initial steps of creation, and not God in Himself. See next note for more.</i> It is written in the Midrash HaNe’elam of the Zohar Hadash (Bereshit, p. 3), “Before the world was created it was only He and His Name.” There are a number of matters attributed to the time before God created the world. The Midrash tells us that the Torah was hidden for two thousand years before the creation of the world. All of this occurred after the desire to create arose in God’s primordial will, whose antiquity is as old as the border of the existence of creation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">230</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The world mentioned here refers to metaphyisical existence before the creation of matter. The creation of the “world” happened through the first contraction (<i>tzimtzum</i>) of the <i>Ayn Sof</i> (the “Without End”), in which God withdrew His light from around a single in the endless light, creating an empty space in the center of His being. Creation <i>ex nihilo</i> is tantamout to the withdrawl of the light and the creation of this empty space. (See <i>Etz Chayim</i>, Chapter 1; <i>Talmud Eser Sefiros</i>, Introduction, “<i>lifnai</i> <i>shenivrau</i> <i>hanivraim</i>”).</i> At this moment, time was created. This is called, “two thousand years” – a thousand of wisdom, a thousand of understanding. It is called the order of time. This is as it is said in Bereshit Rabbah (3), “This teaches us that the order of time preceded the creation.” In the place and within the borders that were established for the order of time – that is, with the creation of time – the borders and order of Divine conduct were established.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">231</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Time was created before matter. The idea of a time period “before the world was created,” refers to the metaphysical realms that God created prior to the material world. However, as there is an order and sequence to these worlds – the emergence of <i>sefirot</i>, the arrangements of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> (Primordial Man), the breaking and repair of the vessels – we may say that they exist in some form of time. Knowledge of the forms that existed prior to the creation of matter is received tradition from the Prophets, sages, and Kabbalists. The progression of metaphysical creation is described in great detail by the Arizal, in the <i>Etz Chayim</i>, his magnum opus on Kabbalah. </i> This is as it is written in the second introduction to the Tikkunei Zohar (17a): \"You are the one who brought forth ten rectifications, and called them ten Sefirot, for the purpose of conducting worlds that are hidden and not revealed, and for conducting worlds that are revealed.\" Thus the entire order of the Divine conduct of the world was established within the boundaries set for the order of time for the express purpose of running the worlds, both hidden and revealed. This is as this passage in the Zohar concludes: \"You have no known name, or any known place, but rather, You make Your strength and influence known to mankind.\"",
                "<b>Perceiving God’s light through His Names, Sefirot, and Attributes</b> <br> <small>In the previous chapter, the author makes a distinction between the limited creation and the infinite, undefinable state of pure Divinity that precedes all acts of manifestation – even the pre-creation existence of time. Our intellect, itself a created entity, can only grasp other created entities. It cannot penetrate to the pre-existent dimension of God. In this sense, the “boundaries” of the intellect and the “boundaries” of creation correspond. Yet, if God Himself is ungraspable, what is the function of the numerous names of Divinity found in Scripture? In the following chapter, R. Gershon Henoch explains that God Himself has no name, and that all the names found in the Torah are merely attributes that God uses to run the world and relate to humankind; for without them, God’s light would be too intense for creation to bear. Finally, the author explains that since everything in creation is emanated freely and autonomously by God, it is contingent upon God’s will, and therefore lacks ultimate permanence. There are no inviolable principles in creation, including those formulate by the human mind. The consequence of this is that the world is a place of doubt, where it is impossible to posit any absolute truths; for doing so leads to idolatry, as explained above. One must rely only upon faith, which is the recognition of God’s absolute transcendence.</small>",
                "In Parshat Pinhas (257b) the Zohar discusses the meaning and function of God’s names and attributes: In this way, The Master of the World (was called by various names and appellations) even before He created His creations, who would eventually call Him “the Merciful One,” or, “the Judge.” All of God’s names are intended for His creation, in order that creation should have a way to call Him and relate to Him. Therefore, when the people of the generation are worthy, they call Him, “YHVH,” which is the name of mercy. And when the people of the generation are unworthy, they call Him, “A-donai,” which is the name of strict judgment. Each generation and each individual relates to God according to his particular qualities, yet it is clear that God Himself has no attribute or known name.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">232</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, on the highest level, God transcends names and letters.</i> This is similar to the Sefirot, where each Sefirah has a known name; an attribute, measurement, and border. God ventures into these names and rules in them. He is called through them, concealed by them, and dwells in them, as the soul dwells in the limbs of the body. And later in this passage (158a): When God was alone before He created the world, why was it necessary for Him to be called by these name and appellations like, “the Merciful and Compassionate One,” “the Long Suffering,” or, “the Powerful Judge”?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">233</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There was not yet anyone to call God by name, so why did He have a name?</i> There are many more such names, and they are all called in reference to the supernal worlds which existed prior to the existence of the physical world.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">234</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even though names and appellations are born out of the relationship between God and man, they also serve a function in the emanation of the world, and thus, like the supernal <i>Sefirot</i>, they existed prior to the physical world.</i> In reference to the “ten rectifications (Sefirot),” it is said in the second introduction to the Tikkunei Zohar, page 17a (<i>Patach Eliyahu</i>):You are the one who brought forth ten rectifications , and called them ten Sefirot, for the purpose of conducting worlds that are hidden and not revealed, and for conducting worlds that are revealed.

The second introduction to the Zohar, quoted above, continues: You established garments for them, and from these garments souls fly down to mankind. … None of them know You at all, and besides You, there is no Oneness in the upper and lower realms. … You have no known name, for You fill all names, and You are the completion of everything.

You have no known place, but rather You make your strength and power know to mankind, namely, how the world is managed through judgment and mercy … Yet it is not a known form of righteousness, which is <i>din</i> (judgment), nor is it a known form of justice, which is <i>rahamim</i> (mercy), nor with any of these attributes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">238</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Though we call God, “the Compassionate,” the essence of compassion or any such attribute is beyond human understanding. </i> Here it is perfectly clear that all of these names and attributes (Sefirot) exist only for the purpose of the creation, and that they are also created forces essential to the creation.",

This is as it is written in the Zohar (Parshat Bo, 42a): “To whom shall you liken me, that I shall be his equal, said the Holy One.” (Yeshayahu, 40:25) All of the holy Hayot (angels) are called in the letters of the holy name. This is as it is written (Yeshayahu, 43:6), “All that is called in My name, I have created for My glory.” Everything in the creation was created with the letters of God’s name, and there is no creation that does not have God’s name inscribed in it, in order that one may know who created it. For this reason it is written, “To whom shall you liken Me, that I shall be his equal, said the Holy One.” No creature shall be My equal. Even though I created it in the form of My letters, still, I can erase its form and re-create it as many times as I want, and there is no god above Me that can erase My “form.” Here it is clear that all created beings, even the holy Hayot (angels) and all the supernal powers, even the root of their spiritual forms are only arranged and ordered in holy likenesses, and renewed according to God’s desire. It is in the power of God’s desire to change these likenesses into different forms; for according to the changing of the supernal forms, so will the order of God’s governance change, from the loftiest of heights to the lowliest of levels.

How, then, could one say, “Everything in the creation was created with the letters of God’s name, and there is not creation that does not have God’s name inscribed in it”?</i> he will give the answer, “This image I did see, for it is written (Bamidbar, 12:8), “He shall see the vision of God.” “The vision of God,” but not any other vision that He created and formed out of letters.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">243</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, you see only the vision of the letters of creation, but no other vision.</i> For this reason it is written (Yeshayahu, 40:25), “To whom shall you liken me, that I shall be his equal.” To whom can God be compared? What form could you possibly ascribe to Him? Even this “form” of God that is accessed by created beings through the letters of creation does not exist in God’s own place, but comes into being when He descends to reign over his creation. Then the vision spreads over the creation, and each one sees it according to his specific ability to perceive. This is as it is written (Hoshea, 12:11), “I have used images through the prophets.” For this reason, God will say to them that even though He appears to them in a vision that they can comprehend, still, “to whom can I be compared,” because before God created any image or formed any form in the world, God was alone without any form or semblance. We have mentioned how all names and appellations of God are created entities, and that before the creation, there was no name or form from the holy forms. This is as it is written Zohar (Bo, 42b): One who receives information about the state of existence before the creation<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">244</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Despite the limited nature of human cognition, it <i>can</i> receive information about states of existence prior to creation; that is, beyond cognition.

One cannot use a holy name, or even so much as a letter or point to describe this knowledge. This is as the Torah says (Devarim, 4:15), “You did not see any form.” You did not see anything which engenders a likeness or form. However, after God made the form of the holy <i>merkava</i> (chariot) of the supernal man, then God descended there, and He is called in the name of the Tetragrammaton (<i>Yud Hei Vav Hei</i>).

It is God who gives life and existence to all of the worlds and to all of forces that are emanated, created, formed and made.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">246</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He uses four terms for creation, paralleling the kabbalistic concept of the four worlds, <i>Atzilut</i>, <i>Beriyah</i>, <i>Yetsirah</i>, <i>Asiyah</i>. This is a way of saying that God runs all of the worlds, from the most sublime spiritual realm down to the lowly physical world.</i> Not only this, but so too does He gives life and existence in this world to man’s mind, including this very understanding. God’s desire is that we take our knowledge and power of understanding and then go on to serve Him with our free will, which we are required to exercise. This is as it is written in the Tikkunei Zohar (Tikkun 70, page 137a): “Let us make a man” (Bereshit, 1:26). Man is required to perform the mitzvot of the Torah. He must devote his efforts to the Torah in order to work at it and guard it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">247</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Based upon Bereshit 1:15. </i> In this way he will have a good reward, and dominance over you (the angels).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">248</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Sages, when God said in the plural, “Let us make a man,” He was consulting with His angels. The Zohar adds to this rest of the verse: “and they shall rule over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the heaven,” which includes the angels themselves. Although they aided in man’s creation, his free will ultimately enables him to rule over them as well. </i> This is why Israel is called (Yeshayahu, 60:21), “the branch of My planting, the work of My hands in which I will be glorified.” For even though the supernal angels are great in strength and always fulfill God’s word, still, their service is not ranked as truly mighty since they are programmed to serve and obey Him. They have no evil inclination that they may conquer, and do not have a body to contend with in order to serve God. For this reason, “let us make a man,” and he will rule over you. From this understanding and from this power of the intellect comes man’s power of choice, for it is God’s desire that man serve Him with his free will. ",

                "Indeed, a human being is enjoined to believe with perfect faith that God can change his understanding and power of intellect to a completely different one, including one’s overall intellect, that is, the entire order and structure of his mind. This could mean that man’s power of free choice could become completely nullified, or it could mean that only his understanding and power of intellect is changed, yet his free choice remains intact. It could be that God gives man a completely new way of understanding totally different from that which he now knows. This is as it is said in the Gemara (Tamid, 28a), “Which is the right way that man should choose? Let him have abundant faithfulness, as it is written (Tehillim, 101:6), ‘My eyes are upon the faithful of the land that they may dwell with Me.’” This means to believe with perfect faith that nothing is impossible for the Creator, and similarly, man’s mind is in God’s hands. For example, just as it we now understand with clarity of intellect that it is impossible that two opposites could be true on any one subject, it is in God’s power to grant us a perfectly clear understanding that two opposites could be true in one situation. This is as it is written in the Zohar (Bo, 42b), quoted above: I can erase its form and re-create it as many times as I want, and there is no god above Me that can erase My “form.” As was mentioned previously, since human knowledge and understanding is a created entity, ordered, arranged, and granted to us according to God’s will and desire, it could be God’s will and desire to change it to its very opposite. Just as we know now with perfect clarity that two is more than one, so too is it possible that God can have us believe with complete clarity that one is more than two."

For, according to R. Gershon Hanokh, God could easily restructure the human mind to grasp that which now seems illogical. An examples for this, he cites several miracles that occurred in the Holy Temple in Jerusalem. At the moment the miracle occurred, reality – and the human mind – became open to the possibility of opposite phenomena occurring simultaneously. However, he does offer a caveat. This shift in perception only occurs from human perspective. From God’s point of view, there is no distinction between the miraculous and the natural, between the state before and the state after creation, or between finitude and infinity; creation is and always has been nullified within God. The various Divine names used to relate to God, as well as the permanent and logical appearance of creation, exist only from our perspective, to provide us with the means with which to serve God. Only to human perception is there a “before” and “after” to creation, a shift from potential to actual. A view of how the world is managed by God, “from above to below,” is by and large hidden from man’s understanding. Only the rare and sensitive prophetic soul among us can have a vision of this magnitude. </small>",

Yedaya Ben Avraham asked the Rashba to instruct the secular philosophers of Provence. There the philosopher wrote that one must divide the belief of God’s ability to do the impossible into two sections. One is the belief that God can temporarily change nature through miracles such as the splitting of the Sea of Reeds. Yet after a period of time, God will restore nature back to its previous state. God gave nature an enduring existence, yet God is above nature and has the ability to change it. The second section concerns the impossible. Here we must understand the nature of its impossibility even in terms of God’s own conduct,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">250</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“אפילו בחוק ה”</i> and we should not ascribe to God the ability to change it. This is because nature is a part of [God’s] existence, to a certain degree. He further wrote, and this concept is well known, concerning the impossibility of two opposites existing in one subject at the same time. This is all the more apparent with two contradictions, for the contradictions themselves provide a clear illustration of the impossibility that anything could be happening and not happening at the same time. For example, if we say that Reuven is riding on a horse and not riding on a horse at one time and place. Or if we say that he is writing and simultaneously not writing. Contradictory events cannot happen at one time and in one place. In this way truth and falsehood will always be clearly divided. The example of opposites in the realm of number would be saying that a number is both odd and even. In the realm of time, it would be saying that a point in time is both past and future. How could it be, since the past is entirely lost, and the future has not yet begun. How could you have the same exact day which is simultaneously called yesterday and tomorrow? This is clearly a contradictory statement, and illustrates how the impossible remains impossible and can never be the possible.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">251</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meaning, even for God.</i> Such is the contention of the philosopher, that it is impossible for two opposites to be simultaneously true; yet, this is opposite the view of the Torah.",

It has been taught to the same effect: “The ark which Moshe made had around it an empty space of ten cubits on every side.” Now, it is written (Melakhim, 6:20), “And in front of the Sanctuary was twenty cubits in length and twenty cubits in breadth,” and it is also written after that (verses 24-25) that the wing of the one cherub was ten cubits and the wing of the other cherub was ten cubits. Where then was the ark itself? We must therefore conclude that it stood by a miracle without occupying any space. In other words, if the wings of the golden cherubs, positioned to the right and left of the ark, each took up ten cubits, then, theoretically, there was no place left for the ark to stand between them.</i>  Similarly, the Mishnah records that, “on the Day of Atonement the crowd in Holy Temple was so packed together that it would normally have been impossible to move, yet when it came time to fall prostrate on the ground, everyone had enough room.” <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">253</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When the High Priest would pronounce God’s ineffable name in the Holy of Holies of the Temple on Yom Kippur, the crowd, which had been standing so tightly packed that people could barely move, would fall down on their faces, hands and feet spread out on the ground; yet not one of the worshipers touched any other surrounding him. </i> This is a physical impossibility.

Of the place of the Holy Temple it is written (Divrei HaYamim 2, 7:16), “My eyes and heart shall be there at all times.” God illuminated the place of the Holy Temple with an illumination that is above all orders of the natural world, and above the ability of the human mind to comprehend. All who entered the Holy Temple in a holy and pure state would perceive this even through human eyes. He would understand with his mind and intellectual power on a level which is beyond the capacity of perception for someone anywhere else in the world. The Holy Temple was a place where God revealed miracles and made them perceptible to the mortal mind. When the Israelites fell prostrate in the Holy Temple, which was the moment when they heard the Name of God being pronounced by the High Priest in a state of sanctity and purity, God sent them an awesome illumination, and they understood on a level beyond all orders of creation and the capacity of human understanding. At this moment they understood that there is no contradiction between standing jam-packed in a crowd unable to move anywhere, and being able to freely fall to the ground with arms and legs spread out, yet not coming into contact with the people around you.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">255</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, not only did a miracle occur in the Temple, when the congregation prostrated themselves on the ground, the consciousness of the people there itself expanded, so that they were able to cognitively grasp why such a thing is possible.</i> The space of the courtyard of the Holy Temple was not miraculously expanded, for we have many sources in the Talmud<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">256</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The author lists BT Eruvin, 154a, Chulin 83b, and Berachot 17b as sources, though those folios do not seem to relate to this discussion.</i> which teach us that it was not permitted to expand the area of the <i>Azara</i>. This is based on the verse (Divrei HaYamim 1, 28:19), “And this, said David, is written by the hand of God who instructed me, even all the works of this pattern.” With this miracle, where two contradictory opposites could join together in one place without negating each other, two opposites could truly join together in one subject. At the moment when they fell prostrate, they knew this with complete and certain knowledge.

Those who were close would fall on their faces, and those who were far would say, ‘<i>Baruch Shem Kavod Malkhuto Leolam Va’ed</i>,’ – ‘Blessed is the name of His glorious Sovereignty forever and ever.’ Both the High Priest and the people would not move from their places until it was <i>hidden from them</i>.” At the moment when the people heard the <i>Shem haMefurash</i>, they possessed a knowledge and understanding that is beyond time, space, and the laws of nature, as explained in the previous chapter.

He would perceive this through human eyes. Since his very body reached such a level of purity, he could clearly see and understand that there is no logical contradiction in that the Holy Ark existed and yet did not take up any physical space. The Midrash and the Yalkut both interpret the verse (Vayikra, 16:17), “And no man shall be in the Tent of Appointed Meeting when he shall go in to the holy place to make atonement,” as meaning that a man did not go into the Holy of Holies, but rather an angel of the Lord of Hosts.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">259</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Midrash inteprets the words of the verse, “no man shall be in the Tent of Appointed Meeting,” as including to the High Priest himself; yet it was he alone who was commanded to enter the sanctuary!

Due to the intense nature of the experience, Ben Zoma went mad, Ben Azzai died, and Elisha ben Abuya became a heretic and was subsquently known as <i>Acher</i> – “Other.” Only R. Akiva entered and departed in peace.</i> explanation shook the world and perplexed the sages.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">263</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The following passage from the tractate Hagiga (15a) describes the incident: Our Rabbis taught: Once Rabbi Yehoshua ben Hananiya was standing on a step on the Temple Mount, and Ben Zoma saw him and did not stand up before him. So Rabbi Yehoshua said to him, “What are you contemplating, Ben Zoma?” He replied, “I was gazing between the upper and the lower waters, and there is only three fingerbreadths between them, for it is said (Bereshit 1:6), And the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters - like a dove which hovers over her young without touching them.” Thereupon Rabbi Yehoshua said to his students, “Ben Zoma is still outside.” See now, when was it that ‘the spirit of God hovered over the face of the water? It was on the first day of Creation. But the division took place on the second day, for it is written: And let it divide the waters from the waters!’ And what is the size of the division? Rabbi Akha ben Yaakov said, “a hair’s breadth.” According to R. Gershon Hanokh, Ben Zoma was attributing the division between G-d and creation to the very roots of reality – to the first day of creation. However, as Rabbi Yehoshua pointed out, the division between G-d and creation only occurred on the second day, with the creation of the firmament. And even in those terms, Ben Zoma was still wrong, as he perceived a significant division between the upper and lower worlds (three fingerbreadths), whereas the division is no more than a hair; meaning to say, the division between G-d and creation is extremely slight, and exists only from the human perspective, as explained above. For further discussion of this see <i>Living Waters: The Mei HaShiloach</i>, (Tr. Betzalel Edwards), Parshat Emor, on the verse, “and you shall not do so in your land.”</i> Wasn’t the creation of the firmament already included in the statement (Tehillim, 33:6), “The heavens were created with God’s word, and the spirit of His breath all their hosts”?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">264</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse six in the first chapter of Genesis says, “And God said, let there be a firmament.” Verse seven says, “And God made the firmament.” Yet the psalm teaches us, “The heavens were created with God’s word,” meaning, God’s word created the universe immediately. Thus, if the firmament was already created in verse six, why in verse seven does it say, “God made the firmament”? To Ben Zoma, this implied a division between G-d and His actions.</i> Rashi explains to us that Ben Zoma perplexed the sages by saying that he gazed and saw that the distance between the upper and lower waters was three fingerbreadths. The Midrash goes on to say that it was not long after this that he died. Concerning the creation of the firmament and the division of the waters, the Ramban asked why in verse 6 the Torah says, “Let there be a firmament in the waters,” and then again in verse 7 it says, “And God made the firmament.” Wasn’t the firmament already made in verse 6?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">265</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Ramban, this is the exact problem that bothered Ben Zoma. It was not only on account of the word, “He made” since on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days it also says, “He made.” Rather, Ben Zoma’s problem was that on other days, immediately after God’s utterance (“let there be”), it is written, “and it was so.” This implies that it came into being immediately after the utterance. Yet on the second day, after it says, “and God said, let there be a firmament,” it goes on to say, “and He made.” (before it says, “and it was so.”) The Ramban suggests that Ben Zoma had some secret interpretation of the verse that he did not want to reveal. (See the Ramban for his own reconciliation of this problem.)</i> Truly, both explanations are true and one. The mistake of Ben Zoma was that he posited too great a distance between the upper and the lower waters. This is the meaning of the statement, “Ben Zoma glimpsed and died.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">266</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Babylonian Talmud, Ben Zoma went mad, but Ben Azzai died. According to Palestinian Tamud, Ben Zoma died, and Ben Azzai went mad. </i> The <i>Mei HaShiloach</i> gives a brief explanation of this. The Gemara (Hagiga, 15b) records Ben Zoma saying, “I was gazing between the upper and the lower waters, and there is only three fingerbreadths between them.” Upon hearing this, Rabbi Yehoshua said to his students, “Ben Zoma is still on the outside.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">267</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Simply explained, this means after his mystical experience, Ben Zoma’s perception became damaged, and the sages of his day felt that they could no longer rely upon him. On a deeper level, R. Yehoshua may have been saying that Ben Zoma perception was outside the realm of unity.</i> What was the actual distance between the upper and lower waters? “Rabbi Aha ben Yaakov said a hairbreadth. And the Rabbis said the space between the boards of a narrow bridge. Mar Zutra (or maybe Rav Assi) said as the space between two garments spread one over the other; and others say, the space between two cups fitted one over the other.” The subject of the space between the upper waters and the lower waters is hinted at in the matter of the firmament, which alludes to the separation between the upper and lower worlds. The creation of the firmament made a division between the upper and lower worlds, as it is written in the Zohar (Bereshit, 17a): “And God said, let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters.” (Bereshit, 1:6) This is the secret of the rectification, specifically of the separation between the upper and lower waters, in the secret of the left… A conflict that is arrayed as above,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">268</sup><i class=\"footnote\">D. Matt’s translation was partially used in this passage. </i> which rises and does descend,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">269</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meaning, a conflict exists in this world, similar to the conflict above – i.e. the division between heaven and earth; that is the Talmudic debate between Shammai and Hillel, which was a “<i>makhloket l’shem shamayim</i>” – a dispute for the sake of Heaven, and ultimately reconciled (<i>Pirkei Avot</i>, 5:17), just as the division between heaven and earth will ultimately be reconciled. The opposite is the conflict of Korah, which was a a “<i>makhloket sh’lo l’shem shamayim</i>” – not for the sake of heaven, and thus will not endure. It is similar to the false division perceived by Ben Zoma. </i> and which exists on a straight path, is the dispute of Shammai and Hillel. There God separated between the two and reconciled them. Since this was a conflict for the sake of Heaven, the Heavens mediated the conflict, and because of this it endures.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">270</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Matt renders, “and upon this conflict the world was established,” based on another version. </i> This is akin to the creation of the world. Korah (in his dispute with Moshe) went against the work of creation. He was in dispute with the heavens. He wanted to contradict the words of Torah. In his dispute he was certainly cleaving to hell, and hell clove to him. This secret is written in the book of Adam. The reason for the separation between the upper and lower realms is in order give man the ability to serve God. The division creates darkness and a concealment of the Divine Presence. Man can then serve God through the power of his own free choice. This is as was mentioned above in the Tikkunei Zohar (Tikkun 70) and is mentioned in the Zohar (Tetsave, 184a): Man only serves God from amidst darkness…<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">271</sup><i class=\"footnote\">G-d’s worship is not complete until it arises out of man’s free will. But in order for many to have free will, he cannot be aware of G-d’s presence. A level of darkness, concealment, or “division” between the upper and lower worlds must exist. </i> Therefore God created the “Tree of Doubt” which is the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">272</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil represents the consciousness that perceives a separation between heaven and earth. When it is used to bring man closer to G-d, it is called a “controversy (i.e. division) for the sake of heaven.” However, when the dualistic perception is taken to its most negative extreme, it posits an unbridgeable gap, which is the root of all irreconcilable controversies, that are “not for the sake of heaven.” </i> In this way man can serve God out of this very uncertainty. This is as it is said (ibid.): Light is only that which comes out of darkness. When this side is subdued, the Holy One, blessed be He, ascends above, and His Glory is magnified.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">273</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The only true service of God is that which arises from a situation of doubt and confusion.</i> Indeed, from the downward evolutions and concatenations of the branches of the Tree of Doubt, there eventually arises the phenomenon of the dispute which is not for the sake of Heaven, like the dispute of Korah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">274</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Radziner is presenting a tremendously novel concept, namely that the root of all earthly conflicts lie in the contradiction between God’s omnipresence and His concealment. Though He is everywhere, as the Torah states, “there is none else besides Him,” yet our normal human perceptions contradict this. Similarly, though God directs everything in the world, we still have free choice to do as we please. Yet, it is the concealment of the Divine that provides us with the ability to freely serve Him. When the Zohar says, “The Heavens mediated this conflict, and thus it endures,” it means that only through God’s illumination can the human mind grasp the reconciliation of these paradoxes. </i> This is because the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil also contains separate evil. This is included in the divine utterance of creation, “Let there be a firmament,” – which is separate – and creates a division between the upper and lower realms. "

                "<b>The Sin of Adam and that which Separates us from God</b> <br> <small> The author now seeks to explain how Adam’s sin in the Garden was an antecedent to Ben Zoma’s similar mistake. As explained above, the division between G-d and creation allows for human free will, and the ability to freely and autonimously accept G-d’s dominion. More specifically, the creation of the six sefirot (character traits, days of the week) from Hesed to Yesod, all allow for the existence of Malkhut (free will, Shabbat), though only when they are actively invested with the higher sefirot of Hokhmah, Binah, and Da’at. (the intellectual faculties). That is, when one’s actions and emotions are balanced by the intellect. Adam sinned by assuming that this process occurred within him automatically, which meant that his desire to eat from the Tree of Knowledge was actually G-d’s will. By following on his desire, he separated Malkhut (G-d’s explicit commandment and his own free will to heed it) from the upper sefirot. </small>",
                "It is written in the Midrash Rabbah (Kohelet, Parsha 1), “‘I wounded, and I will heal.’ (Devarim, 32:39) … Rabbi Yohanan said, ‘I struck’ is not written, but rather ‘I wounded.’ I created a wound<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">275</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word for wound – <i>mahatsti</i> – is similar to the word <i>mehitsah</i>, “divider.”</i> in that I made a <i>division</i> between the upper and lower realms whereby the upper realms exist forever, and the lower realms are subject to death. Yet in the time to come, there will no longer be death, as it is written (Yeshayahu, 25:8), ‘He will destroy death forever.’ Rabbi Abba said, furthermore, in the time to come I will return and heal the wound. It is precisely through the division that I bring healing.” The matter of division hints at the positive aspect of separation, which necessitates the existence of free choice, as mentioned above. The result of choosing the good, despite the concealment of God’s presence, is the revelation of the God’s glory in the world. This is as the Gemara says (Rosh Hashanah, 31a), “[What psalm did the Levites recite] on the second day of the week? ‘God is great and greatly praised,’ (Tehillim, 145:3) because He divided His works and ruled over them.” The division of God’s attributes led to the birth of the attribute of Malkhut – G-d’s Kingship – by means of human beings using their power of choice. Before the division, God could not be called, “King.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">276</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Before the division of heaven and earth, God ruled alone. R. Gershon Hanokh uses the term <i>moshel</i> - <i>– </i>a ruler – to define G-d’s reign at that stage. This is unlike a king, who rules through the consent of the people. Thus, it was only on the second day, after the division in creation was formed and something “other” than G-d existed, could the creation willfully crown Him as its King. </i> Thus, on the first day of the week [the Levites recited]; “The earth is God’s and the fullness thereof” (Tehillim, 24:1).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">277</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The song that the Levites sung each day of the week corresponded to the six primordial days in which G-d created the world. Since, on the first day of creation, there was not yet a division between heaven and earth, nor was there an independent creation to coronate G-d as King, so, the Levites, on Sunday, sang “The earth is God’s and the fullness thereof.” At that point, the creation belonged solely to G-d.</i> It was then that He acquired, gave over acquisition, and ruled in His world. What does it mean that God, “ruled,” on the first day? He ruled against the will of the creation, without having His sovereignty built upon the free choice of the creation. But since concealment is a prerequisite for choice, it also leads to absence, darkness, and the need for healing. This is hinted at in the Zohar (Bo, 35a), with the secret of the great sea creature:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">278</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Bereshit, 1:21</i> Then, when the light was hidden above from the gardener,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">279</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Zohar is revealing the secrets of the mystery of creation, which begins on the first day, where God “divided between the light and the darkness.” Before this passage, the Zohar introduced the concept of the Tsaddik (Holy Man, also, alluding to the <i>sefirah</i> of <i>Yesod</i>) who is described as a gardener, who tends, cultivates, and facilitates growth. It also represents Divine providence, which “cultivates,” humankind in particular and the creation as a whole. </i> as mentioned, the first darkness emerged, hitting [the sea creature] on the hole that had been made in its head. And a single thread emerged from between the light that had been hidden and the emerging darkness. This is as it is written, “And God divided between the light and the darkness.” This sea creature,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">280</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The sea creature is the Leviathan (see Bereshit 1), representing the highest levels of Hokhmah - Wisdom (ChaBaD of Hokhmah), which are the concealed forces in the upper waters. The Midrash teaches us that there were two Leviathans, the largest creatures of the sea, a male and a female. The female was killed after being created, and its meat was salted and preserved for the Righteous in the time to come.</i> with the separation of the thread, was then divided into the rivers that flow within the darkness.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">281</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The thread of light that that the Zohar tells us is emerging from the darkness provides the power of choice and the ability for man in the lower world to choose the good, thereby revealing God’s glory in the world. </i> God created the lower world purely out of His kindness. This is as it is written (Tehillim, 89:3), “For I have said, the world will be built on kindness.” God divided space into six directions.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">282</sup><i class=\"footnote\">North, south, east, west, up, down.</i> Each direction representing one of the six lower attributes (<i>Sefirot</i>), and from the division of these six attributes comes the power of choice, which brings forth the seventh and final attribute of Malkhut – Kingship.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">283</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Malkhut</i> is the ability to receive God’s light and thereby crown Him as King of the world. </i> This is related to the statement in the <i>Chapters of Rabbi Eliezer</i>, that Kingship only comes about through choice and will. Now, the attributes are divided into Hesed - Lovingkindness, Gevurah - Strength, Tiferet - Beauty, etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">284</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The revelation of God’s sovereignty is achieved through man actively choosing through which of the six lower attributes that Sovereignty will be revealed. To reveal the aspect of Sovereignty in any one of the attributes, one must draw the light of ChaBaD into that attribute. </i> We have mentioned above that each of the attributes on its own is not intrinsically good. Thus, when any one of the attributes is used without Da’at – Consciousness<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">285</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Da’at, or Divine consciousness, originates in the intellect, or the upper three <i>sefirot</i>, and is ideally drawn down and infused into the lower revealed <i>sefirot</i>, the attributes of action.

See above, Part 2, chapter 2, for a discussion of the misuse or “unclarified” used of the attributes.</i> However, when the six lower attributes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">287</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The six lower “revealed” <i>Sefirot</i> are Hesed – Lovingkindness, Gevurah – Strength, Tiferet – Beauty, Netzah –Eternity, Hod – Majesty, and Yesod – Foundation.

HaBaD is the spiritual root of man’s intellectual faculties. </i> and as a result, the sum total of the attributes are used in their proper time and place, then the structure is complete. Then the attribute of Malkhut comes forth as the true completion and perfection of all the attributes, and the light of the Kingship of Heaven shines in its full completeness. Indeed, when a man reaches the point where he is drawing HaBaD into the lower attributes, which is possible only through his concerted efforts in Divine service and striving to know God, it must occur in the same way that Shabbat follows the six days of the week.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">289</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The six work days correspond to the six attributes (sefirot), from Hesed to Yesod, with Shabbat corresponding to the <i>Sefirah</i> of Malkhut. Just as free will needs the engagement of all six of these attributes (without which, a person would be emotionally imbalanced, and fall into idolatry, as explained above), which leads to the creation of Malkhut – the willing acceptance of G-d’s kingship – so too, does Shabbat follow the six days of the week.</i> Similarly, with man, this is only possible through efforts at the service of God, crowning God over him as his King, and accepting upon himself the yoke of the Kingship of Heaven. In the world, this idea is hinted at in the place of the Holy Temple, which is a place of lucid Divine service, for it is at that place that God shines His light in its fullness. ",

                "The sin of Adam was the failure to achieve what was spelled out in the previous section. This is explained in the Etz Hayyim and the Liqutei Torah (Bereshit) of the Arizal.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">290</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Namely, failing to draw Da’at – Consciousness into the lower attributes, and the mistake of creating a separation between Malchut – Kingship – and the upper attributes.</i> Adam’s sin was that he wanted to magnify the size of the crown (Keter) of Zeir Anpin (which contains the six attributes) before its time, and did not draw light into it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">291</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The crown needs to receive the proper intensity of light in order to be adequately illuminated. Increasing the size of the vessel of the crown without increasing the intensity of the light only reduces the illumination. An analogy in this world would be a person opening a charity organization without having the funds to distribute. </i> Similarly he sinned with regards to the Nukva (female) of Zeir Anpin, in that he turned the female away from the male. This is not the place to explain this complex Kabbalistic idea in full, and God willing, we will return to it in its place. The root of Adam’s sin is mentioned in the Tikkunei Zohar (Tikkun 69, page 117a): The central principle of the four letters and the ten letters<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">292</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The “four letters” refers to the Tetragrammaton, spelled Yud Hei Vav Hei. The ten letters are the expansion of the name, with each letter spelled in full - Yud Vav Dalet, Hei Aleph, Vav Aleph Vav, Hei Aleph.</i> is Malkhut – Sovereignty. Malkhut is comprised of ten Sefirot, and all must be included within Malkhut. Anyone who takes the nine upper Sefirot without Malkhut is, “cutting the plantings” (committing heresy). And similarly, in the Tikkunei Zohar, Tikkun 19: Rabbi Shimon said to Rabbi Elazar, “Elazar my son, they sinned in them all: in their thoughts, and in their hidden thought. The word “et”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">293</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This whole passage requires kabbalistic knowledge. The Zohar refers to the commandment to send away the mother bird (Devarim 22:7): “<i>v’et habanim tikach lach </i>– and take the chicks.” The chicks represents Kingship-Malkhut. Meaning to say, always take Malkhut together with the upper <i>sefirot</i>. In R. Gershon Hanokh’s terms, a person must exercise his free will in a balanced way – by allowing the light of the intellect to shine into the attributes. Adam’s sin lay in his eating impulsively from the Tree of Knowledge, rather than carefully examining his motivations, in light of G-d’s commandment. As R. Gershon Hanokh will explain, Adam did this because he assumed that his innate desires were G-d-given, and thus always accurate. In the verse from Devarim, the direct object “<i>et</i>” is understood to be referring to the Shechina, which went into exile when the Israelites sinned.</i> is said in order to include the lower <i>Shekhina</i>. Meaning to say, within the totality of the six attributes can be found the trait of the Malkhut, which completes them all. This is said in several places in the Zohar and the Tikkunei Zohar. The three upper Sefirot are also found in the six lower attributes, as is said in the Raya Mehemna (section of the Zohar), Parshat Pinhas (257a): The seventh is only from the side of the letter Yud ( י ), the crown on his head, Supernal Wisdom is a sign,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">294</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Ot,” as in a sign of the covenant, like Shabbat or Brit Milah. </i> Lower Wisdom is a sign … <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">295</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Shemot 31:13, “The Sabbath is a sign – <i>ot hi – </i>beween you and Me.” The pronoun <i>hi </i>is spelled with the letter <i>yud </i>(היא), which represents Hokhmah – supernal Wisdom. The seventh sefirah - <i>Malkhut</i>, Kingship – is considered to be derived from the sefirah of Hokhmah (אבא יסד ברתא). The point on the top of the letter Yud represents the connection between the infinite and the lower finite world (“the crown on his head”). The implication is that the connection to the infinite is hidden within the world. When Malchut, which is the Shechina or the presence of God dwelling in the community of Israel, is revealed as, “the crown on His head,” meaning, when God’s sovereignty that was hitherto hidden among Israel is seen as connected to the Infinite and revealed in the supernal world and as a vehicle for the effluence of supernal wisdom, then malchut – G-d’s sovereignty – is complete. The author’s commentary on the Torah, the <i>Sod Yesharim</i> (Noah, beginning with the words “et kashti”), also heavily based on the Zohar, explains Adam’s sin in the following way: The Arizal writes that the sin of Adam was in attempting to enlarge the crown of Zeir Anpin before its proper time. This means that Adam wanted to draw Hokhmah – Wisdom – into the rest of his body in order for all of his actions would be a direct expression of God’s own will. In this way Adam seized Malkhut, meaning he held onto the power of nature disconnected from the nine upper <i>Sefirot</i>. If he had seized Malkhut through the nine <i>Sefirot</i>, he would have thus built the Kingdom of Heaven in a state of completeness together with the Keter-Crown of Zeir Anpin. In other words, then a permanent reverence for God would have been fixed in his being and in the being of all of creation. Then it would have followed automatically that the Keter of Zeir Anpin would have also been instilled with such awesome reverance. There would have been a complete state of consciousness (<i>da’at shleima</i>) in all one’s powers so that man would know where it was forbidden to enter, because that place would separate man from his roots and he would not see the presence of his Creator. So too, he would see where he was permitted to enter … However, since Adam took it before its time, rushing in with the desire to elevate the matters of this world at the outset, he fell into a state of concealed consciousness and forgetting, remaining in the physical aspect of the world. This is the meaning of, “taking Malkhut without the upper nine <i>Sefirot</i>.” </i>",
                "Adam HaRishon reasoned in this way. Since a force from the root of HaBaD exists also in the revealed attributes, and since he was created by God, God thus desired to be called King also in the lower realm of creation (the physical world). As a result of all of this, Adam’s desire was stimulated, and it occurred to him that his desire was in fact God’s own desire. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">296</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The author writes in his commentary on the Zohar, <i>Tiferet Ha-Hanokhi</i>, (Parshat Lekh, on Zohar 83, section beginning, “ve’lo”): The Tikkunei Zohar states that the sin of Adam lay in his taking the ten <i>Sefirot</i> without Malkhut. Consider the following explanation. Adam did not sufficiently establish God’s Sovereignty, to crown God over all of His creation. Truly, even in the final garment [of creation], that is, the place that seems the furthest and most hidden from God, what we loosely call “evil,” also in this place, man must see himself and conduct himself as a slave. Adam’s sin was in that it seemed to him that as the very handiwork of God, all his feelings of desire and yearning [to eat from the Tree of Knowledge] must also be coming directly from God. However, the essential quality of Malkhut is to serve God through one’s own choice, by limiting one’s behavior in order to increase Godliness in the world, and to accept upon himself the responsibility for sin. [Thus, Adam should not have eaten it, even if he was correct.] </i> In understanding that everything that he felt like doing was the expression of the Divine will,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">297</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, he desire to eat from the Tree of Knowledge must also have been a manifestation of G-d’s will.</i> the necessity for active service through Adam’s power of choice became void. And it follows, that since all of the revealed attributes (<i>sefirot</i>) were innately within him,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">298</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In must be stressed here that the six revealed <i>Sefirot</i> are all the ways we serve God in the world, with love - Hesed, with fear - Gevura, with splendour - Tifferet, etc.</i> then everything he would do would automatically express God’s glory in the world. This is a brief synopsis of the Arizal’s understanding of Adam’s sin."

                "<b>Ben Zoma’s Replay of Adam’s Sin</b> <br> <small> The author, based upon the Arizal, now explains Ben Zoma’s mistake and its similarity to Adam’s sin. Like Adam, Ben Zoma posited an essential division between G-d and the creation (here, defined as a division between Hokhma and the six attributes). This explains Ben Zoma’s radical claim that a space of two fingerbreadth exists between the upper and lower waters (i.e. between heaven and earth), whereas, in reality, there is almost no division at all. And as for the little that exists, G-d is constantly repairing it, to bring the creation back into a state of unity with Him. This is called the “healing of the lower waters,” and their reintegration into the upper waters. </small><br>The Arizal explained Ben Zoma’s mistake in the same way. Ben Zoma thought that if his Divine service reached the level of Binah – Understanding, that is within Hokhmah – Wisdom,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">299</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Each <i>Sefirah</i> is comprised of all ten <i>Sefirot</i>. Therefore, the <i>Sefirah</i> of Hokhmah – Wisdom – contains a “center” of Hokhmah and a “center” of Binah – Understanding. </i> he would reach an apprehension that the root of the attributes are fixed in the place of Binah – Understanding. This would then be sufficient in order to illuminate all the details of the other attributes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">300</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The ten <i>Sefirot</i> above, and the various attributes that constitute the human personality below.</i> It would be revealed that in this place, all of the attributes are unified. However, (in Binah), the attributes are still defined as separate, it is just that they are not in opposition to each other.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">301</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hokhmah, Wisdom is a level above Binah, Understanding. The world of Hokhmah is entirely good. The lower world of Binah contains the roots of separate good and evil, though at this sublime level, evil is unlike that of the physical world; i.e. destruction and hatred, but rather exists as a spiritual or intellectual potential for negativity. The “evil” in Binah is not in opposition to the good, as it still accords with God’s plan for the total amelioration of his creation. </i> This is all explained in its place in the Etz Hayyim.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">302</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This may refer to the author’s own commentary on the Ez Hayyim, which was lost during the Holocaust, or to a source in the Lurianic writings. The complete explanation of both the sin of Adam and the four who entered the “Pardes” is found in the Liqutei Torah of the Arizal, Parshat Bereshit. </i> Truly, man’s Divine service must reach the root of the attributes as they are found in Hokhmah – Wisdom. This is because complete and total Hesed–Lovinkingness is found in the Sefirah of Hokhmah –Wisdom. This is as it is said in the Tikkunei Zohar (Tikkun 69, page 107a), “Hesed is Hokhmah.” If you study deeply various places in the Zohar and Tikkunei Zohar, you will see that when the attributes are found in Hokhmah – Wisdom, they are not even called attributes. It is only when they descend below and dress themselves in the lower realms that they are called by the name, “attributes.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">303</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The level of Hokhmah – Wisdom – is beyond good. On the personal level, it means a level of knowing so deeply that everything in one’s life is for the good that one cannot really work out its details in the mind. The details and concrete ideas, like the blueprint of a house or a detailed buisness plan, is the act of revealing Hokhmah in Binah. Once we get to the details of an idea or project, we begin to separate the good from the bad. You say to yourself, “This possibility is good, and the other possibility is not so good.” So it is in the upper realms of Divinity, that Hokhmah – Wisdom is all good, and the genesis of the separation of good and evil starts in the <i>sefirah</i> below Hokhmah, which is Binah – Understanding. </i>",
                "Let us examine the situation in terms of the words of Ben Zoma. He said, “I looked between the upper and lower waters, and I saw that between them there was a difference of two or three finger breadths.” This is the version of his words in the Midrash.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">304</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereshit Rabbah</i>, 1:6</i> In the version of the Gemara, he says, “a difference of three finger breadths.” The expression, “two or three finger breadths,” is a kind of code word for the hidden attributes (HaBaD). By saying, “two,” according to the Arizal, Ben Zoma was saying that his Divine service reached the level of Binah, which is the second Sefirah from above to below.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">305</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Keter is not included, therefore the highest <i>Sefirah</i> is Hokhmah, followed by Binah, which is counted as “two.” </i> Upon reaching Binah, Ben Zoma asserted that his knowledge of all the attributes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">306</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The lower seven <i>sefirot</i>, or “Attributes.” Ben Zoma was mistaken in that he could effectively use all of the <i>sefirot</i> in his Divine service as a way to reveal God’s glory in the world. </i> was complete. In this way he shook the whole world in asking how the Torah could say, ‘and God made the firmament,” while the Tehillim says, “and with the word of His mouth were the heavens made (meaning already made).” This teaches of division and separation (<i>havdala</i>). Thus, in Ben Zoma’s understanding, there was a certain distance between the attributes and Hokhmah at the root. He thought that it was impossible for man to truly unify them through his Divine service. As long as the attributes are not unified with their source,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">307</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Hokhmah – Wisdom.</i> they have no complete unity, as is explained in the Tikkunei Zohar quoted above.",
                "",
                "Truly, one must know and understand, that from God’s point of view, it is all one, whereas the concealment of God’s presence and separation exist only from man’s point of view. God gave man the power to serve the Divine with his power of choice in order to unify all of the attributes and connect them to their source. Once this is done, he will see that they are, in reality, not even called attributes. This is how Ben Zoma shook the entire world in asserting, “Is it not written that that the Heavens were made by the word of God? And here, after God said, let there be a firmament, it is said, and God made the firmament. Thus, in this place, there is a difference between God <i>saying</i>, and God <i>doing</i>.” The conclusion in the Talmud, after reviewing this statement, was that, “Ben Zoma is still on the outside. But what is the actual distance between the upper and lower waters? Like the space between two garments spread one over the other; or as the space two cups fitted over one another.” That is to say, there is no separation whatsoever.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">308</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Likewise, there is no actual separation between God saying and doing.</i> The separation is only an appearance in order to enable man’s ability to serve the Divine. A veil must conceal the source from its effects in the world we live in, for if the source were revealed there would be no impetus from the side of man to perform Divine service. Therefore, in Tehillim 148:4, which describes how all the elements of creation give praise to God, it does not say, “Halleluiah, all of the waters which are below the heavens,” but it says specifically, “all of the waters which are <i>above</i> the heavens,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">309</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The full verses are: “Praise Him, you highest heavens and you waters above the heavens...

If the waters are praising the Creator, then, by definition, they are called, “upper waters,” for at such a time of proclaiming God’s praises the lower waters have ascended and are in a state of complete unity with the upper waters. God is constantly occupied with healing the veil of separation, as was mentioned above, in Chapter Seven, with the Midrash Kohellet on the verse, “I have wounded, and will heal.” This is also hinted at in the Zohar (Vayigash, 207a): “God established the heavens with understanding.” (Mishlei, 3:19) What does the word, “establish,” mean? Rather, God establishes each day, never ceasing. He does not fix the world once, but rather fixes the world each and every day. God established that from the creation’s point of view a separation exists, and all that descends from the source in the upper realms to enclothe itself in the lower world takes on the appearance separation. This is as it is written in the Zohar (Bereshit, 22b): All of Rabbi Shimon’s fellowship stood up and said, “Rabbi, Rabbi, is there a separation between <i>Abba</i> and <i>Imma</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">311</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The supernal personae (<i>partsufim</i>) expressing the Divine conduct of Wisdom (represented by the <i>partsuf</i> of <i>Abba-</i>Father) and Understanding (representing the <i>partsuf</i> of <i>Imma-</i>Mother)</i> for <i>Abba</i> is in the path of <i>atzilut</i> (the World of Emanation), and the side of <i>Imma</i> in the world of <i>beriya</i> (Creation)?” Rabbi Shimon answered, “My friends, my friends, it is not like this.

Rather, the supernal Imma was called by the name whose numerical equivalent is Elo-him (86). This name is, ‘light and darkness.’ As a result of the darkness existing in this name, father said that Adam of <i>beriya</i> would sin in the future.” It is apparent from the Zohar in parshat Kedoshim (page 83a) and in the Tikkunei Zohar (Tikkun 67, page 98b) that sin cannot touch <i>atzilut</i> whatsoever.

                "Our subject is explained by the Holy Ra’avad<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">318</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Twelfth century talmudist and kabbalist, Rabbi Avraham ben David of Posquieres.</i> in his introduction to the Sefer Yetsira<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">319</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hayim Vital (Introduction, Ets Hayim) states that this work was not actually written by the Ra’avad, but by another sage. Nonetheless, it is an authentic and trustworthy work of Kabbalah. </i> where he explains the concept of the Fifty Gates of Binah. He says, “It is the contention of the philosophers that substance cannot come into being from nothing, but rather can only be created from a similar substance. It is our view, and the view of the Torah, that the world was created <i>ex-nihilo</i>. Based on this, the heretics ask us their impudent questions, for the world must now be understood in one of two ways. Either there was some primordial substance out of which God created the world (a view hinted at in Bereshit Rabbah, Chapter One, that God is a “Painter,” who found lovely paints, namely “chaos and void and darkness<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">320</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the second verse in the Torah. </i> “), or that there was no material at all before the world’s creation, only the Cause of all Causes, God Himself. Now, the assertion that there was something that existed eternally, other than God, is a purely heretical notion. Yet, if we say that nothing existed – that God created His world out of His own essence – it means that His essence took on a physical form.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">321</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is an equally heretical statement. </i> Concerning this mystery, God responds by saying (Iyov, 38:4), ‘Where were you when I laid the foundations of the world? Tell me, if you possess understanding!’ Meaning, the world came into existence through the power of Hokhmah – Wisdom, and the power of Binah – Understanding. One can further ask, ‘Why was the world created with this exact measurement, no more or less?’ And, ‘How did a finite world consisting of substances with specific dimensions come forth from a power that is immeasurable by definition?’ Concerning these questions, God answers (Iyov, 38:5), ‘Who determined its measurements, do you know? Or who has stretched the line upon it?’ The inquirer can further raise the question, ‘Can the basic qualities of creation become opposite of their nature, or not? And if you say that it is possible,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">322</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra’avad does not address the opposite possibility, that the basic qualities of creation cannot become opposite of their nature. Perhaps to do so would attribute to them a degree of necessary existence, which contradicts the principle of creation ex nihilo.</i> then we may ask, seeing as there are four qualities – hot, wet, cold, and dry – from whence were they created? If they were created out of the very first Cause of all Causes, then how could this Primal Cause contain these opposite qualities? And if you say that the Primal Cause is a simple unity, then from were are these qualities and their opposites derived?’ In response to this, God says (Iyov, 38:6), “Upon what (<i>mah</i>) are its foundations fastened?” (Referring to the elementary materials of nature, which are garments for the foundation of Divine Sovereignty – <i>Malkhut Shamayim</i>.) The verse uses the words, “Upon <i>what</i>,” as a coded way of saying, “Upon Hokhmah – Wisdom, which is called ‘<i>mah</i>.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">323</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The sefirah of Hokhmah refers to a level of reality in which the entire creation exists as a single point of potential, before it unfolds in a downward process of expansion and formation. This is alluded to by very word Hokhmah, which can be divided into two words: ko’ah mah (כח מה) – the “potential” for “what is.”</i> Nature’s foundations are fastened upon God’s Wisdom, which can contain all of these contradictory qualities, just as the Hiyuli<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">324</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hiyuli is the primordial, formless substance of creation, which preceded the physical elements. The Ramban writes, “The heavens and all that is within them is one substance. And the earth and all that is within it is one substance. God created both of them out of non-existence. Only these two were created, and everything was made out of them. This substance is called the Hiyuli. In Hebrew it is called tohu – ‘formless matter.’”</i> can contain the simple elements of creation. The heretics believe that it is impossible for material (<i>homer</i>) to exist without retaining some sort of form (<i>tsura</i>), or <i>homer</i> without <i>tsura</i>. Yet according to the Torah “Hokhma – Wisdom comes forth from nothing (Iyov, 28:12),”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">325</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, the verse reads, “Wisdom, from whence is it found?” Interpreted Kabbalistically, however, the word “from whence” – m’ayin – is understood to refer to the highest sefirah of Keter, also called Ayin, “nothingness”; that is, the Divine “No-thingness” that precedes the creation. It is from here that the sefirah of Hokhmah emerges – m’ayin. In terms of the author’s discussion, Hokhmah is understand to be the pure, formless potential for creation, emanating out of Keter. Thus, it has the potential to hold all opposites, for it is only in Binah that reality attains a level of form and division. (Recall the discussion in the previous chapter, the Ben Zoma perceived the supernal traits only in their root in Binah, where they still maintained their independent forms, and not in Hokhmah, where they were united and absorbed in their root.”)</i> and Binah – Understanding is its form. This is the matter explained above, through which one can well understand the teaching of the Ra’avad. For according to man’s limited understanding, there is neither matter without form, nor form without matter. Either the creation can not exist, or it exists through one of the two, erroneous conjectures provided by the philosopher, quoted by the Ra’avad. However, the man of perfect faith knows that his own intellect and knowledge are entities created by God, and he sees that his own intellectual conception of that which is possible and that which is impossible is only a veil of the limited human consciousness, which was created in order to establish a separation between the lower, human realm and the upper, Godly realm. God is one simple and absolute unity. All perception of division is only a product of the veil of creation.",

The Zohar does not say here that it includes all colors, but that all colors are seen within it. That occurs by means of the veil of separation. For example, when light is pass through a filter, then the form of the filter will determine man’s perception of the light that he sees. If a different filter is moved before the light, the form seen will change in accordance with the color of the new filter. The different appearance only depends on the differences in the veil of separation, yet at the source of the light, there is no change whatsoever. The light is exactly the same. It is further written in the Zohar (Bereshit, 52a): The ocean<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">327</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Again, this is a kabbalistic notion of the source of all emanating from the Infinite.</i> is one. It is the supernal ocean which contains all of the seven days. These seven supernal lights enter into the ocean, striking it, and producing seven sides. Each side divides into seven streams, as it is written (Yeshayahu, 11), “and it struck it, forming seven streams.” Meaning, from the perspective of the ocean, all of the divisions are really one, and only from the division of the streams do we perceive a division in the resulting lights. This passage in the Zohar continues: They emerged from the supernal unity. Just as the ocean receives, so does are the waters divided into these days and lights. All of man’s perceptions and understanding are lower<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">328</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, lower, in the unfolding sequence of worlds.</i> than the division of attributes. Therefore, our understanding is only according to what was allocated from above, as previously explained. So the logical notion that there is neither form without matter nor matter without form is merely a created understanding. Yet above, before the division, whether in time, or in terms of cause and effect, the form is abstract. The division, which is below, receives from the form which is undivided wisdom. It is within the division resulting from the veil that form is changed from a total abstraction to one dressed in garments.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">329</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, human understanding, which “clothes” and conceals the divine realm of Hokhmah, thus perceiving it in its own, relative terms.</i>"

The verse tells us that the One who is not revealed and not known whatsoever rides the heavens. And if you were to assert that He comes and rides in the name Y-ah, then even though He is hidden, in this place He stands to be revealed. However, “Exalt the One who rides the heavens,” He is the Ancient of all the ancients, the Hidden of all the hidden, who is not known. On what does He ride?

Then we find distances, senses, things to be sensed, intellect, and things to be discerned, causes and effects, the necessary, the possible, and the impossible. Yet above the veil, there is no relationship whatsoever between our knowledge and that of the Creator. With this, we may dismiss the whining assertions of the philosophers, for no matter what they say, it is all questions and answers confined within the borders of the human intellect and their own created knowledge. Since the Cause itself is unknowable, one cannot bring a proof about the nature of the Cause from one of its effects.

                "<b>Miracles – Can God Change His Mind?</b> <br> <small> R. Gershon Hanokh returns to the theme of miracles. A miracle is a temporary suspension of the laws of nature, which were themselves set in motion by G-d from the very onset of the creation. Most often, it is in response to an event in the world, such as in order to affect a deliverance (e.g. the splitting of the sea, the sun standing in the sky over Gibon). This sudden shift in G-d’s providential direction suggests that a change occurred in G-d’s will for creation – a spontaneous decision to abrogate one structure of reality for another. However, such a shift raises an important question: was a corresponding change in G-d’s will – a concept axiomatically refuted by the Torah? The author offers an answer, based upon the famous medieval philosopher, the Maharal. His own conclusion, however, is that the very question is faulty, and based only upon our limited, dualistic consciousness. In truth, G-d can both initiate new and miraculous events without altering His eternal and unchanging will at all. Regarding various miraculous events of the past, many Rishonim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">334</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Torah scholars of the Middle Ages.</i> have questioned how such miracles fit into God’s overall plan. </small>",
                "In the Midrash Rabbah (Beshalach) we find the statement, “When God created the world, He made a condition with the sea that it would split when the children of Israel would leave Egypt.” If so, how is this considered a miracle, if it was instilled in the nature of creation? Pirkei D’Rebbi Eliezar (chap. 18) gives numerous examples of miracles that were programmed into the creation from its outset.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">335</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Such as the manna in the desert, the miraculous rock that gave water, the hole in the earth that swallowed Korach and his cohorts. See, also, Pirkei Avot 5:6.</i> For, if it were said that they were not preprogrammed into nature, one could claim that God changed His will.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">336</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, G-d’s deciding to change the order of nature, which He established with the very creation of the world, implies a change in His will or intention in response to events in this world. Yet, G-d’s immutability is an axiom of Jewish faith.</i> The Maharal of Prague discusses this at length in the introduction to his book, <i>Gevurot Hashem</i>, and provides many opinions on this subject. After presenting these opinions, he explains that there are two forms of Divine governance: a natural governance, and a miraculous governance. Both are worked into the general order of Divine governance. The difference is that natural governance is always happening, while miraculous governance is revealed only at the time of the miracle. Furthermore, the order can be changed in response to the recipient. For instance, if the Egyptians had repented, the sea would not have split, even though its splitting was set as a condition in the very fabric of creation. This is because the natural order follows the attribute of God’s judgment, and the miraculous order follows the attribute of God’s mercy. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">337</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Again, the contradiction is, “If God made a condition with the Red Sea that He would create it only if it would split before the Children of Israel at the time of the exodus, then how could the Sages teach us that if the Egyptians had repented at the time, it would not have split?” This is resolved by seeing the splitting as a part of “natural governance,” or God’s judgment, and the revelation of the miracle as part of “miraculous governance,” flowing from God’s mercy. Ironically, the splitting of the sea was not a miracle, since it was preprogrammed in the creation. The miracle would have occurred had the Egyptian soldiers repented, and the sea not split. </i> Because of this, the mode of governance can change according to the status of the receiver. This does not imply any change whatsoever in God’s essence, for no actions can affect any change in His essence.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">338</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As the verse states: “For I am G-d, I do not change” (Malakhi 3:6) Changes in the Divine governance of the world do not indicate a change in God’s essence. </i> In the same passage, the Maharal explains the miracle of the sun standing still for Yehoshua (Yehoshua 10); for the sun was moving and standing still at the same time.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">339</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, the sun stood still in the sky for the Israelites, until they defeated their enemies in battle, while for the rest of the world, it moved through the sky normally.</i> According the natural governance, the sun was moving as usual, and according to “miraculous governance’, it stood still. Two opposites existed in the same event. This is a synopsis of his words, which are correct, and (Mishlei, 24:26) “every man shall kiss the lips of one who gives a true answer.” There are many proofs and real wonders, for with miracles, two opposites can exist simultaneously.",
                "",
                "However, even though all of the Maharal’s words are true. Yet, all of his arguments were proffered only in order to show how there is no change in God’s will when a miracle occurs. One could still assert that God’s knowledge can change, from which it follows that His will also changes. When God arranged the work of creation, it was His will that certain miracles would happen at a definite time in the future. If this plan is delayed in any way, then the primordial will must have changed. Since God programmed into the creation the condition that the sea would split with the Exodus, therefore He knew that it would split, which it eventually did. If so, how could we be taught that the Egyptians could have repented prior to the sea’s splitting, which would have cancelled the order for the sea to split. With this in mind, we also find it difficult to understand the statement of the Talmud (Berachot, 4a, Sotah, 36a), “At the time of Ezra,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">340</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And the nation’s return from the Babylonian exile.</i> the nation of Israel was worthy of experiencing a miracle of the same magnitude that happened in the days of Yehoshua,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">341</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The miracle would have been their entering the land of Israel with a high hand, just as they left Egypt. Rashi.</i> but the prevalence of sin prevented it.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">342</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Instead, they could only return from Babylon by the permission of Cyrus. Rashi.</i> The Gemara explains the verse in the Song of the Sea (Shemot 15:16), “until Your people shall pass over, O God, until they shall pass over...” is alluding to two “passing overs” into the Land – the first in the time of Yehushua, and the second in the time of Ezra. All this leads to conclusion that a miracle was supposed to happen at the time of Ezra, yet God’s will changed. R. Eliyahu Mizrahi, in his commentary on Rashi (Parshat Vayishlach), examines the situation of Yaakov Avinu returning to Israel, and confronting his brother Eisav and his army of four hundred men. The last Yaakov heard from Eisav was that he wanted to kill him, and he assumed, now twenty years later, that this was still true. Thus, the verse says, “and Yaakov was afraid,” on which Rashi comments, “He was afraid that he would be killed.” (The Lechem Mishnah, at the end of the fifth chapter of the Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah, also addresses this issue.) Yaakov was afraid that his own sins may have nullified God’s promise to protect him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">343</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, G-d’s promise, made in Bereshit 28:15: “Behold, I am with you and will protect you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not abandon you until I have done that which I have promised you.\"</i> Furthermore, we have the statement of the sages in the Gemara (Shabbat, 55a), “Rav Acha son of Chanina said: God never once broke His promise of bestowing good, and brought calamity in its stead.” We would have to bend over backwards with forced arguments in order to reconcile this contradiction. Based on the words of the sages, one would seem obliged to concede that God’s will can change. Yet based on all we have explained above, that all human knowledge is a created entity, and the whole order of existence is a created and arranged order, then we can also see that the borders and limits of what may change is also something that was arranged with the creation as an expression of God’s will. It is impossible that it could be only a change of will, for that very conception is no more than a created idea that can only be understood from our own greatly limited human perspective. At the time of the revelation of the miracle, it will be revealed that the miracle could occur even without any change in God’s will. It is the function of the Divine service of the Jew to arrive at this faith and to fix it permanently in his heart. Purely out of faith, man can reach a place above all orders of governance. Then it will be readily apparent that there is no difference between nature and miracles even from the perspective of created beings. "

Human beings can only perceive G-d through His revealed attributes – the post-emanational world of the sefirot or Divine Names (exemplified here by the Sefirah of Tiferet); they cannot perceive him cognitively above that level. This lower, perceptual level is the basis of all our prayers and acts of worship, and it can be understood by all who live on the mundane level, even Pharaoh. The author bases his discussion on the Kabbalistic idea that the Sefirah of Tiferet (also known as <i>Zeir Anpin</i>) lies at the root of Israel’s service of God. It is not, however, the highest level, which can only be accessed via faith (discussed later as being the level of <i>Atika Kadisha</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">345</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the end of Part 1, chapter 18, for a discussion of the levels of Zeir Anpin and Atika.</i> ) </small>",

This is as it is written in the Midrash (Mechilta Yitro 1), “No slave could ever escape from Egypt, because Egypt was filled with all the most powerful of worldly delights, to the point where it was more comfortable to be a slave in Egypt than a lord in another country.” In this way, he ruled over their minds and intellect.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">347</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It may be implied by this that even the Israelites themselves could not that escape from Egypt was possible, or even desirable – their minds and hearts having been so thoroughly enslaved. What they, and Pharaoh, did not realize is that Israel is connect to G-d on a level that transcends the intellect and the natural order - that is the dimension of faith and miracles.</i> For this reason, he asserted that there was no way they could arouse the root of their souls in order to pray to God for deliverance, and as a result, God’s compassion would not be aroused to redeem them. To this, the Zohar responds, “He did not see the other connection – the connection of faith, which rules over all. ” All of the connection between Israel and God is through prayer and Divine service.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">348</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The author refers here to the revealed connection between Israel and G-d; not that of faith, which is concealed to the intellect.</i> And all Divine service and prayer that is within man’s conscious grasp is only within the inclusion and unification of God’s revealed attributes (sefirot), as King David listed them when he said (Divrei HaYamim 1, 29), “Unto You, God, is the greatness, the strength, the splendor, the victory , and the majesty. For all that is in heaven and earth is Yours. Yours, G-d, is the kingdom; and You are exalted over all.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">349</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this verse, King David alludes to the seven lower sefirot, from hesed to yesod: Greatness - hesed; strength - gevurah; , splendor - tiferet; victory - netzah; majesty - Hod; all - Yesod; kingdom - Malkhut.</i> This is explained in the Sifri, on the verse (Devarim, 11), “If you keep all these commandments that I command you to do, to love the Lord, your God, to walk in all His ways, and to cleave to Him.” Is it possible for man to cleave to God? asks the Sifri? Is it not written that God is a consuming fire? But the answer is: You should cleave to God’s attributes. Just as God is merciful, so you should be merciful (and in this way you cleave to Him).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">350</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The author is relying upon an implicit connection between the Divine attributes of loving-kindness, compassion, etc, their human parallels, and the sefirot. The seven lower sefirot are “revealed” – that is, their influence can be felt in the world. When man serves G-d by actualizing these potencies within himself (loving-kindness, mercy), so he clings to the supernal manifestation of these attributes. However, there are worlds far higher than these attributes, to which a human being cannot consciously connect to.</i> Due to man’s limited knowledge, his Divine service only reaches these revealed attributes, which are included under the aegis of Tiferet (splendor), the Sefirah which contains the six lower attributes, which is also called Zeir Anpin (the microprosopus, or the “small face”). This attribute is Israel’s connection,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">351</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tiferet is in the center of the middle column and connects to all of the six lower Sefirot: Hesed is to its upper right; Gevurah, its upper left; Nezah, at the lower right, Hod, at the lower left, and Yesod directly below, on the middle column.</i> for through Tiferet, Israel is called, “my firstborn son Israel” (Shemot, 4:). As it is written in the Zohar (Balak, 191b): The secret of the matter is the secret above, “What is his name and what is his son’s name that I should know him?” (Mishlei, 30:4). His name is known, and it is Hashem Tziva’ot (the Lord of Hosts). His son’s name is Israel, as it is written, “My firstborn son Israel.” All of the keys of faith depend on Israel, who takes pride in this and says (Tehillim, 2), “God said to me, you are My son.” It is certainly like this, in that Abba and Imma<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">352</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Father and Mother” – the supernal constellations of sefirot that correspond to Hokhmah and Binah.</i> crowned their son and blessed him with many blessings, telling him and commanding him for everything. They kissed their son’s hand, as it were, and gave him dominion over all, that all should serve him. It is also written in the Zohar (Yitro, 79a), And how does the verse end? “What is his name and what is his son’s name that I should know him?” He told him the secret of this matter. It is written, “My firstborn son Israel,” and it is written (Yeshayahu), “Israel, I shall pride Myself in you.” His name is Hokhmah (wisdom), and His son’s name is Tiferet (Adornment, Pride).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">353</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here, the Zohar links the supernal persona of Israel to the sefirah of Tiferet, which is connected to Hokhmah, a higher sefirah, representing the Divine. </i> ",

This is referred to in the Gemara (Megilah, 25a): A certain man went to lead the prayer service in the presence of Rabbi Hanina and said, “The great, the mighty, the awesome, the majestic, the strong, the powerful God.” Rabbi Hanina said to him: Have you finished the praises of your Master? Even the first three terms of praise<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">355</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Amidah prayer begins: “Blessed are You, our G-d and G-d of our forefathers… the great, mighty and awesome G-d,” based upon Moshe’s words in Devarim 10:17. </i> could not be recited, had not Moshe wrote them in the Torah (Devarim, 10:17) and the Men of the Great Assembly came and ordained them (see Nehemia, 9:32), we could not say them.

In another moment God may illuminate to you an understanding of awesome heights thoroughly beyond your present perception, as incomparable as gold is to silver. Thus, Rabbi Hanina said to him, “Even the first three terms of praise could not be recited, had not Moshe wrote them in the Torah.” Meaning, that which is written in the Torah contains the entire creation. This is akin to what we quoted from the Zohar as an introduction (see section 4, Zohar Yitro). “And the Men of the Great Assembly came and established them in the prayer,” which means that they clarified the fact that these three attributes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">357</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Great, mighty, and Awesome” or Hesed, Gevurah and Tiferet.

Then Yirmiyahu and omitted the attribute, ‘Awesome.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">358</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Yermiyahu 32:18, “…You are the great and mighty God.”</i> Daniel omitted the word ‘Mighty.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">359</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Daniel 9:4, “O Lord, you are a great and awesome God.”</i> But they returned the crown of Divine attributes to its ancient completeness.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">360</sup><i class=\"footnote\">By opening the Amidah prayer with all three attributes mentioned by Moshe.</i> They made it clear that these were truly His attributes of might, and these were truly His attributes of Awe.

They are all included in the attribute of Zeir Anpin, also called Tiferet Yisrael (the splendor of Israel). Even though there are attributes far loftier than these, yet prayer can only be directed to the place where man’s mind can reach. This is why Yermiyahu and Daniel omitted certain attributes. Since they knew that G-d was true, they mentioned only the attributes that God revealed to them in their prophetic experience.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">362</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Talmud, they removed these terms of praise after witnessing the destruction of Jerusalem. At that point, they could no longer perceive G-d’s might and awesomeness.</i> However, in the time of the members of the Great Assembly, who had already seen God’s great salvations in the Purim miracle, they identified that these were indeed God’s mighty actions, and these where truly God’s awesome deeds. In this way they restored the crown of God’s attributes to the way it was first perceived by Moshe. Indeed, from this we see that the act of prayer is the mystery of Zeir Anpin, since all of God’s attributes are rooted in God’s great name YHVH, which is the same as the Sefirah of Tiferet<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">363</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tiferet refers to a single sefirah; Zeir Anpin refers to the entire six-sefirah unit from Hesed to Yesod.

We learn from the Zohar (Vayikra, 10b): All is built from Yud Hei… He is the King to whom all Peace is His, in the mystery of Tiferet.

Accordingly, a person should not pray for a miracle to occur, since miracles transcend nature, and also originate in that place which is beyond human cognition. To pray for a miracle is to “burden G-d,” who must acquiesce to change the very laws of nature that He himself put into effect. However, this all applies only to a person whose perception is itself limited to the natural world. For someone with perfect faith in G-d’s all-embracing providence, there is no difference between a natural occurrence and a transcendent one. Thus he can pray for a miracle, since, in his eyes, even the most mundane actions are under G-d’s total providence, and no less miraculous. </small>",
                "When one prays to God in the mystery of Zeir Anpin (Tiferet), one is not praying to any particular Divine attribute, but only to God in His essence, as the root of all of His attributes. For even though the name YHVH is the root of all of God’s attributes, their garments are other names of God. In Tiferet, however, both the inner aspect and the outer garment are the name YHVH.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">367</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meaning to say, the Tetragrammaton – YHVH – is considered to be the Divine Name closest to G-d’s essence, as it’s meaning is “constant and eternal being.” Being essential, it lies at the heart of all other Divine names, like the soul rests within the body. Other Names of G-d represent various aspects of Divine manifestation, though not essence itself. Each Divine Name is associated with a different sefirah, with the Tetragrammaton being associated with the sefirah of Tiferet. Thus the author writes: “In Tiferet… the root (YHVH) and the garment (the Name YHVH) are one.” However, as he continues to explain, even this manifestation of G-d’s essence still only follows human perception. The essence of G-d transcends all mortal cognition, and thus manifests itself in the miraculous. </i> The root and the garment are one in the mystery of Zeir Anpin. Thus, all prayer is directed to the spiritual place where the Holy One, blessed be He, is called Zeir Anpin and the name YHVH. However, man cannot comprehend the levels of Divine providence and governance above Tiferet Yisrael.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">368</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The sefirah of Tiferet/Zeir Anpin.</i> For this reason we do not pray for miracles, for the source of miracles is in a place beyond man’s ability to comprehend.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">369</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As in the previous chapter, in which it was explained that one can only praise G-d using those epithets instituted by Moshe (such as, “the great, mighty and awesome G-d”), since only these are truly graspable to the consciousness.</i> Since man is a part of nature and the natural order of things, and cannot see how the salvation could come from the place beyond his ability to perceive, he is not supposed to direct his prayer to this place. Directing prayer to the source of miracles is considered a “burden for Heaven.” This is as it is said in the Gemara (Ta’anit, 24b), “Who dares to be such a burden on Heaven,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">370</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Once a certain man was sentenced to death by the court of Rava, for having had intercourse with a gentile woman. The punishment was carried out, and the man died. The matter reached the ears of King Shapur (CE 309-379), who sought to punish Rava. Whereupon Ifra Hormuzd, the king’s mother, said to her son, “Do not interfere with the Jews, because whatever they ask of their God He grants them.” The king asked her for an example. She said that when they pray for rain, it falls. He answered that this is not unusual because the prayers for rain are recited in the rainy season. Rather, he said, let them pray for rain in summer. She sent a message to Rava: “Concentrate and pray for rain.” He prayed, but it did nor rain. He then exclaimed: “Master of the Universe, ‘we have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us; a work You did in their days, in the days of old’ (Tehillim 40:2) But as for us, we have not seen it with our eyes.” Whereupon there followed such a heavy rain that the gutters of Mahuza emptied their waters into the Tigris. Rava’s father then appeared unto him in a dream and said to him, “Is there anyone who dares to be such a burden on Heaven? Change the place where you sleep.” (It is the belief that if one changes his place, his fortunes will also change) He changed his place and next morning discovered that his bed had been cut with knives.</i> referring to the story of Rava, who prayed for rain in the dry season. Yet still, we find the story of Rav Hanina be Dosa who prayed for miracles (Ta’anit, 25a), and indeed there are several instances where sages in the Talmud prayed for miracles and miraculous changes in nature. As Antoninus said to Rabi (Rav Yehuda HaNasi, Avoda Zara, 10b), “I know that even the least among the Jews can revive the dead.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">371</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi, second century sage and redactor of the Mishnah, was personal friends with the Roman Emperor, Antoninus, and the two held regular, private study sessions. At every such meeting, Antoninus would kill the slave who accompanied him, so that his friendship with Rabbi Yehudah would remain a secret. On one occasion, R. Haninah b. Hama was present when Antoninus arrived, and was asked to leave the room. Outside, he unexpectedly found the slave dead on the floor. Not knowing how to react, he prayed that the man return to life, which happened. When Antoninus saw this, he remarked: “I know that even the smallest among you can revive the dead.”</i> The difference is that the miracle of Rava occurred in public.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">372</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And, furthermore he was in a dangerous situation.</i> Now I will explain why this is exceptional.",

                "Praying for a miracle is only a burden for God when it is done publicly, in front of someone who lacks faith. From God’s perspective, there really is no difference between natural and miraculous governance. God constantly rules over nature, and recreates the world each and every day. It is just that God concealed His governance in nature in order that one would not see how the glory of His sovereignty rules over it. In the language of the Zohar, this attribute is called, “having no eyes” (Mishpatim, 95a). The Gemara explains this by means of a parable (Avoda Zara, 54b): “Suppose a man stole a measure of wheat and sowed it in the ground; it is right that it should not grow;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">373</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since it was acquired illegally, one would not expect G-d to help it grow, yet G-d does; thus, giving priority to the natural world over miraculous intervention. See Rashi on Bereshis 7:4, who states that the people of Noah’s time “burdened G-d” by making Him form fetuses that were conceived through adulterous relationships. See next note.</i> however, the world pursues its natural course and as for the fools who act wrongly, they will have to render an account before God.” Study this matter carefully.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">374</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our Rabbis taught: Philosophers asked the elder Sages in Rome, “If your God has no desire for idolatry, why does He not abolish it?” They replied, “If people worshipped something that the world did not need, He would abolish it. However, people worship the sun, moon, stars and planets. Should He destroy the universe on account of fools! The world follows its natural course, and as for the fools who act wrongly, they will have to render an account [on the Day of Judgment]. Another illustration: Suppose a man stole a measure of wheat and sowed it in the ground; it is right that it should not grow, but the world pursues its natural course and as for the fools who act wrongly, they will have to render an account. Another illustration: Suppose a man has intercourse with his neighbor’s wife; it is right that she should not conceive, but the world pursues its natural course and as for the fools who act wrongly, they will have to render an account.” This is similar to what R. Simeon b. Lakish said, “The Holy One, blessed be He, declared, It is not enough that the wicked put My coinage to vulgar use, but they also trouble Me and compel Me to set My seal upon it!”</i> The whole purpose of letting the world run according to its natural course and not subverting nature every time someone violates the Divine order of justice is to give man the choice to serve God, for serving God in the darkness, out of his own free will, is all the more valuable. This is as it is written in the Zohar (Tetsave, 184a): “Man only serves God through the darkness.” For this reason, G-d concealed His governance so that man cannot see how He rules the world. If God’s governance were totally revealed, man’s free choice would be nullified. Therefore, a person who believes, with perfect faith in God, that nature also runs according to God’s governance, and fixes this faith permanently in his heart, believing and knowing that when a fire is lit it only happens according to specific Divine providence, such a person presents no burden before God whatsoever. (And, as we explained in the introduction, a person with complete faith in God’s providence experiences this providence in everything that happens.) This is as it Rav Hanina ben Dosa said, “The One who causes oil to burn can make vinegar burn.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">375</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One Friday eve, Rav Chanina ben Dosa noticed that his daughter was sad and asked her why. She answered, “My oilcan got mixed up with my vinegar can and I kindled of it the Shabbat light.” He said to her, “My daughter, why should this trouble you? He who had commanded the oil to burn will also command the vinegar to burn.” Tradition has it that the light burned the entire day, until they took from it flame for havdalah (Saturday night).</i> Rav Hanina ben Dosa could say this, and experience the miracle of the vinegar burning for the whole Shabbat, without placing a burden upon Heaven.",

But for a miracle to be shown to the general public, like the story about Rava praying for rain in Ta’anit 24b, including those who have not fixed perfect faith in their hearts and who look at nature as running according to its own order, then miraculous governance is indeed a burden before God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">376</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For G-d must change the natural order, which He originally put into place in order to grant human beings free will.</i> Thus, it is forbidden to pray for a change in nature, as this requires a revelation of supernal governance which is above man’s intellectual grasp. On this, the Zohar of the miracle that happened in Egypt<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">377</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Zohar here specifically discusses the splitting of the Red Sea.</i> (Terumah, 170b): “It was difficult for God.” Why was it difficult? Because the miracle in Egypt happened before both believers and nonbelievers alike. It was good for the believers and bad for the nonbelievers, as was explained in the introduction to the subject of miracles. There was a revelation of the level of God’s governance beyond man’s intellectual grasp. Pharaoh did not know of the connection between God and Israel, from which Divine salvation can be aroused, as it exists beyond the grasp of the mortal mind. This is mentioned above, in chapter 12 (Zohar Beshalach 52b), “Pharaoh didn’t see that there was another connection, the connection of faith, which rules over all.” The Zohar calls this kind of connection, “the connection of faith,” because the main kind of connection between Israel and God is through <i>emunah</i> (faith) which reaches beyond the grasp of the human mind. <i>Emunah</i> is the inner aspect, even though it is not dressed in a garment. In the merit of <i>emunah</i>, Israel is worthy of receiving God’s salvation, even though they have no clear good deeds on record. The clear statement of this is written in the Torah where it says (Shemot, 4:32), “And the people believed and they heard.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">378</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a foreshadowing of the famous statement of the Jewish people before the giving of the Torah (Shemot 24:7), “We will do, and we will hear (understand)”; meaning to say, the children of Israel had so much faith in God that they accepted the laws of the Torah even before understanding their meaning. </i>"

In other words, his rectified perception of the world – that everything follows the Divine command – can actual cause an alteration in the laws of nature. Thus, the faith of the Jewish people in actually caused the sea to split after they left Egypt. In addition, the greater a person’s faith and the clearer his perception, the more radical the miracles can be. Moshe, for instance, performed miracles that totally uprooted the laws of nature. Prophets with lesser vision, such as Elisha, could only alter nature’s laws for their benefit. </small>",
                "With the splitting of the Red Sea, it is written, “and [the people] believed in God and in Moshe, His servant.” This is as it is written in the Zohar (Beshalach, 53b): It is written, “and they believed in God and in Moshe, His servant.” Did they not believe in God until now? We find that when Moshe first told of the redemption to the children of Israel, the verse says (Shemot, 4:21), “And the people believed; and when they heard that the God had remembered the people of Israel… they bowed their heads and prayed.” Furthermore, they must have believed after witnessing all of the mighty acts God did in Egypt. If so, what does it mean when the Red Sea split that the Torah says, “and they believed?” [The difference is that here] God told them (Shemot, 14:13), “Do not fear, stand still, and see the salvation of the God which He will show to you today.” … Rabbi Yeisa asked, “It is written (ibid, 14:13), ‘Do not fear, stand still… for the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you shall not see again forever (<i>ad olam</i>),’ and it is also written (ibid. 14:30), ‘And Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">379</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, there is a contradiction in the verses. In verse 14:13, Moshe promises the Jewish people that they will never see the Egyptians again, yet verse 14:30 states that they did see them again, albeit dead on the shore. (In the original Zohar passage, verse 30 is cited before verse 13. The order is reversed here for greater clarity.)</i> Rabbi Yossi said, “In the second verse, they saw them dead.” Rabbi Yeisa said, “If so, the verse should have said, ‘you shall not see them again <i>alive</i>.’” Rabbi Abba said, “You have asked a good question, but come and see. It is written (Divrei HaYamim 1, 16:36), “Blessed is God forever and ever’ – ‘<i>min ha-olam ve’ad ha-olam</i>,’ which could also mean, ‘from the world to the world.’ On this we are taught, there is a world above, and a world below. ‘The world above,’ is the place from which the candle is first lit. ‘The world below,’ is the completion, which includes everything.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">380</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The “world below” refers to the sefirah of Malkhut (“Sovereignty”), which is the last of the ten sefirot. Positioned directly above our material world, Malkhut receives all the spiritual light and energy from the upper worlds, and transmits it to us. </i> From ‘the world below,’ God’s mighty acts wake up for the denizens of the lower realm.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">381</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Malkhut, being feminine, is also a world of dinim – strict judgments.</i> In this lower world, God does wonders for Israel, bringing about a miracle. When this [lower] world is aroused to perform miracles, it had the effect of drowning all of the Egyptians, and produced a miracle for Israel with the splitting of the Red Sea. For this reason it is said, you shall not see them again forever– <i>ad olam</i>. That is to say, “until the world which is below is aroused’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">382</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, Rabbi Abba interprets the verse’s use of the word “forever” as an allusion to the upper words, reading ad olam – (“forever”) as ad d’itar hahu olam – “until that world (Malkhut) is aroused” to destroy the Egyptians.</i> and they are delivered into the hands of its judgment. And since they are given over to it to be judged, it is written, ‘And Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the sea shore’ as it is written “<i>min ha-olam v’ad ha-olam</i>” – from the time the lower world is awoken. This is the meaning of, ‘And they believed in God and in Moshe, his servant.’” The children of Israel believed, in the beginning of Moshe mission, as it is written, “and the people believed.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">383</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even though the statement “and they believed” refers to the Israelites immediately after the splitting of the sea, that Zohar also applies it retroactively to the belief of the Israelites after meeting Moses and learning of G-d’s intention to redeem them from Egypt (Mtok M’dvash).</i> The faith was fixed in their hearts, and through their faith they connected to God. Their faith aroused God’s salvation in a place beyond all human understanding. This is the meaning of the statement in Parshat Beshalach, at the splitting of the Red Sea, “and they believed in God and in Moshe, His servant.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">384</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is an ironic rereading of the verses. The straightforward meaning is that the Jewish people believed more in G-d after they passed through the sea. According to R. Gershon Hanokh, it was their faith in G-d that actually caused the sea to split, as faith reaches a level above the laws of nature.</i> This is as it is written in the passage in the Zohar above, that they clearly saw the revelation of the supernal light.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">385</sup><i class=\"footnote\">During the splitting of the sea.</i> It was from this place that miracles happened for the Jews and defeat for the Egyptians, to the point where their entire redemption was miraculous. This is because miracles are the revelation of the Supernal light far above any revealed governance.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">386</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, the way G-d runs the world through the revealed elements of creation.</i> This is as it is written in the Zohar (Beshalach, 54a): “Then Moshe and the children of Israel sang this song to God.” Rabbi Abba opened and said: I looked into all of the praises sung to God and saw that they all started with, “<i>az</i> (then).” “<i>Az</i> – Then Israel sang.” (Bamidbar, 21); “<i>Az</i> – Then Yehoshua spoke” (Yehoshua 10); “<i>Az</i> – Then Shlomo said” (Melachim 1, 8). Why is this? It is taught that with all of the miracles and mighty actions are performed for Israel, when the light of <i>Atika Kadisha</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">387</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Atika, or Atikia Kaddisha (the “Holy, Ancient One”) is one of the highest levels of reality, in the order of the supernal worlds.

When we say that miracles happen from a place that is above man’s ability to comprehend, we call this the light of “<i>Atika Kadisha</i>.” When this light illuminates and breaks through the border of man’s understanding and enclothes itself in a lower garment, then the governance of the supernal light is revealed in the world, and we can clearly see miracles.",

                "Truly, from God’s perspective, natural governance is actually miraculous governance, in that God’s providence and governance extends to every detail of creation. The recognition of this governance is from man’s understanding, so that he sees only how the world runs according to nature. However, God relates to the man of perfect faith with individual providence. According to this, if one believes that all of creation runs miraculously, then hidden miracles will be revealed before him, for he views even nature’s law as miraculous. Whereas for a person who does not believe, the miracles will remain hidden. With this in mind, we can see that it was easy for Rabbi Hanina ben Dosa to pray, “May the One who makes the oil burn make the vinegar burn.” He saw how the natural phenomenon of the combustion of oil only happens due to God’s command, and for this reason his prayer was effective. Through faith, man can even arouse the supernal governance to reveal itself in this world. This is as the Zohar states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">388</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I n the previous quote from Parshat Beshalach.</i> that since Israel believed in God, they managed to awaken revealed miracles before the Egyptians. When a person witnesses such miracles, he then sees how two complete opposites can happen at once, as was explained previously. When man is confronted with the impossibility of the simultaneous occurrence of opposites, it is due to the concealment of nature. In fact, God established creation’s normative perception to be through natural governance. However, God fixed permanent faith within the innermost heart of <i>Knesset Yisrael </i>– the Community of Israel – so by means of this faith they may connect to God even above natural governance. This is as it is written in the Zohar (Tikkun 21, 57b): “He is her nurse (<i>oman</i>), and she is His faith (<i>emunah</i>).”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">389</sup><i class=\"footnote\">אומן, artist, is the same letters as אמונה, faith.</i> This is explained in the <i>Mei HaShiloach</i>, Parshat Bereshit, on the passage in the Midrash Rabbah: Rabbi Hoshayah began and said (Mishlei, 8:30), “I was a nurse (<i>amon</i>) for him, and I was his delight every day.” <i>Amon</i> means a teacher, <i>amon</i> means covered, <i>amon</i> means hidden. There are those who say, <i>amon</i> means the capitol, <i>amon</i> means artist. According to Rav Mordechai Yosef, this Midrash tells of the development of man’s form from its very first root, hidden in God’s essence, until its revelation in a complete and mature state, signified by man’s ability to reproduce and bring forth a new generation. This process precisely follows the way God created the world. The world was initially hidden in God’s essence, and then emerged in a revealed form where the supernal light breaks forth in every new being. The Zohar says (Terumah, 170b), “This is why man finding a mate is as difficult as the splitting of the Red Sea.” Both cases entail the simultaneous occurrence of opposites.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">390</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In both cases the miraculous governance is happening within the natural order. </i> All this occurs at the root of faith, for from God’s perspective, He is the “nurse” of creation, yet from the side of Knesset Yisrael, the matter depends upon faith. A nurse must provide for everything the child needs at all times. For the nurse, everything must be ready, even though the child, with his limited knowledge, does not really know what he will need. For this reason, he must always have faith that the nurse will provide him with whatever he will need. This kind of faith is the connection between the nurse and the infant. For the infant, it is a kind of connection above his ability to comprehend. In this way, we see that <i>emunah</i> in the heart can reach beyond man’s intellectual comprehension and awaken God’s will to open the supernal light, which is beyond time or any border in nature. This relates to the teaching that the redemption from Egypt happened before its proscribed time. God, so to speak, caused His power of redemption act, even though the Children of Israel were not yet ready, as it is written (Shir HaShirim 2:8), “The voice of my beloved! Behold, He comes, leaping over the mountains, skipping over the hills.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">391</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meaning to say, the redemption “skipped” over the natural unfolding of events, which would have demanded the Jewish people to stay slaves in Egypt for two centuries more.</i> The Zohar (Parshat Noah, 61b) also says that the redemption from Egypt happened before its time. So too, the wars fought by Israel in the days of Yehoshafat were also miraculously before their time. We find that the miracle in Egypt was brought about by a cry from the depth of the heart. The Zohar (Shemot, 20b) says that the when the Hebrew word “<i>za’aka</i> – cry” is used, it means that it is coming directly from the heart, as it says in Eicha (2:18), “Their hearts cried out to God.” Such cries are closer to God than prayers. Purely by means of <i>emunah</i> in the heart, as explained above, a person can come before God through the heart’s cries, even though he cannot offer any intelligible prayer. He cannot dress the sorrow of his heart in the letters and words of the prayer, as he cannot find the strength to pray. In this way he can wake up God’s highest will, solely through faith flowing from the depth of his heart. We find it written of Yehoshafat (Divrei HaYamim 2, 20:3), “And Yehoshafat was afraid, and he went to ask God, and called upon all the inhabitants of Yehuda to fast.” He said to God, “we have no power before this great multitude which has set upon us, we do not know what to do, our eyes are only upon You.” And indeed, he was answered by Yahaziel’s prophecy (ibid 20:15), “Do not be afraid of this great multitude, for this battle is not yours, but God’s. You shall not need to fight this battle. Stand still, and witness the salvation of God with you.” And after this, “Yehoshafat stood and said, Hear me, inhabitants of Yehuda and Jerusalem, Believe in Hashem your God. So shall you be established. Believe in His prophets and you shall prosper.” Here we see that the miracle happened due to a great overpowering of <i>emunah</i>. It was then that they saw above nature, as the story continues, “And the people of Yehuda went to the lookout over the desert and turned to the multitude of their enemies, and behold, their carcasses were falling to the ground and they had none to rescue them.” When man prepares faith in his heart, he can effect miracles through his service of God, for the power to make miracles comes from a great surge of service in the depths of the heart. This is as it is said in the Gemara (Megillah, 27a), “All of the wonders that Elisha accomplished, were done through prayer.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">392</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note that earlier, in chapter 13, the author said that it is forbidden to pray for miracles, inasmuch as prayer can only reach the dimension that we can grasp, whereas miracles originate from a higher place. Perhaps he means here that it was not the prayers themselves that produced the miracle, but the faith in G-d underlying the prayers; for faith, emunah, transcends the borders of our limited perception. Alternatively (as we will shortly see), Elisha’s prayers did not effect a total transformation of nature, since his perception of G-d was not as clear as that of Moshe or certain other prophets. Thus, G-d performed miracles for him through the nature order, and not above it.</i>",
                "",
                "Indeed, we find various distinctions and levels in the miracles performed by various prophets and their awakenings, based upon the level to which they prepared their souls. The miracles performed by Moshe could actually transform things to their very opposite, as the Midrash teaches us (Beshalach), “‘And God showed him a tree’ (Shemot, 15:25). It was a bitter branch, and the bitter sweetened the bitter.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">393</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shortly after passing through the sea, the Children of Israel camped at an oasis called Marah – named so because its waters were bitter and undrinkable. G-d told Moshe to throw a tree into the waters, to sweeten them. According to the Midrash, this tree was itself bitter.</i> So too with the brass serpent, which healed the snakebites.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">394</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Numbers 21, the Children of Israel complain unnecessarily about the hardship of their travels. G-d is angered, and sends poisonous serpents to bite them. The people repent, and G-d commands Moses to forge a snake made of brass, and place it atop a pole. Whoever was bitten by a snake, yet looked upon the brass snake, would be healed. Again, that which kills and that which heals is the same.</i> Also with the splitting of the Red Sea, where the waters congealed against the laws of nature, where (Shemot 15:8), “the depths congealed in the heart of the sea.” This, too, also an example of opposites, because water usually begins to freeze at the surface, and here it began in the middle of the sea, which, according to nature, would be the last place to freeze. The miracle of the splitting of the sea happened in the exact opposite way nature would have had it. Thus, with all of Moshe’s miracles, things were changed to their complete opposite. Moshe’s level of prophecy was greater than all of the other prophets, for he would see the Divine form at once. This is written in the Midrash Tanhuma (Hayei Sara) and in the Tikkunei Zohar (Tikkun 18, 32a).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">395</sup><i class=\"footnote\">God has no form. However, prophets receive their prophecy through a vision of the Divine body. All of the other prophets would behold a vision of a part of the Divine body. Moshe differed, in that he could see the King in His entirety. </i> Therefore the miracles associated with him would change a thing over to its complete opposite. Similarly, with Yeshayahu, we find a miracle within a miracle, and the transformation of one thing to its complete opposite. As he said (38:21), “Take a lump of figs, and smear it on the boil, and he shall recover.” The Midrash tells us that it is the nature of figs to cause the wound to rot. Yeshayahu knew that this would have the opposite effect. This is because Yeshayahu’s prophecy had an aspect of Moshe’s prophecy. It is said in the Midrash on Tehillim (90), “Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rav Yossi ben Zimra, all of the prophets would prophesize, and not be conscious of their prophecy. This was not so for Moshe and Yeshayahu. Moshe said (Devarim, 32), ‘My doctrine shall drop as the rain.’ And Yeshayahu said (Yeshayahu, 8:18), ‘Behold, I and the children whom God has given me are for signs and tokens in Israel from the Lord of Hosts who dwells in mount Zion.’ Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Yossi, even Shmuel, the master of prophets, would speak prophecy, and not know what prophecy he was speaking. This is as it is said (Shmuel 1, 12), ‘And God sent you Yeruval and Badan and Yiftah and Shmuel.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">396</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He was speaking to the people, and as he was not aware of what he was saying, he said, “Shmuel,” instead of “me.”</i> This is because he was not aware that he was speaking.” On the other hand, the miracles performed by Elisha occurred mostly through an awakening of salvation through prayer. That is, his miracles were answers to his prayer. Most of them were effected through hints contained in his prayer to heal the waters of Yericho, as he said (Melachim 2, 2), “Bring me a new bowl and put salt in it.” As it is said in the tractate Berachot, “Just as salt will sweeten meat, so will it sweeten water.” Elisha also said (Melachim 2, 4), “Take flour and put it in the bowl.” He was praying, “God who said flour will be man’s food, so shall He say that these fields will bring forth food.” And also (Melachim 2, 6), when one of the sons of the prophets lost his axe in the river, Elisha cut down a branch and threw it in the river. His prayer was, “The one who said wood floats can also tell the iron to float.” For Elisha to perform various miracles at various times, he had to prepare his heart for each situation. In this way, he was showing how God’s miraculous governance is hidden within nature.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">397</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The implication is that because Elisha’s prophecy was on a lesser, more concealed level than Moshe’s, his prayers did not achieve a total uprooting of nature, but merely an extension of natural laws.</i>",
                "",
                "There are many other miracles that happened through natural governance. The Tikkunei Zohar cites the Purim miracle as one of these. When a miracle happens through nature, it is hidden in the Divine Sefirot of Netzah (Victory) and Hod (Majesty).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">398</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Netzah and Hod, toward the bottom of the sefirotic chart, represents the last stages through which the Divine effluence passes before it is brought into the world below, through the union of Yesod and Malkhut. It is said that prophets draw their prophecy from these sefirot. </i> The entire Purim story happens within the confines of the natural order. The execution of Vashti, Ester’s rise to power, Ester’s notifying the king of the assassination plot – all these are events which happened in the realm of nature, as we normally see it. Yet after one considers the course of all of these events as they lead into each other, it all becomes one great miracle. In retrospect, one sees how God’s directed each event and it all was a part of his miraculous plan. While each event was happening, the miracle was hidden, yet at the end, the miracle was revealed. This is as it is said in the Talmud (Megillah, 11a), “When do we see the realization of the words of the psalm (98:3), ‘All of the corners of the earth have seen God’s salvation?’ We see it in the days of Mordekhai and Ester.” In this case, we must consider all of the events afterward, in order to behold God’s miracle. After all is over, we see how God directed all of the nations, even beyond their comprehension. However, in the middle of it all, everything appears to be happening according to the natural order."

Thus, they are forever ready to pray for things that are beyond mortal grasp. </small>",
                "The Zohar in Parshat Nasso (130a) speaks of the revelation of the supernal light called <i>Atika Kadisha</i>, which is alluded to in the Torah but once. The Zohar says: The name of <i>Atika</i>, the Ancient One, is hidden from all, and only mentioned in the Torah once. At the end of the <i>Akeida</i> (the binding of <i>Yitzhak</i>), we find that the Divine persona of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> makes an oath to Avraham, where it says, “<i>Bi nishba’ati, n’oom Hashem</i> – I swear on Me, says God.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">399</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Zohar always reads the various names of G-d as referring to different spiritual worlds, such as sefirot and partzufim. The name Hashem – the Tetragrammaton – is understood to refer to the partzuf of Zeir Anpin, where as the word bi – “I swear on Me,” refers to Atika Kadisha.</i> Here, <i>Zeir Anpin</i> is swearing on the higher <i>partsuf</i> of <i>Atika Kadisha</i>. The revelation of the light of Atika is explained in the Zoharic explanation of the <i>Akeida</i> in Parshat Vayeira, on this verse. God had told Avraham to offer his son as a sacrifice. However, it was a vague statement, which could have been interpreted either as “slaughter him,” or simply, “bind him on an altar like a sacrifice, but do not kill him.” Up until the point where the angel tells Avraham, “do not stretch forth your hand against the boy,” the command to offer Yitzhak as a sacrifice meant to slaughter him. At the very moment the angel said, “do not stretch forth your hand,” there occurred a revelation of the Supernal light, reaching from a place beyond all borders.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">400</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The author seems to be suggesting that the change in G-d’s commandment to Avraham – from slaughtering Yitzchak to merely offering him – was in the nature ofa miracle, in that it resulted from the emanation of a light that transcended the intellect. Other chasidic thinkers have pointed out that the entire test of the Akeida transcended the intellect. G-d had earlier promised Avraham “through Yitzchak, your descendants will carry on your name. (Bereshis, 21:12). Yet now, G-d commands to kill him. The test, for Avraham, was believing that somehow both could be true.</i> This light then remained permanently with Yitzhak and his descendents. Truly Yitzhak is an “<i>olah temima</i> (a wholly offered and unblemished sacrifice).” This happened after he and Avraham wholeheartedly decided to sacrifice him as an <i>olah</i>. All of Yitzhak’s life is contained in the Divine utterance spoken to Avraham, “Do not stretch forth your hand against the boy.” From this moment on, it was permanently established that his progeny would all be ready and willing to receive this light at any moment that they need it. This is discussed at length in the Zoharic explanation of the <i>Akeida</i>. This is possible when man actively fixes <i>emunah</i> in his heart, and it is through this <i>emunah </i>that he may connect to God in a place beyond his comprehension. This being so, it follows that such a heart will have the power to pray, even when those prayers defy nature. From the Akeida on, the seed of Yitzhak contains a willingness to be drawn after God’s will on the level of being an <i>olah temima</i>. Because of this, he can awake God’s will to clearly show him and let him understand realms and levels beyond his ability to see or comprehend."

Logical contradictions exist only in the former instance, whereas with the revelation of a miracle, it becomes clear that even strict opposites can exist simultaneously. An example of this was the dedication of the Holy Temple, when the laws of nature were suspended, and two things occupied the same space, at the same time. </small>",
                "It was explained above that miracles have been programmed into nature from the creation of the world. Now, you may ask, “How can a person arrive at a place above the natural order revealed in the world?” It all depends upon one’s service of God and upon one’s faith. If one’s service and faith are strong, he can ascend to a place above the system of governance, and draw down a transcendent light that can be fixed within the mind’s grasp.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">401</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Similar to the revelation that occurred at Akeidat Yitzchak, discussed in the preceding chapter.</i> If he makes the absolute most of his Divine service and faith, then the supernal light will be revealed and fixed within the system of revealed governance.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">402</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to this (and as explained previously), faith changes the very nature of a person’s perception of reality (a phenomenological shift), so that even the mundane is perceived as miraculous. This, in turn, allows for actual (ontological) changes in the nature of reality itself; i.e. the occurrence of an actual miracle. </i> Then it will be explicitly revealed that this was the way God had originally conceived it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">403</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Ala be’makhsava” – literally, “ascended in His thought.” Meaning, the person will see that the miraculous occurrence did not entail a change in the natural order, but was always part of G-d’s primordial plan for the world.</i> However, if a person does not prepare his heart, he will remain under the influence of the revealed order of nature. This is the meaning of the Gemara’s statement (Sotah, 36a), “The Jews in the days of Ezra were worthy of witnessing miracles the magnitude of those seen in the days of Yehoshua, yet their sins prevented it.” Instead of revealed miracles, they experienced hidden miracles. That is to say, miracles that occurred through natural processes and a series of everyday events: The Jews found favor in the eyes of King Korash (Cyrus), and he commanded them to build the Holy Temple. However, had they not sinned, they would have witnessed revealed miracles instead. So too, with all miracles, they depend upon the worthiness of the one receiving them, and to that same degree is the miracle proclaimed in the world. We explained this in our introduction to miracles, with the discussion of the splitting of the Red Sea. Similarly, the miracles performed for the Tanaim and Amoraim.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">404</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Early and later sages in the Talmud.</i> Some were worthy of experiencing only private miracles; however, the more the miracle worker prepared his heart, the more the miracle was experienced and revealed in the world at large.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">405</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This seems to be a contradiction to what the author said earlier, that one cannot reveal miracles before an unenlightened public.</i> This is as Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai said in the Idra Zuta (289b), “By God’s knowledge the depths were split” (Mishlei 3:20), and filled all of the chambers and passageways of the body, as it is written (Mishlei 24:4), “And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled.” These lights shine from the supernal hidden brain, which illuminates the <i>mazal</i> (<i>Atika Kadisha</i>), and they all depend on each other, and connect to one another, until it is known that they are all one. They are all <i>Atika</i>, the Ancient, and are not at all separate from him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">406</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This means that everything is seen from the perspective of Atika, which transcends nature.</i>",

Then, it is clear that there are no contradictions or opposites, and even things which seem contradictory only appear to be so because we have been apportioned a limited intellect, based upon the lower level of governance. Yet, when the supernal governance is revealed, all who witness the miracle understand that there is no change in God’s will to allow for the miracle, for that which appears to us to be a change in God’s will is only due to the created knowledge which is allocated to us, and subservient to the boundaries of time and place. But in the place where the past, future, and present unite, one cannot say that there is a change in God’s will, because in that place there is no before and after, and no concept of spatial borders.

                "This is exemplified by the miracle that occurred when King Shlomo brought the Holy Ark into the Temple. It is written in the Midrash Tanhuma (Vaera, 7) on the verse, “Raise, O gates, your heads, and be lift up, you everlasting doors!” (Tehillim, 24) that Shlomo said these words when he sought to bring the Ark into the Holy of Holies. He had made an ark of ten cubits in size, placed the original Ark of Moshe inside of it, and carried it to the Temple.

He began to pray to God. Our sages teach us that he brought the casket of his father David, and said (Divrei HaYamim 2, 6:42), “Hashem Elo-him! Do not turn away the face of Your anointed.” “Master of the world!” he said. “Do it in the merit of this one. Remember the kindnesses of Your servant David.” Whereupon he was immediately answered.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">408</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And was able to bring in the Ark.</i> My father, master and teacher, the holy Rav, explained that the essence of the miracle was a revelation of the supernal light of <i>Atika Kadisha</i> in this lower world. If the size of the gate was miraculously widened to make enough space for the Ark, or if the Ark had become smaller, it would not have been such a great miracle.

She came to him and said, “I have built a house but the beams will not reach the walls.” He asked her, “What is your name? “Aiku.” she replied. He then exclaimed, “Aiku, may your beams reach the walls!” A Tanna taught, they extended one cubit on both sides. Some say that new pieces miraculously joined themselves to the beams. Polemo said, “I saw the house, and its beams extended one cubit on both sides. People told me, ‘This is the house which Rabbi Hanina ben Dosa covered with beams through his prayer.’”</i> However, in the Holy Temple, the measurements of the gates, the Ark, or anything else could not be changed, as it is written (Divrei HaYamim 1:28:19), “All this, said David, is written by the hand of God who instructed me, even all the works of this blueprint.” The Gemara (Berachot, 17a) understands this to mean that Temple and all of its vessels had to be built according to the exact measurements that King David received in his prophetic understanding and taught to Shlomo. The miracle here was that matter entered into matter, and two different entities occupied the identical place and time, in defiance of natural governance. If man believes in this with perfect faith, and absolute sincerity, his heart will not go astray after strange logic or the philosophical speculations of those of limited consciousness. In his faith he will find all he needs to allay all the doubts and confusions resulting from all such doubts and inquiries. "

From G-d’s perception, there is no contradiction. This corresponds with R. Gershon Hanokh’s earlier statement concernings miracles.

In this case Maimonides proposed a difficult question, and instead of providing a possible answer, left it up to faith. The Ra’avad says that it would have been better to have not raised the question, leaving the matter up to the “naiveté of the simple,” and not to lead the reader in a direction where he could become lost spiritually, and question the Torah. The Ra’avad’s own possible solution, based on astrology and the ability of the intellect to surpass the binds of the zodiac, is rather contrived. Actually, the Rambam was not the first one to ask this question. This question had already been raised by Rav Sa’adia Gaon a few centuries earlier in his book, <i>Ha’Emunot ve’Hadeot</i> (<i>Beliefs and Knowledge</i>), in the fourth chapter entitled, “Divine Service and Rebellion.” There he writes, “Perhaps you would further say that since God knows what will happen before it happens, He therefore already knows that a man is destined to rebel against Him. Thus it would be impossible for man not to rebel, as he must complete God’s knowledge, which is perfect.” Rav Sa’adia Gaon’s solution to this conundrum is similar to that of the Ra’avad. Rav Sa’adia goes on to say that God’s knowledge of events does not cause them to happen, meaning that God’s knowledge does not force man into any particular action. Man is free to choose the good according to his own will. A similar view was held by the Rivash in his responsa. ",
                "Really, all of these conjectures are insufficient. In the final analysis, if it is totally within man’s power to choose the good, then it is within his power to change God’s knowledge, and if it is not within man’s power to change God’s knowledge, then he has no power to choose. There is much discussion of this topic among both medieval Jewish philosophers and later Kabbalists. According what I have already outlined, both man’s knowledge and intelligence are created entities. Man, however, is convinced that the Divine order and man’s knowledge are irreconcilable. Therefore, from man’s perspective, when something is predestined to happen, yet the outcome is different than originally planned, it is considered a change in the order of things. However, the past is also under God’s control, and for God, nothing is impossible. The distinction between past, present, and future is merely a reality that God created and programmed into the perception of the creation. Distinctions in time are only relevant to the creation. God has the power to change our perception, and to grant us additional understanding, until we understand that even the past can be changed. God left this up to man’s choice, for if man chooses the good, he will see how it was God’s will from the very outset for man’s benefit, and so too with the opposite.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">412</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a classic Izhbitzer teaching, which asserts that our repentance does not so much change things for the better, but reveals that things were actually different from the start, if only we had been able to realize it. </i> ",

                "This is as the Talmud says, as we have already mentioned (Berachot 4), that Yaakov was afraid that his sins changed his relationship with God, and he would no longer be worthy of Divine protection. Yaakov was afraid, even though God had made him a promise. It must be stressed that God’s speech is not like human’s speech. When a word goes forth from man’s mouth, it is gone and he cannot change it. If he wants to say something different, he has to say something different. With God, just as there is no change in His will, as was explained, so too, his words living and enduring. According to man’s actions, so will he see a response in God’s words. That is to say, if he acts properly and walks on the right path, he will see that God’s words are for his amelioration, and vice versa. The Zohar (Vayishlah, 169a) writes that “all of Your words are on condition.” In the source of God’s will there is no change. All of man’s power of choice is based upon the limitations of his perception. And all of his attainment of goodness, wholeness, or bliss, which depends upon his power of choice, is only that which he acquires for himself within the confines of the borders of his awareness and understanding. God’s will even directs those who transgress against His will. Even though they themselves think that they are transgressing His will, God still directs them, in a way that transcends their own perception. "

However, as the author explains here, this is only from the sinners perspective. In reality, even in their rebellion, they are secretly being directed by G-d for purposes beyond their comprehension. Nonetheless, inasmuch as they consciously rebel, they will not receive any benefit nor eternal reward for the good that ultimately derives from their evil deeds.

From where do we derive this? It is written (Yeshayahu, 26:10), ‘Favor will be shown to the wicked, who did not learn righteousness.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">413</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Midrash is freely interpreting this verse. The literal reading is: “Even if an evil person is shown favor, he will still not learn righteousness..”</i> Whereas, if he learned the Torah and does not fulfill its commandments, he is not shown favor.” It may be asked, “Perhaps a person is wicked because he did not learn the path of righteousness?” This question is addressed in the Talmud (Megillah, 6a): Rav Yitzhak also said: What is the meaning of the verse, “Favor will be shown to the wicked, who did not learn righteousness”? Yitzhak Avinu said to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the Universe, show mercy upon Esav.” God replied. “He is wicked.” Yitzhak said to Him, “He did not learned righteousness!”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">414</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meaning, Esav did not learn Torah, and thus should not be requited for his evil deeds.</i> God replied (with the continuation of the verse), “Even in a land of uprightness (<i>nekhochut</i>), they continue doing evil.” Yitzhak said, “If so, ‘let him not behold the majesty of God.’” When Yitzhak said, “He has not learnt righteousness,” he sought to judge Esav favorably. He argued that Esav’s actions were determined by the limits of his understanding. God answered Yitzhak, “Even in the land of the <i>nekhochut</i> (“uprightness,” or “presence”) he will continue doing evil.” That is to say, even if Esav were in the presence of God, he would still not act righteously, but use his elevated consciousness to deliberately and knowingly sin. This being the case, Yitzhak said, “Let him not behold the majesty of the God.” <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">415</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yitzhak asks G-d to show compassion on his brother, Esav, the sinner. He argues that Esav is unaware of the greater context of his actions. Like one who sins withough having learned Torah (Torah, here, being synonymous with an awareness of G-d’s plan.) Esav’s sins are only in terms of his own, constricted consciousness. From G-d’s perspective, even in sinning, he is fulfilling G-d’s will. However, G-d responds that even if Esav saw things from the higher perspective, he would still intent to rebel against G-d. If so, Yitzchak replies, then do not let him see Your Glory; that is, do not let him see how he is fulfilling Your will through his sins.</i> What does it mean to not see the majesty of God? It means that even though God uses his entire creation, including the wicked, for His own purposes and to achieve His desired ends, nonetheless, the wicked cannot see how God is using them as an agent of His design. This is, “he shall not see the majesty of God,” even when it is actualized through him. Similarly, we find that the glory of God was revealed through Pharaoh. The Mekhilta (Ch. 8) has Pharaoh saying, “Who is like You among the powers O God!” (Shemot, 15:11) This was also true with Haman in the days of Purim. The Talmud says (Megillah, 10b), “‘And it shall be to God for a name’ (Yeshayahu, 55:13)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">416</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Just before this the verse said, “and from under the brier shall sprout the myrtle tree (Hadas, in Hebrew.) The point is that Hadas is another name for Queen Ester. </i> – this refers to the days of Purim. (The verse continues) ‘For an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off’ – this refers to the reading of the Megillah.” Though Pharaoh and Haman were used as God’s agents to perform miracles and reveal the Glory of Heaven in the world, they themselves had no portion whatsoever in that sanctification of God’s name that came about through them. This is as it is written in the Talmud (Megillah, 6a), “What is the meaning of the verse (Tehillim, 140:9), ‘O God, do not grant the desires of the wicked, do not further his evil plan, lest he go and laud himself because of this?’ Yaakov said before the Holy One, blessed be He, ‘Master of the Universe, Do not grant the evil Esav the desire of his heart.’ ‘Do not further his evil plan,’ this refers to Germamia of Edom (an evil king that would descend from Esav).” Study this passage in greater depth, and see how God confounded them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">417</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This passage in the Talmud continues, “this refers to Germamia of Edom, for should they but go forth they would destroy the whole world. Rav Khama ben Khanina said, ‘There are three hundred crowned heads in Germamia of Edom and three hundred and sixty-five chieftains in Rome. Every day one goes forth to meet the other, one of them is killed, and they have all the trouble of appointing a new king.”</i> The words, “lest they praise themselves (<i>pen</i> <i>yaroomu</i>),” could also mean, “they shall be raised above.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">418</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse from Tehillim would then read: “Do not further his evil plan, for [Your hidden purposes] are far above him [above his comprehension].”</i> This means that God leads them in a place far above their ability to comprehend, and they themselves take no credit from the Glory of God which is magnified through them.",

It was necessary at the moment for him to “swallow riches,” meaning that God willed that something in the world had to come about through the power and wealth of a certain sinner. However, this wasn’t the sinner’s intention. Unknowingly, he was being used as an actor in God’s play. Therefore, no remnant remains with the sinner,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">419</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, no merit or reward for having fulfilled G-d’s will.</i> “he will vomit it, and God shall cast it out of his belly.” This is as Zophar the Naamite continues, “He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the streams of honey and butter.” Honey and butter represent the good reward God has in store for His servants and those who follow after His will. Yet the wrongdoer has no intention or desire to fulfill God’s will. It happens through him, not by him. Therefore he will not see any reward that is stored away for those who actively intend to magnify God’s glory in the world. Truly, all of his rebellion and destruction exists only within the scope of his limited perception and understanding. He only damages himself, for God’s will is fulfilled even through him. It is only in his limited estimation that he carries out a rebellion. This is as it is written in the introduction to the Tikkunei Zohar (2a): From their own perspective, the slave and the maidservant think that they are ruling the world. God’s management of the world is not actually disturbed by the sinner. It is only from his own perspective that he wreaks destruction. Meaning, within the scope of his own understanding he sees that he is destroying the world. This is as it is written (Devarim, Parshat Ha’azinu, 32:5), “Do they destroy Him? No!

Yet, in reality, it is all according to justice. This is as Elihu said to Iyov (34:11), “For according to the work of a man shall God pay him back, and things happen to man according to his ways.” And so it was. Just as Pharaoh had decreed upon Israel, so did God decree upon him. As for that which God said, “though you incite Me to him, to destroy him without cause,” notice that the verse does not say, “you incite Me to destroy him,” but rather, “you incite Me <i>to him</i>, to destroy him.” That is, to him, to his own mind, it seems that “you incite Me against me.” This is like Iyov said, “[Is it good that You should oppress, despise the work of Your hands,] and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?” In a similar vein it says (Tehillim, 78:36), “They seduced Him with their mouths and lied to Him with their tongues.” For this reason it is not written, “They seduce Him and lie to Him.” But it says, “They seduce Him in <i>their</i> mouths,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">420</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“B’fihem,” in Hebrew, could either mean with their mouths or in their mouths.</i> to show us that their seduction and lies exists only in their mouths (i.e., in their minds, whereas God knows all).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">421</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The point being, here, that the rebelliousness of the wicked is only from their perspective, but not from G-d’s. </i> On the other hand, just as man fixes the faith in God in his soul, so does God deal with him. This is as it is written in the Zohar (Vayikra, 103b): “Her husband is known in the gates.” (Mishlei 31:23) “Her husband,” is the Holy One, blessed be He. He is “known” and connected to every one according to how much a person estimates God in his heart.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">422</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word for “gate” – sha’ar is the same letters as the word for estimation – sha’er.</i> Directly corresponding to how much one can cleave himself to God in the spirit of wisdom, so is God known to him.

The meaning here, however, is “by chance”; that is, if a person imagines that the world runs haphazardly, without supernal direction, then G-d indeed allows the world to run that way for a person, and he lacks divine providence.</i> then I too will only go with you haphazardly.’ If you consider Me to be impermanent in the world, then I will make you impermanent in the world.” That is, if a person believes that the world runs by chance, then God relates to him according to his faith, and his life is subject to chance. However, when one believes that God’s providence extends to every detail of creation, then, from His side, God’s providence extends to every detail of creation for the person’s benefit. This is as it is written in the Talmud (Yevamot, 63a, and Midrash Rabbah on Lekh Lekha 39:11), “Even barrels of impure wine<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">424</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yayin nesech – wine used for idolatrous rituals.</i> being brought from Gaul to Spain were blessed in the merit of Avraham Avinu.” You may ask how this could be as they were barrels of impure wine (and thus not worthy of being blessed).

In other words, God blesses the efforts of idolatrous wine merchants coming from distant lands, all in order that Avraham receive benefit from the lower prices that result.</i> Here we see that in the merit of Avraham, whom G-d wanted to benefit, He directed the events of even distant places, so that Avraham might derive even a minute benefit, even through a very distant connection, or a lengthy series of causes and effects. In this way, with regards to Avraham, the entire creation and all of its minutiae were intimately led by God’s providence, even though each of those details themselves were only led by general providence. However, to the man of faith, all the minutiae of creation are led by an intimate, individual providence.

There he proposes the case a thief who robs another’s money. Did it happen by Divine decree? Was the thief merely an agent of the Almighty Judge who wanted to punish or test the victim? Rav Sa’adia’s answer is that when one loses something, it is an act of God. However, when one is robbed, it is an act of man. If wisdom has it that the thing will be lost, if it is not stolen by the thief, it will be lost in some other way. This was how Shamaya and his brothers answered some of the Kings of Edom, “If we are indeed guilty of death by the Heavenly court, then if you don’t kill us, God has no shortage of ready executioners.” R. Sa’adia dwelt on these matters at length. Yet truly, his solutions are insufficient, such as when the thief himself rationalizes the theft, saying that if it was meant to be, and he doesn’t do it, then it will be lost in some other way. This implies a deficiency in God’s knowledge, since it implies that God doesn’t know exactly how His justice will be done. Furthermore, Rav Sa’adia contradicts the Talmud (Ketubot, 30b), which says, “Damage caused by lions or thieves is in the hands of Heaven, by the cold or heat is in the hands of man (as a person is able to take care of himself).” Here we see that man does bring upon himself damage.

Why did Yonah decide to run away? Can one flee from the presence of God? Yonah wanted to go outside the borders of the Holy Land, because the Divine Presence only rests in the land of Israel. Yonah thought that in this way the Divine Presence would not rest upon him (and he would not have to prophesize for the detriment of Israel ...) Notice that the verse reads, “<i>milifnei</i> - from before,” and not, “<i>lifnei</i> - before.” Yet the point is precisely, “<i>milifnei</i> - from before,” because the spirit of prophecy does not come from the <i>Shekhina</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">430</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shekhina: the Divine Presence; the sefirah of Malkhut – alluded to by the word lifnai.</i> but rather from<i> before</i> the <i>Shekhina</i>.

The Zohar states that it alludes to the sefirah of Binah. However, from the verses in Yonah, it seems to allude to the sefirot of Netzach and Hod. According to the Zohar, the word lifnei (“before”) alludes to the sefirah of Malkhut. Therefore, the word milifnei – “from before” – alludes to the sefirot that precede that of Malkhut; i.e. Netzach and Hod. In Kabbalah, these two sefirot are considered the source of prophecy. Thus, the Zohar reads the verse: “And Yonah rose up to flee to Tarshish, from before the presence of God” – that is, from before the source of his prophecy, which are Netzach and Hod. The author will relate to this idea in the following chapter. At present, his point is to show that Yonah sought to flee from G-d’s prophecy by confusing his own mind; that is, by detaching his mind from G-d, he consciousness fell to a lower level, and thus, he no longer experienced prophecy. This is in line with the chapters discussion of two parallel levels of awareness – the Divine and the human</i> Yonah was afraid to be on this level in the Holy Land. Therefore, about Yonah it says, “<i>milifnei</i> – he was fleeing from before the presence of God,” since Yonah knew that prophecy only comes, “from before.”",
                "The Zohar asks a good question. How can one run away from the omniscient, omnipresent God? And even more so, how can a prophet of this God say that he is running away from His presence? Yonah only sought the welfare of all of Israel. He thought that it was in the best interests of Israel that he not experience prophecy. This is as it is written in the Mekhilta (beginning of Parshat Bo), “Yonah sought the honor of the son and did not seek the honor of the Father.“ For this reason, Yonah deliberately brought his mind to a state of chaos, in such a way that he would not receive prophecy. Both the Mekhilta and the Midrash Tanhuma (end of Parshat Vayikra) have Yonah saying, “I am fleeing from before Him to a place where His Glory is <i>not</i>. But where shall I go? If I ascend to Heaven, ‘His Glory is upon the Heavens.’ (Tehillim, 112) If I wander the whole earth, ‘the whole earth is filled with His Glory’ (Yeshayahu, 6). Therefore, I must run to the sea where there is no mention of His Glory.” Why does it say that the sea is not a place that reveals God’s Glory? Because the sea is a place where man’s mind is ill at ease. It is written in the Talmud (Tamid, 32a), “When one goes out to sea, his mind is ill at ease until he returns to dry land.” For a person to experience prophecy, he must possess wisdom, and his mind must be settled and secure. Therefore, Yonah deliberately brought his mind into a state of turmoil, in order to prevent his prophetic faculty. This is what the Zohar means by saying, “<i>milifnei</i> - from before,” and not, “<i>lifnei</i> - before.” That is to say, it is not within man’s power to hide himself from God. The best he can do is disturb his own perception. Such mental turmoil only takes effect within the borders of his own scope of understanding. This is the meaning of, “‘<i>milifnei</i> - from before’ means two distinct levels of prophets.” This is also as the Tikkunei Zohar (Tikkun 21, page 49a) says, “Prophets come from <i>Binah</i> - Understanding, and they are <i>Netzah</i> – Eternity, and <i>Hod</i> – Majesty.”"

According to Kabbalah, prophetic outflow begins in the upper sefirah of Binah, symbolized in the Zohar by the “sea” (in that it collects and holds the illumination of Hokhmah, the “spring”). This energy flows down the Sefirotic Tree until it reaches Netzach and Hod, which are the final stages before it is manifest in tangible reality. The opposing nature of these two lower Sefirot – one manifesting G-d’s grace and the other, His reprimand – must be resolved in the heart of the prophet, who sees G-d’s love even within His stern judgment. Yonah failed to do this, and instead, sought to flee the Divine presence by seeking to disturb his own mind, making it unfit for prophecy. His efforts, however, were ultimately futile. </small> ",
                "The meaning of this is as follows. The source of prophecy is the place of understanding, called the <i>Sefirah</i> of <i>Binah</i>. However, the effluence of prophecy descends to the lower Sefirot of <i>Netzah</i> - Eternity<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">432</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Netzach is also called Victory. In the arrangement of the Sefirot, Netzach is the lowest Sefirah of the right column, and Hod is the lowest Sefirah of the left column. They are synthesized in Yesod – Foundation, the second lowest Sefirah of the middle column.</i> and <i>Hod</i> - Majesty. This is as it is written in the Raya Mehemna section of the Zohar (Parshat Teitse), “The upper <i>Imma</i> (Mother, Binah) spreads down to Hod.” Netzah and Hod are two branches that separate at the end of the promulgation of Divine effluence, which reunite in the attribute of Yesod – “Foundation” – in order to manifest God’s governance in the world. This is as it is written in the Tikkunei Zohar (Tikkun 18, page 34b): \"These are the branches. They separate at Netzach and Hod … They are the two legs, YHVH to the right (the side of Netzach) and Adonai to the left (the side of Hod.)\" The prophet is a channel for the Divine word necessary to effect Divine governance in the world. Every prophet, save Moshe, needed to prepare himself in order to receive prophecy. The required preparation involved ascending in order to receive from the source by means of the two attributes of Netzah and Hod. The Zohar describes these two attributes as two halves of the same body. In this way, they are akin to identical twins.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">433</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zohar, Raya Mehemna, Parshat Pinchas, page 236b.</i> In their root, these two attributes are really one. When Hesed – Loving-kindness on the right, and Gevurah – Strength on the left, unite in Tiferet – Beauty in the center, they then branch out below and come into action as Netzach and Hod.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">434</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hesed, Gevurah, and Tiferet are the middle triad of the ten Sefirot. Netzach, Hod and Yesod are the lower triad.</i> Indeed, at their root, Hesed and Gevurah are also one.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">435</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zohar, Parshat Vayikra.</i> With the downward evolution of Divine effluence through the Sefirot, the upper Sefirot represent abstract potential, and the further down you go, this energy engenders tangible reality and physical actions. Thus, with the lower Sefirot of Netzach and Hod, we arrive at the stage just before the completion of the action ready to emerge in the world. Lower down, with the emergence of the completed action, the Divine effluence looks like opposites. Therefore the source of prophecy comes from the two Sefirot of Netzach and Hod, when God shows how the contradictory attributes unite together as one. This follows the Tikkunei Zohar quoted above, where it says that these two attributes unite in Tzaddik (the righteous, or Yesod –Foundation) in the form of the two names YHVH (God’s ineffable name, representing mercy) and Adonai (God’s spoken name, representing judgment). They are visualized as intertwined in the following way: יהוה אדני יאהדונהי This is the unification of God. Even though the name Adonai seems to govern the principle of God’s concealment and judgment, nonetheless it is in a complete state of unity with YHVH, representing revelation and mercy. This is the true preparation of the heart of the prophet.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">436</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meaning to say, that even when G-d’s message to the prophet seems harsh – as in the prophecies of Yermiyahu – or detrimental to Israel – as in the prophecy of Yonah, they are really expressions of G-d’s love. </i>",
                "",
                "Yonah’s intention in trying to flee “<i>milifnei</i> - from before” God was in order to prevent the supernal light from appearing to him. However, there is the other level of “<i>lifnei</i>,” which means, “directly before.” This is the Sovereignty of Heaven – the attribute of Malkhut which receives from and thereby completes all of the other attributes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">437</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Sefirot are considered to be the attributes of G-d. </i> It is impossible to escape from the Sovereignty of Heaven, as the Divine Presence is everywhere. So when Yonah fled from before God out to the sea, is really means that went to a place where he was unable to prepare his heart to receive prophecy. However, this was only in his mind. He only cloistered himself within the borders of his own scope of understanding, yet not from the presence of God. This is as the Zohar explains (Hayei Sarah, 121a): \"Though the sea became tempestuous for Yonah, the earth did not quake. Why? Since Yonah was running away so that the Shekhina would not rest upon him, why then did the sea seize him when he went? Rather, we see that everything happened according to plan. Of the sea we are taught, “The color of the sea is similar to the color of the sky, and the color of the sky is similar to the Throne of Glory.” For this reason the sea seized Yonah when he went upon her, receiving him within her. When he ran away from the sea, she threw her arms to his place.\" The essence of the sea is the place of Binah. This is as the Zohar tells us (42b): \"Afterwards, God made a great vessel, as if He dug a great pit and filled it with the [supernal] sea which flows from the spring. This vessel is called the sea.\" There (in Binah), is the greatest place of clarity, in which all of the opposite forces unite as one. Yet, when it is expressed in this world (manifest as the sea), it is perceived as the opposite, for in this world it is clothed in a garment that is the opposite of the upper world. This is as it is written in the Zohar (Shlah, 169a): \"This world is the opposite of the world-to-come.\" Therefore the sea is a place of turmoil, and we do not find any verses telling us that the sea expresses God’s glory, since at sea, man is in a state of turmoil and cannot crown God as Sovereign, in unite Him perfectly. Yet from God’s viewpoint, the sea is also a place of His Glory. This is evinced in how the sea became stormy when it saw that Yonah wanted to deliberately disturb his prophetic ability. In contemplating this, Yonah understood that even though his intention was for the good of Israel, nonetheless, it is impossible to hide from God even within the borders of the scope of one’s own understanding, when this is not God’s will. It is the ultimate human folly that man should consider himself smarter than God. God showed Yonah how he made the blunder in thinking that he loved Israel more than God Himself."

                "<b>The Meaning of Suffering</b> <br> <small>From the present chapter until the end of the book, the author addresses the topic of human suffering. Whereas previously, he explained how faith can lift a person above the laws of nature, bringing him to the higher level of divine guidance, in the following chapters, he discusses how faith can bring a person to an inner realization that everything that happens to them is from G-d and for his own good. As in the discussion above, faith results in a shift in perception, from the human to the Divine. Whereas a human being, in this world, may suffer to the point that he questions the very point of his existence, in the root of his soul, he understands how it is all for his good, and before he was born, even agreed to experience it. Faith can restore a person to this primeval awareness of the intrinsic goodness of life</small>",
                "The person who believes in God with perfect faith will not find all his suffering unbearable, for whatever he experiences, he knows that it is for his best. This is because all of person’s suffering is really for his own good, and his soul even agreed to it before he was created. This is as it is written in the Talmud (Rosh Hashanah, 11a), “Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said, all creatures were created in their full stature, by their own agreement, and with full knowledge of their form and character.” Rashi and the Tosafot explain that before anything comes into the world, it is asked if it wants to be created, and it says yes. Tosafot explains, “in their full form and character,” to mean, “in the beauty of their growth.” Rashi also notes (Hulin, 60a) that “with full knowledge of their form and character,” means, with the form that this particular creation <i>chose for itself</i>. Even though the Talmud (Eruvin, 13a) writes that it would have been easier for man to never have been created, notice that it does not say, “it would have been better,” but rather, “it would have been easier.” When man realizes that this world is a place in which he must accept total responsibility, and that the danger [of failing] is constant, then certainly, from the perspective of this world, it would have been easier were he never created. Yet, in his root, the place where his soul is attached, he agreed that it was in his better interest to be created than not, for behold, he was created in his full form and character. He knew and accepted all the risks and responsibilities.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">438</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even though the author speaks of this knowledge being present to the soul before birth, the implication is that it is still available to a person, when they can still access this awareness, if they see creation through the eyes of faith, which entails a cognitive shift in apprehending reality.</i> From God’s point of view, every soul will ultimately be refined for the good. Even after he has sinned a lot, God thinks of ways to insure that he will not be irrecoverably pushed away from Him, as it is written in the Zohar (Saba d’Mishpatim, 106a): We are taught that nothing in the world stands in the way of repentance (<i>teshuva</i>), and that God certainly accepts everyone. If a person returns to God, then the path of life is open before him. Even if he is blemished by sin, it is all fixed, and it all returns to its pristine state of existence. Even if God had vowed to punish someone who transgressed a major sin, repentance corrects this, as it is written (Yeshayahu, 14:24), “The Lord of Hosts has advised, who shall annul it?” This mystery is greatly hidden.",
                "Even when a person suffers great ordeals and afflictions, God can make amends and console him, to the point that he is appeased and consoled over everything he has gone through. Our passage in the Zohar continues: Concerning this, David HaMelech said (Tehillim, 119), “Your mercies are great, O God, give me life according to Your law.” If God is merciful with the wicked, then all the more so with the righteous. Who needs the greatest healing? The ones who are in pain. Who is in pain? The wicked. They need God’s mercy and healing, so as not to be left abandoned… Come and see! It is written (Yeshayahu, 57:17), “He went rebelliously in the way of his heart.” Afterward, it says, “I have seen his ways, and I will heal him, and I will lead him, and I will console to make him and his mourners whole.” “He went rebelliously,” that is to say, even though the wicked do all kinds of intentional sins, pursuing their desires, with others warning them time and again, and the wicked not heeding them, nonetheless, upon returning to the path of God in penance, they will find the healing ready for them to receive. Here we see that God can comfort them over all their suffering. He can return everything to the good, and look forward for the good. This is as our passage in the Zohar concludes: Now that it has come back to him, we clearly see consolation on all sides. Now he is certainly alive – alive in all aspects, grasping onto the Tree of Life. By virtue of grasping onto the Tree of Life, he is called a Master of Repentance (<i>Baal Teshuva</i>). For indeed, <i>Knesset Yisrael</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">439</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, the entire community of Israel. Symbolically, the Shekhina, and the sefirah of Malkhut.</i> is called <i>teshuva</i>. And he is the “Master of <i>Teshuva</i>.” The ancients said, “[he is] an actual master of <i>Teshuva</i>.” For this reason the sages said, “A perfectly righteous man cannot even stand in the place of greatness where the <i>Baal Teshuva </i>stands.” Even an inkling thought of repentance is not lost from God, as the Zohar says (Terumah, 150b): No good intention is ever lost from before the Holy King. For this reason, fortunate is the man who entertains good thoughts for the sake of his Master! For even if he cannot bring his them to fruition, God considers his intentions as if they had actually been accomplished. This is as it is said in the Zohar (Mishpatim, 99b): Everything in the world, no matter how small, has a place where it can stand and hide, a refuge to enter into and never be lost … These are the great powers of the Holy Supernal King, and nothing is lost. Even a fleeting breath has a place, and the God does with it that which He will. Even man’s slightest word is not in vain, for everything has a place. Even all of the pain that man suffers will not be ignored by God. God will comfort every soul that suffers. Since God knows the final purpose of everything, and that it is better for the creation to have been created than not. He shows this understanding to a person’s soul while he is still in potential, before he enters the world. Then the soul agrees that it is better for him to be created, as it is written in the Zohar (Vayehi, 233b): But come and see! Before they descend into the world, all the souls that exist from the very first day of creation stand before God, in the very form that they will take on after they come into the world. They stand above in a body that looks just like the body they will enter. When the time comes for this soul to descend into the world, the soul stands before the Holy One, blessed be He, in the exact form it will take on when it enters the world. At this time, God has the soul swear that it will keep the commandments of the Torah, and not transgress the statutes of the Torah. From where do we derive that the soul stands in this way before God? As it is written (Melachim 1, 17:1), “I swear by the Living God, whom I stood before…” God shows the soul its entire structure, his characteristics, abilities, and even its physical attributes. The soul agrees to it all, down to the last detail. From man’s point of view, it is difficult to understand how the soul could agree to all of the pain it will have to endure in this world. Before the soul descends into this world it has not yet sinned, so why doesn’t it stay safely where it is, before it has to incur punishment? Why would it intentionally enter a world where it has no choice but to suffer?",
                "",
                "It is explained in the Zohar (Vayeishev, 181a): Rabbi Shimon opened and said. “He shall not go to the veil or come near the altar.” (Vayikra, 21:23, in reference to a blemished Cohen.) At the time when the river runs forth,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">440</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Soncino Zohar translates, “At the time when the perennial stream releases human souls.”</i> it brings all souls to the female. The female becomes pregnant. They are all within her, in a room within a room whose walls are covered with tapestries. The souls themselves are pure and holy. Yet since they emerged at the time when the moon is blemished from the influence of the Serpent, then wherever the souls reach they are broken and blemished with various pains and afflictions. God wants these souls in all of their sadness and all of their brokenness. This is the secret. They exist below as they are above; the body is blemished, and the soul within is just as it is above, one according to the other. Because this is so, they need to be renewed with the renewal of the moon. On this it is written (Yeshayahu, 66), “On each new moon and each new Sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship Me, says the Lord.”",
                "Here Rabbi Shimon explains the nature of the cries and tears of the downtrodden. The Cohen who is disqualified from serving in the Holy Temple due to one of the blemishes mentioned in the Torah has grievances against God for being cast away from being included in the service of G-d, for he is forbidden to serve in the Temple. It is impossible to say that he is blemished from birth at the core of his soul, for then he he would be forbidden from eating from tithes and sacrifices.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">441</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Vayikra 21:22. </i> It is only a <i>Halal</i> – a Cohen who married a divorcee – who is forbidden from eating of the sacrifices, and whose offspring no longer have the status of Cohanim. Yet a blemished Cohen is allowed to eat tithes and sacrifices, and his children are full-fledged Cohanim. It is only that he is forbidden from entering into the Temple and performing the holy service.",
                "What is the meaning of eating “<i>kodesh</i>” – the meat of the Temple sacrifices? It means that a person eats a holy substance that is absorbed in his body. When he serves G-d with the energy he gained from that food, the food itself is elevated. One could argue that for a person who is blemished at the core of his soul, the prohibition of eating <i>kodesh</i> should be greater than for entering the Temple grounds. Eating the <i>kodesh</i> will cause greater destruction than treading on holy ground, since the food is absorbed in his body, and he can use its energy to do whatever he wants, whether good or evil. If he decides to use the power of the <i>kodesh</i> to do something evil, he drags the holy power of the food down to the lowest of levels. In the case of a blemished individual entering the Temple, the holiness surrounds him, and he cannot damage the force of holiness to such a great extent. The essence of Rabbi Shimon’s solution is that blemished Cohen is not at all blemished at the core of his soul. Rather, out of his great love for God, he willingly accepted this blemished state even before he was created – to undergo a process of purification and to endure suffering.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">442</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Menahem Nahum of Chernobyl (1730-1798) teaches a similar idea in his work, Meor Eynaim, at the beginning of Parshat Vaeira. God’s hidden wisdom knows exactly how to run the world, and exactly which level of effluence is needed to sustain every particular time, place, and soul. God knows the proper attribute or Sefirah through which this effluence must be revealed. When one experiences success, it is because God’s wisdom knows that that is the precise level of Divine effluence needed for that person. When one endures some kind of suffering or failure, then God had discerned in his impenetrable wisdom this is exactly what is needed for this person in this time and place. No matter what attribute one experiences, it is absolutely essential, and there is really no need for jealousy, because one is just as essential as the other. This is the secret of the verse in the Shema, “You shall love God with all your abundance,” as the Talmud says (Berakhot, 54b), “in whichever attribute God deals with you, thank Him greatly.” According to R. Gershon Hanokh, the soul of the blemished priest – and of every individual who suffers in life – is privy to this knowledge before birth, and willingly accepts G-d’s judgment in his coming into this world.</i> This is as the Zohar says, “God wants these souls in all of their sadness and all of their brokenness.” That is to say, the suffering soul wants to be pushed out to the furthermost place, to be clothed in a garment that is furthest from the Divine source, and to suffer greatly, for by serving God in the dark, concealed place, he magnifies and sanctifies the Glory of Heaven. This passage in the Zohar concludes: “From new moon to new moon, and from Sabbath to Sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me, declares the Lord” (Yeshayahu, 66:23) “All flesh,” precisely. They will be completely rejuvenated, and need to be renewed in the renewal of the moon.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">443</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Zohar uses the moon as a symbol for the Shekhina, which is presently blemished and in exile – corresponding to the moon’s own waxing and waning. This deficiency in the Shekhina is the source of all the pains and suffering of humankind. In the Messianic era, when the Shekhina will be redeemed and fully united with G-d, the “moon” will be full, and human suffering will come to an end.</i> They are in a constant partnership with the moon, sharing her blemish. For this reason, she dwells constantly within them, never leaving them. This is as it is said (Yeshayahu, 57:15), “I dwell with the downtrodden and broken of spirit.” And it is written (Tehillim, 34:19), “God is close to the broken hearted.” Since they suffer the same blemish as the moon, they are always close to her. Therefore, in order to bring new life to the broken hearted, they will have a portion of that life that will be renewed. The ones that suffer together with her shall be renewed together with her. This is called the suffering of love. This suffering is born of the soul’s love, and not from the man himself. It is out of love, for the light of the small love is blemished and pushed away from great love.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">444</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Mikdash Melech reads, “‘The small love’ – Malkhut. ‘From the great love,’ Zeir (Anpin), for Malkhut is built out of the Hasadim (forces of loving-kindness coming through Zeir Anpin), which is called, ‘love.’”</i>"

                "<b>The Blemish of the Moon.</b> <br> <small> Continuing with the image of the moon, as symbolizing creation in its current, deficient state, the author recalls themes that he discussed much earlier in the work – that G-d is best served from a place of lack and deficiency, as he stated previously: “There is no light but that which emerges from darkness.” The soul, like the moon, willingly limits itself to enter this dark world, yet only from here, can it truly shine. With this, R. Gershon Hanokh begins to close his argument: the world of darkness and concealment is not an absolutely negative state. It is the setting out of which revelation emerges. As such, it is an indispensable step to revelation. Seeing through the eyes of faith not only means seeing the good in the darkness, but seeing how the darkness itself is part of the larger plan. This redeeming vision is at present hidden from our eyes (and thus, the need for faith), but will be revealed in the world-to-come.</small>",
                "The blemish of the moon reflects the deficiency that God programmed into the very fabric of creation. God saw the necessity for such a deficiency in order to give man the possibility of serving Him. This is as it is written in the Zohar (Tetsave, 184a): Man only serves God from amidst darkness… This is as it is written (Yeshayahu, 48), “You are called a criminal from the womb.” God concealed the good that results from this type of service until the final redemption, to that special day known only to Him. This is as it is written in the Talmud (Shevuot, 9a) concerning the goat offered of the new moon (Bamidbar, 28:15), “‘And one goat for a sin offering for God.’ Why does the verse here say, ‘for God,’ which is not said after other offerings? It is as if God is saying, ‘Bring a sacrifice for Me, in order to atone for My own sin of diminishing the moon!’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">445</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chulin, 60b: Rav Shimon ben Pazzi pointed out a contradiction between two verses. One verse says, “And God made the two great lights,” and immediately the verse continues, “The greater light . . . and the lesser light.” [In other words, are they both great, or are they great and small?] The moon said unto the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the Universe! Is it possible for two kings to wear one crown?” [I.e. can there be two great lights?] God answered, “So go and make yourself smaller.” The moon cried, “Master of the Universe! Since I have suggested that which is proper, I have to make myself smaller?” He replied: “Then you will go and rule by day and by night.” [I.e. the moon can be see both at night and by day.] “What is the value of this?” cried the moon; “What is the use of a lamp in broad daylight?” God answered, “Go. By you will Israel calculate the days and the years.” “But it is impossible to calculate the seasons without the sun!” said the moon, “as it is written, And let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years.” “Go, for the righteous shall be named after you, as we find, Yaakov the Small, Shmuel the Small, David the Small.” On seeing that the moon would not be consoled, the Holy One, blessed be He, said: “Bring an atonement for Me for making the moon smaller.” This is what Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish meant when he said, “Why is it that the he-goat offered on the new moon is phrased differently in that after it, it is said, ‘a sin offering for G-d’? Because the Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘Let this he-goat be an atonement for Me for making the moon smaller.’”</i> It is hinted at here that a person should not complain angrily to God, but rather, should accept everything with love. This is what the Zohar meant when it quoted the verse, ““from new moon to new moon… all flesh shall come to worship before me, declares the Lord.” The word, “flesh,” hints at the deficiency which exists in the very nature of the creation, as the Talmud states (Sotah, 5a), “the word, ‘flesh – <i>basar</i>,’ is an acronym for ‘<i>busha</i> – shame,’ ‘<i>sruha</i> – stench,’ ‘<i>rima</i> –worm.’” Thus, “flesh” is the root of all deficiencies. Yet, the future renewal will be built from this deficiency and raised up out of this shame. This is as our passage in the Zohar continues (Tetsave, 184a): He opened and said (Yeshayahu, 52:13), “Behold, My servant shall prosper; he shall be exalted and lifted up, and he shall be very high.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">446</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a prophecy concerning the righteous in the messianic era.</i> Fortunate is the portion of the righteous to whom the Holy One, blessed be He, reveals the way of the Torah and how to live by it! Come and see how this verse is a sublime mystery. “My servant shall prosper,” has been explained. Yet come and see! When God created the world, He created the moon, and then made her light smaller. In this way, she would not have any light of her own. Since she made herself smaller, she only reflects the light she receives from the sun and the power of the supernal luminaries. In the days of the Holy Temple, Israel was assiduous in bringing sacrifices together with all the other services performed by the Cohanim, Levi’im, and Israelites. Their service wove bonds of union and caused an intense illumination. After the Temple was destroyed, the lights were darkened, and the moon no longer shined from the light of the sun. Ever since the sun withdrew from her, the days are fraught with curses, affliction, and pain.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">447</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a metaphor for creation in its present, exilic state, in which the light of the son (G-d) no longer shines upon the moon (our world). Thus, it is a period of suffering and pain. </i> But of the time when the moon will shine with her original light, it is said of her, “Behold, my servant shall prosper.” This is the mystery of <i>emunah</i> (faith). At that time, there will be an awakening in the upper realms, like someone who, upon catching a sweet scent, wakes up and looks out at the world. “He shall be exalted,” from the side of the most exalted of luminaries. And as in the verse (Yeshayahu, 30:18), “And He will be exalted that He may have mercy upon you.” “Lifted up,” is from the side of Avraham. “He shall be (very) high,” is from the side of Yitzhak. Whereas “very” is from the side of Yaakov. in the mystery of wisdom. At that time the Holy One, blessed be He, will cause an awakening on high in order to allow the moon to shine in her full splendor, as it is written (Yeshayahu, 30:26), “Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of the seven days.” For this reason, an exalted spirit will be added to the moon which will rouse the dead who sleep in the dust. This is the meaning of “My servant,” who has the key of the Master in his hand.",
                "",
                "The blemish of the moon represents the point of Divine Sovereignty that wanted to descend to the lowest of levels, so that there is the potential for serving G-d through concealment and free choice. This is hinted when the Talmud says (Hullin, 60b), “The Holy One told her: Go and make yourself smaller,” and not that “God made the moon smaller.” God only gave the moon a piece of good advice, telling her that she would benefit from making herself smaller. This reduction follows the desire of the creation, which wanted this state of concealment in order to later be worthy of a very great illumination, as is explained in the passage of the Zohar quoted above. An intensely precious light hides in this point of concealment, since the end of the attributes is wedged in the beginning and chief of all attributes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">448</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Sefer Yetzirah says, “The end is wedged in the beginning”; meaning, the lowest spiritual world (Malkhut) is included in the highest (Keter).

See the Mei HaShiloach, Sefer Bereshit, Parshat Vayeira, under the verse, “and Sarah laughed.” It must be noted that this concept can be easily misunderstood and even corrupted, as the Mei HaShiloach notes in his discussion of Amalek. </i> in order to say at first that she did not want to enter into a state of concealment, but rather receive light directly from the source without any diminution of the light by means of a system of filtration in the upper worlds. The act of receiving the light of the sun teaches how man receives light through Divine service and constriction (<i>tzimtzum</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">450</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tzimzum is the act of God constricting his infinite light through numerous filters so that it can be contained in the weak vessels of this world without breaking them. Performing a commandment is a way of receiving the light of the Infinite through tzimtzum.</i> The Zohar explains that the only way that man can completely connect to God is if he receives the Infinite light through the Divine service.

On Rosh Hashanah, which falls on the new moon, the light of the moon is covered. Ten days later, on Yom Kippur, the moon is not yet full. This means that on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur the moon is still close to the sun, receiving her light at points closer to the source. This is as it is said (Ibid.): Rabbi Abba sent a question to Rabbi Shimon asking, “When is the union of <i>Knesset Yisrael</i> (the <i>Shekhina</i>) with the Holy King?” He sent back to him, “(As Avraham said of Sarah:) Indeed she is my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother. And she became my wife.” (Bereshit, 20:12) This is explained: \t“On the covering of the day of our festival.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">452</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to Rosh Hashanah, when the new moon is still hidden (i.e. “covered.”)</i> (Tehillim, 81:4) On this day the moon is covered… And it illuminates everything with the light of repentance… Come and See! On this day the moon is covered, and does not shine until the tenth of the month, on Yom Kippurim… Why is the name of the day of Atonement voiced in the plural (Kippurim – <i>Atonements</i>)? It is because on this day, two lights shine as one. The upper luminary shines to the lower luminary. And on this day the upper luminary shines, and not from the light of the sun. God established the service for Israel according to the seasons, each time according to its system. Therefore, by Yom Kippur the Divine service has not yet been completed, to unite God’s will with the service of Israel. Since on the tenth of the month the moon is not yet full, therefore the Divine service cannot yet be totally complete. For this reason, the Divine service performed by Israel on Yom Kippur is through restraint and afflictions.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">453</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The five afflictions one must perform on Yom Kippur: not eating, not drinking, not washing, not anointing, and not engaging in marital relations. </i> This is evinced in how the moon does not yet fully receive the light of the sun, since it still too close to the source. On Succot, however, when the moon is full, the Divine service is fulfilled through active service, through the joy of the festival and all of its delights.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">454</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On Succot there are active commandments such as sitting in the succah, waving the four species, and rejoicing in the feasts of the festival. In the days of the Temple there was also the joyous ritual of water libations. </i> Then the Divine service is truly complete. This is as it is written in the Midrash (Kohellet, 4), “Man’s desire is to work and receive the fruits of his labors.” When man receives, he wants to have earned his reward by his own efforts. In this way he doesn’t suffer the shame of receiving an undeserved gift.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">455</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, on Succot, the moon is the furthest from the sun. Yet precisely for that reason, it shines the brightest. In our terms, it is precisely when a person is furthest from G-d that he has the ability to serve him. And as a result of that service, comes the joy of receiving a hard-earned reward – the opposite of the shame a person feels when he receives a gift that he does not deserve.</i>",

And so, the root of creation was content in reducing itself. And even though it possesses a great strength, as its source is in a very high place, it is even more pleased to receive the Divine effluence through a filter, which is the service that Israel performs when God’s presence is concealed.

For while no one would willingly accept suffering while in this life, each person did indeed accept it as his lot before entering the world. From the soul’s perspective, life in this world is as fleeting as a dream, and sometimes, as awful as a nightmare. Yet, its duration is always brief, and it is worth bearing, if one has faith in the benefits he will receive upon awakening in the world-to-come – a reality totally different than our present one. </small>",
                "A person should not find the idea difficult that he was created with his own consent, and that he should accept upon himself suffering. Indeed, the world holds the opposite view, and people prefer immediate physical gratification over patience and constraint – even when they know that they will be rewarded for the latter in the world-to-come. ",
                "However, although the above idea is true, after the soul descends into the darkness of this world, it begins to desire everything, as one’s inner drives make a person feel lacking and empty. A person becomes jealous upon seeing that his fellow is blessed with abundance, while he remains unsated. And he experiences great shame before the wealthy, whose words are heeded solely because they prosper, while no one cares what he thinks or feels. He does not see, however, the anger and pain that prosperity brings the wealthy. Really, the roar and tumult of the world is a terrible thing, for it does not allow a person the peace of mind necessary to think about life. If only a person were given the choice to be sent to a faraway place, where no one knows him and he would not be ashamed of his poverty. If he were given the power to choose the right path for his life, he would then see things clearly, and not feel the dismay and distractions experienced by those who are spoiled by ephemeral abundance. How much pain and hardship comes from all of this good! How much terror does one reap from all of these matters! A person afflicted with abundance lacks the peace of mind to build him home, and pitch his tent with surety. He misses the mark of his true purpose in the world. This could be from the pain of others jealousy saddled upon him, causing him to hate his fellow man, leading to anger and agony. It could be from the strife of the spirit he feels by never being satisfied and never feeling that he truly has enough. He is infected by one-usmanship, and compelled to surpass his betters. This is as the famous saying of the Talmud, “A man never dies with the feeling that he has attained even half of his desires.” If he has made a million dollars, he wants two million. And the desire for two million is nothing compared to the cancerous desire for a billion. This harrowing desire brings on madness, his mind is lost in the vortex of wanting more and more. It is incomparable to the disturbance felt by one who desires something minute.",

For it is indeed so, that if only man were to chose to live by his faith and make do with little, as opposed to dedicating his life to seeking pleasure, then he will not possess a hint of arrogance.

Clearly, he thinks, it would have been much easier if he were never created. But consider the following modification of his dream.

One man is content to endure great suffering and misfortune in the dream. He considers it a good choice, and accepts it all with love and a willing heart. He girds his soul so as to not fall off the good path. He willingly and bravely puts himself in the peril of suffering in order to achieve the awesome good at the time of awakening. Yet another man doesn’t want to take the risk and the responsibility it entails, and would rather be satisfied with the lesser good during the dream, with no promise of future reward.

Certain great and precious souls, when all of the future suffering and pain that they will endure for the Glory of Heaven is spelled out for them, accept it all out of their love for God. This is as it is said in the Talmud (Shabbat, 88b), “Our Rabbis taught, those who are insulted but do not insult, hear themselves reviled without responding, act through love and rejoice in suffering, of them it is written (Shoftim, 5:31), ‘Those who love Him are as the sun when He goes forth in His might.’” And it is said further in the Zohar (Vayakhel, 198a): It is written (Tehillim, 146:5), “His hope (<i>sivro</i>) is in the Hashem his God.” It does not say <i>tikvato </i>(the normal word for hope.)

Yet still, in this garment, in his state of being in the world, he will feel that it would have been easier if he were never to have been created. Yet if he searches his heart and strengthens his faith, he will know that all his feelings of regret at his very creation were quite clear to him and accepted before he was created.

Rabbi Yehuda answered that knowledge of the Divine Chariot depends upon the heart’s understanding, as a person can meditate upon it and come to know it. But the blessing over light is said over the benefit derived from actually seeing light. This teaches affirms that the meditations of the heart can bring a person to perceive that which his senses cannot grasp. Gazing upon the Divine Chariot is compared to the sight of the blind.

A person should not ask, “How can I even start, for I do not even believe in the Torah or its laws?” For this reason, God gave the Torah and the positive and negative commandments to Israel, so that by simply fulfilling them, with all the “garments” of the laws,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">473</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Apparently, he means “all the outward details and observances of the laws,” without their deeper meanings.</i> he will set faith in his heart, and will see with perfect clarity that God is the Creator and Ruler of the universe, whose providence extends to the minutest details of creation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">474</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Before accepting the Torah at Sinai, the nation of Israel declared as one, “We will do, and we will hear.” The Torah view is that one should fulfill the mitzvot even before “hearing”; that is, understanding their rational. </i> And the more a person accepts and builds fences<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">475</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The sages of the Talmud enacted many laws that serve to distance a person from transgressing or failing to fulfill the Torah’s commandments. These are called “fences” (“gedarim” or “siyagim”), for just as a fence protects a house or garden, so do Rabbinic injunctions protect the Divinely ordained laws of the Torah. One simple example is the prohibition of eating meat immediately after milk, or even together, if they are uncooked. The Torah prohibits only meat and milk that has been cooked together. However, the Rabbis instituted further strictures, so that people should not come to stumble in the Torah’s law itself.</i> around the law, out of his growing love for the Torah and its mitzvot, the more the light that is in it will refine his heart and illuminate his eyes to the inner nature of the Torah, as the Zohar says (Vayeitse, 154b): From this we learn how through the revealed Torah, one arrives at the hidden mysteries of the Torah. The more one increases in his knowledge of the inner mysteries of the Torah, the more his faith will be strengthened in every detail of his Torah observance."

        "An exposition of the idea of Divine Providence": [
            "<small>(From the <i>Tiferet Ha-Hanokhi </i>of Rabbi Gershon Henoch of Radzin, Parshat Vayeira.)</small>",
            "The views of God’s providence on creation are well known.",
            "1.) As the Rambam teaches us in the <i>Guide</i> (third section, chapter 17), the most incorrect view in this matter is that of the heretics who claim that God exercises no providence whatsoever over existence, but rather, the world runs purely by chance, and all that happens is merely accidental. This view is rooted in the Primordial Serpent (in the Garden), which brings darkness and obscurity to the world. In the Beit Yaakov on Parshat Bereshit (64-65), the holy Rav explains that throughout the verses of creation in the beginning of the Torah, the name YHVH (the Tetragrammaton) is not mentioned until the creation of man. Prior to this, only the name Elo-him is used. However, the beginning of the Serpent’s incitement lay in concealing the name YHVH, for when he began to speak to Eve, he said, “Did Elo-him say that you shall not eat from every tree in the garden?” This is because the name Elo-him alludes the governance of nature, as we are taught in the writings of the Arizal, that the name Elo-him is the numerical equivalent of word, “nature (<i>hateva</i>).” It is written in the Zohar (Parshat Mishpatim, 108b), “For now, the name Elo-him is not connected to the sacrifice, for if it was, how many <i>elohim aherim</i> (false gods) would sprout ears and join there!” Meaning to say, the Serpent concealed the name YHVH, because it alludes to God’s presence that shines through every garment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">498</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, every seemingly \"external\" aspect of creation that “covers” the Divine Presence.</i> This light was concealed through the Serpent’s incitement, and from then on, it looked as if the world was run by chance. It is written in the Zohar (Pekudei, 244b), “The sixth level is called, ‘the foreskin.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">499</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Zohar here lists six levels, or spiritual forces, that conceal Divinity. The number six always corresponds to the Sefirah of Yesod, which anatomically corresponds to the male member.</i> This and all levels below it are all called, ‘foreskin,’ because they draw their power from this aspect. This is within the secret of the bar-like serpent, (<i>nahash bariah</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">500</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Yeshayahu 27:1, and Iyov, 26:13.</i> referring to the masculine force of evil), which nurses the crooked serpent (<i>nahash alkalaton</i> – its female).’”",
            "This is akin to the foreskin which covers the <i>brit milah</i>, which conceals the light.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">501</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, just as the foreskin covers the glans, so God’s revelation is concealed by this particular force of evil.</i> The root of the Serpent includes the three <i>klipot</i> (husks, forces of evil) seen in the prophet Yehezkel’s vision of the Chariot, the storm wind (<i>ruah sa’arah</i>), the great cloud (<i>anan</i>), and the burning fire (<i>eish mitlakahat</i>). The final letters of these three <i>kelipot</i> (<i>anaN, ruaH, eiSH</i>) spell the word snake (<i>nahash</i>). This is because every <i>kelipah</i> that contains a great power of concealment touches the source of the Serpent.",
            "2.) The second view is that of the Moslem sect of the Asha’riah, who claim that everything is God’s will, and that nothing created has any volition whatsoever, that everything that happens is only a result of God’s decree. They assert that wisdom is totally hidden from man. Within this view there are different opinions. Some of them will say that even a lack of action is also created by individual providence at every moment. At the root of their view is that nothing in the world has anything to do with the action it produces, the writer is not writing, the pen is not a writing instrument, nothing physical ever acts. The final force in everything is God. They claim that there is no action that produces a result. Every minute detail is constantly coming from God, and everyone’s abilities and actions are constantly being created.",
            "Just as every motion is created at every instant, so is the absence of action created. Thus death is not the absence of life and darkness is not the absence of light (since absence is itself a creation.) For a living being, life is newly created at every moment, and for the dead, God also creates the state of death at every instance. The present is not the present, but it is constantly being renewed. All is a result of God’s initial decree. For instance, the blackness of the color black is constantly being recreated every millisecond, as is the whiteness of white, or any color. The view adopted by the Asha’ariah is that the entire creation is a result of God’s initial will without any reason. See more on this in the <i>Guide </i>(Section Three, Chapter 17, and Section One, Chapter 73).",
            "The Zohar, Bereshit 22b, calls this position the governance of the “<i>Eelat al kol ha’eelot</i>,” or the “Cause of all causes.” See also the Tikkunei Zohar, Tikkun 67 (Page 98b) which says, “In the place of <i>Atzilut</i> (the World of Emanation) there is no sin and no death.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">502</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, the position that everything is under G-d’s constant control does have its roots in Judaism. Indeed, Izhbitz hasidism is famous for asserting this rule. The author, however, attributes this reality to the highest spiritual world – the World of Atzilut – and not necessarily to our human perception in this mundane world. The idea that there are two perspectives on reality: a human one, in which free will exists, and a supernal one in which only Divine providence exists, is found throughout Izhbitzer writings. (See, for instance, Tzidkat HaTzaddik §40.) This dichotomy of perception is one of the central themes of the Introduction to the Beit Yaakov, found above.</i>.",
            "3.) According to the other branch of Asha’ariah philosophy, created beings have a limited ability to act and have power in their actions. God is all-knowing, and man can effect actions. It seems that according to their view, every action is really coming from God, it is just that man can use the power of resistance to constrain the action. This idea is found in the Talmud (Sanhedrin, 94b) when it discusses Sancherib, king of Assyria.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">503</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Talmud (Sanhedrin, 94b) writes, “ ‘After these things, and the truth thereof, Sancherib, king of Assyria, came and entered into the land of Yehuda, and encamped against the walled cities, and thought to win them for himself’ (Divrei HaYamim 2, 32:1). Is such a reward fit for such a gift? (For in the previous verse says that Hizkiya, king of Yehuda, did that which was good and true before God, serving God and the Torah with all his heart, and prospered.) Why does the verse say, ‘After these things and the truth thereof’? Ravina said: After God had hurried and made an oath (to bring Sancherib; the word, “true,” in the verse refers to God’s oath.) God reasoned it as follows. If I say to Hizkiya, ‘I will bring Sancherib and deliver him into your hands’, he will reply, ‘I want neither the ultimate victory over him nor the preceding terror!’ Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, circumvented his objection by swearing that He would bring him.” The implication here is that although God willed for Sancherib to come, Hizkiya could have refused and prevented it. Thus, G-d had to make an unbreakable oath first, to avoid this situation. </i> This view of providence is the root of the <i>kelipah</i> of Assyria. This is why those who adhere to this philosophy are called <i>Asha’ariah</i>, as it comes from the kelipah of <i>Assyria</i>. According to the Talmud, Sancherib thought that his victory was absolutely ordained by God. Yet indeed man has the ability to limit or prevent the action. It follows, then, that man can increase the length of his life and coerce the power of action as he wishes. This philosophy contains aspects of the Asha’ariah, and aspects of the Mu’tazilites. This philosophy contends that man has no power to serve God, and that there is no place for the service of God. Similarly, according to this view, there is no punishment for going against God’s will.",
            "This view is similar to that of the Midrash (Bereshit Rabbah, 19), where the Serpent incites man to sin by claiming that all later created beings rule over all earlier created ones. Since man was created last, he rules over all. According to this, absence, which is the opposite of existence, is in man’s control. Therefore, when man eats (the fruit), he will impose a limit so that nothing else will be created.",
            "4.) It is the view of the Mu’tazilites that man has a limited power to act as he chooses, yet everything that happens are not the result of man’s actions. It is only God who knows what will happen, and all acts of God are a result of His wisdom. This depth of God’s wisdom, however, is hidden from man, and we have no way of knowing it. Still, everything is for the good. This view contains many contradictions which are pointed out in the <i>Guide</i> (Section Three, Chapter 17, and Section One, Chapter 73).",
            "Some of the Mu’tazilites say that there is no absence unto itself in any situation. They would say that darkness is not the absence of light, but is itself a special creation. So too, the lack of immobility is itself created and is not the absence of motion. However, they contend that there are forms of absence that do not exist,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">504</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, they are not created entities, but result from the lack of something else.</i> like weariness, which is the absence of strength, or stupidity, which is the absence of wisdom. Also according to this philosophy, everything is drawn from God’s hidden wisdom.",
            "5.) Aristotle’s view is that certain things in the world are controlled by Divine providence, arranged and led by a guiding force, whereas other things are left up to chance. Divine providence extends to and ends with the sphere of the moon.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">505</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This follows the ancient cosmological idea that the heavens are arranged in concentric circles, with the earth at the center. To Aristotle, G-d’s providence ruled over and directed all of these spheres, down to that of the moon, which is just above that of the earth.</i> This is part of his theory of the eternity of the universe, and that the world has necessary existence, just as a man must have a shadow. It is the nature of God’s relationship with his creation that His providence extends to the roots of things but not to their particulars.",
            "In the third section of the <i>Guide</i>, chapter 23, the Rambam ascribes these views to Iyov and his friends. Iyov held Aristotle’s view, Eliphaz that of our Holy Torah, Bildad was like the Mu’tazilites and Tsofar like the Asha’riah.",
            "The Rambam says that Elihu’s words were similar to the other speakers, except his claim that an angel can occasionally intercede to pray for man and thus help him, as it is written, “If there be an angel with him, an interpreter, among a thousand, to show unto man his uprightness.” (Iyov, 33:29) A reading of the book of Iyov will show all of the above-mentioned views.",
            "Indeed we find it written in the Zohar (176b), “We learn from this that one who is going to console a mourner needs to prepare his words in order that they will bring consolation. Iyov’s friends spoke words of truth, but said nothing to console him.” The Zohar says that they all spoke the truth, so we cannot say that these views on Divine providence are all philosophies totally foreign to the Torah. Indeed the Zohar proves also that Eliphaz’s view was not completely in harmony with the Torah, either. Elihu, however, did offer a solution to the problem of theodicy called “<i>Tzaddik vetov lo, tzaddik verah lo</i> – a righteous person who prospers, and a righteous person who suffers.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">506</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Talmud (Berachot, 7a) offers several solutions to the problem of theodicy; that is, the seemingly unjust suffering of the righteous. It states that “When a righteous person prospers, it means that he himself is righteous and is the son of a righteous father. A righteous person who suffers is himself righteous, though his father was wicked.” The Talmud questions the validity of this answer, since another verse states, “…sons shall not be put to death because of fathers; each man shall be put to death for his own transgression” (Devarim 24:16). In other words, a righteous person should not suffer on account of his father’s actions. The Talmud clarifies its view by stating, “When the righteous prospers, it means that he is perfectly righteous, but when the righteous suffers, it means that he is not perfectly righteous.”</i> This is as the Zohar says (Pinchas, 116b), “Iyov was the son of a levirate marrage.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">507</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Devarim, 25:5. If a man dies without fathering children, his brother is required to marry his widow to keep his name alive. Stating that Iyov was the son of levirate marriage implies that though he was righteous, his father probably was not, inasmuch as the whole process of leveritic marriage is understood as a kind of Divine punishment. According to R. Gershon Hanokh, Elihu apparently understood the Talmud’s first position (see previous note), inasmuch as Iyov was “a righteous person whose father was wicked.”</i> Elihu’s words enlightened Iyov to the depth of God’s governance of the world, as tte Zohar<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">508</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Perhaps referring to the Zohar on Parshat Mishpatim which discusses yibum.</i> teaches, that the root and depth of God’s governance is hidden from man, yet from there, everything can be redeemed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">509</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The author writes in his book, the Sod Yesharim, Parshat Mishpatim, that the whole state of being born out of yibum is a rectification for someone who only thought to serve God but never actually brought this thought into action. All of the negative energy within him join together in this good thought and comes to fruition after he dies in his son born through the yavam and the yavama (his widow and brother). This soul brings all the light of salvation and revelation of Godliness into the world that he could not. In this way the darkness holds the greatest light. </i> From a straightforward understanding of the statements of Iyov’s friends, we do not see that they deny the idea of Divine reward and punishment. They only say that the depth of God’s wisdom is hidden. Their belief in Divine providence is that it exists in the root of the creation and the essence of existence, but still in these foreign views there is no necessity for reward and punishment. The centrality of reward and punishment is only in the Torah’s view. ",
            "The Zohar explains that with all of their words, none of Iyov’s friends managed to console him, and therefore, he did not accept what they said. It was only Elihu who managed to say something correctly, and therefore, his words were accepted. Iyov immediately attained a level of prophecy in which God answered him. ",
            "The erroneous beliefs are rooted in the powers that God dispensed to the nations. Each one holds grasps onto the external manifestation<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">510</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, “the garment” of these forces.</i> of these forces, when he sees that it contains a certain power unto itself. This is idolatry, as explained above. (See more on this in the Zohar, Parshat Mishpatim, page 108b.) ",
            "Israel’s portion and belief is summed up in the verse (Yermiyahu, 10:16), “The portion of Yaakov is not like them, for He forms all things, and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance; the Lord of Hosts is His name.” Israel believes in God, even though He appears to run the world in numerous contradictory ways. For example, sometimes God shows His supernal governance, where He awakens the initial benevolence of the creation of the world, which occurred without any initiatory gesture on the part of the creation, as it is written (Tehillim, 25:6), “Remember Your mercies and loving kindness, O God, for they have been as of old (from the very creation of the world).”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">511</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meaning to say, the world currently functions in terms of cause and effect. Human beings act – for good or for bad – and G-d responds in kind, bestowing blessing or curses. However, the creation of the world occurred before there were any beings below to awaken the flow of blessing from above. Thus, it was an act of pure, Divine kindness. There are times, even now, when G-d relates to creation in this way, bestowing blessing and goodness gratuitously, and not in accordance with the deeds of His creatures.</i> Indeed, in the beginning there was nothing yet created that could wake up and inspire God’s response, so He created the world out of His pure will.",
            "At other times God conducts the world through revealed governance, and there is a correspondence between the suffering endured and the reward. Sometimes it seems as if man has the power of choice, and at other times it is seen that the power of choice is taken away from him. This is as it is said in the Talmud (Pirkei Avot, 3:15), “Everything is foreseen, yet permission is given (for man to make his own choices).” ",
            "God’s justice decides when one form of governance or another takes effect in the world. Yet all derives from a single source, and no mode of governance contradicts another. God sees from the very beginning to the very end. He rules in totality and in every detail. "
