                    "<i>“In the beginning God created ….”</i> (Bereshit, 1:1)<br>“Created” means strengthening. In the beginning, God strengthened and reinforced the foundations so that they could receive the creation. This is like a king who builds a treasure house. First, he strengthens the foundations and the walls so they can receive his treasures. The heavens and the earth are the foundations of the universe, which correspond in a human being to the mind and the heart. When a person wants to live according to God’s will and become a complete creation, he needs to fortify and strengthen these two foundations. In other words, he must hand over his intellect and thoughts, and his most heartfelt desires to God, crowning God over them, so that he uses them only according to His will. This is as Rabbi Israel, the holy Baal Shem Tov, taught: “A person is entirely where his thoughts are.” This is also the meaning of the verse, “My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes follow My ways” (<i>Mishlei</i>, 23:26). That is, if you give Me your thoughts, then you will naturally follow My ways. For when you commit your heart to God, serving Him will become primary in your life, and all worldly concerns secondary. This is like a rich man who has a wise and wonderful son whom he betroths to a woman befitting his honor. When he prepares the wedding banquet and tastes the food, all he thinks of is the joy of his son, while the taste of the food is secondary.",
                    "<i>“And God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light.”</i> (Bereshit, 1:3)<br>It is said in the Midrash (<i>Bereshit</i> <i>Rabbah</i>, 1:1), “Rabbi Ushaya Rabba opened, (Mishlei, 8:30) ‘And I was as one brought up with him, and I delighted in him each day.’ Ammon, or ‘brought up,’ means like a tutor.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Esther 2:7, “and he brought [<i>omman</i>] up Hadassa, that is, Esther.”</i> Also, ‘Ammon,’ he was well covered. ‘Ammon,’ he was hidden [or well cared for]. There are those who say, ‘Ammon,’ is the name of the capital (in Egypt, Alexandria was once called ‘Ammon.’)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This has another translation. <i>Ammon</i> means famous.</i> Another interpretation: ‘Ammon’ is an artisan.” <br>We find these five interpretations of <i>Ammon</i> in man, who goes through five states of being from the beginning of his existence until his final completion. At first, when his father and mother conceive him, he is completely hidden, unrecognizable to any part of creation. The second state of being occurs when he is formed in his mother’s womb and becomes recognizable as a separate entity. The third, when he is born and his existence is complete. Then, all see how he a separate entity. The fourth, when he is weaned from his mother’s breast and begins to act on his own. And the fifth, when he marries a wife and begins to create new beings, built as an everlasting structure. It is towards this end that was he created. <br>And thus, we find these five states of being in the creation of the world, which emerged from nothing and from being completely hidden to become revealed and substantive. At first the creation was called “brought up in secret,” for it was included in God’s essence, may He be blessed, and there was no sign of it emanating from Him. This was the first state of being. When the creation emanated from God and began to become revealed, it entered the second state of being, called “brought up, well covered.” This is the secret of the embryonic state, which is well covered. Afterwards, it became further revealed, called “brought up as by a tutor.” These three states of being are the first three hidden <i>sefirot: Keter</i> (crown), <i>Chochmah</i> (wisdom), and <i>Binah</i> (understanding).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These aspects are hidden, just as the intellectual faculties are hidden in the head, and thought is hidden from external recognition.</i> The Midrash explains these three <i>sefirot</i> from below to above. First, “raised as by a tutor” is <i>Binah</i>, “raised well covered” is <i>Chochma</i>, and “raised in secret” is <i>Keter</i>, the <i>sefira</i> so concealed that it is called “in secret.”<br>Afterwards it revealed itself even more, called “Ammon the capital” (literally: “Greater Ammon”) as the creation began to enlarge. This is the meaning of being weaned from the mother’s breast. Afterwards, “Ammon is an artisan,” where the creation emerges into complete revelation, and started to create new creatures, according to His will. This is why we make the blessing, “who formed man in His image,” under the wedding canopy, and not at birth. Because when a person is born, he is not yet complete; only when he marries and begins to make new beings.<br>This is what the Torah means when it says, “and the world was <i>tohu u’vohu</i>, chaos and void.” From the moment of conception until the embryo becomes apparent, it is called <i>tohu</i>, chaos or unformed. Once it is recognized it is called <i>bohu</i>, void; that is, seeing something and not knowing what it is. The nine months of pregnancy are called “and darkness on the face of the abyss.” At that time, though the outcome is not yet clear, we hope for and anticipate the birth. Thus we call it, “the abyss.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meaning, something deep and unrecognizable, which we long to know clearly.</i> “And the spirit of God hovered” is the moment when the woman gives birth, when both mother and child hover closer to death than life, as we find in the Midrash and Gemara (<i>Vayikra Rabba</i>, 27:7). “And God said, let there be light,” means complete salvation. The five times the verses mention, “light” correspond to the five states, mentioned above. The last one is “and God called the light day,” in which God realizes all of His intentions in creating the world.",
                    "<i>“And God said, let us make a man ….”</i> (Bereshit, 1:26)<br>In the beginning God created His creation. Afterwards, the creation understood that it was lacking, with nothing to connect its vitality to God. For it is man who connects all aspects of creation to God, and who raises everything back up. Inanimate matter gives power to vegetation, vegetation to animals, and animals to Man. Then, when a person serves God with all his strength, he uplifts all the energies he received from this world, even from the inanimate realm. When the creation saw its deficiency, it effected an awakening from below and desired the creation of man. When God said, “let us make a man,” He was addressing the entirety of creation, summoning every part of creation to give of its power and join in the creation of man, so that man would have a portion in all of them. Then, if man should need anything, they would all be able to help him, for his evil behavior would harm them, as in the generation of the flood, while his good behavior would benefit them.",
                    "<i>“And thus the heavens and the earth were completed and all their host.”</i> (Bereshit, 2:1)<br>The holy Rav of Pshiske, Reb Simcha Bunem, may the mention of the <i>Tsaddik</i> be for a blessing in this world and the world to come (the author’s Rebbe), said that nowhere in all of Torah and Scripture is the creation of the earth is called a host.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or army, <i>tsvah</i> in Hebrew.</i> Yet from the time that the people Israel came into the world, the earth was also called a host. <br>A host is a multitude united under the one who unifies them, such as an army unified under a king. So in the heavens it is conceivable to use the term host, for there His sovereignty and oneness is recognized over the host of Heaven. It is clear that He rules over them and unifies them. Therefore it says each time, “the host of heavens.” Yet in this world, where idolaters deny the providence of the Holy One, blessed be He, it is inconceivable to use the term “host,” regarding them rather as, <i>tse’etsaim</i> (descendnats). Take for instance, “He has spread forth the earth and all that which came out of it [<i>tse’etsaeha</i>],” where “that which came out of it” (Yesahya 42:5) signifies spreading forth. Thus when Israel came into the world and recognized that God rules over all, publicly proclaiming God’s name, then even in this world the land was also called “host.”",
                    "<i>“And thus the heavens and the earth were completed and all their host.”</i> (Bereshit, 2:1)<br>It is written in the Gemara, “whosoever says the verse, ‘thus the heavens and the earth were completed,’ is made a partner with the Holy One, blessed be He, in the act of creation.” (<i>Shabbat</i>, 119b) We find that the main point of the creation of the world was so that Israel could recognize God’s sovereignty and oneness. In this way Avraham Avinu began to use this new kind of consciousness to call in the name of God as the Lord of the land (not just of the heavens), and each soul in Israel yearns for this. Were it not for this the heavens and the earth would not be able to endure, as we find in the Gemara, “It would be well for Israel to receive the Torah, for if not this place will be your graves.” (<i>Shabbat</i>, 88b)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Another example from the same page of Gemara could also be used here, which Rashi quotes on the previous verse. With <i>Yom HaShishi</i>, the sixth day, the Torah adds the letter <i>Hei</i>, whose numerical equivalent is five, to the word <i>shishi</i>, sixth, at the completion of the work of creation. This was to say that He stipulated with all that He had created thus far that they would remain in existence only on the condition that Israel would receive the five books of the Torah.</i> Whoever recognizes and declares God’s sovereignty in the world completes the creation, for here we equate speech to action. And whoever recognizes the Shabbat, crowning God over all He has made in the six days of creation, though he is finite and frail mortal compared to God, he proclaims judgment on the two angels who accompany him, the good inclination and the evil inclination. Then together they place their hands on his head and say, “your transgression is removed and your sin is atoned for.”",
                    "<i>“And God caused every tree pleasant to the sight and good to eat to sprout from the land, and the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.”</i> (Bereshit, 2:9)<br>This verse hints at four trees. “Pleasant to the sight” corresponds to the <i>tsaddik</i> who occupies himself with mitzvot and good deeds, which are like garments both he and his fellow man find beautiful, such as giving charity and guarding the <i>brit</i>, or guarding himself from unbridled lust. In the <i>Pirkei Avot</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Pirke Avot</i>, 2:1. What is the proper way in which man should choose for himself? A way that brings honor to the one who goes in it, and honor from his fellow man.</i> this is called <i>tiferet l’osei’ha</i>, or “bringing splendor and honor for the one who acts in this way,” as is explained in its place. The tree that is “good to eat” means one whose outside appearance is not so beautiful, since he has no great need of strengthening himself in mitzvot and good deeds as he is very good in his essence. This is called (ibid.) <i>tiferet lo min ha’adam</i>, or “appreciated<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">also honored.</i> as beautiful by his fellow man.” He is good and beautiful both internally and externally. “The tree of knowledge” is one who is in a state of constant uncertainty as to the nature of God’s will, corresponding to all the <i>eebayot</i> in the Gemara. (This term, which translates, “if you want say,” is a term which either proposes alternate solutions or raises legal problems. Yet in our context it refers to uncertainty.) “The tree of life” is true <i>teshuvah</i>, repentance and return to the way of the Torah, which heals all that came before.<br>Corresponding to these four trees are the four rivers that water them. The river Pishon waters the tree that is good to eat, for <i>pishon</i> denotes greatness and spreading forth, for when we use <i>notarikon</i> the name PISHon refers to <i>hitPASHtut</i>, or spreading forth. He whose goodness is from his very roots may allow himself to spread forth much as he wants, as all that he does is God’s will. This is the river that “circles the whole land of Havilla where there is gold.” The river Gihon waters the tree that is pleasant to the sight, for “Gihon” signifies modesty, as in <i>holech al gichon</i>, or “moving on the belly” where its movements are not recognized. In other words, a <i>tsaddik</i> on the surface. This river circles the land of Cush, and he is one who is not yet complete in the depths of his heart<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">perhaps referring to Ham son of Noah, who was flawed.</i> and needs to strengthen himself in mitzvot and good deeds in order to clean out the refuse of his soul.<br>The third river is Hidekkel, and it waters the tree of knowledge of good and evil. The Midrash says, “Hidekkel is <i>had</i> (sharp) and <i>kal</i> (light),” (<i>Bereshit</i> Rabba 16:7) like a man on a narrow bridge who wavers from side to side about to fall, as mentioned above concerning uncertainties in the Gemara. It flows “from the east of Ashur,” which is restraint, as “Ashur” connotes restraint<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“And the exiles shall come back from the land of Ashur,” the strength it takes to return from a state of confusion.</i> since he is unsure and thus restrains himself, and we have established that “all who are in doubt are to follow the stricture.” The river Prat (Euphrates) waters the tree of life, as it says in the Gemara (<i>Bechorot</i>, 55b), “Prat came first.” It was the first river and the source of the other three. In this way the river Prat corresponds to <i>ba’alei teshuva</i> who have returned to the way of God’s, back to the source, and <i>teshuva</i> heals all that came before and all that was lacking from the day of our birth. Thus the Talmud in <i>Bechorot</i> tells us the Prat was the first river to come out of Eden, signifying how <i>teshuva</i> reaches back to the source.",
                    "<i>“And the gold of that land is good ….”</i> (Bereshit, 2:12)<br>Gold signifies reproof.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As it is written (Mishlei, 25:12), “Gold earrings and ornaments of fine gold are a wise reprover.” On this it says that the gold of that land is good, as it is written (Malachi, 3:12), “and you shall be the land of your desires,” and this connects the land to the aspect of the <i>Tsaddik</i>. <i>Tashlum Mei Hashiloach</i>. [Note: The footnotes marked “Tashlum” are the explanatory notes from the author’s grandson, Mordechai Yosef of Lublin. All footnotes marked “<i>Giliyon</i>” are the emendations of his brother, Gershon Chenoch of Radzin.]</i> “And there is the bedellium [<i>bedolach</i>, in Hebrew, or crystal] and the onyx stone (<i>shoham</i>),” means that in the land of Israel there is the place of the Holy Temple, the location of the true fear of God, hinted at in <i>bedolach</i>, as we shall see below. The <i>shoham</i> hints at the true love of God, as it is written (<i>Tehilim</i>, 5:8), “and I, in Your great kindness, will come to Your house and prostrate myself towards Your holy chamber in the fear of You [<i>b’yirateiCha</i>].” The last letter, “<i>caf</i>,” (“of You”) in <i>b’yirateicha</i> teaches of the true fear of God. Thus we have in the Mishna <i>Middot</i> (3:7), “the height of the antechamber [<i>ulam</i>] in the Holy Temple was 40 [<i>mem</i>] cubits, and its width was 20 [<i>caf</i>] cubits, and it had five ceiling beams, progressively a cubit longer on each side until the last one was 30 cubits [<i>lamed</i>].”<br>We find in the height and width of the antechamber and in the extension of the ceiling beams the letters of <i>melech</i> or “king.” Its height was 40 (<i>mem</i>), its width 20 (<i>caf</i>), the first beam was 20 (<i>caf</i>), and the last 30 (<i>lamed</i>). This teaches that from there went forth the true fear of God, as the measurement of the beams hint at the letters of <i>bedoloach</i>. Each one extended a cubit more than the previous one on either side, the first totaling two (<i>bet</i>), the second totaling four (<i>dalet</i>), the third totaling six (<i>vav</i>) and the fourth totaling eight (<i>het</i>). The last one was thirty (<i>lamed</i>) cubits long (all together spelling <i>b’daloach</i>). The onyx (<i>shoham</i>) stone hints at the love of God, for it is the stone that corresponds to Yosef, who is the sefirah of Yesod (foundation), which is filled with Divine flow of abundance (as it receives and collects all the Divine energies from the eight sefirot above it).<br>Thus in the holy Zohar, when it wants to say that also joy and blessing also spread forth from the <i>sefirah</i> of <i>Binah</i> (understanding, above in the hidden intellectual faculties), it does so by comparing it to Yesod. There it is written (Zohar <i>Shemot</i>, 135b), “the word <i>baruch</i> in <i>barchu</i> brings forth blessing from the source of life, the place which brings forth all saturation to water everything [which is <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Binah</i>. Sulam]. Since it is the source from where God’s abundance flows forth in the secret of the sign of the <i>brit milah</i> [<i>Yesod</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>] it is called ‘<i>hamevurach</i> [blessed],’ the spring flowing from the well [which is Binah].” This is not within mortal power to apprehend, for there is only blessing with something that is hidden from the eye. In a place where you find <i>Binah</i> it is inconceivable to use the term <i>bracha</i>, blessing, for it understands everything.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Binah</i> is the source of understanding, and thus revealed below.</i> Yet with God, “<i>haBina vehaBracha lechai olamim</i>,” “understanding and blessing to God, Life everlasting.”",
                    "<i>“And God commanded man, saying, from all the trees in the garden you may surely eat. And from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil do not eat ….”</i> (Bereshit, 2:16–17)<br>In the future, when the sin of Adam will be fixed, then the verse will be rearranged, “from all the trees in the garden you may surely eat and from the tree of the knowledge of good,” and after that the next verse will begin, “And evil do not eat.” Then we will eat the good in the tree and not the evil. And God will make it clear that he only ate the good, and the sin was regarded by God as insignificant as a peel of garlic and no more.",
                    "<i>“… I will make him a helper opposite him.”</i> (Bereshit, 2:18)<br>It is the Creator’s will that salvation comes to man from that which opposes him, like the challenges of a student to a teacher.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From the thoughtful criticisms and challenges of the teacher the student may strengthen his position.</i> We find this in the Gemara (<i>Baba Metsia</i>, 84b) with R. Shimon ben Lakish offered twenty-four challenges to every argument of Reb Yochanan, who would return with twenty-four possible solutions. In this way the law was clarified and settled. After Reish Lakish died, Reb Elazar would respond to Reb Yochanan with “there is a teaching that supports your words,” which did not help at all. Reb Yochanan needed to be challenged, so he would walk along, tearing his clothes, saying, “where are you Reish Lakish? Where are you Reish Lakish?” The challenge inspires the other to strengthen his argument with greater proofs and clarifies his position.",
                    "<i>“[said the snake to the woman] Did God say to you do not eat ….”</i> (Bereshit, 3:1)<br>“The Torah of God is perfect, restoring the soul.” This is akin to returning a lost article, for God gave the Torah in order to restore the lack imprinted in man from the day of his birth. So when God said to Adam, “and from the tree of knowledge do not eat,” the snake jumped at the chance to expose man’s deficiency. So it is when an adversary wishes to bring out the deficiency in his opponent and to trap him in his imperfection. When man was forbidden from eating from the tree of knowledge it was because he had a deficiency in this particular kind of eating. Truly, Adam was also frightened in that it was even necessary for God to draw this boundary for him, as will be explained, so therefore the snake jumped in and caused him to fail. Similarly we find (<i>Devarim</i>, 25:11), “when two people are struggling … and she grabs hold of his shame.” Here one shames another with his opponent’s deficiency. Therefore the law is, “and cut off her hand,” which really means to seize all of the merit from the one who put the other to shame, and give it over to the shamed, for everywhere the Torah says, <i>“Caf”</i> or “hand,” it really means right hand, or merit (<i>Menachot</i>, 9b). In this way judgment fell back upon the snake. God cut his hands and legs off, and cursed him to walk on its belly as a punishment for deceitfully directing Adam’s deficiency against him.",
                    "<i>“And Adam said, the woman who You gave to be with me gave me of the tree ….”</i> (Bereshit, 3:12)<br>This is truly the mistake of Adam and his sin. God said, “I will make him a helper opposite him,” since when Adam was forbidden from eating from the tree, he became terribly frightened. He said to himself, “certainly God made this forbidden to me only because He knows that I am deficient.” Then, when God created Chava (Eve) and gave her to him as a helper and to act according to her understanding, just as we find with Avraham Avinu (<i>Bereshit</i> 21:12), “everything that Sarah tells you, you are to listen to her,” Adam was put at ease. Adam understood that “the woman who You gave to be with me” meant that it would be permitted to eat if she said it was. <br>The sin of Adam is related to what we find in the Gemara (<i>Kiddushin</i>, 70b), “if someone teaches a law, if he teaches it before he does an action pertaining to it, you listen to him. However, if he does it pertaining to an action that he has just done, do not listen to him,” for maybe he is just saying it to justify the action he has just performed. Similarly here, that even though he was supposed to listen to the woman, nonetheless since she had already performed the action he shouldn’t have listened to her when she gave him to eat. Her claim was “the snake tricked me, and I ate,” the snake seduced me and caused me to lust. The snake’s explanation was that all desire comes from God. And truly, Adam himself gave the name “<i>nachash</i> [snake],” to the snake, meaning a cheat, which is <i>m’nachesh</i>, a diviner, beguiling and hypocritical, one who deceives another into thinking that something is from God. As Adam had given the snake his very name and thus knew its true nature, he should he should have increased his vigilance when he sensed something was wrong.",
                    "<i>“Thorn and thistle will it sprout for you ….”</i> (Bereshit, 3:18)<br>The matter of this curse is, “thorn,” evil ones who will stand from it. “Thistle [<i>dardar</i>],” concerns all the controversies among <i>tsaddikim</i>, even the true controversies written in the Gemara, for thistle (<i>dardar</i>) is the numerical equivalent of two times “<i>tsaddik</i>” (408).",
                    "<i>“[God to Cain] If you do well, will it not be raised?”</i> (Bereshit, 4:7)<br>The first sin emerged in the world from the power of jealousy. Even though it seems clear that Cain had a reasonable complaint, for he was the one who was first moved to bring a sacrifice. It seemed to Cain that his brother Hevel, who brought a sacrifice afterwards, was doing it only because it was expected of him. Therefore Cain had a powerful grudge against against God. Yet in truth Hevel waited to bring his sacrifice until he understood the reason and even the secret of the <i>avodah</i> (service). Therefore it is not considered as if he was just bringing the sacrifice because his brother did. Therefore God appeared to Cain and asked him why he is so angry and despondent, for if Cain had no legitimate claim, God would not have appeared to him. In other words, if you improve your heart to yearn for an accepted <i>avodah</i>, without any jealousy or selfish motives, then it will be raised, or rather, elevated in your levels to the highest heights. “Raise” or <i>seit</i> in Hebrew signifies the priesthood, as in (<i>Vayikra</i> 9:22), “<i>Vayisa Aharon</i>,” “and Aharon raised,” meaning that you will serve according to your own yearning, but not according to the level of your brother, for each man has a level unto himself.",
                    "<i>“… and if you do not do well, sin crouches at the entrance.”</i> (Bereshit, 4:7)<br>Man can only return to God is while he is still alive, for as long as he is alive the sin is not considered permanent, and he may still return. Yet, “at the entrance,” meaning when the vitality is drained from man, then “the sin crouches,” and he can no longer get up. This is as we find in the Gemara (<i>Baba Batra</i>, 74a), “Now the congregation of Korach are constantly saying, ‘Moshe is true and the Torah is true,’ but it does not save them from <i>gehinom</i>.” Their words are not coming from the depths of their hearts, and the attitude that one has in this world stays with him forever. If in their lifetimes they had said, “Moshe is true and the Torah is true,” God would have saved them.",
                    "<i>“This is the book of the generations of man, in the day that God created man, in His image [</i>D’mut<i>] …”</i> (Bereshit, 5:1)<br>The secret of the matter of <i>tselem</i> (form) and <i>d’mut</i> (image). <i>Tselem</i> means the body of life without any expansion, like an infant, immediately when he is born, at the first moment he is called <i>tselem</i>. Afterwards his desires begin to expand. For instance, his appetite for food causes him to eat, thus growing and expand until he is large in both thickness and stature. This kind of expansion is called <i>d’mut</i>. And so it is in the soul, that the first drop of Torah that enters into man is called <i>tselem</i>, and the desire with which he yearns for the Torah is called <i>d’mut</i>, for by means of this desire he continually adds more and more to his study of the Torah. This is why it says, “On the day that God created man, in the <i>d’mut</i> of God He created him,” telling us that the main point in creating man was in order that he have an ever greater desire for the Torah. This is the meaning of the statement of our sages (<i>Berachot</i>, 7b), “the service of the Torah is greater than its study,” for the service of the Torah is called the desire. And this is also the meaning of “the book of the generations of man,” where if man merits being both the <i>tselem</i> and the <i>d’mut</i>, he will then constantly see renewal of the Torah, enjoying many years and generations, and the length of days."
                ],
                "Noach": [
                    "<i>“These are the generations of Noach … Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood ….”</i> (Bereshit, 4:9–14)<br>Concerning the ark, God gave Noach advice and protection until the days of wrath would pass, and similarly all whose hearts are not yet refined can receive advice from the ark as to how to find refuge and protection from all evil that upsets the world. Thus we find in the words of our sages (<i>Tanna Dvei Eliyahu Rabba</i>, Ch. 6), “If a man sees that suffering is coming upon him, he is to run to the inner chambers of the Torah, and it will give him advice as to how to survive.” Advice from the ark based on that is written in the Gemara (<i>Pesachim</i>, 113b), “There are three whom the Holy One, blessed be He, loves—one who does not get angry, one who does not get drunk, and one who forgives.”<br>One who does not get angry is one who does not show any anger through actions. One who does not get drunk is one who possesses a settled mind, recognizing and believing in the Creator of the world. One who forgives means one who removes the anger from his heart, not leaving in his heart any grudges against his fellow man. The ark hints at these three aspects. “Make yourself an ark of gopher wood” means not to get angry, for gopher (<i>gaphrit</i>) or brimstone teaches of anger (cf. Rashi, ad. loc.) We are rather to take the anger and make an ark out of it, to make it a closed structure. Close the anger inside and don’t reveal it in external actions. “Make rooms in the ark” teaches of the next stage, order. In other words, don’t act like a drunk in a state of disorder, but rather attain peace of mind, for one who has many rooms must have a sense of order to know the location and function of each one. The order of the Mishna called <i>Kanim</i> teaches of this.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Kan</i> means nest, hence room; thus, organization of space. The <i>mishnayot</i> in <i>Kanim</i> deals with sacrifices brought from birds.</i>Therefore one who doesn’t have peace of mind and a pure heart cannot understand the true depths of the Torah in the order of <i>Kanim</i>. “Seal it from within and without with pitch.” This is the third stage. Do away with all anger and forgive. “Sealing with pitch” or “<i>ve’chaparta</i>” in Hebrew is comprised of the same letters as “atonement,” <i>capara</i>, meaning to atone from the depth of your heart, so as not to leave even a residue of the anger against your fellow man. <br>With the very measurements of the ark we may derive the word for tongue, <i>lashon</i> (<i>Lamed Shin Nun</i>) in Hebrew. “Three hundred cubits in length [<i>Shin</i>], fifty in width [<i>Nun</i>], and thirty in height [<i>Lamed</i>],” meaning not to have a lying tongue. Also, these measurements teach of the way of service commanded in the <i>Shema</i>, with all your heart, all of your soul and all of your possessions.”<br>“With all your heart,” or <i>Levaveicha</i>, is <i>Lamed</i> (30). “With all your soul,” or <i>nafsheicha</i>, is <i>Nun</i> (50). “With all your possessions” or <i>me’odeicha</i> is <i>Shin</i> (300), for <i>me’odeicha</i>, “possessions,” also translates as “much,” hence expansion. Thus <i>me’odeicha</i> signifies all one can fathom and expand upon in his mind, and the most one can fathom is hinted at in the letter <i>Shin</i>, the penultimate letter in the alphabet, the most we could ever fathom in our lifetimes. God hid the secret of the final letter of the alphabet, <i>Tav</i>, in the world to come. Furthermore, whenever the sages wanted to express a very large amount they said three hundred (<i>Shin</i>), as in (<i>Chullin</i> 90b), “three hundred <i>kor</i>,” or the three hundred <i>Cohanim</i> in the Mishnaic order <i>Middot</i> (Ch. 3, Mishna 8). <br>“Make a light for the ark” means to know that everything is in God’s hands, as light stands for clarity and knowledge. “Complete it to a cubit from above” means to constrict one’s self in all receptions of Divine effusion, so as not to be greedy.<br>“Place an entrance on the side of the ark,” in other words, similar to the explanation of the Midrash on the verse (<i>Bamidbar</i> Rabba, Ch. 19:16; <i>Tehilim</i>, 34:15), “seek peace and run after it Seek peace where you are, and run after it elsewhere.” This means that as far as you are concerned, do not create any obstacles to peace, rather run after your fellow man in the pursuit of peace to bring him close to you. However, this too is not always necessary, for in everything there is a certain amount of uncertainty. Sometimes we encounter people who are not fit to bring home, yet still we are not supposed to altogether reject them. And this is the meaning of, “place the entrance on the side,” as if to deal with them in a way that is not readily apparent. <br>“Make lower second and third sublevels,” meaning that Noach was commanded to know how to conduct himself with his three sons, each according to his level.<br>With Ham he was to conduct himself on the lower level, speaking to him only on the surface. With Yaphet, on the second, and <i>Shem</i> on the third, with whom Noach could speak from the depth of his heart and reveal all his secrets. All these were advice for Noach as to how to conceal himself before he had achieved completion. Then immediately after he had left the ark and had in fact achieved completion, he proceeded to do the opposite of what he was advised to do. This is as it says, “and he drank and became drunk.” Then he became angry with Ham, not exercising patience. When one achieves true completion it is then permitted for him to extend himself, for in such a state everything is according to God’s will.",
                    "<i>“And he sent out the raven, which went back and forth ….”</i> (Bereshit, 8:7)<br>The raven hints at anger. Noach wanted to rid the world of the attribute of anger, yet the Holy One, blessed be He, showed him that there was still a need for the attribute of anger in the world, for sometimes when an evil desire comes to man he may save himself by entering into a state of anger. This is the meaning of the verse, “the raven went back and forth until the waters dried from the land,” in other words, when evil lusts are eradicated there will be no need for anger, for water represents lust. Therefore in the Holy Temple there was a small hint of this, for there was an “<i>ama caleh oreiv</i>” (Mishna <i>Middot</i>, 4:6), a sharpened plate on the roof one cubit high that prevented ravens from roosting there (representing the eventual eradication of anger).",
                    "<i>“… and God said in His heart, I will no longer curse the earth because of man ….”</i> (Bereshit 8:21)<br>Here Noach knew God’s thoughts.  He had tremendous fear imprinted in his heart after the flood, which led him to understand that it is not befitting for man to extend himself as much as he wants, but must rather curb his spirit. From this he understood that similarly it was God’s will not to curse the land again.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Perhaps because of the new consciousness in man that he must limit his desires. This is reminiscent of a line from the poet William Carlos Williams, “Man has hitherto survived because he has been unable to realize his desires. Now that he can realize them, he must change them, or perish.” One may understand this in reference to the principle of kabbalah that from the physical world we may learn of the attributes of the Divine. Therefore, if such a spirit arose in man that he must limit his desires, so it must have arose with the Omnipotent to refrain from destroying and re-creating the imperfect creation, for as our sages said, “G-d would create and destroy worlds until He created this one.”</i>",
                    "<i>“And shall be fruitful and multiply, swarm in the earth, and multiply therein.”</i> (Bereshit, 9:7)<br>Regarding this, the Midrash (Bereshit Rabba, 34:21) relates the following story. “A disciple of R. Yossi was sitting before him and could not understand his lesson. ‘Why can’t you grasp it?’ he asked. ‘Because I am an exile from home,’ he replied. ‘Where are you from?’ he asked. ‘From Gabat Shanimai,’ he answered. ‘What is the air like there?’ he asked. ‘When a child is born there we need to smear his head with a salve lest insects should eat him,’ he replied. Though the air of his hometown was infested and evil, still he was homesick and could not concentrate. ‘Blessed is He who inspires people with a love for their place!’ he exclaimed. In the future too it will be like this, as it is written (Yechezkel, 36:26), ‘And I will take away the heart of stone from your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh—<i>lev basar</i>,’ a heart which has no envy [<i>boser</i>] of his neighbor’s portion.” <br>The sin of the generation of the flood was envy, where everyone had an evil eye on the portion of his neighbor. On this, God said to Noach, “and you shall swarm in the land,” for “swarming,” <i>shratsu</i> in Hebrew, indicates smallness, like the interpretation of Rashi of blessed memory on the phrase, “swarming creature” (on <i>Bereshit</i> 1:20, where he says, “every living thing that low to the ground is called <i>sherets</i>”). So this is “swarm in the land,” meaning to be satisfied with your portion no matter how small, and not to be jealous of the portion of your neighbor. “And increase therein” means that you will experience ever greater delights from your own portion, and increase therein.",
                    "<i>“And it shall be when I bring clouds over the earth, then the rainbow will appear in the cloud.”</i> (Bereshit, 9:14)<br>“Cloud” signifies fear and the concealment of His presence. “Rainbow” (or simply “bow”) signifies a stronghold. That is to say with powerful fear you shall find great security, and this is what the Holy One, blessed be He, promised Noach. This is as it is said in the holy Zohar (<i>Bereshit</i>, 72b), “do not expect the heels [arrival] of the Messiah until you see the luminous colors of the rainbow.” This means that once the great strengths of God are apparent and explicit before your eyes, then you may expect the arrival of the Messiah. We find this in the question of R. Shimon bar Yochai to R. Yehoshua ben Levi (<i>Ketubot</i>, 77b):<br>As Yehoshua ben Levi proceeded on his way he found R. Shimon bar Yochai sitting on thirteen tables of gold. “Are you,” R. Shimon asked him, “the son of Levi?” “Yes,” he replied. “Has a rainbow ever appeared in your lifetime?” “Yes,” he replied. “If that is true then you are not the son of Levi” (the rainbow was a sign that God would never again destroy the world, which should not have been necessary in the generation of a <i>Tsaddik</i> such as Yehoshua ben Levi. as the <i>Tsaddik</i>’s merits alone should be enough to save the generation. See Rashi). But truly a rainbow had not appeared in his lifetime, but he thought, “I do not want to take the credit for myself.”<br>Rabbi Shimon specifically asked him, “has the rainbow appeared [“<i>nirata</i>,” just as it is worded in the verse],” and not “have you seen [<i>ra’ita</i>],” for the meaning of “appeared” means occasionally but not constantly. Yet for Rebbi Shimon, the rainbow appeared constantly. The rainbow and the great strength of Israel is the “<i>Shema’</i> <i>Yisroel</i> - Hear O Israel,” which gives strength to the hearts of those who yearn for His mercies.",
                    "<i>“And it was, that the whole earth was of one language and one speech.”</i> (Bereshit, 11:1)<br>The verse is formulated “one language” (“one lip,” <i>sfat echad</i>) and not “one tongue” (<i>lashon echad</i>). This is because the principal tongue is the holy tongue, the Hebrew of the Tanach, emerging from that which is imprinted in the depths of the heart, where all the other languages are called stammering. Thus is it written (Yeshahya, 33:19), “of a stammering tongue, of no understanding,” meaning that it has no root of life in its heart, for understanding is in the heart. With the generation of the division of mankind (builders of the tower of Babel), even though they spoke in the holy tongue, their language was not from the root of life, but rather lip service. Their speech was more like the chirping of birds and other animals.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, not conveying the depth of understanding from the source of life of which speech is capable.</i> So it was with the snake, where all the commentaries ask why it was not cursed by having its tongue removed (only its legs were removed). Truly it did not have a tongue at its roots since it spoke <i>lashon hara</i> (evil speech) against its Creator. This idea deserves deep consideration.",
                    "<i>“And the days of Terach were two hundred and five years. And Terach died in Haran.”</i> (Bereshit, 11:32)<br>Rashi explains (why the Torah mentions Terach’s death at the end of <i>Parshat Noach</i>, and not when he actually died, after Avraham has set off for Canaan,) that this is so Avraham will not be criticized for not fulfilling the commandment of honoring his father. It is said in the Midrash (Bereshit Rabba, 39:7), “The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Avraham, you are exempt from honoring your father.” God also established a covenant with Noach, but He did not establish a covenant with Noach in the way that He established a covenant with Avraham Avinu. With Noach, God established a covenant regarding behavior (<i>derech erets</i>), as is explained above (see, “and God said in Heart”) where He says, “and I will establish My covenant with you and not destroy the world.” This is because after the terror of the flood Noach accepted upon himself not to extend himself as much as he wanted, and God agreed not to destroy the world.<br>This being so, Noach began to involve himself in the world, using his wisdom in worldly endeavors (farming, etc.). However, he was not yet included in the realm of Torah. God’s covenant with Avraham Avinu centered around the Torah and he did not have to involve himself in worldly conduct, for worldly conduct (<i>derech erets</i>) precedes the Torah. Therefore he did not have to fulfill the mitzvah of honoring his father. One who is involved in Torah does not have to be engrossed in worldly conduct, for if he is truly involved in Torah than proper conduct will be inherent in everything he does, even unconsciously. Therefore it says, “and Terach died in Haran,” for “the evil are called dead even while they are alive.”",
                    "When enumerating the ten generations from Adam until Noach (<i>Bereshit</i>, Ch. 5) it says, “and he lived … and all his days were …” Yet with the ten generations from Noach until Avraham (<i>Bereshit</i>, Ch. 10) it does not say “and all his days were.” This can be understood through the verse (Mishlei, 23:24), “The father of a <i>Tsaddik</i> will greatly rejoice, and he who gives birth to a sage shall take joy in him.” With the sage, it does not say “the father” as it says “the father of the <i>Tsaddik</i>.” When a man gives birth to a <i>Tsaddik</i>, then the father has a connection to him, for the level of <i>Tsidkut</i>—righteousness—that is active in the son exists in a hidden way with the father. Yet when a sage is born to him, meaning wise in words of Torah, then he is a completely new birth, and the son has no connection to the father, for he is a new entity. Therefore it does not say with the sage, “the father will take joy,” for he is no more connected to the father than the rest of the world. It says only “shall take joy in him,” meaning that the whole world will take joy in him, and they will no longer be involved with the father, only with him. For the sage is born of words of Torah, and then the whole world rejoices, becoming involved with the son but not with the father.<br>Therefore, with the ten generations from Adam until Noach, it says “and all his days were,” even though he had already fathered a son, therefore it is fitting to remain involved with the father. Because “Noach was a righteous man [<i>Tsaddik</i>],” and still has a connection to his father. However, with the ten generations from Noach until Avraham, it does not say “and all his days were,” for Avraham Avinu was a sage in words of Torah, as we say that he fulfilled the entire Torah before it was given. Therefore he has no connection to his father, so then after each generation fathered a son the verse does not go back and deal with the father, saying “and all his days were,” for it is no longer necessary to deal with the father, but only to take joy in the son."

                "Lech Lecha": [
                    "<i>“And God said to Avram, get yourself from your country ….”</i> (Bereshit, 12:1)<br>It is written (Yesahya, 44:3), “When I will pour water on the thirsty, and drip moisture on the dry lands, thus I will pour My Spirit ….” Avraham Avinu began to investigate and seek after the own source of his life, for he realized that it is inconceivable that all the lusts of this world could be called true life, for all worldly desires and lusts only serve to remove the numerous anxieties and obstacles we face. Then once all anxieties are negated, what will be the true core of life upon which the world was created? Concerning this God said to him, “<i>Lech L’cha</i>,” move yourself forward, meaning to yourself, to your true source, for truly all the matters of this world cannot be termed “life,” and the main point of life you shall find in yourself. “You will rejoice in God, in the holy One of Israel you will glory” (Yesahya, 41:16), this is the life.",
                    "On this it is written in the Midrash (<i>Bereshit</i> Rabba, Ch. 39:1), “Rabbi Yitzchak said a parable. A traveler was passing from place to place, and saw a city burning in flames. He said, ‘shall you say that this city has no master?’ The master of the city glanced upon him and said, ‘I am the master of the city.’ So it was that since our forefather Avraham said, ‘shall you say that this world has no master?’ the Holy One, blessed be He, glanced upon him and said, ‘I am the master of the world.’” At first glance it would seem that the Midrash should have said “He looked unto him,” and not “upon him.” However, when our forefather Avraham saw the actions of the generation of the tower of Babel (who thought they could overthrow God Himself), which is the meaning of the city burning in flames, it was a great wonder in his eyes, and his soul was disturbed from pondering who could create this. Then the master of the city glanced upon him, meaning that the Holy One, blessed be He, answered him, “Do you not see on your own that the whole world is not stumped by this difficulty, and there is not one among them who considered asking who made this. Yet for you it is a wonder. In being so disturbed by this you may estimate that certainly there must be a Creator who suffers the entire world and fills the entire world, and He is the one who awakened your heart to this.” And this is the specific use of “upon you,” meaning that from your very question you yourself managed to come up with a sufficient answer.<br>More on the same Midrash. “He saw a city burning in flames, and began to ask, ‘could it be that this city has no master?’ So the master of the city glanced upon him ….” Concerning this, when Avraham Avinu began to contemplate the great changes that swept the world with the generation of the flood and the generation of the tower of Babel, he then became deeply agitated and had to understand who created these. The Holy One, blessed be He, answered him that the portion of Jacob was different from the rest of the world. It is the way of the nations that when they see a major change in the management of the world, then they begin to amend their ways and want to understand the reason for the change. Yet when the world runs according to the way of nature (without any apparent changes), then none among them take it upon themselves to understand, for they do not believe in God to the extent that the ways of nature are also in His hands. They do not know that without Him nothing has dominion in the world. Yet the portion of Jacob are not like these, for we recognize that He has formed all, meaning that Israel believes that were God not to suffer the world (and all its imperfections), then nothing would be able to exist even for a moment. Thus it is, when Avraham Avinu wanted to apprehend his Creator based on changes in the natural order, God said to him, “<i>Lech L’cha</i>, go forward,” to the portion of Jacob who recognizes that even the natural order of things are a product of God’s greatness.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As in the saying of the holy Baal Shem Tov on <i>hasgacha pratit</i> [individual providence], “He sees everything, He knows everything. He knows how many times the leaf will turn over in the dust before the wind comes to take it away.”</i>",
                    "<i>“Go away from your land ….”</i> (Bereshit, 12:1)<br>Meaning, from your place. Avraham Avinu was renowned throughout the entire world for his great wisdom, and there was no other sage like him knowledgeable in all manners of wisdom, as the Midrash states (Gemara <i>Yoma</i>, 28b), “his heart possessed a great knowledge of astronomy [and astrology. All the kings of the east and west would arrive early at his door to inquire about the constellations. See Rashi ad. loc.].” There was a need for this since he was the first vessel that the Holy One, blessed be He, used to reveal His presence in the world, and corresponding to this He said, “Go away from your land [and reveal this new consciousness in the world].” (The verse continues) “And from your place of birth,” in other words, to get away from his habits, and in this he was tested with the incident, “and there was a famine …” (<i>Bereshit</i> 12:10). This is as it is written in the small tractate <i>Sofrim</i> (Ch. 21, <i>halacha</i> 9), “[Avraham was as tall as seventy-four men] and he ate as much as seventy-four men.” This command of God was in order for to thoroughly refine the way he ate, for the later generations of Avraham Avinu would eat in a place of holiness, as among his descendants would be the <i>Cohanim</i> in the Holy Temple who ate only from the <i>kodshei shamayim</i>, the holy sacrifices.<br>“From your father’s house.” In other words, not to look at the way things seem at first glance but rather into the root of the matter. This corresponds to the whole incident of “please separate from me,” which he said to Lot (to resolve the conflict between the shepherds of Avraham and the shepherds of Lot). Lot was very similar to Avraham in appearance, which means that in any situation Lot acted like Avraham (on the surface). Then God Himself looked and “smelled” his actions, which were not good, and accordingly enlightened Avraham’s heart so he knew he had to separate from him, not to heed his wisdom or actions, for they are not coming from the depth of his heart. This is like the Gemara’s explanation of the verse (<i>Hoshea</i>, 14:10), “Who is wise and will understand these things? Who is brilliant enough to know them? For the ways of God are direct and honest …” (<i>Nazir</i>, 23a), “concerning Lot and his daughters, ‘for the ways of God are straightforward.’” Even though it seemed that they had lust like their father Lot, God testified that it was not like the lust of their father, and even though it was favorable in Avraham’s eyes to be connected to Lot, God commanded him to distance himself from him.<br>“To the land which I will show you” corresponds to the section dealing with the wars of the Canaanite kings, for there God showed him all the secrets. It would seem that he should not have saved Lot, for the nations that would later oppress Israel would come from his descendants, and further we are commanded, “an Ammonite shall not enter into congregation …” It seems as if nothing good would come out of their association with Israel. The Holy One, blessed be He, showed him that their women would be permitted immediately, and from their offspring would come the kingdom of David and Shlomo, as is explained that he only went to save two “virtuous fledglings” (Ruth and Naomi, compared to the fledglings that a woman who gave birth would offer in the Temple. Lot’s daughters would give birth to Moab, and thus Ruth, and then King David’s line. <i>Baba Batra</i>, 38b).<br>“And I will make you a great nation” corresponds to the section that announces that he will have children, where it says, “I will be a shield for you.” “And I will bless you” corresponds to the section on Yishmael. “And I will make your name great” corresponds to the additional <i>Hei</i> added in his name. The first <i>Hei</i> in the Tetragrammaton was added to Avraham’s name, and it signifies cleaving to the life of the world to come. Whereas added to Yoseph’s name (Yehoseph) was the second <i>Hei</i> in God’s name, which signifies the wisdom of conduct in this world, as is said in the Midrash (<i>Bereshit</i> Rabba, Ch. 89:8), “five [<i>hei</i>] sages are established in each nation.” “And it shall be for a blessing” means that he will be a vessel of reception to receive more and more each time, and this corresponds to the beginning of the next <i>Parsha</i>, “<i>Vayeira eilav</i>,” “And God appeared unto him.”",
                    "<i>“… to the land which I will show you.”</i><br>Avraham Avinu wanted to know just where the essence of his life was intensely joined to God and how far it reached. Thus God responded to him, “to the land which I will show you,” meaning that you are joined to me in a place called “which I will show you.” For He has no end, His endless light will continually increase within you, and this you will find in the land of Israel.",
                    "<i>“… and there he built an altar to Hashem, and he called in the name of Hashem.”</i> (Bereshit, 12:8)<br>The first test Avraham Avinu encountered was “<i>lech l’cha</i>,” “get thee away.” This represents poverty and constriction (that the journey would cause), for it must be first clarified in man that he will not hold grudges against God. Rather he should ask of God that He not bring him into dire straits, God forbid, which would cause a man to go against the His ways. Poverty means one who is not happy with his portion but rather seeks excessive luxury, and for this he must ask from God that he not covet luxury. As it is said of Yaakov (<i>Bereshit</i>, 25:27), “Yaakov was a simple man,” meaning that he was complete in his soul without any desire for excesses, just accepting everything with love according to the will of the blessed Creator. This was the prayer of Avraham Avinu at his first test, that he be happy with his portion and not experience any dire poverty, and this is the meaning of “and he called in the name of God,” that poverty not divert him from the God’s path. Therefore when he returned from Egypt it was said, “and Avram was very heavy [with cattle and silver and gold]” (<i>Bereshit</i>, 13:2).<br>After he was completely clarified concerning poverty through his first test, it is said, “very heavy,” an expression related to seriousness. In his soul he feared wealth, like the prayer of King Shlomo (Mishlei, 30:8), “give me neither poverty or riches.” And with Lot the expression <i>kaved</i>, “heavy,” is not used. Rather it says, “and Lot, who went with Avraham, had sheep,” etc., and “had” (<i>haya</i>) always signifies rejoicing, for he had no fear whatsoever. This was not so with Avraham where it is written “heavy,” because of his fear. Therefore it follows immediately with, “and he went on his journeys … and there he called in the name of Hashem” (<i>Bereshit</i>, 8:3–4), for here too his soul feared wealth, as mentioned above. Thus he was clarified in all these matters.",
                    "<i>“And Malki Tsedek king of Shalem brought out bread and wine, and he was a priest of the supernal God.”</i> (Bereshit, 14:18)<br>It is written (Mishlei, 8:15), “Through Me kings will reign.” One might think it should have been written, “Kings will reign through Me.” This formulation hints that the Holy One, blessed be He, only makes a king out of someone who can first rule over himself, and if so He also makes him a king over others. Concerning this it is said (<i>Pirke Avot</i>, Ch. 4:1), “who is mighty? He who conquers his own evil nature.” This is “through Me, kings will reign,” meaning one who reigns over himself, and his intellect rules over his desires, he will reign, meaning he will be a king over all, and you do not have to pay attention to his opponents, since all his intentions are for the sake of Heaven. This is why it is written, “Malki Tsedek king of Shalem,” meaning that at first he was a righteous (<i>Tsedek</i>) king in that he ruled over himself in his righteousness, and afterwards he was “king of Shalem [meaning complete],” which is Jerusalem.<br>For this reason the first of the month of Nissan is the New Year of the kings. It seems that the first of the month of Sivan would be more proper, for in this month the Torah was given in which it is written, “through Me kings will reign.” Yet still, because it says first “through Me kings,” and afterwards “will reign,” meaning that he will be a king over himself, which occurs in the month of Nissan, when Israel constricts themselves by eating the bread of affliction (matzah) and accepting upon themselves the yoke of the blessed Creator, eating from Him (as it were) dry bread without taste, and not eating delicacies under the yoke of flesh and blood. For in truth there was great plenty in Egypt, as it is said (<i>Shemot</i>, 16:3), “when we sat by the flesh pots.” So by means of this (the constrictions of Nissan), “they will reign,” meaning over the whole world, and this is in the month of Sivan for in it the Torah was given.<br>This is as it is say here, “Malki Tsedek king of Shalem,” and for this he is called king of Shalem (complete). Shem, the son of Noach, whom the Gemara (<i>Nedarim</i>, 32b), identifies as Malki Tsedek, sought after the welfare of Jerusalem with great desire. Therefore when he saw that his student Avraham went to save Lot, he could not understand why. To the contrary, not saving him would have been more reasonable as his descendants were Ammon and Moav, called the “evil neighbors of Jerusalem” (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, 96b). Also, there is a sign that God hated them in warning that they should not be accepted into the congregation of Israel. How then could Avraham Avinu have dedicated himself to saving him? Yet since he knew his student Avraham, regarding him as a complete <i>Tsaddik</i> who would not fail, and he prayed to God shine into him the reasons for Avraham’s endeavors. This is why he was called “a priest to the most high God,” as when he brought out bread and wine he was a <i>Cohen</i> serving God and praying for to clearly understand that which was above his ability to comprehend.<br>Afterwards God shined into him the understanding that Avraham Avinu did not, God forbid, do anything futile. Even though it was indeed so that from Lot would come Ammon and Moav, of whom it is said, “they shall not enter the congregation” (Lamentations, 1:10), this was only for the men, but the women were permitted to enter at once. Furthermore among their descendants was the House of David and Shlomo who are the principle ones to uphold sovereignty over Israel and Jerusalem. On this Malki Tsedek said, “blessed is Avram to the Supernal God!” Notice how he first blessed Avraham (and then afterwards God in verse 20), for Avraham also did something above his intellect, with God only arousing his heart, and he delivered over his soul. Since it was Avraham who first made this known to him, Avraham’s blessing came first, and by means of this he took the priesthood from himself and gave it to Avraham (<i>Nedarim</i>, 32b). That is, he admitted that Avraham was greater than him, as it is said (<i>Tehilim</i>, 110:4), “You are a priest forever, a king of righteousness [<i>Malki Tsedek</i>] according to My word.” “A king of righteousness [<i>Malki Tsedek</i>],” meaning that I (God) shined My light into Malki Tsedek in order for him to see that Avraham was greater than him and admit it to himself.",
                    "<i>“And Avram said to the king of Sodom, I raise my hands to Hashem … that I will not take from you even a thread or a shoelace ….”</i> (Bereshit, 14:22–23)<br>The question is why didn’t Avraham Avinu want to benefit from the king of Sodom, even though he had benefited from Pharaoh and Avimelech? His efforts to save Lot were in the way of a <i>birrur</i> (clarification) as Lot possessed a good power, since Naomi the Ammonite and Ruth the Moabite were among his offspring, and the rest was evil, for Ammon and Moav were born of him. So it was necessary to clarify in himself that at the depths all his intentions were to save these two good fledglings (<i>Baba Kama</i>, 38b). Whenever man must undergo a <i>birrur</i> he is advised to stand back and remove any connection from personal benefit from his actions. After this, God will make it clear that even in the times where he had transgressed the law was also good, for, “it is a time to do for God, they have made void Your Torah” (<i>Tehilim</i>, 119:126). <br>This is hinted at in the Gemara (<i>Ketubot</i>, 66a), “what a wife finds goes to her husband,” for the wife hints helping man in a place where he needs to listen to her, and then it is “a time to do.” This is akin to Adam and Chava where she was given to him so he would listen to her words. There he did not sin, and that which he desired did not come from her, only from the incitement of the snake. This is the explanation of “what a wife finds goes to her husband,” meaning when a man conducts himself not according to the judgment of the Torah, but only according to “a time to do for God,” then it is forbidden for him to receive benefit. “Rabbi Akiva said, what a wife finds is her own,” meaning that he may allow himself to receive benefit then as well. Since at the time Avraham Avinu went to rescue Lot the depth of the intention of the action was hidden from him, therefore he did not want to receive benefit.<br>This is the same as the matter with King David and Achish king of Gat (Shmuel 1, Ch. 30; see this whole chapter for a clearer understanding), where he did not want to benefit from the war spoils, for this was also against the judgment of the Torah. Even though he did not share their intentions, still he refused to benefit from the war spoils for his intentions were for the sake of Heaven. This is as it is said (Mishlei, 1:15), “do not go in the way with them,” meaning that even though you do not go with them, yet still, act in a way that prevents them from even thinking that you are going with them. Therefore Amalek came to him at this time, for Amalek hates Israel at the depths, and one who hates another at the depths can immediately feel when the other is lacking something, as explained in <i>Parshat Bereshit</i> (see p. 16, “said the snake”).<br>Therefore David haMelech sent away the war spoils and did not want to benefit from it. Then when they won the war against the Amalekites, it says (Shmuel 1, 30:19), “and there was nothing lacking in them, neither great nor small … David returned everything,” for such a case requires a great measure of help Heaven and careful guarding. Thus it says “there was nothing lacking,” for here were the salvations of God, and the Amalekites could not bring accusations against them, for whenever Israel makes mistakes, Amalek is there to bring accusations.<br>This is as it is written (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 21:1), “and the Canaanite heard that Israel came <i>derech ha’atarim</i>, by way of the spies.” “<i>derech ha’atarim</i>” means by way of error, for at that time the children of Israel were not yet commanded to go to the land of Israel, but regardless they went by way of the spies, like one gets lost and then eventually goes to a place where God has not permitted him to go. Therefore Amalek immediately appeared to them, for “the Canaanite” mentioned is Amalek, as Rashi explains. But truly Israel’s heart was directed to Heaven, therefore when they won them in battle Israel vowed that their cities would be banned. In other words, they did not want to receive any benefit from this instance as it happened against the judgment of the Torah, and was decreed as “a time to do for God.”",
                    "<i>“And Avram said, Lord Hashem, what will You give me, seeing as I go childless … And Avram said, behold, You have given me no seed ….”</i> (Bereshit, 15:2–3)<br>To understand the doubling of the language, for when Avraham Avinu said (<i>Bereshit</i>, 15:3), “and behold, the one who grew up in my house [his servant Eliezar] will inherit me,” he was not referring to his wealth and property in this world. Rather he was asking about the principle of Divine service. He desired that it be constantly revealed through him also in the physical world, that all would see how God controls and rules over all, that He is also the “God of the land.” This is as he said, “seeing I go childless,” meaning that there is no one to inherit my job of making Your Sovereignty known throughout the whole world the way I have done. He asked God not to pass this inheritance through his servant Eliezar. Even though it seemed that Eliezar drew from the wellsprings of his master’s teachings to give others to drink (see <i>Yoma</i> 28b), nevertheless Avraham Avinu was uncertain whether his intentions were truly for the sake of Heaven, as it is written (Mishlei, 18:2), “a fool does not desire wisdom, but rather to reveal his heart.” Therefore he first said, “and the steward of my house is Eliezar of Damascus,” and then after in a moment of repose he thought, “maybe it will be fitting in the eyes of God to make Eliezar the one to publicize Your oneness.”<br>Only he did not look upon him with a good eye, so therefore added immediately after, “and behold the one who grew up in my house will inherit me.” With these words he was praying that God make Eliezar worthy in his own view, to look upon him with a good eye upon him and rejoice in him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the answer to the question at the outset of why the same thing seemed to be said twice, as if to say, “make him as the actual son of my house, so I will no longer suspect him.”</i> Therefore it follows immediately with (<i>Bereshit</i>, 15:4), “And behold, the word of Hashem came to him saying, this will not be your heir.” This is phrased in a way to denote <i>simcha</i> (joy), that your one desire to promote the oneness of God in the world will not be fulfilled through him. This desire will only be fulfilled through your progeny.",
                    "<i>“And he said, whereby shall I know that I will inherit it?”</i> (Bereshit, 15:8)<br>After all of the <i>birrurim</i> (refinements) that Avraham endured, he asked God for the <i>Shechina</i> to be revealed in the world through him. Yet he asked, “Whereby shall I know,” I want this revelation to be forever fixed in my heart. Therefore God answered him, “take a heifer of three years [literally, ‘triple’],” meaning that you will need the book of <i>Torat</i> <i>Cohanim</i> (or Leviticus, the third book of the Bible, hence “triple”). This means, by means of Divine service (“the law of the <i>Cohanim</i>”) it shall be fixed into your heart more and more until it is fixed there forever, and thus it is truly called an inheritance."

                    "<i>“And God appeared unto him at the oaks of Mamre, and he was sitting in the entrance of the tent in the heat of the day.”</i> (Bereshit, 18:1)<br>It is written (<i>Malachi</i>, 3:20), “For those who fear My name I will shine the sun of <i>tsedaka</i> (righteousness) and of healing in her wings.” “Those who fear My name” means those who have an understanding of words of Torah and of God. This will necessitate that they have true fear, and this is the explanation of “those who fear My name.” promising them that He will shine the sun of <i>tsedaka</i> upon them, or in other words, refined words of Torah. “Of healing in her wings” means trust, or taking strength in God and in words of Torah, just as wings are the trust and strength of the bird.<br>We find that before God was revealed to him, Avraham Avinu derived no satisfaction from all the matters of this world, and even despised them. His true desire was to know “who is the master of the city [the world].” This is as is written (Mishlei, 15:24), “the way of life is above for the intelligent,” meaning that this quest was his principal concern, as something placed on high. Therefore God appeared unto him and gave him the special strength (<i>tekifut</i>) of refined words of Torah, for “oaks” denotes special strength, and “<i>Mamre</i>” (as in <i>zaken mamre</i>, an elder who refuses to abide by the injunction of the courts) means that he refused all the matters of this world, finding them bitter. “And he was sitting in the entrance to the tent in the heat of the day.” In other words, he was fervent for the love of God that is called day, and it was explicit before him. This is the meaning of “in the entrance to the tent,” meaning that it was open before him.<br>“And behold, three men were standing upon him” means that God showed him that all the world stands upon him, for an angel is one-third of the world, as it is written in the Midrash. (<i>Bereshit</i> Rabba, 68:12, where it says that an angel is the high officer [<i>shalish</i>, see <i>Shirat haYam, Shemot</i> 15:4] of the world, and based on the similarity of the words interprets that the size of an angel is a third [<i>shlish</i>] of the world, using the verse in Daniel when he saw an angel [10:6], “His body was like <i>tarshish</i> [beryl, a brilliant gem in the <i>urim</i> and <i>tummim</i>, on the high priest’s breastplate, and also meaning the finest ship of the ancient world],” and as Rashi notes, like a ship on the high sea, and the ocean is a third of the world.) He showed him that the entire world exists in the merit of Avraham Avinu.",
                    "<i>“… and he looked, and he saw three people standing on [in front of] him.”</i> (Bereshit, 18:2)<br>Why did the angels come before the birth of Yitzchak? The world did not deserve to have born into it a soul as precious as that of Yitzchak, for it was as if the very <i>Shechina</i>, the divine presence, were descending into the world. Yitzchak’s attribute is that of <i>Gevurah</i> (strength), and the <i>Shechina</i> is itself called <i>Gevurah</i>, as it says at Mount Sinai, “thus Moshe heard from the mouth of <i>Gevurah</i>” (see <i>Eruvin</i>, 54b). This necessitated the arrival of the three angels in order that the atmosphere of the world would be filled with <i>Kedusha</i> (holiness), for “an angel is a third of the world” (see end of previous passage) and then afterwards Yitzchak could be born.",
                    "<i>“And Sarah denied it, saying, I did not laugh ….”</i> (Bereshit, 18:15)<br>There is a great depth in this matter. The saying of the Gemara (<i>Berachot</i>, 33b), “Rabbi Chanina said, all is in the hands of Heaven, except for the fear of Heaven,” applies only to the extent of the understanding of the mortal intellect. Truly, everything is in the hands of Heaven including the fear of Heaven, yet God hid His way (this consciousness) in the world. The attribute of Yitzchak Avinu was to recognize that even the fear of Heaven comes from God, yet the world was not worthy of a consciousness as precious as this. Therefore Sarah found it necessary to say, “But my lord is old [too old to father children].” Here it seems as if she is denying that all is in the hands of Heaven. Accordingly the Holy One, blessed be He, showed her, measure for measure, that even the fear of Heaven comes from Him, and were it not for the concealment of this understanding from her and from the world, Yitzchak could not have been born into the world. For the preciousness of the attribute of Yitzchak was to clarify and to show that even the fear of Heaven comes from God, and even all the transgressions of Israel occurred under the watch of God’s providence. By means of this God’s great name is exalted and sanctified! Understand this, for it is exceedingly deep.<br>(See in the Gemara [<i>Avoda Zara</i>, 4b], “Rabbi Yehusha ben Levi said, Israel only made the golden calf to support the position of <i>ba’alei teshuva</i> [penitents], as it is written (<i>Devarim</i>, 5:26), ‘would it were that they gave their hearts … to fear Me all the days.’ R. Yehoshua ben Levi said in the name of R. Shimon b. Yochai, David was not capable of this action [his sin with Bathsheba] as it is written (<i>Tehilim</i>, 109:22), ‘my heart is empty [of the evil inclination] within me [and therefore it has no power over me], and Israel was not supposed to be capable of making the golden calf, as it is written, ‘would that they gave their hearts to fear Me.’ So why did they make it? To show you, that if an individual sinned they say to him that it was entirely up to the individual, and if a whole community sinned then it was the responsibility of the entire community.” Rashi comments: “to support the position of <i>ba’alei teshuva</i>,” that is to say that they were courageous and controlled their evil natures, and it was against their very abilities to give in to the evil inclination; yet it was the decree of the King that their evil natures overcome them. Yet it was in order to respond to the penitents, to show that there was value in their return, for perhaps after one sins he would say, “there is no need for me to return to the good, for God would not accept me anyway.” Then they could say to him, “go and learn from the incident with the golden cow, how they made atonement and their penance was accepted.”<br>And if so, what made it so that the tribes would fulfill the mitzvah of giving the half-shekel, it was to atone for their worship of the golden calf, and if the sin of the golden calf caused them to fulfill the mitzvah of the half-shekel, how much more so would be the effect of the merit of the <i>mitzvot</i> that they are doing! And in the Jerusalem Talmud it is written [<i>Shekalim</i>, Ch. 2, <i>halacha</i> 3], “since they sold the first born of Rachel for twenty silver pieces, thus each one must redeem his first born son for twenty silver pieces.” From the emendations of Yerucham Lainer.)",
                    "<i>“All who hear will laugh from rejoicing in me ….”</i> (Bereshit, 21:6)<br>“Hearing” means understanding. It is said (<i>Bereshit</i> Rabba, 45:8), “when Sarah became pregnant, many infertile women in the world became pregnant at the same time.” In response to this, many of the scoffers of the generation said, “who is to say that this miracle came about through the power of Sarah, were not many other infertile women answered with children?” So Sarah said, “all who hear,” meaning whoever possesses understanding will know that this was the laughter that God made for me.",
                    "<i>“and Avraham returned to his place ….”</i> (Bereshit, 18:33)<br>After Avraham wholly delivered himself over to the cause of saving the people of Sodom, and after most of the prayer that he exerted in order to save them, God answered him that they were hateful of God, and it hurt Him that he would exert so much over those who hate God. Therefore, “Avraham returned to his place,” meaning to his initial place of strength, for then he truly knew that he only really loves the lovers of God, and certainly this contained a depth far greater than his apprehension.",
                    "<i>“And Avraham journeyed from there to the land of the Negev.”</i> (Bereshit, 20:1)<br>Avraham Avinu refined all kinds of love in the world so that they be dedicated to God alone. Then, when he saw how an action as the incident between Lot and his two daughters could have occurred, he began anew the entire process of refining love. This is “and he journeyed,” from an action such as this, “to the land of the Negev,” meaning a place so dry that it was as if he had not even begun to refine love whatsoever.",
                    "<i>“… for God has greatly closed up all the wombs of the house of Avimelech, concerning [his intentions to take Sarah for a wife] … And God remembered Sarah … and caused her to conceive ….”</i> (Bereshit, 20:18, 21:1)<br>In the Midrash (Tanchuma, <i>Vaye’chi</i>, 8, on Yechezkel 17:24), “I have dried the wet [fertile] wood, and caused the dry wood to blossom. ‘Dried the wet wood,’ is Avimelech; ‘caused the dry wood to blossom,’ is Avraham.” Concerning Avraham it is written (Yechezkel, 33:24), “Avraham was one.” This means that in himself Avraham was not fit to give birth because he was intensely joined to God at the level of the final and most perfect form of simplicity. Whosoever is joined to God in such completeness only contains within him matters of pure simplicity and oneness with true life. Therefore when the Holy One, blessed be He, wanted Avraham to give birth to Yitzchak Avinu, He did so only after the incident with Avimelech.<br>Avimelech wanted to steal all that was in the possession of Avraham, and for this he was judged measure for measure. At that time the <i>Gevurah</i> (strength, severity) of the world was with the Philistines, and thus we find that the mighty Samson was always fighting with them. Therefore this very power of <i>Gevurah</i> was given to Avraham. (See <i>Tsidkat haTsaddik</i>, 249, which says, “Thus I have heard that Avraham Avinu received the spirit of wisdom and understanding from Egypt, and the spirit of counsel and <i>Gevurah</i> from Avimelech. This is the reason why they suspected that Sarah became pregnant from Avimelech [as the Midrash Tanchuma, Toldot 1, says, “since Sarah gave birth immediately after the incidents with Pharaoh and Avimelech, they said, ‘from Pharaoh or Avimelech she conceived.’” Then even Avraham began to suspect, so God clarified the matter by making the face of Yitzchak exactly like the face of Avraham] for immediately when the power of birth was taken from Avimelech it was given to Avraham”).<br>When the power of <i>Gevurah</i> was given to Avraham it was without limit. For all the powers of the nations of the world are limited within them, and when these powers are entered into Israel they are without limit, as they are cleaving to God also at their roots and without limit. For this reason Israel is dispersed among the nations in order that they may receive all the powers residing in each of the seventy nations, and once in Israel it will be without limit. Thus it is written concerning King Shlomo (<i>Bava Metsia</i>, 86b), “He took wives from many nations,” for the strength of each nation is principally in its women, and particularly in the princess. Therefore, when all these powers are conquered, they will sprout good among Israel, “the branch of My planting” (Yesahya, 60:21).",
                    "<i>“… and God tested Avraham ….”</i> (Bereshit, 22:1)<br>The test of the binding of Yitzchak (henceforth, the <i>Akeida</i>) was in the great faith that Avraham Avinu had in God. God had already said to him, “thus will be your progeny” and “I will keep my covenant, with Yitzchak,” so now, when He said to him, “raise him up on the altar for a sacrifice,” even though he remembered what he had previously been told, still he did not fall from his faith. It is not possible for the intelligence of man to apprehend this kind of faith. Truly, we never find the specific command of God telling him to slaughter his son, so therefore the verse does not say, “and YHV’H tested Avraham” (using God’s name of mercy), but “E-lohim tested” (God’s name of judgment), meaning that the Divine injunction came to him in the aspect of a “mirror which does not illuminate” (a lower level of prophecy) (Zohar <i>Bereshit</i>, 120b) and therefore the name “E-lohim” is used, which denotes <i>tekifut</i> (holy strength). Therefore concerning Yitzchak it was not really a test, for he believed that this was clearly what God wanted Avraham to do, yet for Avraham it was a great trial because he had not received a clear message from God. So if he were tainted in any aspect of his relationship as a father towards his son, then God would have obliged him to have mercy upon him. Truly, it was the direct will of God that he would not slaughter his son, and the trial was only to shine this understanding into Avraham. This is why, when he prayed for Sodom he said (<i>Bereshit</i>, 18:27), “for I am dust and ashes,” for dust represents an action that has not been disencumbered of impurities and needs fixing. It is possible that things may grow out of the dust, where ashes represent something completely lost, God forbid. If he had slaughtered his son then there would not have been any way to repair the damage. Similarly with the people of Sodom, if his prayer had been effective and they lived, and then they continued in their evil ways, then it would have been like ashes from which there is no growth. Thus God showed him that his prayer over them had not been in vain, for as we find in the writings of the Ari’zal (<i>Shaar HaPesikim, Parshat Shemot</i>) the generation of Israel in the desert was born from their souls.",
                    "<i>“… and now I know that you are one who fears E-lohim ….”</i> (Bereshit, 28:12)<br>There is a difference between the fear of YHV’H and the fear of E-lohim. The fear of E-lohim is what causes a man to prevent himself from doing something, such as eating and the like. This is because he is not complete, and there is still something lacking in the man, so he constricts himself according to his understanding. This is called “the fear of E-lohim.” The fear of YHV’H means that even if the man deeply understands that it is permitted for him to act, for his soul has been refined from this deficiency, yet still, from God’s point of view it is still forbidden. God commanded straightforward injunctions to each soul, and since there are others in the world who are not refined in this particular aspect, therefore God did not permit this particular action to the individual. As he is not equal with the rest he is still burdened with the prohibition for the sake of his fellow man. This is called fear of YHV’H."

                    "<i>“And the life of Sarah was a hundred and twenty and seven years, these were the years of the life of Sarah.”</i> (Bereshit, 23:1)<br>The Gemrara (in <i>Berachot</i>, 8a) tells us, “On this every faithful man shall pray unto You at a time when you are found (<i>Tehilim</i>, 32:6). One says this refers to woman, one says this is Torah, one says this is death, and one says this is the toilet.” All of these concern times when a man is in a state of uncertainty over matters beyond his control, and he needs only to pray to God to help him. “One says Torah,” meaning that when he does something, he should pray to God to shine into him the way of Torah, and only act if the Torah permits. “One says that this is woman” means that God should always be before him. One must know, “it is a time to do for God, Your Torah has been made void” (<i>Tehilim</i>, 119:126), which concerns woman, the spouse, as was explained in <i>Parshat Bereshit</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When Adam was uncertain as to whether or not to take Hava’s advice, for she was initially given to Adam precisely to advise him, “<i>eizor c’negdo</i>,” yet he should have not listened to her regarding the tree of knowledge. See above.</i> “One says this is death,” for here too one enters into uncertainty. This is as Reb Yochanan said (<i>Berachot</i>, 28b), “there are two ways open before me,” and as it is said (<i>Berachot</i>, 8a), “a man should pray for peace even up to the last handful of earth thrown over his grave.” “One says this is burial,” for even once he is buried there is also a depth, and one enters into uncertainty for his way is open to the world to come, as stated in the Midrash (<i>Bereshit</i> Rabba, 42:6). “One says that this is the toilet,” meaning shame, so that one should pray that nothing he would later be ashamed of will leave his mouth.<br>These five matters are hinted at in this week’s <i>Parsha</i>. “Torah” is hinted at in “Avraham became old,” for “wisdom is acquired with age.” “Woman” is hinted at in Rivka marrying Yitzchak, and also in “and Avraham again took a wife,” for there is a great depth in that it was necessary for him to father all these generations whose roots are not in <i>Kedusha</i>. All the same, Yitzchak will control all these powers, and on all of them will exult the name of God. “One says burial” is hinted at with Sarah, and “death” with Avraham Avinu. “Toilet” is hinted at with the last section concerning the sons of Ishmael, on that which Avraham said, “would that Ishmael live before you,” which was considered as shaming Avraham, as said in the holy Zohar (<i>Bereshit</i>, 205b)",
                    "<i>“And the life of Sarah was ….”</i> (Bereshit, 23:1)<br>It is said in the Midrash (<i>Bereshit</i> Rabba, 38:1) on the verse (<i>Tehilim</i>, 37:18), “God knows the days of the whole-hearted [<i>Temimim</i> in Hebrew; also upright, honest, innocent],” “just as they are whole-hearted, so are their years whole. Reb Yochanan says, ‘like a whole unblemished and perfect heifer.’” The verse tells us (<i>Tehilim</i>, 1:6), “God knows the way of the <i>Tsaddikim</i> [righteous].” In other words, it is the way of the <i>Tsaddikim</i> to know God, in the language of mankind, where that way leads to, and thus the way of the <i>Tsaddikim</i> is cleared of barriers and vanities of this world, leading only to the knowledge of God. And so is the explanation of “God knows the way of the whole-hearted,” meaning that the way of the whole-hearted draws him to the knowledge of God. Knowledge signifies connection and intense cleaving, as in “and Adam knew his wife Chava.” The meaning is to connect and join intensely in God, and it follows that going in this way is the very beginning of their life. In this way the Midrash explains, “and these were the years of the life of Sarah,” meaning that now life truly began, for “God knows the days of the whole.” On this, Reb Yochanan said, “like a whole, perfect heifer.” <i>Eglah</i> in Hebrew, the same letters as <i>agalah</i>, a circle, something round, made in a perfect and complete circle, which has no end, and each point is its beginning, since is singularly encompassing, and “its end is wedged in its beginning” (Sefer Yetsira, ch. 1). Now that her days in this world had been completed, it says, “and these are the lives of Sarah,” for this is the beginning of her life, as explained in the holy Zohar.",
                    "<i>“And Avraham waxed old, coming in age, and God blessed Avraham with everything.”</i> (Bereshit, 24:1)<br>It is written (Kohollet, 2:10), “and this is my portion from all my toil,” and of this the Gemara says (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, 20b), “Rav and Shmuel [differ on the interpretation of what ‘this’ is in the verse], one says it is his staff, one says it is his water jug.” Certainly King Shlomo was not complaining, God forbid, about loosing the delights of the world, for they were considered as nothing before him, yet he praised himself and said that even though it seems that everything was taken from him, still the concentration of all the life of this world remained with him. In these two matters we find the concentration of all the life of this world, in that he said, “this is my portion from all my toil.” “One says his staff,” for a staff hints at life, meaning that the power of life remained with him, as it is written (Zechariya, 8:4), “[thus shall the old men and women dwell in Jerusalem], and each man his staff in hand.” “One says his water jug,” for a jug is a vessel of reception, meaning, ready and still longing to add to it. This was his delight, for this is the main point of the life of this world. And this is the meaning of the verse, “and Avraham was old, coming in days,” that he came to the roots of life, and he himself became a vessel of reception, yearning for God to increase his life at each moment.",
                    "<i>“And Yitzchak came from the way of the well ‘Lechai Roi,’ for he dwelt in the south country. And Yitzchak went out to meditate in the fields upon evening, and he raised his eyes, and saw, and behold, the camels were coming.”</i> (Bereshit, 24:62)<br>Yitzchak was the root of all fear of God in the world, and even when (the mitzvah, or God’s will) involves “sitting” and refraining from action, as it says, “he dwelt [sat] in the south country [Negev]” or dry (<i>menugav</i>) from all desire not directed to <i>Kedusha</i>. And concerning this, since Avraham Avinu understood that the soul of Yitzchak had a great desire to serve God with active performance, he sent his servant to find him his soulmate. And here truly, “this has come from God” (<i>Tehilim</i>, 118:23), for the time had come for Yitzchak to marry a wife. Furthermore, Yitzchak’s heart woke to the understanding of (Yeshaya, 45:18), “God did not create a desolation for his creations,” yet since he feared the actual performance of something in this direction, he went out to meditate, to pour out his heart in the field and ask God to help him and to prepare his <i>zivug</i> (mate). “For some, their <i>zivug</i> comes to them,” (<i>Moed Katan</i>, 18b), and his prayer was answered immediately, “and he raised his eyes, and saw the camels coming,” for “before you cry out, I will answer you” (Yesahya, 65:24).",
                    "<i>“And these are the generations of Yishmael son of Avraham, who Hagar the Egyptian bore, the maidservant of Sarah, to Avraham.”</i> (Bereshit, 25:12)<br>It is written (<i>Tehilim</i>, 111:6), “He told the power of His works to His people in giving them the inheritance of the nations.” That is to say, from the side of Israel, there is almost no need to know the sciences of the natural world, for they act according to the Torah of God and the conduct of God, with no need of the conduct of the natural world at all. Only, “He who said to the oil, “ignite!” can say to vinegar, “ignite!” (God could make anything He wants light, so the point is to be connected to the source rather than the effect.)” Out of His great love for them, God also wants them to know the sciences of nature, and this is also found in the Torah. We find an example in the Gemara (Mishna, <i>Pesachim</i>, 39b), “a man may not chew wheat and place it on his wound, because it turns into leaven,” and from this it is clear that chewed wheat is good for a wound, as we find in several places.<br>And to this, “the power of His works,” meaning the Torah, “He told to His people in giving them inheritance of the nations,” and this inheritance is nature (and its wisdom), and this is also found in the power of His works that He told to His people. This itself is, “these are the generations of Yishmael (son of Avraham, which Hagar the Egyptian) the handmaid of Sarah, bore to Avraham,” for his primary relation to her was that she was Sarah’s handmaid, and owing to this there are sages among them. Their names teach of their wisdom. <i>Neviot</i> teaches that a man must see that his body is clean, as it is related to the word <i>navov</i>, meaning empty, hence empty of impurity. <i>Kedar</i> is the heated body (such as <i>k’dera</i>, a cooking pot). <i>Ad’bael</i> meaning not to eat to become satisfied. <i>Mivsham</i> meaning wines and perfumes that make one wise (connected to <i>bosem</i>, perfume; see <i>Yoma</i>, 76b, “Rava said, wine and fragrant spices made me wise”). This concerns their wisdom in the realm of physical health. Concerning their wisdom in social relations are, “<i>Mishma’</i>, and <i>Duma</i>, and <i>Massa</i>,” <i>mishma’</i>, meaning the power of listening (<i>shema</i>); <i>Duma</i>, virtually the same word for silence; and <i>Massa</i>, meaning a load that is carried, meaning to be patient.<br>Concerning their wisdom in production, “<i>Chadad</i>” means if you want to bring something into the world (<i>Chadad</i> means to be sharp or fierce, essential to creativity), “<i>Teima</i>,” all the world will find it wondrous (<i>Temiha</i>, wonder or astonishment), “<i>Y’toor</i>,” so make sure that it is well-organized (<i>Toor</i> is a row). “<i>Nafish</i>” means to take time with the creation to make sure that it is beautiful (<i>Nafash</i>, to rest, to take the proper amount of time). <i>“Kidma,”</i> or, if you see it is proper to do it, then do it soon lest someone else does it before you (<i>Lehakdim</i>, to precede). Their wisdom is only in the realm of nature, and in this they place their trust. Therefore of Yishmael it is written (<i>Bereshit</i>, 25:18), “and he fell [died] in the presence of his brethren.” However, with Israel, who knows that all comes from Heaven, it is written (<i>Bereshit</i>, 16:12), “and he shall dwell in the presence of his brethren.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meaning, when Yishmael is in the presence of Israel, he dwells in the presence, <i>Shechina</i>, of God.</i>, <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is as it is said in the Gemara [<i>Berachot</i>, 58a], “If you see a sage of Israel you pronounce the blessing, ‘Blessed is He who divides His wisdom among those who fear Him.’ For a sage of the Gentiles, say, ‘Blessed is He who gives His wisdom to flesh and blood.’” It is similarly so with the difference between kings of Israel and kings of the Gentiles. This is because Israel is a veritable portion of God, and the wisdom of the Gentiles is the wisdom of nature and not connected to <i>Kedusha</i> [holiness]. For the wisdom of Israel and their conduct is according to the Torah of God. <i>Tashlum Mei HaShiloach</i>.</i>"

                "Toldot": [
                    "<i>“And these are the generations of Yitzchak, son of Avraham. Avraham begot Yitzchak.”</i> (Bereshit, 25:19)<br>It is written (Divrei haYamim 1, 28:9), “If you seek it, you will find.” The seeking is Avraham Avinu, and the finding is Yitzchak. The main point of Avraham Avinu was that he always had a great yearning for Torah, and a great desire to make the reign of God known in the world. This is the attribute of love. The attribute of Yitzchak is that of <i>Gevurah</i> (strength, severity), when this became clear and the revelation of God descended into the world. This is called <i>Gevurah</i>, as it is written (<i>Megillah</i>, 31b), “thus Moshe heard from the mouth of <i>Gevurah</i>,” and Yitzchak is also called the <i>Gevurah</i> of God in the world.<br>This goes according to the verse, “and these are the generations of Yitzchak, son of Avraham …,” which means that the generations, or results of Yitzchak Avinu, are the proclamation of the revelation of God in this world. Thereby, “Avraham begot Yitzchak,” for this came about by means of Avraham’s yearning, for yearning is the attribute of Avraham, and so it is that all true words of Torah are born into the world only after the great desire of those who long for them.<br>This also concerns what is said in the Gemara (<i>Baba Metsia</i>, 44a), “In his younger days Rabbi Yehuda haNasi taught his son, ‘silver buys gold,’ and in his old age, ‘gold buys silver.’” In a man’s youth he has great desire and yearning for words of Torah, and by means of this, he is “buying gold,” which means acquiring words of Torah in their true form that are called gold, by means of silver (<i>Kesef</i>), which is desire and yearning (<i>Kesifa</i>). Yet, in his old age a man must ask that his desire for words of Torah not be taken from him, for in old age the powers of desire weaken. Therefore he taught that “gold buys silver.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The silver, or desire, is then the main point.</i> The silver is the prayer that he offers to God, that by means of the very words of Torah the desire may come to him for an increase in more words of Torah. This may be compared to a man who is satisfied from eating, and nonetheless, if more good food were placed before him it would draw his appetite to eat further.<br>So it is with words of Torah. This is as we pray each day in the blessing over the Torah, “and may God make words of Torah desirable in our mouths,” that is, may words of Torah become sweetened in such a way that we always have a greater and greater desire for them. This is the meaning of the verse (Yoel, 2:26), “and you shall eat food and be satisfied.” The doubling of the language teaches of this,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Hebrew, <i>ve’achaltem ochel</i>; “were the doubling of, <i>ochel</i>” is apparent.</i> for by means of the very eating there will come greater desire. This is all an allegory for words of Torah, as explained above.",
                    "<i>“And Yitzchak loved Eisav because of the taste of the meat he would trap [or, he would trap with his mouth].”</i> (Bereshit, 25:28)<br>The Midrash (<i>Bereshit</i> Rabba, 63:10) tells us, “that he would deceive his father into thinking that he was a scholar with fancy dilemmas in Torah, like how can one tithe salt and straw.” You cannot understand this literally, for surely Yitzchak Avinu was not mistaken in thinking he was actually genuine, when he was clearly cheating him. Yet from the beginning, Yaakov and Eisav were two men equal in their greatness. However, it was Eisav’s mind to make himself more appealing in his father’s eyes, so he would find favor in his father’s sight, and then accordingly pray to God to give his son Eisav more wisdom. Yaakov, however, went in the way of simplicity and said, “what need have I of this? If I am worthy in the sight of God, He will cause the heart of my father Yitzchak to pray for me.”<br>Eisav’s way was not honest in Yaakov’s view, for this way needs <i>birrur</i> (<i>birrur</i>), for who can say if this way will be accepted, and perhaps he is only doing it to deceive. Since Yaakov Avinu had separated himself from all uncertainty, his heart trusted only in God. And truly, everywhere that one enters himself into uncertainties in the service of God and into matters that need <i>birrur</i>, if the matter is clarified for the good then he is greater than one who just removed himself from all doubts. Yet this is only for the seed of Yaakov, since they have found a stronghold in God, that He will clarify all for the good, so it is permitted for him to enter into uncertainties. Yet whoever does not have this stronghold, it is forbidden for him to enter into uncertainty in the way that Eisav did with matters that were later clarified as being evil. For the Holy One, blessed be He, only clarifies Israel for the good, as is explained in the verse, “it will be <i>tsedaka</i> for us” (<i>Parshat Vaetchanan</i>). For all who are not from the seed of Yaakov, God would rather they limit themselves with all kinds of constrictions, as is explained concerning converts, for whom it is forbidden for them to enter into uncertainties.<br>So therefore, when Yitzchak saw that Eisav was entering himself into these matters, he said that if they are clarified for the good, then Eisav would become greater than Yaakov, yet God then showed him that Eisav’s intentions were not for the sake of Heaven. Also within Israel, we find that there are some souls who may permit themselves to enter into uncertainty more than others, even though they both come from the seed of Yaakov. Take, for instance, Shimon and Dinah. Levi did not want to take her because he feared that maybe his intentions were not completely for the sake of Heaven, as the fear of God is always before the tribe of Levi and they are careful to remove themselves from all doubts. This as it is said (Malachi, 2:5), “and I gave them to him for the fear,” etc. Because of this He brought out of them Cohanim who would enter “before Me and inside [the Holy of Holies],” and therefore their life was clarified immediately as explained in <i>Parshat Korach</i> (with the tribes, on the verse “and God said”). Shimon, however, entered himself into uncertainty, saying, “God forbid I would consider myself licentious,” and marrying Dinah.<br>Thus he created a situation that needed <i>birrur</i>, saying he trusts that God will make it clear that it was good, that his intention was not only to take her out from Shchem and all his intentions were for the sake of Heaven. Therefore the tribe of Shimon needed all these kinds of <i>birrurim</i>, such as Zimri who also said that his intention was good, as explained in its place (<i>Parshat Balak</i>). And in the future, when the tribe of Shimon will be clarified, its level will be greater than that of Levi.",
                    "<i>“And the men of the place asked of his wife, and he said, she is my sister .…”</i> (Bereshit, 26:7)<br>It is written in the Gemara (<i>Bava Metsia</i>, 59a), “Rava said to the men of his city Machoza, honor your wives, for in the merit of this you will become rich.” This is hinted at with Adam haRishon, where it says (<i>Bereshit</i>, 3:20), “and Adam called his wife Chava,” and then follows it immediately by saying, “and God made for Adam and his wife garments of skins and dressed them.” The meaning is, after God’s influence was reduced through the snake, His influence then returned by means of the garments of skins, since the man proclaimed the preciousness of Chava and called her the mother of all life. Similarly we find with Avraham who said of Sarah, “she is my sister” (in an effort to protect her) when he went to Egypt, and afterwards left with great wealth. It is also so of Yitzchak, who said of Rivka, “she is my sister,” that immediately after it is said, “and Yitzchak sowed in that land, and found a hundredfold in return, and God blessed him.”",
                    "<i>“And Yitzchak returned and digged the wells of water ….”</i> (Bereshit, 26:18)<br>It is written (<i>Tehilim</i>, 147:17), “He sends His ice like crumbs … He causes the wind to blow and the waters to flow.” “He sends His ice like crumbs,” meaning that God gives the nations the power to rule over Israel. “He causes the wind to blow,” that is to say that afterwards the Holy One, blessed be He, is reconciled with Israel, for “blows” is a term denoting <i>meshivat nefesh</i>, “restoring the soul.” Then sweetened waters will flow. “He speaks His word to Yaakov,” meaning that He tells them the sin and deficiency that exists within them, by means of which the nations have the power to rule over them, and then they immediately return in <i>teshuva</i>. “He did not do this to every nation,” for He does not reveal His intention to them at all.<br>And so it was here, when Yitzchak saw that Avimelech said to him, “go away from us,” since he thought that Yitzchak was feeling superior over them. Truly, Yitzchak’s feelings of superiority over Avimelech was not at all considered a deficiency, for it was as if a man felt superior to an animal, and it is simply the order of creation that man is greater than the animal. Therefore Avimelech’s response was very evil in his eyes, since he was the son of Avraham Avinu, who was a king in the world, as it was said (<i>Bereshit</i>, 23:6), “a prince of E-lohim.” Avraham’s prestige was widespread, and his nature well known, so why did they have to antagonize his son until he had to be banished from Gerar? Once he had regained composure, he realized that certainly he was blemished and lacking in the way of service of his father, meaning the attribute of love, which is desire and longing for words of Torah. Avimelech was but an instrument to insure that Yitzchak would take this to heart.<br>Avimelech himself did not at all understand how God was conducting affairs through him, for (<i>Tehilim</i>, 147), “they have not known His judgments.” Once Yitzchak understood this, it says immediately (<i>Bereshit</i>, 26:18), “and Yitzchak returned to dig the wells of water that the servants of his father had dug.” That is to say, by means of this he arrived at the attribute of love, seeing the deficiency in himself, and then of itself a new desire for words of Torah came to him (water and wells are often a symbol for Torah).<br>We find this concerning Shlomo haMelech. It is written in the Gemara (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, 21b), “silver was considered as nothing in the days of Shlomo” (Divrei HaYamim 2, 9:20), and it is written, “Shlomo gave out his silver in Jerusalem like stones” (Kings 1, 10:27). But there is a difference. The first verse refers to before he married Pharaoh’s daughter (and then silver was as having no value); the second is after he married Pharaoh’s daughter (and had the value of a stone, i.e., “<i>shave pruta</i>.” Rashi). At first, when he had great influence in Torah, then therefore he had less desire for words of Torah, which is called <i>cessef</i>, “silver.” <i>Cessef</i>, silver, is related to <i>Cisuf</i>, longing. Then after he married Pharaoh’s daughter, which was considered a deficiency, then of itself a new desire materialized within him. This is why after he married Pharaoh’s daughter it does not say, “considered as nothing,” regarding money (i.e., longing), for afterwards the desire had taken hold within him.",
                    "<i>“… and there Isaac’s servants dug a well.”</i> (Bereshit, 26:25)<br>Concerning the wells of our Forefather Yitzchak, Yitzchak strove to live the attribute whereby he would be distinguished and separated from the nations of the world, and the digging of the wells hints at this.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For a man must cleave to the attributes of God, and this is a sign among His Hosts, that they will not apprehend Him, but he will be exulted over all. Similarly the souls of Israel must distinguish themselves from the idolaters, as we find written in the Gemara (<i>Nedarim</i>, 65a), “Tsidkiyahu found Nebuchadnetsar eating a live rabbit. ‘Swear to me not to reveal this, that the matter not be found out.’ He swore, and later regretted it, had his vow annulled, and told of it. Nebuchadnetsar heard that they were deriding him, so he had Tsidkiyahu and the Sanhedrin brought before him. He said to them, ‘have you seen what Tsidkiyahu has done? Did he not swear on the name of Heaven that he would not reveal it?’ They answered him, ‘He was released of his oath.’ ‘Can one be released of an oath?’ he asked. ‘Yes,’ they answered. ‘In his presence or even not in his presence?’ ‘Actually in his presence,’ was their reply. ‘What did you decide?’ he asked them, ‘why didn’t you say this to Tsidkiyahu (that he could only annul his vow before me)?’ Immediately, ‘The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and keep silence’ [Eicha, 2:10]. Rabbi Yitzchak said, ‘This teaches that they removed the cushions from under them [to show that they had erred in a matter of law].’ “This is the matter here, for after they saw that Yitzchak was greatly successful, they thought that it may be because he has a certain way of conduct before the Holy One, blessed be He. This is as we found in the Gemara (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, 96a), “‘There is such a great man,’ he exclaimed, ‘and shall I not send him a greeting? Write to him: “Peace to King Hizkiah, peace to the city of Jerusalem, and peace to the great God!’” Now Nebuchadnetsar was Baladan’s scribe, but just then he was not present. When he came, he asked them, ‘How did you write?’ And they told him, ‘We wrote it this way.’ ‘You called him the great God,’ he said, ‘but you mentioned him last! Thus,’ said he, ‘you should have written: “peace to the great God, peace to the city of Jerusalem, and peace to King Hizkiah.” So the Sanhedrin had become depressed, and he was forced to reveal to them that he had eaten a live rabbit. “Rabbit” teaches of brazenness, as is explained in the <i>Mei Hashiloach, Parshat Shmini</i>, and since he ate such an animal alive it was a sign that he had in his roots such brazenness against heaven. All of this is only on the surface; therefore he permitted himself to break his vow seeing as they were greatly depressed that perhaps a single idolater could be compared to Israel. <i>Giliyon Mei HaShiloach</i>.</i><br>The first well was words of Torah, that He had chosen words of Torah and the recognition of the Creator, and this understanding is not found among the nations. “And the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with the herdsmen of Yitzchak, saying, the water is ours” (<i>Bereshit</i>, 26:20). This means that they asserted that they also have this understanding, for they too have the recognition of God and the seven <i>mitzvot</i> that were commanded of them.<br>The second well signifies that he chose the form of Divine service with the Temple sacrifices, and the nations asserted that they too have a part in this, for the Temple would also accept certain offerings from Gentiles. On this it says (<i>Bereshit</i>, 26:22), “and he removed from that place, and digged another well, over which they did not argue.” This well shows how he chose the attribute of patience and accepting suffering, that is to say, to suffer for the service of God, as it says in the Midrash (<i>Bereshit</i> Rabba, 69:8), “Yitzchak reinstituted the way of suffering.” “And over this they did not argue,” for immediately after this well had been dug they ran away, scorning it. This is why of this well it is said, “for God has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land.” This means that he asked of God that he not have to undergo great suffering, God forbid, but only to receive Divine visitations (punishment from God alone). What is the nature of Divine visitation? The Gemara explains (<i>Arachin</i>, 16b), “even if he intended to pull three coins out of his pocket, and he only pulled out two [it is counted as a Divine visitation].” “And we will be fruitful in the land” means that for all we have suffered, God will return to us good far greater than our loss. This is why the fourth well is called “<i>Sheva</i>,” (<i>Bereshit</i>, 26:33) for <i>Sheva</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meaning seven or satisfied; both make sense here.</i> hints at the future, as is known. That is, in the future the Holy One, blessed be He, will return goodness to all those who suffered over the sanctification of His blessed name.<br>This is the explanation of the Midrash (<i>Bereshit</i> Rabba, <i>Bereshit</i>, 65:10), “And Yitzchak’s servants came” (<i>Bereshit</i>, 26:32). We do not know if they had found water or if they did not find water, but from what it says (verse 19), “and found there a well of living water,” we take it that they found living water.” The explanation of “we do not know if they found living water” is that if it says with the first well, “and they found a well of living water,” then it is all the more so concerning the fourth well, which hints at the good that is hidden in the future. On this, also of third well he said, “for now God has given us expansion and made us fruitful in the land.”",
                    "<i>“And God appeared to him that same night, and He said, I am God of Avraham your father … and he built there an altar … and the servants of Yitzchak dug a well ….”</i> (Bereshit, 26:24–25)<br>It does not say that he gave it a name. We can understand this by means of a parable. A man finds out that the king will come and visit him on a certain day. He begins to prepare all kinds of food, and during his preparations the king comes and visits. Then the man drops all that he is doing and receives the king. It is also like this here, for when God appeared to him, he did not turn to do anything else.",
                    "<i>“And Eisav was forty years old, and he took for a wife Yehudit daughter of Beeri the Hitite, and Basmat daughter of Eilon the Hitite.”</i> (Bereshit, 26:34)<br>Here Eisav “put forth his hooves (showed his true colors).” The name Yehudit teaches of drawing power, for the letter <i>Yud</i> is a single point that is ready to be made into other letters. She had a gentle demeanor about her, and seemed to be drawn after Yitzchak and Rivka. The name Basmat teaches of peace of mind, from the word for “sweetened” <i>mevusam</i> (a sweetened mind is peace of mind), as it says in the Gemara (<i>Yoma</i>, 76b), “Rava said, wine and fragrant spices made me wise.” Therefore it follows immediately that Basmat did not have this effect, only causing a bitter spirit, “<i>marat ruach</i>,” for Yitzchak and Rivka (verse 35). <i>Mara</i>, “bitter,” is like <i>zaken mamre</i>, the rebellious elder. In other words, a bad smell. This is why in the Aramaic translation of Onkles it reads, “<i>mesarvan u’margezan</i>,” contentious and infuriating. Contentious in corresponding to the name Yehudit to show that in actuality she had no affinity for Yitzchak and Rivka, and infuriating corresponding to the name Basmat, for this was her nature even though her name signified a calm spirit.",
                    "<i>“And it came to pass that Yitzchak was old, and his eyesight was fading.”</i> (Bereshit, 27:1)<br>Yitzchak Avinu’s circumstances were precisely the opposite of Moshe Rabeynu’s. Yitzchak was not permitted to leave the land of Israel, and yet he went blind. Moshe Rabeynu was not permitted to enter the land of Israel, and yet it was said to him in <i>Parshat Vaetchanan</i>, “see with your eyes that you will not cross this Jordan.”",
                    "<i>“… See, the smell of my son is like the smell of the field which God has blessed.”</i> (Bereshit, 27:27)<br>“Field” hints at the expansion of desire. Therefore Eisav was called a man of the field since he extended himself into all kinds of lusts and evil desires. Yaakov Avinu, however, expanded in <i>Kedusha</i>, and this is “the smell of my son is like the smell of a field which God has blessed,” meaning the field of the Holy Apples. (This is a term in kabbalah denoting <i>Malchut</i>—sovereignty, the Shekhina, and the “workers of the field” are those involved in the study of divine mysteries.)",
                    "<i>“… Lavan, son of Betuel the Aramean, brother of Rivka, Yaakov and Eisav’s mother.”</i> (Bereshit, 28:5)<br>Yitzchak made it known to Yaakov that he had already completed all the <i>birurim</i> (clarifications) necessary between Israel and the nations of the world. Therefore he told his son that he need not occupy himself with this, for all his children would be called in the name of Israel. They, however, had to make even more important <i>birurim</i> among the souls of Israel themselves, in order to distinguish who were the select, for there are many levels among them. This is even so for the future, of which it is said (Yesahya, 11:9), “and the world will be filled with the knowledge of God,” for it is also said (Yirmiya, 31:26), “behold, the days are coming, says God, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Yehuda, with the seed of man, and the seed of beast.” These are conflicting levels. Then man will no longer experience dread before his teacher, for man shall no longer learn from his brethren, but all that one innovates in words of Torah will be made known to his fellow with brilliance. This is because at this time everyone will know his own portion in Torah is with perfect clarity. Yaakov suffered greatly over these <i>birurim</i> (in the course of Jewish spiritual history), and this was the entire matter with Yosef who asserted that he was the chosen among his brothers.",
                    "<i>“… Lavan … brother of Rivka ….”</i> (Bereshit, 28:5)<br>Yitzchak told Yaakov that he shall see and understand, that just as his mother gave birth to good and evil at one time, so too he should be wary of Lavan who also contains a mixture of good and evil, and he should take care that he receives only the good.",
                    "<i>“And Eisav went to Yishmael, and took Makhalat daughter of Yishmael … for a wife.”</i> (Bereshit, 28:9)<br>It is written in the Midrash (<i>Bereshit</i> Rabba, 67:13), “we derive from the name <i>makhalat</i> that the Holy One, blessed be He, forgave [<i>makhal</i>] Eisav for all of his sins.” The main characteristic of Eisav was murder, while the main characteristic of Yishmael was licentiousness. Despite all of the deficiencies in the world, each of the two has a positive aspect. For instance, though the root of anger is evil, nonetheless there is a value in getting angry at a criminal. And though the root of licentiousness is evil, it has a positive aspect in that there it allows for amelioration in a place void of God’s will, and the good are allowed to improve. This can be understood in how Eisav went and took Yishmael’s daughter Makhalat, he made it clear that there was nothing good about him. This is because he becomes angry at the <i>tsaddikim</i> and showed mercy to the wicked, combining these two deficiencies together. This is the explanation of why “all his sins were forgiven,” for He no longer needed to watch over the details of his sins, since it had been made clear that he had no good side within him, and had no life at all. By way of example, a man wants to take revenge on his neighbor. He thinks about how much his neighbor wronged him. Yet when he sees that his neighbor has given himself over to rebellion against the kingdom, completely abandoned God’s law, (then he is lost, so to speak, and somehow) forgiven for all transgression. Thus it was here, that God forgave all his sins.",
                    "<i>“And God appeared unto him and said, do not descend to Egypt. Dwell in the land of which I shall tell unto you [Israel].”</i> (Bereshit, 26:2)<br>Why was it forbidden for Yitzchak to descend into Egypt, but not for Avraham? Yitzchak needed live in a perpetual state of the fear of God and constraint. He felt a constant need to guard himself. Therefore it was forbidden for him to leave Israel, for whoever is in need of constraint is not permitted to go out and find a reason to earn a livelihood until God summons him to do so.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And to constrict himself in his eating. Therefore God said to him, “sit in your house and wait expectantly until I find you a reason to earn a living. In the realm of the <i>brit hamaor</i> (his sexual activity), he was greatly constrained; therefore he needed no restrictions concerning this, as it is said (<i>Bereshit</i>, 26:8), “and Yitzchak was sporting with his wife Rivka.” Avraham Avinu, however, was constrained in his eating, therefore it was permitted for him to look for reasons to earn a livelihood. Thus it is with all the souls of Israel, whoever knows where he is constrained in the composition of his soul, it is permitted for him to travel from his place and go after his own reasons. Indeed whosoever knows where his heart is afflicted and in this could experience expansion, God forbid, he must wait for God’s salvation, when He shall invite him to go out from his place and his house. <i>Tashlum Mei HaShiloach</i>.</i>"

God forbid that I should give up hope in my Creator, but rather [as the verse continues], my help comes from God.’” When Yaakov went out from Beer Sheva, having no food to eat, nothing in his possession, and needing to go to Lavan to tend sheep for his livelihood, he became greatly despondent, for owing to his situation he saw himself as quite small in comparison to his father and grandfather. Avraham and Yitzchak did not have to concern themselves at all with matters of this world, but were constantly involved in Divine service and <i>ma’ase merkava</i>, the secrets of the Torah. But Yaakov had to occupy himself with these small matters. “He returned and said, ‘I will not give up hope in my Creator,’” which means that even though they were free for great and lofty matters, and I am occupied in mundane things, nonetheless there is also the service of God in this, for He is the one who formed all.",
                    "<i>“And Yaakov departed ….”</i> (Bereshit, 28:10)<br>Why did Yaakov Avinu not pray for his journey immediately upon leaving Beer Sheva, but waited until here (Beit El, north of Jerusalem) for his prayer, “if God will be with me and guard me …” for this was the prayer for his journey? This matter may be understood based on what is written in the Gemara (<i>Bechorot</i>, 56a), “Rav Asi said, Rabbi Yochanan said, if one acquires ten embryos in ten pregnant cows [and the animals were born after he had already owned them], all are brought into a pen and tithed.” The Gemara asks, “are we not taught, if one buys from a friend, or receives as a gift, he is exempt from having to tithe [for he must tithe only those animals born while in his possession]? Rabbi Elazar said, I say that Reb Yochanan appeared in my dream and solved it favorably. [He must tithe the unborn animals, even if they were received as embryos in animals that did not need to be tithed], for it is written, ‘so you shall do,’ [“Give Me the firstborn of your sons, so you shall do to your cattle …” <i>Shemot</i> 22] meaning at the time they are being ‘done’ [or fit to be offered in the Temple].” This means that if he acquired them at a time when he was obligated to tithe, then he is exempt from tithing except for the unborn animals he acquired.<br>It is similar here with Yaakov Avinu. The solution of Rabbi Elazar only came to him after he saw Rabbi Yochanan in a dream, meaning that the only one who would understand this is the one to whom the Holy One, blessed be He, shows His attribute of mercy. Rabbi Yochanan represents this quality of God’s mercy, as it says in the Gemara (<i>Berachot</i>, 57a), “whoever sees Yochanan in his dream, the miracle of miracles will be done for him.” Therefore Yaakov Avinu could not pray first. In his prophetic spirit he saw all that would happen to him on his journey, and he also knew that his prayer would finish with “all that you give me I will give a tenth thereof,” so he then asked the same question as mentioned earlier in the Gemara, that one who acquires something is exempt from tithing. Therefore he could not offer this prayer, for with Yaakov it was said (<i>Bereshit</i>, 31:41), “I have worked six years with your sheep,” and if so, he was one who had acquired. It was only after God had appeared to him in a dream, and with Yaakov Avinu God was addressed with the title “the merciful,” as it is said (<i>Bereshit</i>, 33:5), “the children which God has been merciful in giving His servant.” This is akin to what is said in the Gemara, “I saw Reb Yochanan (the attribute of mercy) in a dream.”<br>Therefore Yaakov knew that something new would be done for him, as it is written, “at the time of doing,” and Yaakov bought the sheep from Lavan in their mother’s wombs, before “the time of doing,” or birth, as his conditions with Lavan concerned the sheep that would be born from now on, and the blessing of God came upon them in their mother’s wombs. Thus they were required to be tithed. Once he understood this reason he could well pray, “if God will be with me … I will give a tenth … ”",
                    "<i>“And behold God was standing on him ….”</i> (Bereshit, 28:13)<br>God’s revelation in the world depends on three factors, place, time, and person. Place is the Holy Temple, where there is a revelation of His Godliness. The choicest of times is Shabbat, a time of the revelation of His Godliness. And person, the souls of Israel unto whom He is revealed. Here these three factors are complete; the place of the Temple, as it is said, “this is none other than the house of God”; the choicest of times, for surely this revelation took place on the holy Shabbat; and person, this is Yaakov Avinu, the choicest of souls, in whom all the souls of Israel are included, as it is written (Yesahya, 29:23), “Yaakov shall not be ashamed … for when he sees his children, the work of My hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify My name, and sanctify the Holy One of Yaakov …”",
                    "<i>“And behold God was standing on him ….”</i> (Bereshit, 28:13)<br>This verse is in itself a blessing. Just as the <i>Kedusha</i> (sanctity) of Shabbat is fixed and exists without any act of sanctification or awakening from below on the part of Israel, as it is sanctified only by God Himself, unlike the other festivals where Israel sanctifies them, so the <i>Kedusha</i> of Yaakov Avinu is like the <i>Kedusha</i> of Shabbat, sanctified by God and needing no awakening from below. Therefore the verse does not say “<i>omed alav</i>” (the normal way of saying “standing on him”) but rather “<i>nitsav</i>” (a special kind of standing). The meaning of <i>omed</i> is that now He is standing on him but not before, only now from the power of his own awakening, while <i>nitsav</i> that He was always connected to him.",
                    "<i>“… And He said, I am Hashem, God of Avraham your father, and God of Yitzchak ….”</i> (Bereshit, 28:13)<br>It is written in the holy Zohar (<i>Bereshit</i>, 150a), “Yisrael is in the middle of everything, he receives the [the effusion of God’s abundance] first from the source of everything …” This verse says “your father” regarding Avraham but not regarding Yitzchak. The attribute of Avraham is love, and the attribute of Yitzchak is fear. In a place of abundant love fear is constricted, and similarly when the attribute of fear is complete, then love is constricted. However, with Yaakov Avinu, the two attributes balanced each other, and this is called the attribute of <i>tiferet</i>, harmony or beauty—the attribute of Yaakov Avinu, which contains both of them, and they do not contradict each other.",
                    "<i>“… I will give to you and your offspring the land on which you are lying ….”</i> (Bereshit, 28:13)<br>This blessing is saying that your thoughts were clear and pure even when you were sleeping. “And all the families of the earth will be blessed in you and in your offspring” means that you will adorn all the nations with your words of Torah, as it is written (<i>Devarim</i>, 4:6), “for they are your wisdom and your understanding in the eyes of the nations.” “And behold, I am with you.” “I” is written in the form <i>Anochi</i>, as opposed to the usual form <i>Ani</i>, for the additional letter, <i>caf</i>, teaches of the unceasing source of life, as is written in the <i>Sefer Yetsira</i> (Ch. 4:41 in the version of the Ari”zal), and the Holy One, blessed be He, showed him all the refinement that he would have to suffer, so therefore He promised him, “and I will guard you everywhere you shall go, and I shall return you to this land.” “I shall return you” (<i>hashivoticha</i> in Hebrew) is the term for returning a lost article. “<i>Hashevat aveida</i>,” for one cannot stand on the Torah unless he has first failed in keeping it (tractate <i>Gittin</i>, 43a), meaning that through the very act of failing man has an even greater desire for Torah. This is the formulation of <i>hasivoticha</i>, meaning <i>teshuvah</i>, the return to the Torah.",
                    "<i>“The name of the older one was Leah and that name of the younger one Rachel ….”</i> (Bereshit, 29:16)<br>It is written in the Midrash (Kohollet Rabba 7:3), “A man has three names—one is what his father and mother called him, one is what other people call him, and one is the name he acquires for himself.” “The name his father and mother called him,” refers to the qualities that are recognized in the infant immediately after he is born, if he will be wise or foolish, lazy or industrious, and the like. In the first generations this wisdom was clear and apparent to all; and they would see in the face of the infant the attributes of his nature, and in this way Lavan called his daughters appropriate names according to his understanding of their natures. The name Rachel teaches that she bears jealousy and (the need for) victory in her heart, but does not let this go out of her lips, as it is written (Yesahya, 53:7), “as a lamb [<i>rachel</i>] is silent before its shearers,” and her jealousy was for the sake of Heaven, as it is written, “and Rachel was jealous of her sister” (and wanted to populate the tribes who would bring the Torah to the world).<br>The name Leah is similar to the word <i>nilei</i>, or exhausted, in that she was always exhausted from the thirst for God’s salvation. Concerning the name that other people call him, this is what others see in his nature and dealings in his chosen occupation. And the name he acquires for himself is how he fixes and heals his deficiency, even those he was born with, and this is the meaning of the verse (Mishlei, 3:9), “it shall be health to your navel,” meaning to the lack that he has from the moment of birth, for it says in the Gemara (<i>Sotah</i>, 45:2), “the beginning of man’s formation is from his navel.” This is as the prophet Yesahya said (48:8), “you are called a sinner from the womb,” as the name he acquires for himself is far greater than the name he was born with. Name always signifies the source of life, as the entire soul is exemplified in it.",
                    "<i>“And she said, this time I will thank God ….”</i> (Bereshit, 29:35)<br>It is written in the Gemara (<i>Megillah</i>, 6b), “Rabbi Yitzchak said, if a man tells you he tried but did not succeed, do not believe him. I did not try but I succeeded, do not believe him. I tried and I succeeded, believe him.” Of course the Gemara does not deal in nonsense. If one who says I tried but did not succeed, and we can see that he tried very hard and did not succeed, and another says I did not try very hard but still I succeeded, and we can see that he did not put in much effort but still succeeded, so if so, then why would we say not to believe them? Yet the depth of the matter is explained with Rachel and Leah. Surely with our matriarch Rachel, how much did she plead and pray that God would show His salvation and give her children, yet still it did not help her since it says, “and Rachel was jealous of her sister.” It had to be made clear whether this jealousy was <i>kinat sofrim</i>, envy at another’s good behavior for the sake of Heaven, or the normal jealousy of the world according to nature, God forbid.<br>This is the way in which God deals with man. When He gives His good in the form of an attribute, in that very attribute He creates a lack, and the good within cannot come into action until the lack has been healed. Before this lack is healed all the prayers and self-mortification that a man attempts will be of no use until the lack is healed and he experiences salvation. Therefore, it was necessary to clarify Rachel’s attribute of jealousy, and before this was clarified all prayer and struggle was useless.<br>This is why Yaakov became angry with her when she asked him to pray for her. This must be understood, for did she not act according to the law? Whosoever has discord in his house is to go to the sage, and the sage will ask for mercy on his behalf (<i>Baba Batra</i>, 116a; so Rachel was doing just this in going to Yaakov in her distress). This same question was asked by the Ramban of blessed memory. Yet since it was written before she went to Yaakov, “and Rachel was jealous,” therefore Yaakov became angry because before she even came to him she needed to clarify her jealousy. Then when she said to Yaakov, “here is my handmaid before you … and I too will build [the future tribes] from her,” we see that her intentions were for the sake of Heaven because she included her handmaid in her household (that she did it for the children and not just for herself). And this is the meaning of “I tried and did not succeed, do not believe him,” for even though we see that truly he tried very hard, he did not exert himself in the place where he was supposed to.<br>This is like one who wants to enter a house but knocks on a wall far away from the door; even if he knocks all day it will not help him. If he goes to the door and knocks, then it will be opened for him right away. “I did not try but I succeeded” is understood from Leah. When she gave birth to Yehuda she said, “this time I will thank God,” since she did not ask for this, already having taken her portion before in giving birth to more children more quickly than the other matriarchs, so it seems as if she did not try but still succeeded. Yet with God all was according to judgment. God testified concerning her that she had struggled very much regarding her first three children, as she said (with Reuven), “for God has seen my poverty” (with Shimon), “for God has heard that I am despised.”<br>Thus God gave her Yehuda, like a man who gives an additional portion to a friend who takes a great amount from him. The additional amount that the Holy One, blessed be He, gives is greater than the initial portion. This is the preciousness of the soul of Yehuda. He was greater than his brothers because all the greatness went out from him. On this she said, “this time I will thank God,” for a soul like this is not born from the power, reward, or righteousness of a person, but only from the blessing of God. When it comes from the power of man it only comes according to his actions, but when God gives the additional portion from His side then it is without any limit; therefore His additional portion is greater than the main portion. Therefore when it says “<i>vatahar od</i>,” “and she conceived again,” concerning Shimon and Levi the <i>ta’am</i> (cantillation mark for the melody) called <i>munach zarka</i> is used, yet when it says “and she conceived again,” for Yehuda, the <i>ta’am</i> for the melody is <i>kadma ve’azlah</i>, meaning without any effort. Understand this.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Munach zarka</i> brings the melody down to its lowest point, a downward swirl, here signifying struggle, showing that she truly did struggle with her first sons, also as seen in the derivation of their names. <i>Kadma ve’azla</i> brings the melody to its highest point, an upward surge, showing that after her struggle she found God’s salvation, which was without limit, surging upwards and this only came about by the blessing of God.</i>",
                    "This is as we pray in the <i>Amida</i> prayer, in the first of the Eighteen Benedictions, “who owns all, and remembers the kindness of the forefathers, and brings a redeemer to their children’s children for the sake of His name with love.” “Owns all” means that God is involved with all of His creation, for nothing He created was superfluous. “And remembers the kindnesses of the Patriarchs” means that God remember the good that the Patriarchs would do with all their power and all their souls, bringing the entire world close to God, and not standing for a second without love and fear. Nevertheless, “He brings a redeemer to their children’s children for the sake of His name,” for it is not enough to reveal the light of the king messiah in the merit of the Patriarchs, only for the sake of His name. This is as it is written in the Gemara (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, 100a), “whoever gives the poor his entire amount in this world, the Holy One, blessed be He, gives him His entire amount in the world to come.” Because they exerted themselves with all their power, that the glory of Heaven should be revealed by means of them, therefore the attribute of justice dictates that the Holy One, blessed be He, should pay them according to the full amount of His blessed power."

                    "<i>“And Yaakov Avinu came to … Shchem, … and he graced the faces of the city ….”</i> (Bereshit, 33:18) (<i>Vayichan et p’nei ha’eer</i> is normally translated, “and he camped before the city.”)<br>“The faces of the city” means its honored citizens, and “the faces of the city” at that time were Shchem and Hamor. The term <i>vayichan</i> (meaning “pitched,” but also meaning “graced”) means that their grace was aroused in his sight (he liked them). This relates to what is found in the writings of the holy Ari”zal (<i>Shaar haGilgulim</i>, Ch. 50) that “Shchem was later reincarnated into Zimri ben Salu son of Dinah.” Therefore his soul desired her now also, as it said (<i>Bereshit</i> 34:8), “My son Shchem’s soul desired your daughter.” This means that he did not want to marry with the women of Canaan, only Dinah; and in this he found favor in the sight of Yaakov, for he was somewhat connected to Yaakov Avinu.",
                    "<i>“And E-lohim ascended from him in the place where He spoke with him.”</i> (Bereshit, 35:13)<br>For God showed Yaakov that he needed to undergo further <i>birrurim</i> (clarifications),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, <i>birrur</i>s that he would undergo with the sale of Yosef. <i>Tashlum</i>.</i> and this is, “and God ascended from him,” as if he still needed to hold on to Him. “In the place where He spoke with him” means concerning the same financial matters with which the Torah was now dealing, for they were not yet complete. The same intention concerns what was said of Avraham (<i>Bereshit</i>, 17:22), “and E-lohim ascended from upon Avraham,” after the section discussing <i>brit milah</i>, for here too he needed to undergo further <i>birurim</i> with the trial of the binding of Yitzchak. There, however, it does not say “in the place where He spoke with him,” for the needed <i>birurum</i> and the immediate subject were not the same.",
                    "<i>“And Yisroel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eider.”</i> (Bereshit, 35:21)<br>This concerns what is written in the Midrash (Ruth Rabba, 2:7), “even after all the tribulations and adventures of Yaakov Avinu, the death of Rachel was more difficult on him than all of them.” It is the way of the <i>Tsaddikim</i>, and especially Yaakov Avinu, to strengthen himself and not to question the attributes of the Holy One, blessed be He, for certainly everything is for the good. This is why it says here after the death of Rachel, “and he pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eider,” meaning that he strengthened himself and did not question the ways of the Holy One, blessed be He. Both “tower” and <i>eider</i> (a heard) are terms denoting <i>tekifut</i> (unbridled strength), and truly God had a deep intent with the death of Rachel, as mentioned in the holy Zohar (<i>Bereshit</i>, 175a). This is as it said (<i>Bereshit</i>, 35:22), “and it was, when Yisroel dwelt in the land …” “Dwelling” signifies acceptance, as he accepted it and did not at all question God’s attributes, for surely God intended a depth in this that was above his apprehension.<br>Then afterwards, God showed him that it was proper to ask for the depth to be revealed, for a man needs to ask for this. Even though questioning His attributes is forbidden, nevertheless he must ask God to show him what He wanted to effect with this depth, for it is the way of God not to conceal anything for those who long for His mercy. He showed him this in the incident with Reuven, and after (in the same verse), “and the sons of Yisrael were twelve.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The holy Isbitser does not reveal this depth, only pointing where to look. We have all in verse 22, first the ready acceptance of the stern judgments of God in the word “dwell.” Second, an answer to the meaning of the depth of God’s decision in, “and Reuven lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine, and Israel heard it,” for hearing always means understanding; so Israel understood why this happened, and from this, the reason for Rachel’s death. Third, there is an empty space in the middle of the verse as written in the Torah, between “and Yisroel heard” and “the son’s of Jacob were twelve,” for this is the landscape of silence through which the secrets of the Torah are transmitted. Whosoever can understand this silence in relation to Yisroel’s hearing and the tribes will truly know something of the secrets of the Torah.</i> This means that God opened for him the meaning of the order of the enumeration of the tribes, for every time the twelve tribes are mentioned they are enumerated in a different order, and each order is a study in itself for those who turn themselves to words of Torah. Therefore we come to this order now, after the death of Rachel.<br>This is the order of the tribes according to its various enumerations in sixteen places.<br>1.

The <i>kelipa</i> (“shell” or evil force) of Edom is the greatest of them all, as there is only a slight and fine difference between it and Israel, for immediately after Israel begins his life, Eisav begins his (as Rashi notes that the first seed to conceive was Israel, then Eisav). Thus we see a great difference between Israel and all the nations of the world. Even with the Ishmaelites, even though they are of the seed of Avraham, still there is a great difference, because from the mother’s side they have no connection to Israel. Yet compared to Israel we see no visible difference, for they both appear clean regarding their mother, but it was the will of the blessed Creator that Yaakov would be the chosen one, and this is as it is written (Malachi, 1:2), “Is not Eisav Yaakov’s brother?” “Brother” meaning that the two were equal, or that at the time of conception when the level of one over the other is unrecognizable for as of yet there are no <i>mitzvot</i> and good deeds, no sin or transgression, and both are from Yitzchak and Rivka. Yet nevertheless, “and I loved Yaakov and hated Eisav,” meaning that it was only God’s will.<br>This is as it is written (Yechezkel, 23:20), “for their flesh is that of asses, and their urine of horses.” That is to say, that at the moment of conception God made it clear that this drop will be in the purity of <i>Kedusha</i> (holiness), and the other the urine of horses. Even though nothing evil was recognized in Eisav, he is anyhow compared to a pig (<i>Vayikra</i> Rabba, 13:5). It is written in the Gemara (<i>Bechorot</i> 8a), “an apple tree grows after sixty days, and so too does a pig give birth after sixty days.” For the letter <i>samech</i> (which is sixty) is in the form of a bow, and a bow is a refuge of strength, meaning that Eisav says that he finds a refuge of strength in God since he was born from Yitzchak and Rivka just like us, for Israel is likened to an apple. Yet God is the one who clarifies that with Eisav it is only on the surface, while Israel is truly cleaving to God. And whoever is knowledgeable in the names of the kings can see this explicitly."

                "Vayeshev": [
                    "<i>“And Yaakov dwelled ….”</i> (Bereshit, 37:1)<br>“And Yaakov shall return, and be quiet and contented, and none shall disturb him” (Yirmiya, 30:10). “And it shall be afterwards I will pour out my spirit … your elders shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions” (Joel, 3:1). All the actions done in the world seem to be the actions of flesh and blood, but ideas and thoughts seem to come from God. But in these <i>Parshiot</i> God teaches us that it is the actions are in the hands of God and thoughts come from man, and all the actions that man does are only those that he is given leave to do, as it is written in the Gemara (<i>Berachot</i>, 33b), “all is in the hands of Heaven.” So the performance of a commandment or the opposite is in the hands of God, and only occasionally does He make the performance of a commandment dependent on man.<br>We find in the Gemara (<i>Sotah</i>, 10a), “on the incident of Yehuda and Tamar, where he said, ‘she is more righteous than I,’ ‘than I,’ ‘<i>mimeni</i>,’ also means ‘from Me.’ Our Rabbis interpreted this to mean that a Divine voice came out of heaven to say that the whole incident came forth from Me.” It is said concerning the dreams of Yosef haTsaddik that they were inconsequential daydreams (that thoughts are really from the side of man), and truly his brothers gave him this response when he told them his dream. When Yaakov Avinu dreamed his dream en route to Lavan, he investigated it and taught all the depth within it to the tribes, and they studied it, each time receiving new Torah insights into its nature, for so many deep Torah insights are contained in this dream.<br>So when Yosef haTsaddik said to them that he also dreamed dreams as precious as his father’s, they answered him, “will you surely rule over us?” For how could you resemble our father, for is not our father in a state of awe and cleaving to God all day long, and for this God shows him the depths of the Torah in his dreams, for he is cleaving God even in his sleep. But you are not on this level, so all your dreams are inconsequential fancies, and through your desire for greatness and status you dream these dreams, for you have no greatness from the qualities of the fear of God or humility.<br>Yaakov Avinu, on the other hand, was constantly engaging in Divine service through these qualities—fear—meaning that he saw how God watches over everything, as it is written (<i>Tehilim</i>, 33:14), “from Your dwelling place you watch” and “he does not sleep” (<i>Tehilim</i>, 121:4). And humility—meaning he did not find himself superior to any part of creation, for “the superiority of a man over a beast is naught.” This, “naught” <i>ayin</i> in Hebrew, means that even though that truly from God’s point of view there is a difference between man and beast, from man’s point of view there is no (<i>ain</i>) distinction. This is “and Yaakov dwelled in the land of his father’s sojourning,” signifying fear (Zohar <i>Bereshit</i> 180a), and the continuation, “in the land of Canaan,” means humility. (The name Canaan is similar to the word for humility or submissiveness, <i>c’niya</i>.) And as the Midrash says, “he asked to live in peace.”<br>This particular kind of peace occurs when a man conducts himself in a way as to remove himself and to guard himself from all doubt and all evil action. Concerning this, God told him that as long as man is connected to his body, it is not possible to reach the highest levels of self-guarding, fear, and humility. This is because God desires the actions of man, and in this world one must conduct himself with love, which means to act in ways that are not in the highest state of refinement. This is the formulation of the verse in Yirmiya, “and Yaakov returned [<i>shav</i>],” similar to “He restores [<i>yeshovev</i>] my soul,” in the delight of the Torah. “And be quiet,” meaning on the level of Shabbat, “and strangers shall stand and tend your sheep,” (Yesahya, 61:5). “And content,” meaning in thought, not to fear from wars and transient events. “And none shall disturb you,” meaning that even in your sleep you shall cleave to God, and not to fear, for nothing shall cause you to withdraw from God. This was the accusation of the tribes against Yosef haTsaddik. He too conducted himself in the attribute of fear. On this it says in the Midrash (<i>Bereshit</i> Rabba, 84:8), “the light of his face was similar to Yaakov,” meaning that he delved deeply into these two attributes of fear and humility, in order that he could proceed in confidence. Thus it was said of him, “he was the son of his old age,” meaning that just as Yaakov Avinu conducted himself according to the attributes of Yitzchak Avinu, namely fear, so too did Yosef conduct himself with this attribute, and with humility, just like his father.<br>For this reason God was also exacting with Yosef haTsaddik down to a hairsbreadth, for even though these attributes are good, one still needs to trust in God, for the actions done on the part of man are not an everlasting structure. Even though Yosef guarded himself greatly, and from him emerged all the kings of Israel who were called great, as it says in the Midrash (<i>Bereshit</i> Rabba, 84:14), “It was the custom of great men to wear sackcloth [to suffer], for Yehoram dressed in sackcloth,” yet still, it is said of them (Kings 1, 11:39), “yet not all the days.” This means that (even through all their suffering) an everlasting structure was not to be in their portion, but rather in the portion of Yehuda. Even though he (Yosef) acted so his righteousness would stand in the world throughout the 6,000 years (until the redemption), still, the everlasting structure was the portion of Yehuda. And Yosef haTsaddik continually voiced the complaint—why is it that God causes all the actions of my brother Yehuda to succeed, yet with me, the Holy One, blessed be He, is exacting down to a hairsbreadth?<br>So, in an answer to his query, God showed him the example of the wine steward and the baker. Every king has two attendants, one a wine steward and the other a baker. Truly, with the wine steward, if the king finds a fly in his cup it is not proper to punish him, for what could he do? The fly is an independent living creature, and if once the cup has been passed to the king the fly decides to land into the cup, then it is not possible to guard from it. Yet with the baker, if there is a pebble in the bread, isn’t it his fault, for the pebble is not a living being and he could have prevented it? In this God shows Yosef that he corresponds to the baker, for God established him in a bright and clean place over against Eisav, in order that Eisav would not have any room for accusation. This is why established Yosef against him, clean in all respects, as it is written (Ovadiah, 1:18), “and the house of Yosef is a flame [and the house of Eisav straw … and they shall devour them].” He gave him strength to be able to overcome all his desires. Then if some impure aspect comes to him from without, it is counted against him as a crime. Only out of God’s love for Yosef did He put another man in his place, and kill the baker, as it is written (Yesahya, 43:4), “and I will give men in your place.” From this he understood the matter.<br>Yehuda corresponds to the wine steward, for King David is called “the King’s jester” (Zohar <i>Shemot</i>, 107a), and the songs of David are sung over the wine libation offerings. Truly, with Yehuda, concerning the incident with Tamar and all the happenings of the tribe of Yehuda similar to this, God instilled them with such a great power of desire that it was not even within their power to overcome it. As it is explained (<i>Bereshit</i> Rabba, 85:9), “the angel in charge of desire forced him.” Therefore it was not his fault that he could not overpower his inclination to evil. This is the meaning of “the King’s jester,” meaning that he lets God win over him, as King David said (<i>Tehilim</i>, 51:6), “in order that You should be shown right in Your word,” let whoever it pleases You to be right, You or I.",
                    "This is as it is said (Yesahya, 11:13), “Efriam shall not be jealous of Yehuda, and Yehuda shall not distress Efriam.” These two tribes were always opposing each other, for the force of life which God gave to Efriam (from Yosef) was of the nature that it always looked to every action regarding its judgment and law, without moving from it. Therefore, when the writings warn Israel against sinning, then the aim of the Torah will be to say (Amos, 5:6), “lest the house of Yosef should prevail like fire,” that they should take care that there is no opposition to their actions. The root of life for Yehuda, however, is to look to God regarding the course of every action. Even though he sees where the judgment leans, still he looks to God in order to see the depth of the truth of the matter. It could be that even though the judgment is true according to the claims of the plaintiffs, yet still it is not at the deepest level of truth, for fear that one would make a false claim.<br>This is as we find (<i>Nedarim</i>, 25a) in the case of Rava’s cane. (One had not paid another a debt, and the other asserted that he had paid it. They told him to swear on a Torah scroll, and before doing so, he said to his lender, “hold my cane,” inside of which he had hidden the amount owed. He then swore on the Torah that all the money he owed he had paid to his hand. Which, of course, only he could know was true. The lender was furious at the apparent false oath and broke the cane, the money spilling onto the floor.) So it is with all matters, and this is the root of life for Yehuda, to look to God in everything and not to act simply in a way that is accepted or habitual. Even though yesterday he acted in such a way, yet anyhow, today he does not want to rely on his former response, only that God should illuminate His will into him anew. This matter sometimes necessitates even doing something against the law, for, “it is a time to do for God, the Torah has been suspended” (<i>Tehilim</i>, 119:126). In this way these two tribes oppose each other. Of the future it is said that, “Efriam will not be jealous of Yehuda, and Yehuda will not distress Efriam.” Then Efriam will not accuse Yehuda for the times when he goes outside of the law. He will not trouble him over this, because God will show Efriam the intentions of Yehuda, that his intentions are for the sake of Heaven and not for his own benefit. Then, of itself, there will be peace between them.",
                    "<i>“And Yaakov returned to the land of his father’s sojourning, in the land of Canaan.”</i> (Bereshit, 37:1)<br>In this <i>Parsha</i> we find the first fine spiritual <i>birrur</i>s (<i>birrurim</i>) that occurred internally within Israel. Avraham Avinu was the root of the attribute of love, for he separated out all the kinds of love in the world that were not love solely given over to God’s will. Yitzchak Avinu was already refined in this attribute, for he was born from Avraham Avinu after he had refined himself with all such <i>birrur</i>s. So his attribute was only to refine fear, that is, to disencumber fear from any variety that is not the fear of God alone. With Yaakov Avinu, these two attributes were already well refined, and all of his dealings were in the attribute of <i>tiferet</i>—beauty (balance, splendor), termed the “middle bolt,” (See <i>Shemot</i>, 36:33) to arrange fear in its proper place and time, and so too with love. In the days of Avraham Avinu the depth of the preciousness of the Jewish people was not yet clearly recognized, and also in the days of Yitzchak, therefore they had to refine themselves from the attributes of the nations and to separate themselves from their power. This was not so with Yaakov Avinu, who had the twelve tribes of Yeshurun, who were all in their proper place, and not one deviated from God’s will. Here, all his efforts were to refine them among themselves, to clarify who would come first and who would come after. This too caused Yaakov Avinu suffering, for he asserted that Yosef was the chosen one. Yosef also thought this. These are the fine internal <i>birurim</i> that occurred within Israel, and will be explained further.",
                    "<i>“And Yehuda said to his brothers, what will we profit in killing our brother?”</i> (Bereshit, 37:26)<br>It is written in the Gemara (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, 6b), “whoever blesses [congratulates] Yehuda is called a compromiser.” (“sells out.”) Concerning this, it is said in the Gemara (<i>Nedarim</i>, 32b), “at the time of the evil inclination, no one remembers the inclination to good.” When God wants to test man, He causes him to forget the very basis of the prohibition in which he is being tested. So it was with the tribes when they wanted to kill Yosef; then the basis of the prohibition against killing was hidden from them, and he was only saved from counsel outside the realm of Torah. This also saved his brothers from sin. Yehuda was a great sage in the wisdom of this world, therefore he devised advice and said, “what profit [<i>ma beitsa</i>].” This means, even though that it seemed to him that it was lawfully permitted to kill him, as will be explained, still, what benefit will we receive by killing him?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And this was the “counsel outside of the realm of the Torah.”</i>, <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Would I suppose that my father would give me the coat? The coat of many colors was only meant for Yosef. <i>Tashlum</i>.</i> And from not killing him our father will love us so much more. And immediately when they decided among themselves not to kill him, they saw the basis of the prohibition, that from the side of the law it was also forbidden. One is forbidden to defend himself by means of this advice based on the wisdom of this world anytime he wants to, he may only do this at a time that he is being tested and there is no other advice to be used. However, he is not to separate from the prohibition at a time when he remembers that it is forbidden, for it is forbidden for him to separate himself based on this kind of counsel unless it a direct commandment from the blessed One. This is the explanation of the Gemara, “all who congratulate Yehuda,” meaning for one who thinks that it always proper to do as Yehuda did, is called a compromiser (or one who compromises with the Torah), for even Yehuda used such advice only at a time of testing.",
                    "<i>“Let us go and sell him to the Ishmaelites ….”</i> (Bereshit, 37:27)<br>The tribes had first sentenced him to death, since he had spoken of their evils to their father. In their view this sin was in the very root of his life, God forbid, for creating a separation between them and their father was in their eyes akin to separating the Holy One, blessed be He, from the community of Israel, the Shekhina. At that time Yaakov was the “<i>Tsaddik Yesod Olam</i>,” the righteous one who is the foundation of the world, on whom the entire world rests, and he was the place where God revealed himself in this world, and they were at that time all of Israel. They were all included in the word “One” in <i>Shema Yisroel, Echad</i> (<i>alef</i>, 1; <i>het</i>, 8; <i>dalet</i>, 4). One was Yaakov; eight were the eight children of Leah and Rachel; and four were the four children of the handmaids. They understood that Yosef wanted to separate this unification. Only Yehuda in his wisdom said that the judgment was not arbitrated in this way. Maybe he is good and we are mistaken about him. In that case we should not do anything about him, and only let God make it clear concerning him, and if he is good in his root then certainly God will rescue him from all sin and he will not be lost in exile. So therefore God refined him, purifying his soul through the incident with the wife of Potiphar. For the <i>brit</i> of the foreskin corresponds to the <i>brit</i> of the tongue (<i>Sefer Yetsira</i>, 1:43), and when he emerged refined from this, then he was also refined and clean concerning the <i>loshan horah</i> (evil speech) of which his brothers had suspected him.",
                    "<i>“… and Yehuda went down from his brothers ….”</i> (Bereshit, 38:1)<br>Why did Yehuda go and wed a wife at this particular time? When he saw how Yaakov refused to be consoled, and as he was the one who had to bring Yosef’s coat to his father, he became depressed, and felt as if, God forbid, there was no more hope. So he went to marry a wife, saying, “perhaps I will have good children from whom will grow an everlasting structure.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is why his son’s name was Er, which means awake, as if to say that it would awaken the spirit to descend on us from God. <i>Tashlum</i>.</i> Then afterwards, the Holy One, blessed be He, caused him to understand the following. If, God forbid, it is as you think, and there is no hope for you, and you have no life at your root, if so, then even if you give birth to a hundred, they will not have any more life than you. For with God, the channel through which He sends life must itself be of life. Then, if it is as you think, that you will only have temporary life, then it will be so also with your descendants. Therefore, when the matter became clear to him, he fathered Shela, his name Shela meaning misled, the mistake he made in this matter. This is why his first two sons died, and Shela remained alive.",
                    "<i>“And Er the firstborn of Yehuda was evil in the sight of God ….”</i> (Bereshit, 38:7)<br>Rashi explains, “he was afraid that she would become pregnant and lose her beauty.” The sin of Er emerged in a way similar to what is explained. “Yaakov asked to dwell in peace [but the troubles of Yosef came upon him. The righteous want to dwell in peace. The Holy One, blessed be He said, it is not enough for the righteous that which is prepared for them in the world to come, but they seek also to dwell in peace in this world].” “To dwell in peace” means to guard oneself from all actions that could lead him into uncertainty. But this is not God’s will in this world. Therefore God showed Yaakov, saying, “look who will come from your progeny [Er], and he also intentionally avoided action in order not to suffer a loss. The only difference is he was involved in physical matters. See and understand the value of this.” Yaakov Avinu also had this deficiency, but his deficiency concerned the service of God where he guarded himself so as not to mar the beauty of his service. When this intention branches out into the body it becomes an explicit sin.<br>So it was with all the thoughts of the Patriarchs, which to them were quite small, and then afterwards, when the Holy One, blessed be He, clarifies them, and creates a unique soul from this thought, then whatever will be clarified is clarified. The sin of Er and Onan follows according to what is explained in the Mishna (<i>Avot</i>, 2:1), “Rabbi said, what is the proper course for a man to follow? All that brings honor to he who does it, and honor to his fellow man.” “Honor to he who does it” actually means that the action will find favor in the eyes of his fellow man. “Honor to his fellow man” means that it will be good at its depth, from the depths of his life, at the very form (essence) of man.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For <i>Adam</i>, “man,” is a higher level than <i>Ish</i>, “mortal”. <i>Tashlum</i>.</i> A man must look into all his actions to make sure they are refined according to these two requirements. If a man happens into an action that does not effect these two <i>birurum</i> (<i>birrur</i>s), on this we have the disagreement between the house of Shammai and the house of Hillel in the tractate <i>Ketubot</i> (16b). “Our Rabbis taught, how should one dance in front of a new bride? The house of Shammai says, the bride just as she is [one should not exaggerate in her presence and say she is beautiful if she is not].”<br>Their assertion is that the main principle is “bringing honor to the one who does it,” for if they were to say, “a beautiful and comely bride,” it would not bring honor in the view of men because we are told to “stay far from lies.” “The house of Hillel says, a beautiful and comely bride,” meaning that even if it does not bring honor to the one who does it, still it is not necessary to look at this, since it brings honor from his fellow man. This means that man’s intellect will necessitate this.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As it is written (Mishlei, 3), “to find grace and good understanding” first, “in the eyes of God,” and only after “and man.” <i>Tashlum</i>.</i> This is as it explained, “The house of Hillel said to the house of Shammai, according to you if one has made a bad purchase in the market, should one praise it in his eyes or criticize it? Surely, one should praise it in his eyes.” It was that Er primarily regarded “bringing honor from his fellow man,” for it is well known that every birth will only come about through concealment and forgetting, just as the seed that is sown will not sprout unless it is destroyed and deteriorates in the soil. So too the drop of life, which descends from the brain, will not bring about birth until it becomes coarse and conglomerates in the seed of man. For at the moment of conception the consciousness of man (before God) is interrupted and forgotten, and if a man’s consciousness could stand constantly before his Creator then he would not be able to experience this concealment and forgetting necessary for conception.<br>Therefore Er, since he only looked towards “bringing honor from his fellow man,” meaning that he always had a clear and brilliant intellect, and stood in the presence of God, therefore he did not want to detract from this. This is the meaning of “he did not want to detract from [or mar] her beauty,” meaning that he did not want to mar the splendor of Israel. Onan took the other way, for his actions were based on how he saw his father’s intentions, that his seed would only be called in the name of his brother. Therefore it was evil in his view that he would not be able to fix himself, but only the soul of his brother. This caused him to voice his grudges, as also happens with the great <i>Tsaddikim</i>. And the action of Onan is called “bringing honor to the one who does the action,” so therefore their souls were rectified when Peretz and Zerach were born.<br>Peretz was the soul of Er, because Peretz is a term denoting <i>tekufut</i> (vigorous strength),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A kind of “holy <i>Chutspah</i>.”</i> meaning “bringing honor from his fellow man.” This means that even when the honor turns against his fellow man (into something else), he shall not look at this. Zerach was the soul of Onan, for his very name proves that his attribute is “bringing honor in contrast to his fellow man.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zerach means to shine, meaning shining from within, or bringing honor to the one who does it.</i> Concerning these two, Peretz and Zerach, God said, “she is more righteous than I [also, from me],” (what Yehuda said of Tamar, their mother, and as the Gemara explains) “from Me came forth hidden things.” This means that even though Er and Onan were not worthy in God’s eyes, still their souls in Peretz and Zerach would be fixed. Even though it would seem that the descendants of Peretz would act against God’s law, as we find with the kingdom of the House of David, God would testify that it was always because of “a time to do for God.”<br>Even though in terms of the action it seems that Er’s sin was greater than that of Onan, nonetheless his soul was greater at the depth than the soul of Onan, for the kingdom of the House of David was born from him. For the Holy One, blessed be He, conducts all the structures of the kingdom of the House of David, according to structures such as these, even though at the time of the action it seemed like a sin. In this way Yehuda thought that Tamar was a harlot because she was covering her face, which really means that the matter was concealed; a secret from God. This is as it is explained (<i>Sotah</i>, 10b, “she is more righteous than I” [<i>Mimeni</i> means both “than I” and “from me]), “from Me came forth hidden things.” The secret of the kingdom of the House of David is greatly concealed, even from the prophets."

                "Miketz": [
                    "<i>“And it was, at the end of two years ….”</i> (Bereshit, 41:1)<br>It is written in the holy Zohar (<i>Bereshit</i>, 193b), “Rabbi Elazar opened and said, ‘God lives and blessed is my Rock, God shall elevate my salvation’” (<i>Tehilim</i>, 18:47). “God lives,” meaning one who has a pure heart, cleaned from all the desires of the world, and cleaving only to eternal life. “And blessed is my Rock” means one who recognizes that all good things come only from God, and therefore has a good eye. Then (it follows that), “God shall elevate my salvation,” meaning that he will apprehend salvations beyond the power of his intellect to grasp. Before man has been clarified in the areas mentioned it is not yet possible to give him salvations, for he is not yet a vessel illuminated for reception. And with this in mind it says, “and it was, at the end of two years,” meaning after these two areas had been clarified, then Pharaoh dreamed his dream, and he (Yosef) immediately apprehended salvation—“until the time that His word came, the utterance of God refined him” (<i>Tehilim</i>, 105:19). For on that very night the cry of Yosef haTsaddik, “how long before You return, God?” (Psalms, 90:30) reached such great proportions, that he achieved salvation immediately. On this it is said (<i>Tehilim</i>, 88:2), “Hashem, God of my salvation … I cried out before You at night.” These are the ways of the Holy One, blessed be He, where before He gives salvation He causes man’s heart to cry out so strongly that it will be called “the work of your hands.”",
                    "<i>“And it was, at the end of two years of days, and Pharaoh dreamed ….”</i> (Bereshit, 41:1)<br>“Years—of days” hints that in two days all the good of the world were created. That is, in the third day God created all the good we receive from eating, and on the sixth day God created the form of man, meaning the root of life and the honor of elevation, for man is elevated above all. Salvation comes when man is refined in these two aspects. This is the meaning of “and it was, at the end of two years of days,” meaning when there is a complete end of the evil in these two days, then salvation will comes at once. This is the meaning of the Midrash at the beginning of the <i>Parsha</i> [which reads: “He sets an end to the darkness” (Job, 28:3]. He gave a time to the world—how many years would be made in darkness. And what is the meaning of “He sets an end to darkness”? For all the while the evil inclination is in the world there is darkness and the shadow of death in the world, as it is written, “stones of darkness and the shadow of death” (Job, 28:3), meaning the evil inclination will be uprooted from the world; there will be no darkness and shadow of death in the world. Another meaning of “He sets an end to darkness” is, He allotted Yosef the twelve years he would be in darkness in the prison, and when the end came, then Pharaoh dreamed his dream. That is, when an end comes to the darkness, which is the end of the evil existing in these two aspects, then salvation comes immediately.",
                    "<i>“And it was, at the end of two years ….”</i> (Bereshit, 41:1)<br>At first Yosef was in prison for ten years, and afterwards another two years were added to his time. The first ten were decreed upon him since he had sinned against ten tribes; and then afterwards, when he had been refined from this in prison, another two years were added according to himself and Binyamin. Thus it is when a man sins against God, then God brings upon him a process of refinement from which he suffers. Then afterwards, when he is clarified for the good and makes atonement, then he must suffer from asking himself why he needed to enter himself into a state where he needed such a difficult refinement in the first place. He must necessarily suffer from this, for when a man suffers then God also suffers, so to speak, for “in all their suffering He suffers” (Yesahya, 63:9). Therefore after one refines himself corresponding to his sin, in addition to this refinement he must refine himself also concerning his suffering, for this also smacks of sin, as is explained in the Gemara (<i>Ta’anit</i>, 11a), “he sinned in that he disturbed himself.” So it was that at first, ten years of captivity were decreed upon Yosef corresponding to his ten brothers. Then after he was refined in prison like silver smelted in a crucible, he had to be refined for his own suffering and the suffering of his brother Binyamin. After this was clarified in the two additional years, then he was immediately redeemed.",
                    "<i>“… and behold, he stood on the Nile.”</i> (Bereshit, 41:1)<br>It is written in the Midrash (<i>Bereshit</i> Rabba, 89:3), “Who exists because of whom? Do I exist because of my god, or does my god exist because of me? He said to him, ‘you exist because of your god, as it is said, he stood on the Nile’ [his god].”After he saw his dream, Pharaoh wanted to know that all he desired would succeed. He wanted to know exactly how this would come about. Either his god was completely with him, and his thoughts were only what his god would send him, then therefore he would succeed; or, it first came to his own thought and will to do something, and then his power and god would help him to succeed. So He said to him, “you exist by means of your god,” meaning that first the idea would come to you, and then the power that rules over you would be forced to help you. Yet with Israel it is not so, for Israel is a <i>merkava</i> (chariot) for the Shechina. They will conduct themselves according to His blessed will, and only in the future when they arrive at the final form of completion, will it be said (Job, 22:28), “you shall decree it, and it will be established for you.”<br>Like Avraham Avinu, after the tenth trial, and like Yitzchak and Yaakov when they achieved completion, it was said of them (Yesahya, 58:14), “then you shall take delight in God.” This is hinted at in the Gemara (<i>Shabbat</i>, 69b), “one who is travelling and does not know which day is Shabbat, Rav Huna says to count six days and then keep one day [of Shabbat], Chaya bar Rav says keep Shabbat and then count six.” For the six days of action are the efforts of man, and Shabbat is the assistance of God. Rav Huna is speaking of a man completed in all ways, whose heart is drawn after God’s will. Such a man is permitted to exert his own efforts, and then after he can ask God to complete the matter for him. Yet as long as a man is not complete, he must accept the yoke of the sovereignty of Heaven before each action, and if God agrees with him he may act.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The matter in this is that Pharoah asked to investigate if he had to boundary himself within Divine service, or if he was allowed to extend himself into anything his heart desired. However, unknown to him, he had to act according to God’s will since he was a creation of God. Then God showed him that truly He does not desire his service, for there is no completeness in the service of idolaters, nor is there any completeness in their fear, as it is written (Yesahya 44:16), “he burns half of it in fire, the other half he eats.” Even the most precious intentions with which they serve can afterwards be directed into physical desires, as explained on the matter of the <i>migdal</i>, the tower (<i>Menachot</i>, 110a), “they call Him God of god.” (Though the name of God is renowned through the nations, they do not fear Him. Rabeynu Gershon.) Yet God desires the service of Israel because they are serving only God alone. This is called complete, for it is not effected from anything (only God), as it says in the Midrash (Tanchuma <i>Shmini</i> 8), “what does God care whether the animal is ritually slaughtered and eaten, or stabbed and eaten.” For with the service of Israel, corresponding to how much they suspend their (vain) desires does He want to effuse energy to them. This is as He showed him (in the above Gemara) that at the present moment He does not want their service, and at a time that will become clear, then “the rider [as well as the horse] will fall.” For even the heavenly angels of the nations are not complete, and therefore “the horse and the rider fell into the sea” (song at the splitting of the Red Sea). With Israel, God will entreat them because of their service. Giliyon Mei HaShiloach of Gershon Cheinoch of Radzin ZY”A, grandson of the Isbitser.</i>",
                    "<i>“Then Pharoah sent and called for Yosef … and brought him quickly out of the dungeon.”</i> (Bereshit, 41:14)<br>“Brought him quickly out” is unusually expressed with the word <i>Reetsuhu</i>, meaning that he was pleased (<i>nitratza</i>) with everything he had gone through, because God sent joy to his heart so he would not bear any anger against Him.",
                    "<i>“… you can understand a dream to interpret it.”</i> (Bereshit, 41:15)<br>All of the affairs of this world are like a dream that needs interpretation, and as one interprets it so will it be with him. And for one who understands in everything that all comes only from God, and only from what comes out of His mouth does man live, he understands the meaning in everything and arrives at true life. As with bread, where the principal sustaining force exists within it, so it is the issue of God’s mouth. He who eats simply like an animal will understand from the bread only the life of this world, and one who understands that what comes out of God’s mouth is what gives him life will apprehend everlasting life. For bread, <i>lechem</i>, is composed of the same letters as dream, <i>chalom</i>, meaning that it needs to be interpreted. So it is with all that we derive benefit from, as everything that gives us satisfaction and all the good things of the world are compared to bread.",
                    "<i>“And Pharoah called Yosef the name</i> Tsafnat Pa’neach <i>[solver of hidden things].”</i> (Bereshit, 41:45)<br>Rashi comments that the word <i>Pa’neach</i> appears nowhere else in the Scriptures, and it seems as if Pharoah wanted to say, “<i>poteach</i> - opener,” yet he could not bring these letters out of his mouth, namely the letters <i>vav</i> and <i>tav.</i> This is because the letter <i>vav</i> hints at life, and the letter <i>tav</i> is the seal of truth of the Holy One, blessed be He. (“Truth,” <i>emet</i>, ends with a <i>tav</i>.) The nations of the world have no understanding of these letters, for they have no true life, only as far as the eye sees (on the surface). Therefore he replaced them with the letters <i>ayin</i> and <i>nun</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pharoah did not speak the holy tongue, Hebrew, anyhow, and had no understanding of these letters. Therefore the word “open,” <i>poteach</i>, does not appear in the Torah (with a <i>Vav</i>, at least in the five books of Moses). The principal (spiritual) root of the word <i>poteach</i> is <i>Vav</i> and <i>Tav</i>, which opens the concealed. He could not say the <i>dalet</i> in the letter <i>Tav</i>, for the visual shape of a <i>Tav</i> is a <i>Dalet</i> joined to a <i>Nun</i>, with the <i>Nun</i> representing property and apprehension, and the <i>Dalet</i> representing that we can effect nothing (without God, <i>d’leit leih meagarmeh clum</i> – effecting nothing in Aramaic). This is not in the ability of idolaters to understand, for according to them they have power, and thus <i>Ayin</i> (one of Pharoah’s substitute letters) hints at the dealings of this world, the opposite of the <i>Vav.

                    "<i>“And may El Shaddai [the Almighty God] give you mercy ….”</i> (Bereshit, 43:14)<br>Rashi explains that <i>Shaddai</i> means He who said to His world “<i>Dai</i>!” “Enough!” The Holy Rav of Pshiska<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Reb Simcha Bunem ZY”A, a Hasidic master and the author’s Rebbe.</i> said of the name Shaddai, that when the world was created it would expand and continue, as in the saying in the Gemara (<i>Chagigah</i>, 12b), “until He said to His world, <i>Dai</i>!” This is because the main reason for creating the world was to show the world the greatness of God, and therefore he said, “Enough,” when this could be certified. This is why Yaakov mentioned this particular name here, to show that God brings suffering upon man to refine him enough to recognize his Creator. Therefore he used this name, as if God would say, “Enough!” In all that I have gone through I have recognized everything. And truly, our Patriarchs did not say anything from their own initiative; they prayed in the direction of what God effused to them, and all their prayers were in the proper time and place, for here God agreed to say “enough” to all their troubles. This is just as Avraham Avinu asked for mercy from God after the tenth trial so as not to test him further, for at that time God agreed to no longer test him.",
                    "<i>“… What can be said to my master, what can be spoken … God has found out the sin of your servants ….”</i> (Bereshit, 44:16)<br>In the Midrash (<i>Bereshit</i> Rabba, 92:9) it says, “We know that we did not steal.” Now we know for certain that we are not at all flawed. However, since God brought such a situation upon us, surely there exists something similar within us to suit us to the situation. It is because we misled our father (literally “stole his mind”) with the sale of Yosef that we are falsely accused of theft."

                "Vayigash": [
                    "<i>“And Yehuda drew close to him.”</i> (Bereshit, 44:18)<br>This is as the writings say (Shmuel 2, 23:3, the last words of King David), “God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me [thus], the ruler of man is righteous, ruling in the fear of God.” Our sages have explained this in this way (<i>Moed Katan</i>, 16b), “A <i>Tsaddik</i> rules in the fear of God.” “God of Israel said” means the principles of the Torah, and they are the <i>Rama’ch</i>, 248 positive mitzvot, and the <i>Shas’ah</i>, 365 prohibitive mitzvot, that were given to all of Israel in complete equality. “The Rock of Israel spoke to me”—“to me” refers to the <i>ba’al teshuva</i>, the master of return to the law, to whom God speaks specifically, and gives him vigorous strength after he sinned in thinking that there was no hope from Him.<br>Then he returns to God, and he is given <i>tekifut</i> (holy strength). For this reason does the verse formulate itself the way it does, for first it says “said,” a formulation denoting softness, and with the <i>ba’al teshuva</i> it says “spoke,” denoting strength. Also, first the verse says <i>E-lohei</i>, and later <i>Rock</i>, which is also a term of still greater strength. “The ruler of man is righteous” means if the sin was a result of the decree of the sages (namely desecration of the <i>brit</i>, and the “righteous” refers to Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai). On this it says “the ruler of man is righteous,” meaning that the <i>ba’al teshuva</i> rules over them (these sins), for nothing stands in the way of return. “Rules in the fear of God” means if the sin was against the written Torah. On this it says “rules in the fear of God,” meaning that he will also rule over this, and on all of this it is said (<i>Avoda Zara</i>, 5a), “said the man who was raised up (Shmuel 2, 23:1), means who raised an offering of <i>teshuva</i> [return].”<br>For even if words of Torah were delivered with great fear, and several known punishments threatened by our sages, still, only before the sin occurred was it said that you have nothing that stands against <i>teshuva</i>. Yet after one has failed he is not to give up, for in the time to come no sin shall remain in any soul of Israel. The principle of this <i>tekifut</i> that we are discussing is in the tribe of Yehuda, so therefore it said, “Yehuda drew close to him.” Even though it seemed now that he had nothing new to say, yet still we can sense the vigor in his words where he has no doubt that salvation will now emerge.<br>This is the meaning of the verse (Mishlei, 24:21), “Fear God, my son, and rule.” “My son [<i>B’ni</i>]” meaning wisdom (<i>Bina</i>), and this is to say that your fear should be refined and true. “And rule” means that you shall be a king who is vigorous in his great trust in God. (And the verse continues), “and do not mix with the hateful,” meaning as the Gemara says (<i>Sotah</i>, 22a), “those who teach the law out of their hatefulness,” and it is asked of this, “is it so simple? It is taught as one who understands it like Rav Huna, who said (that “the hateful” means) one who transgressed, and then taught that it was permitted to him,” meaning that there exists a place even for this, as is explained [in the <i>Mei HaShiloach</i> on the verse, “you shall have a shovel” (<i>Parshat Ki Teitsei</i>]. And this was <i>tekufut</i> of Yehuda after what had happened to him, saying, “I will be a surety for him [Binyamin],” (<i>Bereshit</i>, 43:9) transgressing what is said (<i>Yevamot</i>, 109b), “be wary against vouching [leaving a pledge],” for nevertheless he was confident that salvation would emerge from this.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And this is, “the Rock of Israel spoke to me,” for <i>dibbur</i>, speaking, meaning that God will lower unto him his explicit word, as it were. This matter has special relevance for the tribe of Yehuda, for this tribe, since its power is awesome, will do things that seem to be like people who are not in a state of <i>devekut</i> (intense cleaving) to God. For example, King David, for whom the principle of his birth was from Ruth, and they did not understand the difference between a male Ammonite and a female Ammonite. <i>Giliyon Mei HaShiloach</i>, R. Gershon Henoch Lainer of Radzin, ZY”A.</i>",
                    "<i>“And Yehuda drew close to him.”</i> (Bereshit, 44:18)<br>The power that God instilled in the tribe of Yehuda is that he will never give up, even if he fears certain things will overcome him. We find in the previous <i>Parsha</i> that he said, “we are my lord’s servants,” (<i>Bereshit</i> 45:16) and it seems as if he began to give up hope, thinking to himself that it was a mistake to risk loosing his share in two worlds over Binyamin. In this <i>Parsha</i> he strengthens himself greatly before God by saying, even though I have done improperly, still, it is in the ability of God to save me. This is, “and Yehuda drew close to him,” “to him” meaning to the innermost depths of Yosef’s heart, to such an extent that he would be forced to reveal himself to them. For all these verses (at the beginning of the <i>Parsha</i>) are a claim against God, with Yehuda supposing all the while that he was standing before and arguing with a Gentile king. Then when God sent them the salvation, then they saw that even in retrospect they were never in danger, for truly they were arguing with their brother.<br>Thus it will be in the future, when God will save us and redeem us, then God will show us that we were never in exile, and that a foreign nation never ruled over us, only God alone. This is the meaning of the verse (<i>Tehilim</i>, 37:10), “and a little more, and there is no evil one, and you considered his place, and there is nothing there,” meaning that very soon evil will be banished. “And you considered,” meaning the understanding of the heart, for if you want to understand its place, “there is nothing there,” meaning that in it there was no power of governance over you.",
                    "<i>“My master asked his servants, do you have a father or a brother … and you said to your servants, bring him down ….”</i> (Bereshit, 44:19–21)<br>Even though there is no retort in this to Yosef’s claim of theft, still truly, these are Yehuda’s claims. For truly, one is not punished for the deficiency within him in any matter until it is brought out into action. And here, if there was any deficiency concerning theft within Binyamin, God forbid, it would never have come into the realm of action in this way if he had remained at home, only the “accuser of the journey” caused it to happen. If so, this action that he is being punished for is not his fault, for the power of his own will would never have had him make the journey to Egypt. And here Yehuda claims this against God (“and You said to Your servants, bring him down”), for he believed that even what Yosef said to them, to bring Binyamin, was nothing other than God’s will.",
                    "<i>“And Israel said, it is enough, Yosef still lives! I will go and see him before I die.”</i> (Bereshit, 45:28)<br>It is written in the Gemara (<i>Berachot</i>, 5a), “Rabi Levi bar Hama said in the name of Rabi Shimon ben Lakish, a man should always have his <i>yetser tov</i> [inclination to good] rage [fight against] his <i>yetser hara</i> [inclination to evil], as it is said, ‘rage and do not sin’ (<i>Tehilim</i>, 4:5). If he is victorious, good. If not, he should study Torah, as the verse continues, ‘say to your hearts.’ If he is victorious, good. If not, he should recite the <i>Shema</i>, as it continues, ‘on your beds.’ If he is victorious, good. If not, he should be reminded of the day of his death, as it continues, ‘and be silent, <i>selah</i>.’” Rabi Levi bar Hama said specifically, “a man should always rage,” for “always” means all matters that overwhelm a person. If <i>galdlut</i>, important matters and difficult life decisions, need <i>birrur</i> (clarification), then joy all the more so in order to gauge whether or not the joy is encumbered with dross from a negative influences. Therefore the Gemara offers four levels of advice as to how to do the <i>birrur</i> and arrive at the true depth of the matter. Afterwards, when he knows for certain that that the matter was truly from God, he may extend himself and rejoice, all the while knowing that it is either a mitzvah or the joy of doing a mitzvah. So when any this-worldly matter befalls man that needs <i>birrur</i>, we have these four levels of advice.<br>The first <i>birrur</i> is, “one should always have his <i>yetser tov</i> rage over his <i>yetser hara</i>.” This means that he needs to curb his lust by knowing that he will not have these desires forever, contemplating his mere “seventy years” and asking himself, “What good is my joy if it does not last forever?” “If he is victorious, good, and if not, he should learn Torah.” For when he makes a deep reckoning about the ephemeral nature of this desire, knowing full well that he yearns for desire that lasts forever, but still lusts, he needs then to undergo another <i>birrur</i>. This is to be engaged in the Torah which reinforces his goal and teaches man how to guard himself. However, “at the time of the <i>yetser hara</i>, no one remembers the <i>yetser tov</i>,” (<i>Nedarim</i>, 32b), so in response to this the Holy One, blessed be He, created the <i>Torah Tavleen</i>, the antidote of the Torah to guard a person from sin.<br>For truly, a man immersed in desire and unable to extricate himself from it has no advice to remind him that he is doing something forbidden, for the halakha on its own does not have the power to separate man from evil when he is overcome by his <i>yetzer</i>. Then the Torah reminds him that he can find the same desire or satisfaction in words of Torah, the only difference that the desire for Torah is rooted in <i>kedusha</i> (sanctity). This is explained below on the verse, “the sea saw and fled,” from the book of Tehilim, where it says that he saw how God can transform a rock into a pool of water and dry flint into a flowing spring.<br>One would think that it would be formulated in the opposite way, for at a time  God’s might was readily apparent, that He could destroy and dry up the ocean. However, water hints at desire, and at a time when desire overpowers the only advice against it is to show how the same desire and enegy he can use for lust also exists also in a state of <i>kedusha</i>, quelling the desire.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is as it is written (<i>Devarim</i>, 8), “He brings you water from the driest flint,” meaning that all the delights that are found in words of Torah are adorned with all kinds of beauty. When a man remembers this, then the sea will be calmed from its fury. It is just as if a man runs in a panic to fill his hunger, and his friend reproves him on the speed of his panic, and wants to stop him from running so fast, he will certainly not be heard, for he is terrified from his hunger. But if his friend says to him, “why do you need to run? Just go home and you will find all you ask for in greater amounts,” he will certainly be heard. <i>Tashlum Mei HaShiloach</i>.</i> This is the advice to study Torah. “If he is victorious, it is well. If not, he should recite the <i>Shema</i>.” For exalted states are found in words of Torah, and by means of words of Torah one may dare to become arrogant, and then he will not be able to come to true refinement. For this, the advice is to recite the <i>Shema</i>. The matter of reciting the <i>Shema</i> is explained in the Gemara (<i>Ta’anit</i>, 31a). “In the future the Holy One, blessed be He, will make a circle dance of the <i>Tsaddikim</i> [righteous].”<br>This means that all will see that all is in the hands of God, and no one has any superiority over his peers. Specifically a “circle dance,” because the nature of a circle is that it has no end, and this hints at the matter of reading the <i>Shema</i>. “If he is victorious, it is well. If not, he should be reminded of the day of his death.” This means that he should visualize before him as if right now is the day of his death. This is the difference between the first advice, “he shall rage,” explained in a similar way, yet remind him of the day of his death, i.e., visualize as if now is the time of his death; and if so, the lusts and the unwarranted rejoicing have no place. And if after all this the lusts and rejoicing still remain in his heart, then it is proof that it comes from God and endures forever.<br>So it was with Yaakov Avinu at the time when he heard the news that Yosef is still alive, as it is said, “and Yaakov’s spirit was revived.” At this moment he feared that perhaps his rejoicing was only the rejoicing of this world, therefore he tested and refined himself with these <i>birrurim</i>. The first <i>birrur</i> was when he said, “I will go and see him before I die,” and this corresponds to “a man should always rage,” as was explained. The second was, “and he offered sacrifices to God of his father Yitzchak,” which corresponds to “engage in Torah,” as we bless each day “who has sanctified us with His mitzvot and commanded us to engage in words of Torah.” For when the Holy One, blessed be He, gave the Torah He was called, “<i>Gevurah</i>,” power, for there it is said that Moshe heard from the mouth of <i>Gevurah</i> (<i>Megillah</i>, 31b). And there God said to Yaakov, “and I [<i>Anochi</i>] will surely bring you up again,” which corresponds to the fist saying in the Decalogue, “I [<i>Anochi</i>] am Hashem your God, who brought you out.”<br>Only here it is phrased in the past, and in our <i>Parsha</i> it is phrased in the future. Furthermore, what is said, “and he sent Yehuda before him” (<i>Bereshit</i>, 46:28), is explained by our sages (Midrash Tanchuma, <i>Vayigash</i> 11) that it was “to establish a house of study for him,” which is also related to this matter.<br>Afterwards he clarified the third <i>birrur</i> with “and he wept on his shoulder,” and our sages interpreted this to mean that he recited the <i>Shema</i>. Then after, he said to Yosef, “now let me die,” which corresponds to the fourth advice, to remind him of the day of his death. When Yaakov saw that after all of this his joy was still with him, then he understood that it was from God, and that his rejoicing was true and would last forever.",
                    "<i>“… and he offered sacrifices to God of his father Yitzchak.”</i> (Bereshit, 46:1)<br>Why was God called here “God of his father Yitzchak”? Because Yaakov prayed in the direction of the words that were said to Yitzchak (from God) (<i>Bereshit</i>, 26:3), “live in this land [and do not leave the boundaries of Israel], and I will be with you.” So Yaakov then feared that perhaps it was also forbidden for him to leave. Therefore he prayed to God until He illuminated his eyes to show him that for him it was permitted to leave.",
                    "<i>“And he sent Yehuda before him.”</i> (Bereshit, 46:28)<br>It is written in the Midrash (Tanchuma, <i>Vayigash</i>, 6), “[God said,] be careful of the <i>mitzvot</i>, for they are my messenger, and one’s messenger is like he who sends him.” Yosef was on the level of fulfillment of the <i>mitzvot</i>, and Yehuda was on the level of the blessings of the <i>mitzvot</i>. With all <i>mitzvot</i>, we bless God before we do them, and this is why “he sent Yehuda before him.”",
                    "<i>“And Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen.”</i> (Bereshit, 47:27)<br>Yaakov Avinu was afraid to leave Israel, as it is said (<i>Ketubot</i>, 110b), “all who live inside of Israel, he is as one who has God, and all who live outside of Israel, he is as one who does not have God.” Therefore, God said to him, “everywhere you are is sanctified with the <i>Kedusha</i> of the land of Israel.” This is the meaning of “and Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen,” for even in the land of Egypt you will be close to God, and it will be a holy place, for “Goshen” is a term signifying closeness.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“<i>Gash</i>” means “came close,” as in the very name of this <i>Parsha</i>, “<i>Vayigash</i>,” meaning “and he came close.”</i>"

This is the meaning of “if there is no understanding then there is no knowledge,” for if a man does not know the general principle that is the reason for the matter, then he cannot understand the detail, for from one detail is known the next detail. The converse is also true, for if there is no knowledge then there is no understanding. For if one can say that he knows a principle, but does not need to know its resulting details, on this it says, “if there is no knowledge.” Meaning, if the details are not organized for you, then you will not be able to truly know the root of the principle, so how will you be able to branch out from there? This is the meaning of “and he lived,” meaning the root of life, which is the principle of everything; and “Yaakov” means knowledge [<i>Da’at</i>] which is the detail, for <i>Yaakov</i> represents <i>Zeir Anpin</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Zeir Anpin</i> represents the “miniature presence,” and is one of the Divine personae in the kabbalah.</i> In other words, (<i>Yaakov</i> is) how God watches, or rather, is intimately involved, in every detail necessary for every matter, even the smallest of the small.",
                    "<i>“… guiding his hands intentionally [Yaakov moving his right hand over his left to place it on Efriam for the blessing] ….”</i> (Bereshit, 48:14)<br>Since the attribute of Yitzchak Avinu was that of <i>Gevurah</i> (strength), he wanted to bless Eisav, because the attribute of <i>Gevurah</i> teaches of the Torah, as it is written (<i>Megillah</i> 31b), “[at Sinai] Moshe heard from the mouth of <i>Gevurah</i>.” Therefore it says, “let the judgment [<i>Din, Gevurah</i>] cut through the mountain [meaning to follow the judgment under all circumstances].” This is why it was not in Yitzchak’s power to go against the judgment, and he wanted to give the blessing to Eisav since he was the elder son. Yet since God supports the pure of hand, for the hands are branches of the heart, and his heart was pure and refined, then the result was that Yaakov would bless without (or independent of) his own knowledge. Therefore it is written (<i>Tehilim</i>, 16:5), “You support my fate,” yet Yaakov Avinu always looked towards the understanding and God’s will. Therefore he said, “I knew, my son, I knew,” “guiding his hands intentionally,” placing Efriam before Menashe.",
                    "<i>“… God before whom my fathers walked … who guided me all my life ….”</i> (Bereshit, 48:15)<br>Yaakov Avinu made himself small before his fathers, Avraham and Yitzchak. He said that their wisdom and understanding was so great that they could by themselves cause an expansion of God’s will. Even if God created a small opening for them, in their wisdom they would expand and extend it in order to do the will of their Creator, and would understand even what God had not explicitly illuminated to them. This is the meaning of “before whom my fathers walked,” meaning that they went by means of their own power. But as for me, “E-lohim who guided me all my life until this day,” meaning that for every action I do, no matter how small, I need God to illuminate His will into me. I even need it with this action (blessing Menashe and Efriam), where I saw how it is His will to change it (to bless the younger before the older), nevertheless I need to see even the second time how it is His blessed will. Truly in this matter Yaakov was the greatest of the Patriarchs, for to have God constantly lead one’s actions is a great level. This was the prayer of King David (<i>Tehilim</i>, 23:1), “God is my shepherd, I will lack nothing,” meaning that for me the Providence of God will not be lacking, He will always guide me, and I will be ever aware that God is guiding me. In His goodness He conducts everything, it is only man who turns his face away, not wanting to behold and pray. Yet at a time when a man prays a complete prayer he is answered immediately, and he will see that God is the Shepherd. This is the meaning of “I shall not lack,” meaning that he will not turn his face from Him.",
                    "<i>“And Yaakov called to his sons ….”</i> (Bereshit, 49:1)<br>It is written on this in the Midrash (Tanchuma, <i>Vayechi</i>, 8), “I shall call to the supernal E-lohim, to God who does all for me” (<i>Tehilim</i>, 57:3). Now that Yaakov Avinu wanted to bless his sons, he was unsure as to whether he needed to bless them after the anguish they caused him with the sale of Yosef, and, “any <i>talmid chocham</i> [Torah scholar] who is not vengeful and grudge-bearing like a serpent is not a <i>talmid chocham</i>” (<i>Yoma</i>, 22b). Therefore it says, “and he called,” which is an expression of crying out and longing of the heart, for he gave over his eyes and heart to the heights (to God) and let himself say whatever God put in his mouth. This is why the Midrash mentions this verse, as he asked God to complete the action for him. The word “blessing” is not used first (it does not say “he called his sons to bless them”) as it was still not yet clear to him what he was going to say. However, with Moshe Rabeynu, he began immediately by saying “this is the blessing,” since it was immediately clear to him what he was going to say when he began to speak.<br>With Yaakov, it only says “he blessed them” after he finished speaking (in verse 28), for only after he finished speaking, and not before, was it clear to him that all his blessings were from God. At first, God placed words of rebuke in his mouth, to chide the first three tribes, for “a <i>talmid chocham</i> must be vengeful and grudge-bearing.” Then when he arrived at the tribe of Yehuda, God showed him from Heaven that he needed to be forgiving, for in the letters of “Yehuda” are the four letters of God’s blessed name, YHVH. These four letters in his name hint at the verse (Yesahya, 66:2), “I will look to this one, to the poor and contrite of spirit, and he will tremble at my word.” This means that there was nothing from Yehuda’s own initiative (he was an instrument of God), as it says (Zohar, <i>Bereshit</i>, 244b), “the <i>dalet</i> gathers up.” (Meaning that the <i>dalet</i> in Yehuda’s name [signifying <i>Malchut</i>, reception] would gather up whatever God’s name would give him.) Therefore there was no room to bear any anger against him, so when Yaakov began to bless Yehuda with the attribute of compassion, this attribute took over with the rest of the tribes and they were all included in his blessing.",
                    "<i>“… and in the blood of grapes his garment.”</i> (Bereshit, 49:11)<br>The word used for garment, “<i>sutah</i>” (on which Rashi notes is the only such usage in all of Scripture) is an expression meaning incitement (“<i>hasatah</i>”). The incitement, or accusation against the root of the soul of Yehuda, which came about after the sin and failure that he had encountered, caused strength to wake in his heart, saying, “this is only because God desires to save me with greater strength.” For “grapes” means mistakes and forgetting. Moshe Rabeynu had said (<i>Devarim</i>, 32:14), “and of the blood of the grape you drank foaming wine,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He used the Aramaic word for foaming wine—“<i>chamer</i>.”</i> which teaches of “no eye has seen a god besides You …” (Yesahya, 64:4). The ministering angels do not understand Aramaic.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Shabbat</i>, 12b, and he would not have understood the word Moshe used, <i>chamer</i>. This was purely for humankind, and <i>chama</i> is “seeing” in Aramaic.</i> Moshe represents the inner aspect, and Yaakov the outer aspects.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Moshe said “drinking” signifies taking internally, where Yaakov’s expression, “garment,” is external. For a full kabbalistic explanation, see the very beginning of the <i>Sha’ar Ma’amarei haRash”bi</i> of the Ari’zal.</i> With Yaakov it says “grapes,” meaning that God will clarify the two mistakes of the tribe of Yehuda, which are the inclination to forbidden sexual relations and the inclination to idolatry. God will make it clear that they are clean in both aspects. Moshe Rabeynu, who represents the inner aspects, saw that there was no fault in Yehuda concerning the inclination to idolatry, yet the inclination to promiscuity still needed to be disencumbered, as Rav said (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, 63b), “Israel only worshipped the golden calf in order to permit promiscuity in public.” Yet they were already clean concerning idolatry.",
                    "<i>“Binyamin is a wolf that tears, in the morning he will devour, at night he will divide his spoil.”</i> (Bereshit, 49:27)<br>Binyamin gathers all the good scattered among the nations and brings it into Israel.",
                    "<i>“Gad, a troop shall troop upon him, but he shall troop upon their heel.”</i> (Bereshit, 49:19)<br>The Holy One, blessed be He, gave the twelve tribes of Yah (God) light and life, and no one is like another. Therefore they are called “diagonal borders,” meaning that the light of this one is the opposite of this one, for this one draws its life force from the attribute of love, and this one from the attribute of fear, and the like. Concerning this we find that each side in every disagreement in the Gemara really goes to the same place in order to fulfill God’s will. We find an example of this in the Gemara (<i>Pesachim</i>, 53b), “whether they say to light [in one’s home on Yom Kippur] or whether they say not to light, they both intend the same thing.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Both opinions serve to distance one from sin. One opinion says that one is more unlikely to want to have relations with his wife if the room is illuminated, and another says that if he does not see her at all then he is less likely to succumb, so they both intend the same ends.</i> So it is with all differing opinions, for their source is really one. Therefore the word for tribe, <i>shevet</i>, comes from the word for branch, for they are all branches coming out of the same place (consider twelve lines in different directions all coming out of a single point).<br>We find that God singled out the tribe of Gad for suffering. The tribe of Gad said that without suffering and tribulation the Torah may not enter into the heart of man, and it is the way of the world that one who suffers obviously has little joy and does not enjoy so much company with his fellow man. Therefore Gad was blessed that they should have joy and company, blessing them to be connected and including many troops of friends. This is why the only tribe whose number includes both thousands, hundreds, and tens is Gad.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Bamidbar</i> 1:25, where the number of the tribe of Gad is 4,650.</i> “But he shall troop upon their heel,” meaning that at the time when it will be necessary to gather all of Israel together, then Gad will be the one to bind and connect them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Another meaning of “troop upon” is to bind or connect.</i> All kinds of joy will come forth from him to Israel, for Eliyahu comes from the tribe of Gad (<i>Bereshit</i> Rabba, 71:12).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“And he shall troop upon their heel” could be interpreted: He shall bring all of Israel together (<i>yagud</i>) in joy at the end (<i>Ekev</i>—“heel or end”) meaning with the coming of the Messiah.</i>",
                    "<i>“Naftali is a hind let loose, he gives words of beauty.”</i> (Bereshit, 49:21)<br>Meaning that within Naftali is a great understanding to ask concerning all the matters of this world, “who created these?” This is the meaning of “he gives words of beauty,” that since he recognizes the presence of God in everything, he would give thanks for it. This is why Onkeles translates, “he gives thanks and blesses over them.”",
                    "<i>“… he gathered up his feet into the bed ….”</i> (Bereshit, 49:33)<br>It is written in the Gemara (<i>Ta’anit</i>, 5b), “Yaakov Avinu did not die.” Death is man’s transformation from this world to the world to come. With Yaakov, all the while he was in Egypt, God let him taste a little of the life of the world to come, therefore it says that he did not die, for he did not experience any change with his death. On this, the Gemara follows immediately with, “all who so much as say the name, ‘<i>Rachav, Rachav</i>’ [the most beautiful prostitute of her time] will experience a seminal flow.” The Gemara concludes that “this was true for those who knew her and had seen her.” These two matters are juxtaposed in the Gemara in order to show that just as with the affairs of this world desire remains fixed in the heart of man, so too was the drop of life (from the world to come) fixed in the heart of Yaakov Avinu from the time God dripped it into him and forevermore. Therefore it is inconceivable that the expression death would have any relevance to Yaakov Avinu any more than one who removes his garments and dresses in other garments. This is the meaning of the verse (Yesahya, 58:8), “then your light shall break forth as the morning,” for “break forth” “is comprised of the same letters as Yaakov” and also “fixed.” Understand this.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is explained well in the <i>Sha’ar haClallim</i>, the Gate of Principles of the Kabbalah, Chapter Ten, which precedes the <i>Eyts Haiim</i>.</i>",
                    "<i>“You thought evil of me, but E-lohim thought it for good ….”</i> (Bereshit, 50:20)<br>With this God showed that it was possible to bring the tribes into the exile of Egypt, the main point of which is separation, for at a time when Israel is unified nothing can rule over them. This began when Yosef was separated from the tribes, for while Yaakov Avinu was still among them it could not be discerned who was the greatest of the tribes, as sometimes he would bring this one closer, and sometimes this one closer, just whichever was fitting in his eyes to bring close at that time. Yet before his passing, at the time when he blessed them, he said to Yehuda, “the sons of your father will bow down before you,” and all recognized that Yehuda was dominant over his brothers. Because of this Yosef did not know how to conduct himself, whether to seat Yehuda at the head, for was he not the king, and it was forbidden to disrespect the king? Or should he seat himself at the head, for did he not know himself that Yehuda was the head and would therefore sit in a category unto himself, and not with the tribes? The tribes judged him that he did this out of hatred, and therefore they were punished to go with exile as they should have judged him favorably.<br>Also with Yosef, his response was considered a sin, since he left room for them to be mistaken about him. Truly he should have acted by seating himself at the head since at this time he was king, yet he was to know in his heart that Yehuda was greater than he was. And truly, that his brothers were mistaken about him might seem like a small mistake in the eyes of man (yet it had tremendous results). Therefore one must always pray before God that it should never enter his mind to judge another as guilty, and also that his fellow man should not judge him as guilty, and therefore the tribes were punished, in that they were supposed to judge him favorably."

                    "<i>“And these are the names … And it was, because the midwives feared God, that He made them houses.”</i> (Shemot, 1:1,21)<br>It is the nature of human fear that when one experiences it he has no peace of mind, for fear is the opposite of peace of mind. However, with the fear of God, one experiences confidence and comfort. “And He made them houses,” teaches of this, for “houses” teaches of an organized, settled mind; and then it follows that when they had a settled mind from the fear of E-lohim they had no fear from the decree of Pharaoh. This is “and He made them houses.” This is the explanation of the verse (<i>Bereshit</i>, 49:13), “Zevulun shall dwell on the ocean shore, and he shall be a shore for ships,” for “ocean” teaches of fear and “ship” teaches of a settled mind. As it is said in the Gemara (<i>Bava Metsia</i>, 9b), “a ship is at rest.”",
                    "<i>“And Moshe said, who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel?”</i> (Shemot, 3:11)<br>He asked two questions. One, “who am I”; in other words, he asked God to shine into him what made him more fit to be the redeemer more than anyone else in Israel. Two, “that I should bring out”; meaning, it is true that they are being subjugated to harsh slavery and they deserve to be redeemed, but nevertheless, what will be with them when they are brought out? That is, surely the intention of God is not just to improve their life in this world.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As our sages say in <i>Avot</i>, “this world is just a corridor,” and what will become of their more primary existence in the world to come? Do you even need me for their spiritual well-being in the hereafter?</i> Concerning this God answered him, to the question, “who am I?” He answered him, “for I will be with you,” saying that it is because I know that you do not turn to anything from your own accord, but only from what I send to you. The very name Moshe teaches of this, “for from the water was he drawn [<i>meshitihu</i>],” meaning that all the desires and personal interests were “drawn” out of him,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Water always symbolizes desires.</i> and he felt no arrogance in that the Divine presence spoke directly to him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here we continue a theme from the previous weeks, that the highest possible level for man to achieve is to be a pure vessel for God’s will, as Yaakov always looked towards God’s will to shine into him, this being the only motivation for his action. It is similarly so with Yehuda and David; one need only look for their names in the previous <i>Parshiot</i> to find how this was their true nature.</i> Concerning the question, “that I should bring out,” the intention of God is surely not for benefit in this world. This being so, He answered him, “when I shall bring you out … You shall serve E-lohim … ” meaning that I shall place you under the yokes of servitude to the Torah, and My dealings with you shall concern things that live and endure for all of eternity. On this He said, “and this shall be your sign, that I [<i>Anochi</i>] sent you,” and He did not formulate it by saying, “that I [<i>Ani</i>] sent you,” for the additional letter, <i>Caf</i> in <i>Anochi</i>, teaches of something that lasts for all eternity.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Zohar tells us, “the letter <i>Caf</i> stands for <i>Ceter</i>, the Divine crown,” which in a general sense surrounds and is higher than all the other <i>sefirot</i>, as a crown is above and surrounding the head. It is so supernal in nature that it is not even counted among the ten <i>sefirot</i>, which rather start with <i>Chochma</i> (see <i>Eyts Haiim, Sha’ar</i> 23, Chapter 5). Also, there is a basic principle that the highest level of each world, <i>Ceter</i>, is actually the same as the lowest level, <i>Malchut</i>, of the world above it; therefore being the chain that connects everything to the Highest, connecting the finite with the infinite—the blessed <i>Ayn Sof</i>.</i>",
                    "<i>“Go then and gather the elders of Israel … but behold, they will not believe me ….”</i> (Shemot, 3:16–4:1)<br>Moshe actually trusted that they would believe him, for if God sent him surely he would succeed. Yet still, he said that it is not befitting that the messenger sent from God should not possess the power to sway their hearts into listening to him, yet should rather have to plead with them. “And God said to him, what is that in your hand? And he said, a staff. And He said, cast it to the ground, and he cast it to the ground, and it became a snake …” (<i>Shemot</i>, 4:2–3). “Staff” hints at the source of life, as it is written in the Gemara (<i>Pesachim</i>, 68a), “In the future the <i>Tsaddikim</i> shall raise the dead, as it is written, each man, his staff in his hand.” “And he cast it to the ground, and it became a snake,” meaning that He showed him that these things did not come out of the source of life, but were rather a surface appearance that seemed like life. At the source they are nothing, for “snake” hints at this. You must understand, are not the hearts of Israel in My hands, to coerce them to My will? And if I sent you, then you must believe that I will also send into their hearts the inclination to adhere to you. “And Moshe fled from its presence” means that he understood his mistake. “And He said, put forth your hand and grasp it at its tail,” meaning, investigate deeply into this very matter, how it occurred to you that they might not believe you, for is this not in itself also God’s will? In this He showed him that there was a reason for his insecurities, for it entered his mind that there would be times when they would fail to believe in Moshe, as in Korach’s controversy. These three wonders hint at the three failures that were to come about in Israel.<br>The staff corresponds to the complaints murmured in <i>Parshat Chukat</i> (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 21:5), “and the people spoke against God and against Moshe … our soul despises this cheap bread … and God sent snakes among the people.” This was fixed with “and all who are bitten shall glance at the brass serpent, and live.” Since this matter had been fixed, here too the snake turned back into a staff. The second wonder, “place your hand on your chest [and it became leprous],” corresponds to Miriam and Aaron speaking against Moshe, and since this matter had also been fixed with the healing of Miriam’s leprosy, Moshe’s leprosy was also healed. The third wonder, “take some water from the Nile, and it became blood,” corresponds to the “waters of strife [When the people complained for water, so Moshe lost control and hit the rock].” Since this was never fixed as Moshe could not enter the land, therefore we do not find that the blood was turned back into water.",
                    "<i>“And he went, and they met at the mountain of E-lohim, and he kissed him.”</i> (Shemot, 4:27)<br>In the Midrash (<i>Bereshit</i> Rabba, 8:5), “Loving-kindness [<i>Hesed</i>] and Truth have met, Righteousness [<i>Tsedek</i>] and Peace kissed (<i>Tehilim</i>, 85:11). Hesed is Aaron, Truth is Moshe, Tsedek is Moshe, Peace is Aharon.” It is also written in the Midrash (Tanchuma <i>Shemot</i>, 28), “With the creation of the world, the Holy One, blessed be He, asked the opinion of Hesed. Hesed said, create it, for the world is filled with Loving-kindness. Truth said, do not create it, for the world is filled with lies. Tsedek said, create it, for the world is filled with righteousness. Peace said do not create it, for the world is filled with quarrels. What did he do? The Holy One, blessed be He, threw Truth down to the earth and created the world.” The famous dilemma is: What did He do with Peace? Didn’t He also throw peace down to the earth? Also, if Moshe was Truth and Tsedek, then on one side he said, create it, and on the other side he said, do not create it. The matter is, “Truth says do not create it,” and also Moshe whose attribute was Truth was greatly disturbed in his soul that the way of evil ones would succeed, and that Pharaoh could enslave the people of Israel. For is it not complete falsehood? Pharaoh was completely evil. This disturbed Moshe greatly.<br>The attribute of his brother Aharon was Hesed (Loving-kindness), and he learned always to have a mind that suffers and endured all, to accept all with love without accusations against God. This is as the Midrash explains (Tanchuma <i>Shemot</i>, 10), “Who gave man a mouth [as God answered Moshe]? Rabbi Yochanan said, who gave the advice to flee from Pharaoh?” Meaning that the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moshe, “who sent it into your heart to flee? Isn’t that the attribute of Aharon, which is contrary to your nature? And your attribute is that of Truth, and according to your attribute there is no reason to flee from the evil Pharaoh, yet I taught you the attribute of patience.” After Moshe Rabeynu fled from before Pharaoh he learned how to be patient.<br>This is the very reason why the Holy One, blessed be He, appeared before him in the burning bush. It was in order to teach him this attribute, and He showed him that He dwelled in the bush.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This could be explained, that either that the All Powerful would reside in a lowly bush until the time was right, or that just as the bush was not consumed, so would Moshe be patient until Pharaoh was subdued.</i> There he learned how to be immensely patient, “for I am with him in times of trouble” (<i>Tehilim</i>, 91:15), remaining patient before Pharaoh. For this reason Moshe Rabeynu blessed Yosef (<i>Devarim</i>, 33:16) with “the will of He who dwelled in the bush.”<br>Here Moshe Rabeynu wanted to include the attribute of patience into the attribute of Yosef the <i>Tsaddik</i>, so he would be filled with good will towards Israel without any grudges against any soul in Israel. In the tribe of Yosef severe judgments arise against Israel at times when they turn away from God’s will. Thus we find the Prophet warning Israel and saying to them (Amos, 5:6), “Lest the house of Yosef break forth like a fire,” meaning not to be easy to anger and to act with good will towards Israel.<br>Therefore he said to him, “the will of He who dwelled in the bush,” meaning that God will teach you the attribute of patience as He taught me with the bush. Then when this attribute settled into the heart of Moshe, it created the peace necessary for Israel’s redemption. This is the meaning of “Hesed and Truth have met,” “meeting” meaning that they opposed one another; for Aharon’s attribute was Hesed, and he said, create it, while Moshe was Truth, and he said, do not create it. So when it was necessary for Moshe to flee from Pharaoh he was called (Daniel, 8:12), “and Truth was sent earthward.” This means that the attribute of Truth reached an equilibrium with Hesed, and the attribute of Truth was made into Tsedek (righteousness), meaning like Aharon, so then he also said “create it.” When they reached this equilibrium, then “Tsedek and Peace have kissed,” for then truth also said “create it.” For when Peace initially said “do not create it,” it wanted to be in opposition to the attribute of Truth, for Aharon’s attribute is Peace. But now that Truth was made into Tsedek and said “create it,” then Peace would not say “do not create it.” In this, “Tsedek and Peace have kissed,” through the “cleaving of soul to soul.”",
                    "<i>“(Moshe to God) Why have you done evil towards the people ….”</i> (Shemot, 5:22)<br>At first glance, it is a wonder that such a word against God could come out of the mouth of Moshe. But truly, Moshe Rabeynu was a great lover of Israel, so when he heard from the mouth of the Almighty that they would need to remain in Egypt until all the plagues had passed through Egypt, he then asked, “is it not in Your power to redeem the people in an instant? Why then must they be in Egypt for the twelve months, to see the plagues and be terrified by them?” As it is written (<i>Devarim</i>, 28:60), “the diseases of Egypt which you were afraid of,” for truly Israel also feared the plagues. So therefore he asked this of the Holy One, blessed be He, and God showed him that even this was necessary for Israel. Truly Israel had a connection to the Egyptians, as it is written (<i>Devarim</i>, 4:34), “You took a nation from the midst of a nation,” meaning, as a newborn falling forth from the womb of his mother also has a connection to the mother. Therefore they also needed refinement and to fear the plagues, for the fear itself refined their hearts, as we find in the Gemara (<i>Berachot</i>, 59a), “Thunder was created only to remove the crookedness from the heart.” This is the meaning of the verse in the chapter of <i>Tehilim</i> against evil spirits (<i>Tehilim</i>, 91:8), “you will only see with your eyes, and you will see the recompense of the evil ones.” In other words, you need to see that by means of this fear the crookedness of the heart will be refined into good."

                    "<i>“And E-lohim spoke to Moshe saying to him, I am Hashem.”</i> (Shemot, 6:2)<br>After Moshe Rabeynu assailed God, may He be blessed, He responded by rebuking him, and this is why the Torah says <i>vai’daber</i>, “and E-lohim spoke to Moshe” which is a harsher way of speaking than <i>vayomer</i> (and he said). The name “E-lohim” also teaches of this (judgment), so immediately after it says, “and He <i>said</i> to him.” This is like one who became angry at his friend, yet he loves him, so when he sees his friend astonished and frightened, he then hints to him that all his anger was only outward and momentary. Thus it is here with the formulation “and He said to him, I am Hashem,” for saying denotes softness, meaning that He said to him softly that He is not really angry, God forbid. This is also why it says “I am Hashem,” for the name <i>Havaya</i> (the Tetragrammaton) is filled with compassion, and the strong rebuke was only outward and temporary, so do not be afraid.",
                    "<i>“And E-lohim spoke to Moshe … And I appeared ….”</i> (Shemot, 6:2–6)<br>Meaning that after Moshe Rabeynu asked the Holy One, blessed be He, “as it is in Your power to redeem Israel immediately, so why must you cause havoc with the plagues?” To this, God told Moshe to go to Israel, and that they would not listen to him. And the Holy One, blessed be He, showed him that the <i>birrur</i> (clarification) for Israel was not complete and the time had not yet come for the final redemption. This is why it is said afterwards, “These are the heads of their father’s houses,” and related their lineage. All together there were found forty-five leaders of the thousands of Israel. He showed him that these forty-five leaders also needed to undergo further <i>birrurim</i> until even the last one, Pinchas, who seemed to be the most purified one of all, meriting the <i>brit shalom</i> (the covenant of peace), also needed to undergo further <i>birrur</i>. This is hinted at in the calligraphic tradition of writing a broken <i>vav</i> in <i>brit shalom</i> (<i>vav ketiya</i>). This <i>Parsha</i> shows how it is crucial for all great men of Israel to proceed with great fear of heaven, and this is (<i>Devarim</i>, 10:12), “what<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">What, or <i>mah</i>, in Hebrew, numerically equivalent to 45.</i> does Hashem ask of you if not to fear Him,” hinting at the forty-five kinds of fear.",
                    "<i>“Go, speak unto Pharaoh, king of Egypt,”</i> (Shemot, 6:11)<br>It is written in the Midrash (Tanchuma, <i>Vaeira</i>, 2), “The saying goes, there is no profit in acacia wood, only in thorns.” What could this enigmatic saying mean? Pharaoh did not listen to Moshe, nor did the children of Israel, as the verse says, “they did not listen …” The children of Israel are the acacia.  Saying “there is no profit in acacia wood,” is as if to say, though Israel is like a good tree with strong roots, the real profit is in the thorny tree, Pharaoh’s oppression. Before the slavery was harsh, Israel did not listen to Moshe. Pharaoh’s insolence and obstinacy served to cause Israel to listen to Moshe, and from this we can recognize the advantage of Pharaoh over the children of Israel.",
                    "The seven plagues in this week’s <i>Parsha</i> correspond to the verse (Mishlei, 6:16), “these six does God hate, and seven are an abomination to His soul.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From here we know that all punishment in the world, even among the Gentiles, such as when one leader is deposed and another gains power, it is all rooted in the evil attributes mentioned in the verse, “six does God hate … a proud look, a lying tongue and hand…” see there. <i>Tashlum</i>.</i> King Shlomo’s intention was to make an order of the sins, so therefore he started with small sins, and then after the serious ones. Yet here, when the Egyptians were punished for all these sins saturated into their hearts, they were first punished for the serious ones. The plague of blood corresponded to “spreading discord among brothers,” as the attribute that does the most to keep us far from God is anger. Lust may bring you away from God, but anger brings you away the farthest. “A false witness who ‘blows’ lies” was the plague of frogs, for the Egyptians would devise all kinds of lies about Israel, and the term “blows lies” means that they would take a small matter and blow it up into a great one. In Israel, the law is that if you see another sinning, and there are no other witnesses, it is forbidden for you to tell, as in the incident of Tuvia sinning (<i>Pesachim</i>, 113b).<br>When there are no witnesses in a case, it is proof that God does not want to publicize the sin but rather hide it in this world. Therefore it is forbidden to publicize it. Yet the Egyptians would publicize everything, so the plague of frogs came upon them who also would croak and howl so loudly that the Egyptians could not hear their own voices. The plague of lice corresponds to “legs hastening to do evil.’ With Israel it is said (Yesahya, 1:21), “righteousness lodges in it.” This means that they would delay the judgment, not carrying it out immediately. Even when they knew that the judgment was correct, still they would put it aside overnight (“lodges”) as perhaps someone would come forth with evidence for acquittal.<br>The Egyptians acted in the opposite way. They would race with each other to harm Israel, yet God in His mercy guarded them and even those who raced to hurt them could not. The plague of lice corresponded to this, small creatures who make rapid movements, yet with all their rapidity they effect very little. “A heart which devises evil imaginations” was the plague of wild beasts, since they would devise plans to harm Israel, so the plague of wild beasts was a mixture of different beasts like the mixture of all their evil plans. This is why it says, “and I will divide the land of Goshen … and there will be no wild beasts there” God will make it clear that among Israel there is no mixture of evil thoughts.<br>The plague of pestilence corresponds to “hands shedding clean blood.” The plague of boils corresponds to “a lying tongue,” in that they had the impunity to spread lies, so therefore they were shamed, as it said, “the magicians of Egypt could not stand before Moshe.” With “arrogant eyes” they boasted of what a good influence they were, and they got hail. Rain is the paradigm of good influence in the world, but all that came to arrogant Egypt was hail. Therefore it was Moshe Rabeynu’s very action that brought about the hail as he was clean from arrogance, as it is written (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 12:3), “and the humility of the man Moshe was greater  than all other men …”."

                    "<i>“And Moshe and Aharon went unto Pharaoh and said to him, thus spoke God … If you refuse to let my people go … I will bring locusts ….”</i> (Shemot, 10:3–4)<br>How did Moshe know that he was supposed to warn Pharaoh about the plague of locusts? God never mentions locusts. Rather, he understood from where God tells him to say to Pharaoh, “in order to place My signs before him, and so that you may tell your sons” (<i>Shemot</i>, 10:1). He said specifically, “before him,” or “in his midst,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>B’kirbo</i>, “in its midst,” has the same root as <i>Krav</i>, meaning war.</i> as if to say among themselves, as it is written (Yesahya, 19:2), “And I will set Egyptian against Egyptian, and the Egyptians will then fight among themselves.” This is why the verse says, “[to tell your sons of] the havoc that I have wrought.” The very havoc was the wonder, and wonders do not occur according to nature. On this He said to him, “so that you may tell,” and from here Moshe understood that it is the plague of locusts. There is a good quality to locusts, as “the locusts have no king, yet they all go forth in bands.” (Mishlei, 30:27) Since there is unity and love among they have no need of a king. The need for a king comes from a lack of unity among men. Since there is no hatred among this species, they have no need of a king. When God understood that the Egyptians hate each other and would fight among themselves, He then understood that this would be realized in the world with the plague of locusts, for this species would come to wage war on Egypt. (FN. The phrase “and God understood” is itself a wonder.)  And this is true all the more so even for those who are trusted to remain faithful and not spread hatred in their community. So as they do shall be done to them.",
                    "<i>“… and there was a deep darkness ….”</i> (Shemot, 10:22)<br>The Midrash (<i>Shemot</i> Rabba, 14:3) says, “why did He bring darkness over them? The wicked in that generation who did not want to leave Egypt died in the three days of darkness so that the Egyptians could not say go see how they were punished just like us.” The matter here is that the <i>Avot</i> (Patriarchs) were called <i>Avot</i> (<i>av</i> means progenitor) because none of their thoughts were by chance or frivolous, but came out from the source of life. Souls emerged from their very thoughts even after several generations. We find this with the trial of Avraham when he went to save Lot both from Sodom, and as a captive in his war with the Kings. Here he was reluctant whether or not to save Lot,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because the descendants of Lot were Ammon and Moav, which the Gemara calls the “evil neighbors of Jerusalem.”</i> until the Holy One, blessed be He, shined into him that he should in fact run after them in order to save Lot’s descendants, “two good fledglings,” Ruth and Naomi .<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a reference to the birds offered in the Temple by a woman who had just given birth.</i> (Ruth and Naomi) (<i>Bava Kama</i>, 38b).

                    "The three plagues in this week’s <i>Parsha</i>—locusts, darkness, and the slaying of the firstborn—correspond to the verse (Mishlei, 8:13), “[the fear of God is to hate evil,] pride, arrogance, and the evil way,” etc. “The evil way” means jealousy, desire, and gluttony, which all correspond to the plague of locusts. “Arrogance” is elevating oneself above another before whom he should rather be subdued and corresponds to the plague of darkness, as it is written (Mishlei, 20:20), “Whoever curses his father and mother, his lamp shall be extinguished in deep darkness.” Truly we are enjoined to listen to God alone and a man only has a small portion in his father and mother. However, when a father and mother want to incline their child in the ways of the Torah he must listen to them and to subdue himself before them. Regarding the arrogant who do not want to subdue himself the verse says, “his lamp shall be extinguished in deep darkness.” “Pride,” when he boasts of himself with greater elevation than is befitting him, corresponds to the slaying of the firstborn, for the expression <i>b’chor</i>, firstborn, denotes elevating oneself.",
                    "<i>“… draw out, and take yourselves a lamb ….”</i> (Shemot, 12:21)<br>(<i>Shemot</i> Rabba, 16:2) “draw out, remove your hands from idolatry. Take a lamb, that of mitzvah.” It is written (Mishlei, 15:19), “The way of the lazy is a hedge of thorns, and the way of the upright is a clear path.” “The way of the lazy” means that though he refrains from evil actions thoughts and desires, his motivation is not the love of God, but rather as a slacker. That is, he understands that these ways will not succeed in this world, or in another way where it is still not out of love for God. This way is thus compared to a hedge of thorns,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A way forever filled with impasses.</i> for the heart cannot be free of thoughts and desires even for a moment. Then once desire is removed from the heart, thoughts of anger and the like enter in, and in this way the whole way becomes like a hedge of thorns. With all the scouring of the soul and work to remove bad trait, then another will come to take its place.<br>However, “the way of the upright,” when his love for God inspires him to be a better person, it “is a clear path” to the good life. This is because when he removes evil desires from his heart, what remains is the love of God which of itself guards him from his former evil ways.  The numerical equivalent of “draw out,” “<i>meeshchu</i>,” is 366, 365 for the days of the year, and one more for God who “rides” on them. So everyplace where the word “thus,” <i>az</i> (<i>alef zayin</i>), is written, the meaning is that the <i>Aluf</i>—the chief, meaning God, rides on seven (<i>zayin</i>—7, the seven days of the week)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One is God, and our case the love of God, and the seven are seven lower attributes, love, fear, harmony, etc.</i>",
                    "<i>“This is the statute of the Pesach offering ….”</i> (Shemot, 12:43)<br>It is written in the Midrash (<i>Shemot</i> Rabba, 19:2), “the Pesach offering is called a statute [<i>choq</i>], and the Red Heifer is also called a statute [<i>choq</i>], and you do not know which is greater. There is a parable of two queens who are walking together as one, and they seem equal. However, the greater one is the one whose companion seems to be accompanying her. Thus with the Pesach and the Red Heifer, each of which is called a <i>choq</i>, the ashes of the Red Heifer are greater because you cannot eat the Pesach offering without it, as it is written, ‘and the unclean person shall take of the ashes of the burnt offering.’” The statute of the Pesach offering corresponds to the first commandment of the Decalogue, “<i>Anochi</i>—I am Hashem your God,” which includes all of the positive mitzvot.<br>The statute of the Red Heifer corresponds to the second commandment, “you shall not have any false gods before Me,” which includes all of the prohibitive mitzvot. And truly, the intellect would deem it that man is unable to understand the precious depth of first commandment, “<i>Anochi</i>—I am Hashem your God,” (henceforth <i>Anochi</i>) until his heart has first been undergone the <i>birrur</i> of “you shall not have any false gods before Me.” First he is to shun evil, and then afterwards to do good (see <i>Tehilim</i>, 34:15). So why does “you shall not have” not precede <i>Anochi</i> in the order of the mitzvot? In God’s great compassion and understanding our limitations he preceded “<i>Anochi</i>” before, “you shall have no false gods,” for if he had not, no one could ever come to an understanding of the declaration, “<i>Anochi</i>,” for who in the world can say, “I have refined my heart in all the prohibitive mitzvot?”<br>Concerning this, David haMelech said (<i>Tehilim</i>, 138:2), “For You have made Your saying greater than Your name.” “Saying”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Saying,” <i>Amira</i>, as opposed to “speaking,” <i>Dibbur</i>.</i> always means in a whisper. This whisper is God saying that He will make it clear that the heart of Israel is clean. On this it says (in the same verse), “I will express gratitude to Your name,” meaning gratitude for the good and great kindness You did in first giving us the declaration of the commandment “<i>Anochi</i>” in order that afterwards our hearts could be refined with the declaration of the commandment “you shall not have.” Moshe Rabeynu corresponds to “<i>Anochi</i>,” and Rabbi Akiva ben Yosef corresponds to “you shall not have,” based on the principle that each and every one of the souls of Israel are rooted in the letters of the Torah. The function of Moshe Rabeynu, who corresponds to <i>Anochi</i> was to clarify all the Oneness of God in the world.<br>The soul of Rabbi Akiva, who corresponds to “you shall not have,” served to refine out all the evil, dross, and refuse from the heart of Israel, and to distance it from evil, which is in the category of “you shall not have.” His innovation of many new boundaries and “fences” around the existing laws served to clean the heart of Israel further, for they became included in the category of “you shall not have.” Furthermore, all the <i>halachot</i> of the forbidden and the permitted, the invalid and the kosher, the impure and the pure, were to refine evil from good.<br>This is explained in the Gemara (<i>Menachot</i>, 29b), “at the time when Moshe Rabeynu ascended to Heaven, he found the Holy One, blessed be He, attaching crowns to the letters of the Torah. He said, ‘Master of the world, who stays thy hand [why are you adding to the Torah, is it not already perfect]?’ He said to him, there will come a man after a few generation, and Akiva ben Yosef is his name. He will expound mountains upon mountains of laws from each crown on each letter of the Torah. (Moses descends into the future and finds himself sitting in the back row of one of Rabbi Akiva’s classes.) Moshe was rendered unable to understand anything until a student asked a question and Rabbi Akiva answered, “this is the law as it was delivered to Moshe at Mount Sinai.’”<br>Since Moshe saw how much Rabbi Akiva expanded so many derivative laws from the commandment, “you shall not have any false gods,” he was rendered powerless to understand. Hassidut teaches that the root of everything is “<i>Anochi</i>—I am Hashem your God,” and, “you shall not have any false gods,” which is a special kind of security to prevent man from being pushed away from his Creator, and as a result of this Moshe’s mind became weak. This continued until he arrived at one law, in other words, Moshe then saw why all these boundaries are necessary; “he said to him, this is the law as it was delivered to Moshe at Mount Sinai.” This “one law” was “<i>Anochi</i>” and the entire principle of the Torah, as it says (Zohar, <i>Devarim</i>, 264b), “<i>Shema Yisroel</i>, Hear O Israel, Hashem is God, Hashem is One, this is a great principle in the Torah.” “You shall not have” is only to keep the house of Israel from straying from, “<i>Anochi</i>—I am Hashem your God.” Upon hearing this, Moshe’s power of understanding was returned as he then understood that the main principle was given to him.",
                    "<i>“Sanctify unto Me all the firstborn … of man and of animal ….”</i> (Shemot, 13:2)<br>The principle of “man” relates to the <i>Chochma</i> (wisdom) and thought. This is man’s principle form. “Animal” teaches of the power of action. We find that God commanded to sanctify and join both action and thought. Then man’s essential form will be complete and refined in God’s will. On this it is said (<i>Tehilim</i>, 36:7), “you, Hashem, preserve [<i>toshia</i>] both man and beast.” Here man is thought, and beast hints at action. We find that Moshe Rabeynu was the <i>Chochma</i> (wisdom) of all of Israel. All of his power was in <i>Chochma</i>, in particular the ability of the man’s mind to have God ever before him. Therefore the entire Torah speaks principally of actions, and thus in the presence of God actions will be as refined as thought. To this end Moshe Rabeynu made the <i>Mishkan</i> (Tabernacle), whose parallel in the form of man is the depths of the heart, and the <i>Mishkan</i> could be taken apart and brought to a different place. The wisdom of Shlomo haMelech was in action, so therefore he built the Holy Temple in a fixed place so as to be ever before God. Also, the book of Mishlei, which he wrote speaks mainly of the uprightness of the heart, and thought that will be established like action.",
                    "<i>“Sanctify unto Me all the firstborn … and Moshe said, remember the day you went out of Egypt … and you shall not eat leaven ….”</i> (Shemot, 13:2–3)<br>Why did Moshe first tell Israel the passage concerning <i>Matsot</i> (unleavened bread, in Verses 3–10), and then after the passage of the firstborn (Verses 11–15), when the Holy One, blessed be He, when the original subject was the firstborn (in verse 2)? God commanded him to say the passage of the firstborn in order to be refined and clean of all lusts. This is because overpowering lust is prominent in the drop of semen which creates the firstborn. This is why it says, “sanctify unto Me all the firstborn.” However, Moshe Rabeynu knew that it is not possible for man to guard himself from these lusts if He had not first shined into him how to be clean from the desire for food. If a man is clean in what he receives, then he will also be refined in what he gives out. This is because the neck that receives is aligned corresponding to the <i>brit</i> of the penis. This was the intention of preceding the passage of <i>Matsot</i> before the passage of the firstborn."

                    "<i>“And it was, when Pharaoh sent the people away … and Moshe took the bones of Yosef with him ….”</i> (Shemot, 13:17–19)<br>Why were these two verses juxtaposed? When Moshe Rabeynu saw Pharaoh running close behind them even after they were redeemed, it caused him to doubt if Israel had reached its final completion. They would not have if they still had a connection to Pharaoh, perhaps due to the long time they had spent in Egyptian society. Furthermore, when he saw that God did not lead the people in the direct route along the coast by way of the land of the Philistines<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">But rather He led them by a more circuitous way so it would be more difficult to return.</i> so they wouldn’t regret and return, Moshe also understood that Israel had not yet been completed in their final <i>birur</i> (refinement). It is written in the <i>Pirke Avot</i> (Ch. 3, Mishna 9), “He whose fear of sin precedes his wisdom, his wisdom will endure.” There are times when God hides His actions and conceals His intentions from mankind. Then man does not know God’s will is in that particular matter, as we find in our case where Moses was uncertain, a wonder in his view why God did not lead the people through the land of the Philistines.<br>If one sees that God is dealing with him in a hidden, inscrutable way, then he is advised not to be too clever, but should rather perform the mitzvot with simplicity and intensify his fear of God. This is “Moshe took the bones of Yosef …” When he faces uncertainty, the <i>Tsaddik</i> accepts that the deficiency in his surroundings is really a deficiency in himself. This has to do with how he took Yosef’s bones. When Moshe had accepted that Israel’s incompleteness evinced by wanting to go back to Egypt really depended on himself, then he began to intensify his fear of God. This is hinted at in the bones of Yosef, for the main attribute of Yosef haTsaddik was the fear of God, as explained in the verse (Amos, 5:6), “lest the house of Yosef overcome like a fire.” And this is the meaning of, “he whose fear of sin precedes his wisdom (his wisdom shall endure),” which is the attribute of Yosef haTsaddik.",
                    "<i>“And they took their journey from Succot, and they encamped at Eitam, on the edge of the wilderness.”</i> (Shemot, 13:20)<br>“Succot” means trust (as living in a temporary dwelling requires trust), and, “Eitam” represents <i>tekifut</i> (“holy chutzpa,” going forward without stopping to assess the situation). sup&gt;15<i class=\"footnote\">Like the word <i>Eitan</i>, meaning strength.</i> “And God went before them by day with a pillar of cloud … the pillar of cloud did not depart from them by day nor the pillar of fire by night.” The pillar of cloud teaches of the fear of God, and the pillar of fire teaches of trust. Sometimes we find man’s heart filled with great trust and great <i>tekifut</i>, called “day,” which requires him delve deeply into the fear God. At other times a man is in a pronounced state of fear, called “night,” which necessitates that he increase and strengthen his trust in God. This is the meaning of “with a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.” This is the explanation of the Mishna in <i>Pirke Avot</i> (Ch. 3, Mishna 17), “If there is no wisdom, then there is no fear, and if there is no fear, then there is no wisdom.” Wisdom is really <i>tekifut</i>, for wisdom fortifies and strengthens the heart of the wise. Yet still, if there is no fear of God, and he does not understand that in an instant God can take away this wisdom and <i>tekifut</i>, then his wisdom is worthless as he fancies that his <i>tekifut</i> can withstand even God. There is no greater nonsense.<br>“If there is no wisdom then there is no fear,” refers to one who has no trust in God, yet he is constantly in a state of fear even without the inspiration from the Torah, then his fear is not authentic but rather imaginary, as one who truly fears God has <i>tekifut</i> in his heart and trust in God. This is as it says once, “and the children of Israel went on the dry land through the sea,” while another time it says, “through the sea on the dry land.” “Sea” teaches of fear, meaning prayer, and “dry land” teaches of <i>tekifut</i> and trust. The principal <i>tekifut</i> is the Torah, the <i>tekifut</i> of Israel. If one’s prayer leads him to study Torah he can know that his prayer is accepted. Likewise he will know that his Torah is the Torah of truth if it is accompanied by crying and praying in his heart. Thus he needs to join the two together as one.",
                    "<i>“… and at night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they might go by day and by night.”</i> (Shemot, 13:21)<br>It is written (<i>Tehilim</i>, 68:36), “Awesome is E-lohim from Your sanctuary, the God of Israel gives strength and awesome might to His people, blessed is E-lohim.” “Awesome is E-lohim.” There are so many reasons to fear and tremble before Him, yet still, at the place of the Holy Temple, where all fear goes forth into the world, of this it says, “Awesome is E-lohim from Your sanctuary,” the source from where “strength and awesome might” go forth to His people Israel. Because of this the verse ends, “blessed is E-lohim,” meaning that He is a fountainhead of life that is ever flowing and never ceasing. Yaakov Avinu possessed these two attributes of fear and trust, corresponding to the face of the eagle in the <i>Merkava</i> (chariot) of Yechezkel, for it is the nature of the eagle to be merciful with its own young and cruel to strangers. This is to “go by day,” meaning with mercy towards Israel, and “by night,” against the nations.",
                    "<i>“… that they turn back and encamp before Pi Hahirot ….”</i> (Shemot, 14:2)<br>The impure power of this form of idolatry was the <i>kelipah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Evil force, or “shell.”</i> of <i>z’nut</i>, or licentiousness, and as such this particular idol in the desert was in the form of a male and female.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Apparently engaged in the act of fornication.</i> Therefore its name was <i>Pi Hahirot</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Like <i>pi haheiroot</i>, the mouth of liberty.</i> for the nations define freedom as the freedom to extend into and perform all the lusts of the heart. On this Pharaoh said, “they are confounded in the land.” As if to say that when they reach this idol it they will be confounded by the realization that they are so enslaved to their physical desires that they go to great lengths to guard themselves with all of the “fences” or extra stringencies of the Torah. In fact the opposite is true, for the nations are enslaved to their lust as their intelligence is not in control of their hearts. Rather they are ruled by their desires, and there is no enslavement greater than this.",
                    "<i>“… over against it shall you encamp by the sea.”</i> (Shemot, 14:2)<br>It is written (Gemara <i>Berachot</i>, 63a), “Know Him in all your ways, even concerning a sin.” Such is the case with “over against it [the idol of <i>ba’al tsafon</i>] shall you encamp by the sea.” Even if your actions are similar to the Egyptians, yet still, the actions of Israel are good, for the people of Israel, the portion of God, are cleaving in simple life without any separation and drawing their energy from the Source of life. Just as God is disencumbered of any attribute or any external coloring, but rather exists in absolute simplicity, so too Israel at the source of its life, free of any external force, separation, or subordinate power. Whether concerning wisdom, status, or wealth, Israel is disencumbered of any influence other than God. With the nations, however, each particular nation has its own power and hue from which it draws its life force and to which it grasps hold of.<br>For example, the power of Babylon was in its status, and the power of the Philistines was in the tricks and wisdom they used to attain wealth, or a crafts with which they could earn a livelihood. The power of Moab and its <i>kelipah</i> was strength, strengthening their minds with a healthy diet and the like. Their particular form of idolatry was <i>Chemosh</i> (meaning “dried”), meaning the form of a man dried up from its childhood form.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Perhaps a kind of “shrunken head.”</i> Their fear was that this power would be taken away, like an old, senile man with little appetite.<br>Now God dispersed Israel among the nations so they would be among these powers, to clarify, refine, and clean themselves concerning them, not turning to them but rather placing their trust in God. And in the future, when God will redeem them, He will then give them all the powers from which they had refined themselves, the status of Babylon, the wealth of the Philistines, the strength and mental fortitude of Moab. He shall give them all of these in recompense for all the trials and tribulations they incurred in the exile. Thus when God shall plant these good things among Israel these attributes will be filled with <i>Kedusha</i> (holiness) and among Israel they will be limitless since they come from God. Among the nations of the world these good things are given in in a limited way, but with Israel they will come from God’s providence and without limit, as God is without limit.<br>This is explained in the prophecy of Yesahyahu concerning the fall of the Philistines, saying, “and the firstborn of the poor I shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety, and I will kill your root with famine” (Yesahyahu, 14:30). They will be paid back measure for measure. Since they say that they need to run after sources of livelihood for security (yet security based on a subordinate earthly power), therefore it is said, “and I have killed your root with famine.” Then when they fall, their power and abundance will be brought into Israel. This is because Israel was in exile among them and tested concerning this attribute, not placing their trust in the subordinate power but rather in God. Therefore, “the firstborn of the poor I shall feed,” meaning Israel who are poor and relying on God. Now with the fall of the wealthy Philistines, the poor of Israel will be fed and supported.<br>It will be similarly so with the downfall of all the other nations. This is the explanation of the verse, “over against it shall you encamp by the sea.” Four powers are enumerated here which are the <i>kelipot</i> of Egypt, <i>migdol</i> (tower), <i>yam</i> (sea), <i>ba’al tsafon</i> (master of the north), and <i>pi haheirot</i> (the mouth of freedom). Therefore the verse says, “over against it shall you encamp.” Corresponding to them and similar to their powers so will all the benefits and abundance of Egypt be yours, and nevertheless you will be redeemed from them and they will fall before you. When all of these powers are among Israel they are filled with <i>Kedusha</i> even if they seem similar to Egypt, for “E-lohim made them one over against the other [everything in <i>Kedusha</i> has its “evil twin” in impurity].” The accuser saw them at the Red Sea and claimed, “what is the difference between these and these? [for they both served idols],” yet God testified for them that there is nothing in the hearts of Israel except the love of God.",
                    "<i>“… and the children of Israel left with a high hand.”</i> (Shemot, 14:8)<br>The Aramaic translation reads, “with an uncovered head,” meaning not with high hand against others, but rather with pride and confidence, since they are now free and fear no one.",
                    "<i>“God will fight for you, and you shall be silent.”</i> (Shemot, 14:14)<br>Concerning this they were commanded to hold their peace and refrain from action, not even praying to God. With the war against Amalek we find the opposite, where it is said, “and it was, when Moshe lifted his hands [they succeeded],” and it said, “and his hands were <i>emunah</i>, steady [faithful],” where the Aramaic translation reads, “his hands were spread out in prayer.” There is a difference between Amalek and other nations. Other nations say that not all is in the hands of Heaven, and ascribe all good influence to their own efforts, saying, “my strength and the power of my hands has gotten me this wealth.” Therefore in Israel’s war with Egypt they were commanded to hold their peace, meaning to show that all is in the hands of Heaven, and even the prayer that a man offers cannot be done independent of God’s will. Thus it is said, “and you will be silent.”<br>The Gemara in <i>Kedushin</i> (18a) calls Amalek, “the apostate of Israel.” He ascribes all of his actions to God.  He believes that all of his evil is God’s will, as he could not do anything but for the will of the Blessed One. The advice against this belief is to show how man has the power to choose the fear of Heaven, and for this he needs Divine service and prayer. On this the Gemara (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, 60a) mentions Ravshakei, an apostate of Israel (see 2 Kings, Ch. 18), who said, “have I come up to this place without God to destroy it!?” In this way he attributes his wickedness to God, and the advice against this is to pray.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Though it must be investigated, for it says there in verse 36, “and the people held their peace … for the king’s commandment was, answer him not,” which seems like the response for Egypt.</i>",
                    "<i>“Thus God saved Israel on that day ….”</i> (Shemot, 14:30)<br>After the great salvation of the redemption from Egypt they needed to experience <i>tsimtsum</i> (constriction). During Passover eating is constricted, hinted at in the <i>matsah</i>, “the bread of poverty.” But here (in this verse) after they merited the splitting of the Red Sea on the seventh day of Passover, it says, “thus God saved,” etc. On that day they no longer needed “fences” (for the law) and restrictions, and this is hinted at in what is written in the Mishne Torah (meaning the book of <i>Devarim</i>, 16:8), “six days,” and it does not say seven.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meaning that the period of <i>tsimtsum</i> was only for six days, and then on the seventh, “thus God saved,” meaning releasing them from restrictions and bringing them great salvations.</i>",
                    "<i>“… horse and its rider He threw into the sea.”</i> (Shemot, 15:1)<br>“Horse” teaches of speed and expansion. “Rider” teaches of a settled mind that restrains the horse from running. With the nations see the pleasures of this world, they do not have the power to restrain themselves but rather expand into their desires. Therefore concerning them it says first “horse” and then “rider,” for after they have been filled with all their desires they have no power for more and cease. Yet with God it says (Habakuk, 3:8), “when <i>you</i> ride upon your horses and chariots of salvation.” The verse says first “You ride,” to say that when God gives goodness to Israel He constricts it before it comes into their possession, and they do not take it until they fears the giver. Then He gives it in a way that it is received by a fully willing heart. This is why it says first “when You ride,” teaching of reckoning and a settled mind, and after “Your horses,” denoting the effusion of good with great velocity.",
                    "<i>“God is a man of war, God is His name.”</i> (Shemot, 15:3)<br>It is written in Midrash Esther (Rabba, 6:3), “With the wicked, their personal name precedes, ‘is their name,’ such as ‘Naval is his name,’ ‘Sheva ben Bichri is his name,’ and so forth. Yet with the <i>tsaddikim</i>, ‘their name is’ precedes their personal name, such as ‘his name is Manoach,’ ‘his name is Kish,’ ‘his name is Mordechai.’ This is because they resemble their Creator, of whom it was said, ‘and My name YHVH I did not make known to them’ (<i>Shemot</i>, 6:3).” So here in the Song of the Sea it say, “God is His name,” just as we find with the <i>tsaddikim</i>, where “his name is” precedes their personal name, because they control their hearts and their hearts are in their possession. The expression “his name” teaches of will, for even <i>shmo</i>, “his name,” is numerically equivalent to “<i>ratson</i>,” “will” (both equal 346) as is mentioned in the Midrash (<i>Bereshit</i> Rabba, 34:11). The <i>tsaddikim</i> control their wills and consider their thoughts. If they deem them improper they refrain. With the wicked it is the opposite as their hearts possess them.<br>It is written in the Midrash (<i>Yalkut B’shalach</i> 241 in the name of the Midrash Avchir), “the angel of Egypt came to recommend that God be merciful with them, so the angel Gavriel came with a brick, placed it before the Holy One, blessed be He, and said, ‘with this Egypt has subjected Israel to slave labor.’ ” With all of Egypt’s sins and wickedness there was still a little room to teach of their merits as their hearts were somewhat inclined towardss the good. Therefore would have been proper for God to be merciful with them and see to their welfare. But when Gavriel came and showed them the brick,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Remember the horror that the Egyptians would make bricks out of Jewish children.</i> he was saying  that they enslaved Israel with such wickedness that any tendency towardss the good was null. Therefore God said, “God is His name,” meaning that He will deal with them measure for measure, for just as they had no control over their hearts, so too God will not change His will from the attribute of stern justice, and this is “God is His name.”",
                    "<i>“Who is like You among the powers [</i>eileem<i>] Hashem? Who is like You, glorious [</i>ne’edar<i>] in holiness ….”</i> (Shemot, 15:11)<br>“Who is like You among the powers,” is saying that in God’s essence He is hidden from the eye of all life and no one can apprehend Him, as it is explained in the Gemara (<i>Gittin</i>, 56b), “who is like You among the speechless.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Eelaymim</i>, speechless, signifying unfathomable inwardness.</i> “Glorious in holiness,” is to say, openly revealed, for the Creator is readily apparent in the creation. All created beings are evidence of the Creator, for whatever the seeker of God encounters his heart wells up and he asks, “who created these?” This is the meaning of the phrase in the liturgical poem, “<i>ha’ederet ve’ha’emuna</i>,” “the glory and the faith, to the Life of all worlds [God].” “Glorious” means revealed and “faith” means hidden and concealed. Something that is not hidden needs no faith, only something that is concealed requires faith, and this is because in man’s view the only thing that is revealed is that a great wonder created all of these. These two aspects of the hidden and the revealed are only united in God.",
                    "<i>“And Moshe had Israel travel from the Red Sea ….”</i> (Shemot, 15:22)<br>When Moshe Rabeynu saw that Miriam the Prophetess sang the song at the sea, then he knew that it was time for them to move on from their place. Thus it is with God at a time when He effuses a renewal of the Torah to Israel, first He effuses it to the hearts of the leaders and <i>tsaddikim</i> among them. Then afterwards it extends to the hearts of all of Israel, down to the smallest of the small, until this <i>Kedusha</i> (holiness) comes to the hearts of the women. Then the renewal is complete, it has been instilled in the hearts of Israel, and then it is necessary for a new renewal of the Torah. Thus it was with the Song at the Sea, first in the mouth of Moshe, and then in the mouths of all Israel, and when it was said, “and Miriam sang for them,” then it followed immediately, “and Moshe had Israel travel.” Meaning that from now on you need not occupy yourselves with this, for you have already finished what was needed, and now we need to renew words of Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When God effuses <i>Kedusha</i> to the hearts of Israel, it proceeds level by level, first by way of the leaders of Israel, just as the Torah was given to Moshe and afterwards he taught it to the leaders of Israel until it finally reached the common folk, just in the same way each soul in Israel first receives in his consciousness [<i>da’at-Moshe</i>] until the <i>Kedusha</i> is fixed in all his limbs and organs, as it is written [Malachi, 3:16], “then they that feared God spoke with one another, God heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before Him,” meaning that it was carved into the hearts of the children of Israel. We find that the beginning of the effusion of <i>Kedusha</i> is in the <i>Kedusha</i> of time, and time is only in the possession of God. Therefore women are exempt from positive mitzvot that are bound to time, for female teaches of being fixed in time without activity. However, women are required to perform <i>mitzvot</i> that are not bound to time, and this is the sign that this <i>Kedusha</i> is fixed in the hearts of Israel.<br>Knowing this, Moshe had them move on, for whenever it is not yet fixed in the heart of man he can still enter into uncertainty, and enter this <i>Kedusha</i> into uncertainty, for it is not yet promised to him, so he may enter it into uncertainty on the possibility that he may gain even more. Yet when it is fixed in his heart, he is not permitted to enter [this <i>Kedusha</i> into uncertainty] for now it is certainly his and his possession, so once Moshe saw that the <i>Kedusha</i> was fixed in their hearts he had them move on. For truly all the <i>Kedusha</i> that man receives, when one receives goodness from God, there is a recognition of His greatness all the time that it resides in his intellect. It is brilliantly clear and cannot be brought to a place that is not God’s will. Yet when it is fixed in the body, then the brilliant clarity is hidden from man and with this added strength he might use it to do an unwarranted activity.<br>For this reason our sages enacted that we say the <i>ketoret</i> (incense offerings) after every [morning] prayer, because the word <i>ketoret</i> is related to the word <i>ketira</i>, connection, meaning connecting everything, to make sure that this newly gained strength [from the newly gained <i>Kedusha</i>] does not enter into a realm that is not God’s will [that it be connected to the will]. And this incident actually caused Miriam to speak against Moshe, so therefore she is called here “Aharon’s sister,” for Aharon was also caught in this [as mentioned in Rashi]. Even though the illumination of God brings strength to man, yet indeed it does not have to be the source of distress of any man, which is a place that is not God’s will. So therefore Moshe had them move onward. (Excerpt from <i>Giliyon Mei HaShiloach</i>.)</i>",
                    "<i>“… and they went three days into the desert and did not find water.”</i> (Shemot, 15:22)<br>After the great event at the Red Sea, and the great understanding received with the revelation of the <i>Shechina</i> (Divine Presence) as is explained (Mechilta <i>B’Shalach</i>, 3), “a maidservant saw at the splitting of the Red Sea more than the prophets,” they then went for three days with no effusion of the renewal of Torah. This is the meaning of “they did not find water,” that they did not find the longing and the desire for Torah, and were thus despondent. What follows is “and God showed them a branch,” which the Aramaic translation renders “He taught them advice.” The advice was that even this absence of the renewal of Torah (this “dry period”) is also filled with light and goodness from God since it is His will, so it is also goodness of great depth.<br>On this the Midrash says (Tanchuma, <i>B’Shalach</i>, 24), “He made sweet the bitter,” and with this intention he gave them laws of Shabbat, the Red Heifer, and the Justice system at the place named “Mara” (bitter. All three examples will show how the bitter turned to sweet.) “Shabbat” means that they saw how God gave them a way to serve Him even by refraining from action, so there is no reason to complain. “Red Heifer” teaches of the future, for in the future, “He will be one and His name one,” the service will be discontinued and there will be no anger. “The Justice System” teaches of order, for then they will not try to force the hour in order to merit all this goodness, as it must go according to an order so it can be fixed in the heart and immutable.",

Knesset Yisrael is protected by keeping the laws of <i>nidda</i>, family purity. The <i>tsaddik</i> is protected by keeping away from the ‘<i>maidservant</i>’ (adulterous relations). Netzach is protected by keeping away from the daughter of the Gentile. Hod is protected by keeping away from the harlot.” The explanation. “Keeping away from the daughter of the Gentile” means from that which has no portion at all in Israel. “The Harlot” is that which has a portion in Israel but it belongs to another and not to you. “Nidda” means that it belongs to you but its time has not yet come. “The Maidservant” means nonsense and things that are unnecessary, and (refraining from this) guards the <i>tsaddik</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These could be variously interpreted as pertaining to many different situations, the theme of adultery or licentiousness being only one very important application.</i>",

(The author explains each phrase in the verse.) “And that which is honest in His eyes you will do”—“honest” means that you will perform His mitzvot with love and affection, and you will understand how to have in mind the awesome depth of God’s consciousness in order to do more than He commanded you. You have been instructed by the honesty of your heart, for that is honest in the eyes of God. For example, to go beyond what is required for <i>hiddur mitzvah</i> (adorning the mitzvah) up to a third more than was commanded. “And diligently adhere to His voice, and keep all His laws” teaches of zeal or alacrity, to fulfill them immediately, and “laws” [<i>choq</i>] teaches of that which exceeds the capacity of the intellect, and then “for I am God who heals you,” and you will be healed from all.",

Even though they knew that God would not abandon them, still they worried that manna would descend to all of Israel but not to them.

This is why Yitro came at this time (to fix this), as it say in the Midrash (<i>Shemot</i> Rabba, 27:3), “Smite a scorner, and the simple will become prudent. ‘The simple will become prudent,’ is Yitro,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi says on this verse, “because of the plagues on Pharaoh and the war with Amalek, Yitro became wise and converted.”</i> who advised to grant others status even in the days of Moshe Rabeynu, when he said “to make princes over thousands,” etc. Then the great among them will be raised over the small, all the way up to Moshe Rabeynu."

This is also to signify that Yitro also did not know the great depths of his own words, how far he had intended, only Moshe understood his words. This is, “as he said [<i>amar</i>],” vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i>, for Yitro also said things to himself, and he himself did not understand how precious they were.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“<i>Amar</i>,” “he said,” occurs 595 times in the Scriptures, and in only three instances do we find it vocalized with the vowel <i>kamatz</i> under the <i>mem</i> instead of a <i>patach</i>. See <i>Bereshit</i> 18:17, “and God said, shall I hide that which I do from Avraham,” and <i>Bereshit</i> 21:1, “and God remembered Sarah as He said.” In the <i>Torat haNekudot</i>, where each vowel corresponds to a <i>sefirah</i>, the vowel <i>kamatz</i> corresponds to the <i>sefirah</i> of <i>keter</i>, or crown, the highest of the <i>sefirot</i>. It has to do with the surrounding light, beyond man’s comprehension. It is described in the liturgical poem “Kel Mistater” [“God, hidden in Himself,” incorporated in the liturgy of the third meal of Shabbat] as the “intellect hidden from all thought.” When connected to this, it signifies something that could be said but not discerned except by the intellect of Moshe Rabeynu. Also requiring further investigation is why the Rebbe chose to say “also to signify,” for surely there are seventy faces to the Torah, even for every vowel, but also in addition to what? Similarly, it says, “Yitro also did not understand,” meaning Yitro, Moshe and whoever else was present when he said this.</i>",

Alternatives are “The designated people,” designated to keep the Covenant, and “the treasured people” whom God treasures as they keep the Covenant.</i> A <i>Segula</i> (special treasure) is a vessel of reception for all the hidden wealth of the kings. Thus God said to Israel that He would make them into a vessel of reception in order to place in them all the goodness and blessings that He has, and that they could receive them. The Holy Yehudi of Pshiske<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Holy Yehudi was contemporary of Reb Simcha Buenem, zts”l, who was in turn the author’s Rebbe, and for a while a disciple of the Seer of Lublin.</i> explains this same verse by saying that God’s love for Israel is in the way of a <i>segula</i>, a hidden beloved treasure, as His reasons for this are hidden.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We cannot see the hidden treasures in the king’s storehouse, they are unseen and thus we cannot know their reasons. He places them there because they are valuable and precious, because the king loves them. A <i>segula</i> also refers to a ritual or action that brings God’s goodness, yet with no obvious connection to the good effected, like how smelling the wick of the <i>havdalla</i> candle after the <i>havdalla</i> ceremony is believed to save one from anger, or a woman biting off the end of the <i>etrog</i> (citron) with the stem (<i>pitom</i>) after Succot is a <i>segula</i> for her to become pregnant. There are countless other <i>segulot</i>, another reason why the Jewish People are called, “<i>Am Segula</i>.”! The “Tiferret Yosef,” Mordechai Yosef Elazar, great-grandson of the Isbitser, in the first explanation of Shevuot, explains it in this way (first selection on Shevuot, p. 92). “And you shall be My most beloved treasure [<i>segula</i>] out of all the peoples,” meaning that then God will show Israel that the love of God for Israel is a kind of <i>segula</i>. This is as Rabeynu Moreynu ZL”HH explained in the <i>Mei HaShiloach</i>, that <i>segula</i> is something without any discernible meaning, like the treasure house of a king, where no man knows how (immensely) precious the treasure really is.

This would seem quite unusual, and the sages of the Tosafot and R. Itschak Alfasi (the “Rif”) proposed that the verse would imply the opposite.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If God Himself is answering Moshe, then obviously the voice of the Creator and power of all the worlds should take precedence.</i> While Moshe indeed spoke the Ten Mitzvot to Israel, the root of the matter was that with the giving of the Torah at Sinai, the mitzvah of Torah study was fixed into the hearts of Israel. This was done by God, who imprinted into the heart of each and every one according to His blessed will. In this way God is called, as it were, the translator, meaning that after the Ten Mitzvot went forth from the mouth of Moshe to Israel, the Holy One, blessed be He, went back and imprinted them into the hearts of Israel. This is “the translator will not raise his voice more than the reader,” for truly it was in the power of the Holy One, blessed be He, to carve the words of Torah into their hearts according to His blessed power, much more than Moshe Rabeynu could. However, it is written, “never again would there be a prophet in Israel as great as Moshe,” so God could not shine His light into any soul of Israel more than he did with Moshe Rabeynu. This is, “the translator will not raise his voice more than the reader,” meaning more than the level of Moshe Rabeynu.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For God, “the translator,” would never raise His voice, meaning illuminate His power into, anyone more than He did for Moshe, “the reader.”</i>",
                    "<i>“Anochi Hashem E-loheicha—I am Hashem your God ….”</i> (Shemot, 20:2)<br>The word <i>Ani</i> is not used for “I” (but rather, <i>Anochi</i>). Had it been written “<i>Ani</i>,” the meaning would have been that the Holy One, blessed be He, had revealed His light to Israel in all its completeness, and then they could not have reached deeply into His words, for He would have already revealed everything. However the additional letter <i>Caf</i> in “<i>Anochi</i>,” teaches that it is not in a state of completeness, yet rather a conception of how the light that the Holy One, blessed be He, would be revealed in the future.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Caf</i> added before a word means “like.”</i> The more a man apprehends in the depths of the Torah, the more he will then understand that until now he was in darkness. This is hinted at in the night and the day. “Day” means that God opens the gates of wisdom for man, and “night” means that man should never imagine that has completely apprehended Godliness, for all he has attained is like night in comparison to the day that follows. So it goes on forever, and it follows that all is night in the face of the light that the Holy One, blessed be He, will open in the future.<br>This is why the verse that follows immediately is, “do not make any graven [carved] image,” on which it is said in the Holy Zohar (<i>Shemot</i>, 87b), “since it was first written, ‘carve for yourself [two tablets],’ therefore it says, ‘do not make any carved image,’ meaning do not make another Torah.” The word <i>pesel</i>, “carved image,” means something with a definite form and measurement, in a state of completeness with nothing lacking. This is found only in the Torah of Moshe Rabeynu. However it is impossible for the mortal intellect to fashion anything in complete perfection.<br>On this it is written (Ruth Rabba, 3:2), “Caesar said to Rabi Yehoshua ben Hanina, ‘I too can make a Torah like Moshe,’ and he decreed that no fire be kindled for three days. (As if to say, “God decrees that you do not light fire for one day? I can decree it for three days.”) During this time he saw smoke rising from a house, and they explained to Caesar that a certain government minister was sick and it was necessary to permit him fire.” For indeed, according to our Holy Torah the law is that saving a life supersedes the laws of Shabbat, yet the difference (with us and the example of Caesar) is that one who violates Shabbat to save a life is not going against the Holy Torah, for thus was it also commanded that saving a life takes precedence over the laws of Shabbat. So, too, in all places where it is, “a time to do for God,” (<i>Tehilim</i>, 119:126), fulfilling Gods word, it is also hinted, as the verse continues, “they have made Your law null and void.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A situation that would require the suspension of that law, such as how we suspend the laws of Shabbat in order to save a life.</i> Therefore the Torah includes all the possible combinations of events that may occur, everything and its opposite, and its light surrounds all the possibilities and all the experiences that may evolve. No man has the power to do this. This is the explanation of the Holy Zohar on “do not make any carved form,” meaning positive mitzvot, and “any image,” the prohibitive mitzvot, for nothing is revealed to man until it reaches its completion.",
                    "<i>“I am Adonai your God ….”</i> (Shemot, 20:2)<br>It is written in the Holy Zohar, “and the tree of life is in the secret of five, five.” “<i>Anochi</i>, I am,” is the source of life. “<i>Adonai</i>” is <i>Gevurah</i>—strength, which brings all into being. “<i>E-loheicha</i>, Your God” is the measure of truth in which God runs His world. “Who brought you out of the land of Egypt” means that even at a time of anguish, may God protect us, still refrain from becoming angry at God. “From the house of bondage” means do not become immersed in niceties, and after this the Torah warns not to imagine that what I ask from you is easy, rather you need to struggle to become pure. Each of these five corresponds to one of the next five. “You shall not have” corresponds to “Anochi,” so as not to think that there is even a hue (or appearance) of life aside from Him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Re: “New Age,” or more properly, ancient; idolatry of earth forces.</i> “Other gods,” meaning a hue of <i>Gevurah</i>—strength.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meaning also taking a subordinate force in the world as the prime force.</i> “Before Me” corresponds to “your God,” meaning a hue of truth that is only superficial, and not part of truth at its deepest level.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Before me,” is literally “at my face,” and the word for “superficial” is literally “to the face.”</i> “Do not make any sculpted idol or image” corresponds to “who brought you out of the land of Egypt.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The land of idolatry.</i> “From the house of bondage” corresponds to “which is in the heavens above,” etc.<br>The heavens, the earth, and the seas are the principal forms in the construction of the world, and the world also contains desire and honor. Jealousy is also included in these two, as it is for these that He is jealous, and they are also the five corresponding to five mentioned above. “Do not bow down to them” means do not be subdued by desire and honor. “Do not serve them” means do not desire to rule over them. Existence is divided into three levels—place, time, and soul. Everything discussed thus far has been in the category of place. Corresponding to time, with the festivals during the course of the year, there is also the secret of “five, five.” Pesach is “Anochi—I.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the first redemption God first made himself known to us as a nation.</i> Shevuot is “Hashem.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As was said, this corresponds to <i>Gevurah</i> (strength), and at Mount Sinai it is said that, “Moshe heard from the mouth of Gevurah.”</i> Succot corresponds to “Elo-heicha, your God.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>succa</i> is likened to the clouds of glory that followed us in the desert, an awesome sight to witness that inspires the fear of God, and so too the name “E-lohim” teaches of God’s attribute of judgment that is the root of this fear.</i> Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur correspond to “E-l Kana, a jealous God,” for the name “E-l” teaches of <i>Chochma</i> (wisdom)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rosh HaShanah is the beginning of the year, and he verse in the Psalms reads, “the beginning of wisdom is the fear of God.”</i> and “jealous,” meaning anger, that is to say that His anger is in (the <i>sefirah</i> of) <i>Chochma</i>. In the category of soul, meaning person, there is also the secret of five, namely, “the fathers, the children, the third, the fourth [generations], and the thousandth [generation]” (<i>Shemot</i>, 20:5). Thus, all in the secret of “five, five.” Deep contemplation is required to understand this.",
                    "<i>“I am Hashem your God ….”</i> (Shemot, 20:2)<br>There are five faculties in human existence; gleam (“musing” or “inkling”), thought, will, action, and speech. If a man’s action is a result of these five stages, beginning in the gleam<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word used is <i>hirhur</i>, which is more vague than a thought. It is here understood as a gleam that sprouts from the subconscious, as opposed to a tangible thought.</i> and descending afterwards to thought and will, then he may be sure that this action is God’s will, having sprouted from the source of life. However, if the action came about by a different order, where first the will came to the heart and descended to thought, then this action needs <i>birurum</i> (refinements) as the gleam from the will that conceived it may have been tainted by worldly desires. God gave us the Ten Mitzvot in order to refine these five faculties.<br>The Ten Mitzvot are also divided into five against five, the five positive mitzvot on the right tablet in opposition to the five prohibitions on the left. “<i>Anochi</i>—I am the Lord” corresponds to the gleam, where the knowledge is still murky and he still doesn’t know what to do. This is like someone who has the vague desire to do something. Small children have such gleams that they cannot articulate. Similarly when a person sleeps he has such gleams of thought that cannot be grasped by the intellect.<br>All of this corresponds to the first of the positive mitzvot, “<i>Anochi</i>,” for the Divine utterance “<i>Anochi</i>” includes within it all the positive mitzvot of the Torah and God’s will dwells within them. The five prohibitions were all given in order “to turn from evil” so therefore man must be able to grasp them in his intellect, yet as the five positive mitzvot are the very locality of God, it is not conceivable that he may have any real understanding of them. After that it is said, “you shall not have any other gods,” meaning that you are not to think that there is another Source of Being<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The name of God <i>YHVH</i> has the same letters as “being”—<i>HAVAYE</i> in Hebrew.</i> in the world besides Me, and this corresponds to the faculty of thought. “Do not take God’s name in vain” means not to push aside anything in the world as unnecessary and useless.<br>Everything that God created has a spark of <i>Kedusha</i> (holiness) within it, only it has an internal and an external nature, and you need to know how to separate the good from the bad. This verse also corresponds to thought, for there are two verses, one corresponding to a positive commandment of thought, and another corresponding to a prohibition of thought. “Remember the Shabbat” and “Honor your father” correspond to the faculty of action. “Do not kill” and “do not commit adultery” correspond to will. The reason the mitzvot signifying action precede the mitzvot signifying will is that if one sins in action, God forbid, he will go back and ponder it and find some thought to hold responsible for it, meaning in the very source of his life. So then he must “do <i>teshuva</i>” [return to the way of God] in this regard, sincerely mending his ways and thus healing his roots. He is not to find fault in the will, for others could have entered this will into his mind.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is puzzling for what does it matter if it was his original will to sin or if he was led astray. Yet you might say the fault is theirs and not his. His will was high jacked.</i> “Do not steal” and “do not bear false witness” correspond to speech. This is because the entire need for speech is only in order to communicate with others, as by himself he has no need for speech. <br>The Torah exists in all of the worlds, so above this world “do not steal” means not to prevent the Torah from reaching one’s students (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, 91b). This applies even to angels, as it is said of them, “and they receive permission from one from the other.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the rendering of the Aramaic translation of Yesahya 6:3, “and they called one to another.”</i> There are also different levels among the angels. An angel on a higher level will have greater strength that one on a lower level. Yet the one on the lower level has greater reverence for the power of the one on the higher level, therefore “they receive one from the other.” <br>“Do not bear false witness” is the opposite of “do not steal.” Bearing false witness is to speak too much and therefore these two correspond to the positive and negative mitzvot of the faculty of speech. “Do not covet” corresponds a prohibition in the gleam of thought, and belongs with “<i>Anochi</i>.” Yet if one could achieve a perfect <i>birur</i> (clarification) in this gleam, he would have no need of <i>birur</i> in the other faculties. Therefore the prohibition in the faculty of gleaming could not be written together with “<i>Anochi</i>,” but rather only after thought, will, action, and speech have been refined, then the gleaming would emerge refined. This is why coveting appears at the end of the Ten Mitzvot.",
                    "The verse “Anochi—I am Hashem your God” contains all the letters of the Hebrew alphabet except <i>Gimel”Zayin</i> (“GeZ”), <i>Chet”Tet</i> (“CheT”), and <i>Samech”Peh”Koof</i> (“SaPheK”). “GeZ” (to shear) teaches of the beginning when one first accepts upon himself the yoke of the kingdom of Heaven, such as the convert who, when he comes to observance, must first limit (“shear”) his enjoyment of worldly pleasures and take great care of the details enumerated by the codifiers of the Law.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Like a sheep, he is shorn from all his coarseness and refined into a vessel for Torah and <i>Kedusha</i>.</i> Afterwards comes <i>CheT</i>, which means sin, as he must take care to guard himself and keep the <i>mitzvot</i> without sinning. Following this is <i>SaPheK</i>, meaning uncertainty and fearing what might be hidden in his heart.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This implies stages of a process. First there is renouncing the vanities and pleasures of the world, and adhering to the details of the Divine law. Second, one must guard himself in his adherence from possible sin.

                    "<i>“Remember the day of Shabbat and sanctify it … and the seventh day is Shabbat unto Hashem your God.”</i> (Shemot, 20:8–10)<br>Why is Shabbat mentioned here twice? All of the 613 mitzvot are called “Shabbat,” as it says in the Holy Zohar (<i>Shemot</i>, 88b), “What is Shabbat? A name of the Holy One, blessed be He.” This represents a time when the desire to fulfill God’s will comes to man, to do that which He commands and to refrain from that which He prohibits. Taking this to heart is to, “remember the day of Shabbat [meaning all God has commanded us].” Afterwards, when he forgets, doing something while God’s will is hidden from him, it is said, “six days shall you work … and the seventh day,” etc. Thus, when he has become far from Shabbat and forgets God, Shabbat comes back again and he ponders his behavior. Then a great cry erupts from his heart, saying, “what have I done?” For “a man can only understand the Torah after he has failed to keep it.” (<i>Gittin</i>, 53a). Then God gives him advice with the offerings that bring atonement, so this is why it says directly after, “honor your father and mother.” This means not to blame your own faults on the fact of your birth, deeming yourself clean and exempt from offering sacrifices that will atone for you. This is “honor your father and mother.”",
                    "<i>“You shall not make with Me gods of silver or gods of gold … an altar of earth you shall make for Me … in any place that I mention My name I shall come to you and bless you.”</i> (Shemot, 20:20)<br>“Gods of silver,” meaning an external hue of love and fervor more than is appropriate for your position, for there is no associate with the One in heaven, and God only shows his love for man when the truth is with him. “Gods of gold,” meaning an external hue of fear greater than is befitting your position. Only, “an altar of earth you shall make for Me.” Here, “earth” means simplicity, just as it exists in your heart. In the verse, “In any place that I mention My name,” “I mention” has to do with the notion of <i>birrur </i>(clarification or refinement).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew word for mention, <i>zachar</i>, is similar to the word for pure, <i>zach</i>, hence refinement.</i> In every place that I clarify how your initial thought was for the sake of heaven I will immediately send you the blessing, “and bless you.”",
                    "<i>“You shall not ascend by steps on My altar, in order not to uncover your nakedness on it.”</i> (Shemot, 20:23)<br>All the hearts of Israel are called “My altar,” and this is “do not ascend,” do not pride yourself above anyone of the people Israel. This is as it says, “in order not to uncover your nakedness,” in order not to lead you to shame, for if you pride yourself over anyone else, in the end you will descend and he will take your place. This it says in the Gemara (<i>Megillah</i>, 16b), “of Mordechai who was first numbered fifth, and later sixth.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">After twenty-four years Mordechai descended in rank among the sages.</i>"

                "Mishpatim": [
                    "<i>“And these are the laws that you shall place before them ….”</i> (Shemot, 21:1)<br>Here it is not said, “And God spoke to Moshe saying,” as with all the mitzvot, for the matter here discusses civil legal enactments (“<i>mishpatim</i>”), and concerning justice there is no difference between the great and the small. This may be compared to when the king goes out to inspect and judge his soldiers; then they all stand in the same line, even their senior officer standing in the line. Thus it is written (Yesahya, 56:1), “keep justice, and perform <i>tzedaka</i> [righteousness], for My salvation is close at hand.” “Keep” is an expression of restraint, saying that no soul of Israel should bear greivences against God concerning His attributes (where He is concealed from us). He should refrain from asking why He does not help him to serve Him, especially as this is what He desires, so why does God not help him immediately?<br>Therefore it is said, “keep justice and perform <i>tzedaka</i>,” meaning to cleave to God with righteousness and honesty of heart, and not holding any grudges. This being done, “My salvation is close at hand,” meaning that God will reveal to us the order with which he conducts our lives in the exile. Then He will send consolation, making it clear that none of the longing and suffering that Israel underwent in the service of God was in vain. On this it is said in the holy Zohar (<i>Shemot</i>, 150b), “even a man’s good intention will not be lost,” for with every action man does, even if it seems now to be insignificant, in the future God will expand upon it greatly.<br>In this week’s <i>Parsha</i>, God teaches us how one must clean and refine himself, to the extent that his attribute of goodness is even drawn into his possessions, and then good attributes will be found in them so as not to cause damage to anyone else. Therefore, when a man’s possessions cause damage, he must pay for the damages, for the damage was done because his soul was not refined enough. Thus his possessions could cause damage, or he could steal from another, for if his soul was in a state of true refinement then his possessions could never do damage to another.<br>So it was told in the Gemara (<i>Ta’anit</i>, 25a), “the neighbors of R. Channina ben Dosa complained that his goat was causing them damages. He said, ‘if it is so, then let them be eaten by bears.’ The goats went into the forest, and returned each with a bear on its horns.” Furthermore, it is said in <i>Berachot</i> (16b), “Manservant and maidservants are not addressed as ‘father so-and-so’ or ‘mother so-and-so’ [a title of honor] except for the servants of the house of Rabban Gamliel, who were called so because of their importance.” This means that the power of the <i>Kedusha</i> of Rabban Gamliel extended even to his possessions, and they too were good (his goodness extended into them).",
                    "<i>“… that you shall place before them ….”</i> (Shemot, 21:1)<br>Rashi explains, “before them [Israel] and not before the idolaters, and even if you know that one of their judgments is the same as the judgments of Israel, do not bring it into their courts. One who brings the judgments of Israel before the heathens profanes the name of God, and gives honor to idolatry to praise it, as it is written [<i>Devarim</i>, 32:31], ‘for their Rock is not our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.’ This means, when our enemies are judges it is testimony to the superiority of their idol.” The matter is thus: Every man is cut from the same material, and the form of the limbs and organs is the same for everyone, yet however, the form of the Israelite is recognized and refined among all the nations. This matter defies logic, for if a thousand Gentiles stand with one Israelite among them, the form of the Israelite will be recognized, and this is a wonder in the eyes of all the whole world. This is because, “their Rock is not like our Rock,” even though with the Israelites, all their organs and the forms of their faces are exactly the same as the rest of the world, yet still, all who see them will recognize that this is the seed that God has blessed. “And our enemies themselves being judges” means that it is exactly the same in the realm of justice, for even if their judgments are exactly like those of Israel, nonetheless, if an Israelite goes to their courts he is profaning the name of God, for it has no likeness to the justice of Israel at the depths. On this it is written in the <i>Tehilim</i> (147:19), “He speaks His word to Yaakov, His statutes and judgments to Israel. He does not do this with any nation, and as for His judgments, they have not known them.”",
                    "<i>“And [if a man] did not lie in wait [he did not lie in ambush for him, but killed him unintentionally. Rashi] but E-lohim caused it to come to be, then I will appoint you a place to where he may flee.”</i> (Shemot, 21:13)<br>Rashi explains, “Concerning what does the Torah speak? Of two men, one killed inadvertently, and the other killed intentionally, and there were no witnesses to testify concerning the affair. Therefore the latter was not put to death, and the former was not exiled. The Holy One, blessed be He, brings them to the same inn, and the one who killed intentionally sits under a ladder; while the one who killed inadvertently ascends the ladder, falls, and kills the one who killed intentionally. Witnesses testify to this, and [the court] requires him to be exiled. So in the end, the one who killed inadvertently was exiled, and the one who killed intentionally was killed.” The famous question is, how did the one who inadvertently killed first come to do this? It seems that it may be explained through the verse (<i>Tehilim</i>, 145:14), “God supports all those who fall, and straightens all those who are bent down.” Two things are mentioned in this verse—fallen, and bent down.<br>This means, with one who has anger and evil lusts rooted in his heart, if God forbid he brings his potential into action, it is called “fallen.” If it still has not been brought forth into action, he is called “bent down,” meaning that his heart is bent and enslaved to this evil lust. God is the One whose thoughts are to never banish anything completely. Therefore it says, “but E-lohim caused it to be,” for with the one who killed inadvertently, it is not to say that he has already actually killed; rather that he has a deficiency in his heart, namely anger and desire to murder. With the one who killed intentionally, it means that he has already brought it into action and committed murder.<br>So the Holy One, blessed be He, completes both of them. The one who killed intentionally is killed, and the one who killed inadvertently is exiled. This is, “but E-lohim caused it to be,” meaning that the Holy One, blessed be He, did it for his benefit. All the while that the evil thought had not come into action it would not occur to his heart to repent. Yet now that the Holy One, blessed be He, has brought it about that he actually has killed someone inadvertently, and the one who was killed had anyhow deserved the death penalty, he began to become greatly agitated in his soul, asking himself, “why did it come about that I killed inadvertently? Certainly I must have a root of murder in my heart.” (Questions that he would otherwise not have asked.) By means of this he repents.",
                    "<i>“Six days shall you do your work, and on the seventh day you shall rest ….”</i> (Shemot, 23:12)<br>In <i>Parshat Yitro</i>, when discussion Shabbat, it uses the opposite order; “remember the day of Shabbat to keep it holy,” and then afterwards, “six days shall you work,” etc. We can understand this from the Gemara (<i>Shabbat</i>, 69b), “if one is wandering in the desert, and does not know when the day of Shabbat is, Hiya bar Rav says, he shall keep one day of Shabbat, and then count six. Rav Huna says, he shall first count six days, and then keep one day of Shabbat.”<br>In order to understand these two different approaches, consider the verse (Mishlei, 4:8), “Laud her, and she shall exult you, she shall honor you when you embrace her.” This means, laud something if it strengthens the desires of your heart and your involvement in Torah. For instance, if you have a strong desire to eat and drink and the like, examine it and if, God forbid, it causes you to go against God’s will then refrain from it.<br>Then through this very examination, “and she shall exult you,” then the very words of Torah will raise you over all your lusts. “Honor her when you embrace her,” for “when you embrace her” means that if you increase how much you take counsel in words of Torah each time more; then also, “she shall honor you” greatly in the eyes of all around you. Shabbat represents the acceptance of the yoke of the Torah, and a young Torah scholar who has not yet completed the purification of his heart is called “<i>Hiya bar Rav</i>,” who said to keep one day of Shabbat first. This means that one whose heart is not yet purified should not pray that God give him anything of the good in this world (“counting six days”), but should rather deliver over all his desires to Him (“starting with Shabbat”), and God will be the one who begins and finishes. “<i>Rav Huna</i>” represents an elder Torah scholar, for the name “<i>Huna</i>” is related to “<i>Hon</i>” or wealth; that is to say, he has found wealth in a large following of students, and his heart has been purified, containing no foreign desires.<br>Therefore it says that he shall first count six days, meaning that it is permitted for him to ask God to fulfill all the wishes of his heart, for the six days teach of the power of the actions of man. “Then keep one day of Shabbat” means that God will then complete matters for him, in the sense of (Iyov, 22:28), “you shall decree the matter, and it will be established for you.”",
                    "<i>“You shall bring the first of the first fruits of your land to the house of Hashem your God; you shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk.”</i> (Shemot, 23:19)<br>This commandment teaches of the attribute of restraint, which is called in the Midrash, “valiant ones of power that can hold back their lust,” and it is written (Yeshiyahu, 28:4), “like an early fruit before summer, that as soon one sees it, it is yet swallowed up in his hand.” The Torah teaches to have restraint and not to eat it, but rather to bring it to the <i>Cohen</i>. “You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk” teaches of the opposite of this, of doing something quickly, as it is written in the Gemara (<i>Succa</i>, 14b), “[a <i>succa</i> with a hole in its wall large enough] for a kid to leap into it at once.” The Torah teaches that in a place that requires alacrity, do not hold back. This is, “do not cook,” meaning do nothing to prevent it being done quickly. “Milk” teaches of restraint, for something done with restraint is called constant, for it is always good to act in this way; yet sometimes a man needs to act quickly, as explained on the verse, “a horse ready for the day of war.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is in the <i>Mei HaShiloach</i> on the Book of Hoshea, which says: A settled mind is called constant, and with such a manner it is always good to act. Acting quickly is called <i>mequdash</i>, sanctified, for sometimes quickness of action is a very good quality. It is such when one chooses to run to a matter of Torah even if he does not yet know what he is running to, but still it is very good. On this, Shlomo haMelech said (Mishlei, 21:31), “The horse is ready for the day of battle, and salvation is up to Hashem.” This means that in the end God will save him and show him that his running to understand the truth of the Torah was in good judgment. This was the sin of the prophet Hoshea who said (<i>Pesachim</i>, 87a), “exchange them [Israel] for a different people.” [“The Holy One, blessed be He said to Hoshea, ‘Your children have sinned,’ to which he should have replied, ‘They are Your children, they are the children of Your beloved ones, they are the children of Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov. Show them Your mercy.’ It was not enough that he did not say this, but he said to Him: ‘Master of the Universe! The whole world is yours. Exchange them for a different people. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘What shall I do with this old man [who does not know how to defend his people]? I will order him: ‘Go and marry a whore and raise children of whoredom’; and then I will order him: ‘Send her away from your presence.’ If he will be able to send her away, then I too will send Israel away.’ For it is said, And the Lord said unto Hoshea, ‘Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredom and children of whoredom,’ and it is written, ‘So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Divlaim.’”] Hoshea said this out of the power of a settled mind. Then, after he realized that he had sinned, he said (Hoshea, 14:4), “we will not ride upon horses,” meaning that sometimes a mind that constantly exercises restraint is not always good. Therefore we must only rely upon Hashem and not on our intellect.</i> Then this attribute is much more praiseworthy than the attribute of a settled mind, which is called “constant.” Thus the attribute of quickness of action is called <i>mekudash</i>, “sanctified.” The Gemara discusses this, asking (<i>Zevachim</i>, 90b), “constant or sanctified, which is preferable?” and we find in the Gemara of <i>Berachot</i> (20a) “the <i>Rishonim</i> [early sages] gave over their lives for the sanctification of God’s name,” etc. This means that they acted with the attribute of quickness of action, a highly precious quality in its time. Thus a man must leave the realm of restraint, and because of this attribute (quickness) a miracle will be performed for him.",
                    "<i>“And you shall serve Hashem your God, and He will bless your bread and water, and I will remove all sickness from among you.”</i> (Shemot, 23:25)<br>This verse begins in the plural voice, and ends in the singular. This is understood according to what has already been explained in <i>Parshat Vayeira</i> on the verse, “and now I know that you fear E-lohim,” (page 25) concerning the difference between the fear of Hashem and the fear of E-lohim. The fear of E-lohim concerns a time when one must constrict himself in an area because of his own deficiency, as his heart is not yet refined. The fear of Hashem teaches that one must limit himself because of the entire community of Israel, even though he himself does not have a deficiency in this area.<br>Therefore, “and you shall serve” is voiced in the plural, for you must suffer constriction for the sake of the entire community of Israel. By means of this, “and He will bless your bread and water,” each one in particular. This is what we mean when we say the blessing, “<i>baruch she’amar</i>,” in the morning service, “blessed is He who has mercy on the land,” for the “land” hints at the entire community of Israel,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Land” represents the female, <i>malchut</i>, kingship, as it receives from the heavens above. So, too, <i>malchut</i> represents the entire community of Israel, as we are the bride, receiving from the Holy One, blessed be He.</i> as God first has compassion for the entire community. Only after (as the order in “<i>baruch she’amar</i>” continues), “Blessed is He who has compassion on His creation,” meaning each one of Israel in particular.",
                    "<i>“And God said to Moshe, ascend to Me, to the mountain and I will be there ….”</i> (Shemot, 24:12)<br>“To the mountain” means to the end of the renewal of all levels. A man must first pass through all of the forms of wisdom in the world until he reaches true wisdom. “And I will be <i>there</i>,” teaches of a place of purity and true life, as in (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 21:17), “and they went from <i>there</i> to the well.” (The well always represents the source of true wisdom.) This shows that all of the forms of wisdom were only stations on the journey, while the main point of your place is the end of all the levels, called <i>there</i>.”"

                    "<i>“And God spoke to Moshe saying, take for Me an offering [</i>truma<i>] ….”</i> (Shemot, 25:2)<br>This is as it is written (Yesahya, 45:1), “Thus spoke God … who formed the land … He did not create a desolation for his creations to dwell in…” In <i>Parshat Yitro</i>, when Israel heard the Ten Mitzvot, it was easy for them to fulfill them since these <i>mitzvot</i> depend on the actions of man. Then after, the <i>Parsha</i> of <i>Mishpatim</i> (Judgments) was said to them, and taught that it was God’s will that His <i>Kedusha</i> (holiness) and service (of Him) would spread forth to such an extent that even a man’s possessions could not do anything against the Torah as explained above in <i>Parshat Mishpatim</i> (cf. “and these are the judgments”). From this, a great crying out burst from the hearts of Israel asking how it could be possible to reach such a level of refinement. Therefore God gave them the advice in this <i>Parsha</i>, “take for me an offering [<i>truma</i>], gold, and silver, and copper.”<br>On this it says in the holy Zohar (<i>Shemot</i>, 148a), that these elements correspond to the basic elements found in man, meaning that he should deliver all his elements and potentialities over to God, so that He may manage them according to His blessed will. Then of itself his possessions will also contain goodness and will not suffer or cause any damage. On this it is explained in the Zohar (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 125), “The verse, ‘Fortunate is the man who God does not ascribe to him sin, and has not the spirit of deception,’ (<i>Tehilim</i>, 32:2) means that the spirit of his life does not turn to any side,” but is directed only to God’s will. If a man asks how it is possible to refine his heart to such an extent, on this it is said, “He did not create a desolation for His creations to dwell in,” meaning that God does not want man’s heart to be distraught.<br>This is also the meaning of (Yesahya, 45:19), “I did not say to the seed of Yaakov, seek Me in vain,” so therefore the verse says, “for his creations to dwell in,” meaning that a man should have a settled mind.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To dwell (<i>lashevet</i>) shares a root with settled mind (<i>yishuv hadaat</i>). His mind will be settled in knowing that God would never have given him obligations that are impossible to fulfill, that the world around man is also a product of God’s will and inherent in it is the desire to be used by man in a state of <i>Kedusha</i>.</i> [And the verse in Yesahya continues], “I am God, speaking righteousness, proclaiming fairness [<i>meisharim</i>, also even, right], meaning that even though God desires that man be righteous and clean in all matters, upholding 613 mitzvot, still He is “proclaiming fairness,” meaning with honesty and a willingness of heart towards man. Thus He gives man advice as to how to fulfill all the <i>mitzvot</i> with ease.",
                    "<i>“…. take for Me an offering [</i>teruma<i>] ….”</i> (Shemot, 25:2)<br>It is written in the Midrash Tanchuma (Teruma, 1), “Rabbi Yannai said, it is permitted to eat the <i>teruma</i> offering on the grave of an unlearned <i>Cohen</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Perhaps because he never knew how to separate the <i>teruma</i> from the produce. <i>Eyts Yosef</i>.</i> All the <i>Kedusha</i> (sanctity) of the <i>teruma</i> offering is drawn into the world by way of the <i>Cohanim</i> who eat it in a state of <i>Kedusha</i>. If there were no <i>Cohanim</i> in the world, then the <i>teruma</i> would not possess any <i>Kedusha</i>. Therefore, with regard to an unlearned <i>Cohen</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Who never ate <i>truma</i> in a state of <i>Kedusha</i>.</i> the <i>teruma</i> never had any <i>Kedusha</i> as far as he was concerned. This is the explanation of the Midrash (Ibid.), “take for Me an offering—means take to Me, to My name.” That is, the entire greatness of the <i>Kedusha</i> of <i>teruma</i> is if it is separated for the sake of Heaven.",
                    "<i>“… take for Me an offering [</i>teruma<i>]….”</i> (Shemot, 25:1)<br>We can understand this through the verse (Mishlei, 16:24), “The way of life for the intelligent is above.” This means that principle and foremost is for one to place his heart on the way of life above. That is to say, the life and sustenance that God gives to all men is above, like something placed on high.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is like a precious object placed on a high shelf, either for protection or to sanctify or honor it.</i> So it is with “take for Me an offering,” meaning that Israel should “take” God exalted<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word for exulted shares the same root as the word for an offering, <i>truma</i>. The meaning is clear, that when the first thing to do with any received sustenance is to give the first portion to God; this is exulting God.</i> and first in all matters. This is as it is written in the Gemara <i>of Sanhedrin</i> (102b), “What part of the bread is taken when the blessing <i>hamotsi</i> is recited? From the part that was first baked [the outer crust].”<br>Relate this to the Gemara in <i>Berachot</i> (35a). “One verse says, ‘the earth is Hashem’s and the fullness thereof,’ and another verse says, ‘the land was given to mankind.’ The first verse is before the blessing is recited, and the second verse is after the blessing was recited.” The whole matter of a blessing is for one to be conscious that he has a Master and from Him he receives all effusion of sustenance. If you have such a consciousness then you can say “Blessed art Thou,” in the real presence of God. On this it is said, “and the land was given to mankind.” This is also the question, “on which part of the bread do you say the blessing <i>hamotsi</i>,” meaning, where is the deep recognition in this loaf of bread that God is giving it so you can truly say on it, “Blessed art Thou?” And the answer is, “from the part that was baked first.” There are so many stages in the work of our human hands that goes into making the bread; the kneading, arranging, heating the oven, putting it equally in the oven. But the very place where it starts baking is not a result of the power of mankind. Then when one takes this into his heart, asking why it started baking at this particular place, he sees that it has only come about from God’s will. Thus over this particular part of the bread is it proper to recite the blessing."

                    "<i>“And you will command the children of Israel … take unto yourself pure olive oil ….”</i> (Shemot, 27:20)<br>“Unto yourself,” meaning to the <i>Chochma</i> (wisdom) inherent in every soul of Israel, and all the wisdom of Israel is called in the name of Moshe Rabeynu. To this God commanded that every one of Israel shall take to the wisdom inside of him some pure olive oil, meaning refined wisdom, and that is that he should not turn to any side that might be tainted. Doing this he will understand who God has chosen, and that is why the verse following immediately after is, “bring close Aharon and his sons.”",
                    "<i>“And these are the garments that they shall make, a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe ….”</i> (Shemot, 28:4)<br>In these garments God shows Israel which soul He chooses, for the preciousness of the soul of Aharon haCohen is recognized and understood from the garments (made for him). The <i>Tsits</i> (“headplate”) hints that he is constantly cleaving to God as he is commanded always to wear it on his forehead. Engraved on the <i>tsits</i> were the words <i>Kodesh LeHashem</i>, “Holy unto God,” meaning that the words (Divrei haYamim 1, 28:9), “Know God of your father and serve Him,” were constantly in the depth of his thought. The breastplate (<i>Choshen</i>) hinted that there was no hatred for any soul of Israel in his heart, for the tribes of Israel were engraved on his heart. The <i>ephod</i>, with which he would gird himself, hinted at his trust in God, which always supported him. The robe (<i>Me’il</i>) teaches of his great fear of God, for it was made entirely of <i>t’chellet</i> (sky blue), which hints at fear.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Holy Zohar says, “the blue of the <i>t’chellet</i> hints at the blue of the sky which hints at the Throne of Glory.” Thus it would inspire awe. Also, the Kotsker Rebbe explained the meaning of what Rebbe Nachman said, that looking at the sky is a <i>segula</i> for [way to come to] the fear of God. The Kotsker said, it has to do with Rashi’s explanation of <i>Bereshit</i>, 1:6, “let there be a firmament.” Rashi says that then the firmament became solid, for on the first day it was still in a flexible. It only became solid on the second day at the shout of God, who said, “let there be a firmanment.” This is as it says (Job, 26:11), “the pillars of the Heavens shook,” for they were not firmly fixed on the first day, and then on the second, “they were astonished at His rebuke,” like a man who is shocked and stands still at the shout of one who frighens him.” On this, the Kotsker said that when one looks at the firmament [sky] he can still feel the shout of God that fixed it in its place.</i> Why were the pants and the <i>tsits</i> not mentioned when the garments are enumerated in verse 4? The pants were not mentioned for they were not considered a garment, only serving to cover his nakedness; in other words, to guard from the lusts of this world. The <i>tsits</i> was not mentioned, as it is explained in the Zohar (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 159), “The brilliance [<i>metscha</i>, also “forehead”] of God’s desire is revealed at the <i>Mincha</i> [afternoon] Prayer of Shabbat.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On a weekday, <i>Mincha</i> is a time of an awakening of <i>dinnim</i>, or severe judgment. However, the <i>Mincha</i> prayer on the afternoon of Shabbat is a time of great mercies. Kabbalistically speaking, this is when Zeir Anpin and Leah ascend within Abba and Imma to the level of the rectifications of the beard of Arik Anpin, considered the supreme abode of divine compassion.</i> The <i>tsits</i> was given to Aharon haCohen since he had great fear, for all the tribe of Levi possessed great fear, as it is written (Malachi, 2:5), “I gave him fear,” and all the more so the high priest. Even his very name teaches of fear for “Aharon” is the numerical equivalent of 256, corresponding to the 256 (2 to the eighth power) wings of the angels called <i>chayot hakedoshim</i>, and wings teach of fear.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The sound of the beating of the wings of 256 angels would surely inspire great fear of God.</i><br>Corresponding to this great fear he was given the <i>tsits</i> to vivify and delight his soul, for the <i>tsits</i> teaches of the love that God has for Israel. Then at the time when God reveals His great love, all the fears depart, and Israel experiences great <i>tekifut</i> (great strength without holding back).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew term in many hasidic books is <i>Tekifut</i>, which is more than just strength, but a kind of <i>azut d’Kedusha</i>, a kind of holy brazenness.</i> Therefore before the making of the robe (<i>Me’il</i>) was mentioned it was not possible to mention the making of the <i>tsits</i>, for the great profusion of <i>tekifut</i> could, God forbid, bring forth an irreverent spirit. Therefore after the making of the <i>Me’il</i>, which teaches of fear was mentioned, it was then possible to mention the making of the <i>tsits</i>, as in the words of the Holy Zohar, “at the time of <i>Mincha</i> of Shabbat,” which is after great fear, “the brilliance of His desire is revealed,” meaning <i>tekifut</i>.",
                    "<i>“And these are the garments which they shall make: a breastplate [</i>Choshen<i>]</i>, <i>and an ephod</i>, <i>and a robe [</i>Me’il<i>]</i>, <i>and a broidered coat [</i>C’tonet Tashbets<i>]</i>, <i>and a mitre [</i>Mitsnefet<i>] and a girdle [</i>Avnet<i>] ….”</i> (Shemot, 28:4)<br>Corresponding to the eight priestly garments, the members of the great assembly (in the Second Temple period) codified the eight expressions in the blessing preceding the morning recitation of <i>Shema</i>, “to understand and to discern, to hear, to learn, and to teach, to guard, and to do, and to uphold.” “To understand” corresponds to the girdle [<i>Avnet</i>], for the girdle comes to make atonement for the fancies of the heart (<i>Arachin</i>, 16a), so too, was it worn over the heart and its length was thirty-two cubits.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">32 = <i>lev</i> = “heart.” Apparently it was a long cloth wrapped around the torso.</i> “To discern” corresponds to the breastplate [<i>Choshen</i>], for a man must consider carefully in order to know God, for with Him there is no anger against the souls of Israel [the names of the twelve tribes were engraved on the Choshen], for, “His wrath is for a moment, yet a lifetime in His will [favor]” (<i>Tehilim</i>, 30:6). “To hear” corresponds to the robe (<i>Me’il</i>), meaning that a man must hear and lead his ear to his foundation and root. This is explained (in <i>Shemot</i> Rabba, 40:3) on the verse (in Job), “where were you when I founded the world?” meaning where was your portion in Adam haRishon (when he sinned). Then when a man contemplates his portion in this he will then come to an understanding of what he has already fixed, and what he has yet to repair. This is hinted at in the robe (<i>Me’il</i>), for the Holy Zohar mentions that the <i>Me’il</i> is the secret of reincarnations (coming back until all is fixed, all the <i>mitzvot</i> have been fulfilled).<br>“To learn” corresponds to the mitre (hat, <i>Mitsnefet</i>), for the <i>Mitsnefet</i> makes atonement for coarseness of spirit (<i>Arachin</i>, ibid.), meaning to receive the truth from one who spoke it. “To teach” corresponds to the <i>tsits</i> (headplate), for of the <i>tsits</i> it is said, “and it shall be on his forehead continually that they may be accepted,” meaning that one needs a good eye in order to teach his fellow man. “To guard” corresponds to the embroidered coat (<i>C’tonet</i>), for the <i>C’tonet</i> makes atonement for the spilling of blood (ibid.). It teaches man to guard himself and to see that because of him no damage is done to his fellow man. Then his peers will not be able to suspect him, and then be punished for suspecting him in vain. Then he too will be punished for causing his fellow man to be punished. “To do” teaches of reliance, and the point of reliance is the performance of <i>mitzvot</i>, such that a man can stand in prayer and support himself on them.<br>This is as it is written (<i>Tehilim</i>, 104:3), “who makes the clouds His chariot,” and clouds teaches of the performance of <i>mitzvot</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For one must understand that there is no action in this world that does not have a remnant in the world to come. <i>Tashlum Mei HaShiloach</i>.</i> “To fulfill” corresponds to the priestly pants, whose purpose is to cover his genitalia. This is a place on which a man stands to suffer a loss, as it is written (<i>Bereshit</i>, 42:9), “the nakedness of the land,” meaning the vulnerable place by which the land may be conquered. At every place God created from which a man could build an everlasting structure, there He also created a place of vulnerability where he may lose all. However, by means of guarding himself here, then from this place an everlasting structure will emerge.",

The name Reuven comes from the word for sight (see <i>Bereshit</i>, 29:32), for with all his dealings and words he always sees himself standing in the presence of God, and God then illuminates his eyes. This causes man to experience great joy, as it is written (Mishlei, 15:30), “the heart rejoices at the illumination of the eyes.”<br>Topaz represents the tribe of Shimon, for the tribe of Shimon possesses great depths in Torah knowledge, yet before they can bring them forth into actuality the must undergo refinement. Therefore Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai (the famous figure in the Talmud and author of the Zohar), since he was from the tribe of Shimon, possessed a depth of understanding in Torah knowledge on the level of Moshe Rabeynu. Topaz or <i>Pitdah</i> hints at this, for its first and last letters spell “mouth” and the remaining letters, <i>Tet</i> and <i>Dalet</i>, are the letters just before <i>Yud</i> and <i>Hei</i> in the Hebrew alphabet. <i>Yud Hei</i> teach of the depth of wisdom<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yud Hei</i> are the first two letters in God’s ineffable name, the Tetragrammaton. <i>Yud Hei</i> signifies transmission, while the second two letters <i>Vav Hei</i> imply reception.

This is why the author says that “the depth of understanding in Torah knowledge” are hinted at in these two letters, and all the more so because they are revealed in the word <i>pitdah</i> only in the previous letters, signifiying a greater level of concealment that cannot be brought into a communicable form.</i> that is found in this tribe, yet it cannot bring it forward through speech.<br>Smaragd represents the tribe of Levi, for <i>bareket</i> hints at the fear of God, as it contains the letters of the word for lightning, <i>barak</i>, whose light is revealed suddenly, in a flash. In this the tribe of Levi possesses the refined fear of God, as it is written of them (Malachi, 2:5), “I gave them My covenant for the fear with which he feared me.”<br>“And the second row shall be a carbuncle….” Carbuncle corresponds to the tribe of Yehuda, for it vacillates between all the colors, as all the colors are contained within it. So it is with the tribe of Yehuda, which does not stay fixed in one attribute, but rather when Yehuda is among the perfectly righteous he is perfectly righteous, and when he is among the “<i>ba’alei teshuva</i>,” he is then the greatest penitent. This is as we find in the Gemara (<i>Shabbat</i>, 56a), “all who say, ‘David was a sinner,’ are mistaken,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Which is normally interpreted to mean that Uriah had sent Bat Sheva a bill of divorce before he went to war. However, the deeper meaning that is relevant here is that David was the paramount “<i>ba’al teshuva</i>,” and when one undergoes an authentic experience of <i>teshuva</i>, then all his iniquities are turned into merits.</i> and we also find (<i>Moed Katan</i>, 16b), “He raised an offering of <i>teshuva</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See how this is explained above, page 53, “and Yehuda drew close.”</i> Further proof of this is how at one time he says in the book of <i>Tehilim</i> (86:1–2), “I am poor and destitute,” and then right after he says, “I am a Hasid.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hirch translates “I am a hasid” with “for I dedicate myself.” Soncino comments, “one who loves God and is therefore deserving of God’s love.”</i><br>Sapphire—<i>Sapir</i>—corresponds to the tribe of Yissachar, for the sapphire teaches of clear and refined wisdom, as it says (<i>Shemot</i>, 24:10), “like the paved work of sapphire stone, and the essence of the heavens for <i>clearness</i>.” Of the tribe of Yissachar it is said, (Divrei haYamim 1, 12:32), “and the children of Yissachar were men of understanding for the times,” as they knew how to create leap years and fix the beginning of the months. This is a kind of knowledge that is possessed only by those to whom God has granted refined wisdom.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Chochma m’vureret</i>.</i> This is hinted at in that the 1,080 seconds in an hour is the numerical equivalent of four times <i>E-lohim</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The name <i>E-lohim</i> is written <i>plene</i> by <i>Chochma m’vureret</i>.

The mortal eye sometimes mistakes these attributes for anger, and on this the Torah testifies that he is a vessel dedicated to God. This is found in the name of the place that he was given as an inheritance, as it says (<i>Shoftim</i>, 18:29), “however, the name of the city was at first Layish.” Layish is another word for lion, and teaches of God-given strength and bravery, “as it is written (Mishlei, 30:30), “the lion is mighty among the beasts, and will not return in the face of all adversity.” Yet after this city fell in their inheritance its name was changed to <i>leshem</i>, which teaches that all his power is due to his confidence that God will help him, and this is because he walks in simplicity.<br>This is as it is explained in the Gemara (<i>Pesachim</i>, 4a), “A certain man used to say, ‘Judge my case.’ They said, This proves that he is descended from the tribe of Dan, as it is written, ‘Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.’” This is because he has the <i>tekifut</i> that surely he would be found innocent if judged, for with all the matters of this world, even with the <i>mitzvot</i> and good deeds that a man does, they remain in the balance even after the action is completed. For instance, if a man gives charity to a pauper, and the pauper later goes with this power and performs a mitzvah, then the one who gave the charity is assisting his performance of the mitzvah. If the pauper takes the money and uses it for a transgression, then the one who gave the charity is assisting him in transgressing. So Godly vigor of the tribe of Dan in his confidence in God that because he did the mitzvah in simplicity then God will not cause him to fail because of it. Certainly God brought him an honest pauper who took this power to do a mitzvah.<br>“Agate”—<i>shevo</i>—represents the tribe of Naftali, for <i>shevo</i> is related to the word for “return”—<i>shav</i>. This means that even when he goes to engage in matters of this world, and it seems to the mortal eye that, God forbid, his heart is not with God, then at that moment his heart returns and “gazes” on God. The name of the chief of the tribe of Naftali teaches of this, whose name was Achira ben Einan, for <i>Achira</i> contains the word for “back”—<i>achor</i>—meaning that he always takes the back way (engaging in the matters of this world) and does not look back. “Einan” however, is related to “eye”—<i>ain</i>—meaning that even in this his eyes are constantly looking towards God.<br>“Amethyst”—<i>achlama</i>—corresponds to the tribe of Gad, meaning gathering together, and great <i>tekifut</i> at a time when it is necessary to gather all of Israel together according to God’s will.

For out of the fear of God alone he could not withstand the temptation of the wife of Potiphar, as it is written in the Gemara (<i>Nedarim</i>, 32b), “At the time of the control of the inclination to evil, no one can remember the inclination to good.” This could only be done out of love for God, who at the moment of that trial showed him a vision of the visage of his father Yaakov, and how his very name would be engraved on the stones of the Ephod of the High Priest.<br>“Jasper”—<i>yoshpeh</i>—is for the tribe of Binyamin, meaning that he has a mouth<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">75</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The name of the stone jasper in Hebrew is the letters of “he has a mouth.”</i> [<i>yesh peh</i> in Hebrew] that can swallow and receive all the goodness that exists in the world.

                    "<i>“And you shall make an altar to burn the incense; make it of acacia wood.”</i> (Shemot, 30:1)<br>This week’s Parsha mentions all of the vessels except for the golden incense altar. We can understand this through the Zohar (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 151b), which asks, “what is incense? It is the connection of all.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And how is incense the connection of all things? Besides the similarity in the letters of <i>ketoret</i> and “connection,” <i>Ketirah</i> in Aramaic, Rabbi Yitzhak of Acco writes in his explanation “Meirat Eineihem” that smoke, <i>ashan</i>, is an acronym for <i>olam shana netesh</i>, meaning place, time, and soul, the three main components of existence, as discussed in the <i>Sefer Yetsirah</i>.</i> This hints that everything, even what is done in “his world, is all connected in God’s will, and without His will nothing at all would be done. One who misunderstands this could come to irreverence, God forbid, since everything that happens is permitted from Heaven. Therefore the incense altar, which represents this understanding, was not said in <i>Parshat Truma</i>, but only after the explanations of the priestly garments in this <i>Parsha</i>, which teach of the great fear of God and vigilant guarding from the vain pleasures of this world. As it is written in the Gemara (<i>Arachin</i>, 16a), “the <i>ctonet</i>, or tunic of chequer work, makes atonement for the spilling of blood,” and so it is with all of the garments. By means of his priestly garments, the Cohen sends great fear of God to the heart of each one in Israel. Then after the Cohen has instilled such fear in the heart of Israel, then they have the ability to receive the <i>simcha</i> and love that comes from the power of the incense.",

It is known that the Mishkan and its vessels hint at the upright form of man, and for each limb man has the right to see to his own well-being, as it says in the Gemara (<i>Pesachim</i>, 68b), “in the first place, when a man does something, he is doing it for himself.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Gemara is talking about the mitzvah of the study of Torah, that foremost he is studying for his own benefit, and only after this for the good of the rest of the world.</i> In the future, God will make it clear that the action that he did for himself was only in the sense of “if a person does a mitzvah but not for the sake of Heaven, eventually he will do it for the sake of Heaven.” Eventually he will bring the light out of the darkness, as it is said (Yoel, 4:18), “and a fountain shall come forth from the house of God, and shall water the valley of Shittim [which means acacia wood].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This means that all the vessels made from acacia wood are like actions that may be for selfish motives to gratify different parts of the body now, but will be refined for the sake of Heaven in the future.</i><br>Yet the caporet, which corresponds to the heart, and the menorah, which corresponds to the eyes, with these a man must be especially vigilant that they are clean and refined, not corrupted in any way from his own desire for the pleasures of this world. This is as it is said in the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i>, 1:5), “the eye and the heart are the two agents of sin. The eye sees and the heart lusts.” But indeed the eye must be stripped of all the lusts of this world, and used as a pure vessel for the soul, like a clear glass through which the soul looks at the world and decides whether it is good and to receive it, or whether it is evil and to reject it. Yet, when within the eye itself there is any desire or lust for the pleasures of this world, then the eye is not a vessel for the soul, but rather a free agent, free to lust after the affairs of this world. Then the soul does not have the opportunity to distinguish the good from the evil. Therefore God commanded to be completely refined. The eye shall be clean and stripped of vain lusts, and then it will follow that the soul will only desire that which is God’s will."

                    "<i>“And from it Aharon and his sons shall wash their hands and feet.”</i> (Shemot, 30:19)<br>When the <i>Cohanim</i> washed from the laver (<i>kiyor</i>) in the Holy Temple they did so in order to remove and kind of <i>negia</i> (personal motive, partiality) Washing teaches of this, as we find in the passage of the beheaded heifer (Footnote <i>Devarim</i>, 21:6, the <i>eiglah arufah</i>, where the elders first take general responsibility for the death and then wash their hands, declaiming to God “our hands did not spill this blood), “and the elders of the city shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded.” Here they are saying that they are clean from <i>negia</i> associated with the death and have no portion in it. So too, the Cohen who serves needs to wash, meaning that he removes any <i>negia </i>in his life, nullifying his own mind and will before God’s will. This means that all his service is only what God desires.<br>So it is with how we are commanded to wash in the morning and before a meal, for before one begins to fulfill the needs of the body he needs to pray. If some worldly matter comes upon him and leads him astray, God forbid, he then prays to God to remove any desire he might have not only from a sin, but even from something permitted that might be a mixture of good and its opposite. For if one were to eat in a way that is permitted to him and then go on and use the energy from this to transgress, then it is made clear that he did not receive any goodness from the food. <br>Concerning this we have ritual washing, which is a kind of prayer that we only see goodness from our actions. We pray to God that our behavior is on condition, the condition being that only good comes out of it. It is for this reason that in the morning service our sages included this passage about washing from the laver before we say the daily sacrifices, meaning that we ask that even what we pray for is only what God desires.",
                    "<i>“And Moshe turned and descended from the mountain, and two tablets of the testimony in his hand, written from both sides.”</i> (Shemot, 32:15)<br>It is written in the Gemara (<i>Shabbat</i>, 104a), “R. Chasda says, they were written from both sides for they were read from within and without. That is, ‘<i>navuv</i> [empty], <i>boban</i>,’ ‘<i>rahav</i> [arrogance or rage], <i>behar</i> [on the mountain],’ ‘<i>saru, veras</i>.’” (Footnote: Both Rashi and Tosafot ask why these words used as they don’t appear in the ten mitzvot? The Mei HaShiloah offers an answer.) R. Chasda is saying that the Torah has the power to change the heart of man from one side to the opposite. <i>Navuv</i> means one who is hollow, or empty of Torah, and so by means of them he is filled with understanding, and this is, “<i>navuv, boban</i>” (<i>boban</i> is connected to <i>Binah</i>, or understanding). <i>Rahav</i> means someone who is filled with desires and external lusts, as it is written (Zohar, <i>Shemot</i>, 170b), “the angel of Egypt was called <i>rahav</i>, and Egypt was steeped in perversity,” as it says (Amos, 8:8), “banished and immersed like the Nile of Egypt,” whose waters were brackish, which teaches of evil thoughts of desire. By means of the Torah he can be separated from all lusts, which is the inner meaning of <i>behar</i> (on the mountain), for you do not find moisture on the mountain that is deep in the valley.<br>So too with Avraham Avinu, since he was separated from all lust, thus it was said (at the binding of Yitschak, <i>Bereshit</i>, 22:14), “for it is said to this day, on the mount Hashem was seen.” <i>Saru</i>, meaning anger, for <i>sar</i> is an expression of anger, as it is written Kings 1, 21:4), “and Achav came home ‘<i>sar ve’zaef</i>,’ sullen and angry,” and on this it says in the Gemara (<i>Bava Metsia</i>, 59b), “why does the Torah warn against distressing the convert in forty-eight places? For it may turn him [<i>saro</i>] to evil,” meaning he has anger, and by means of the Torah he may change his heart to the good, and separate himself from any anger, for <i>moras</i>, (<i>veras</i>, the opposite of <i>saru</i>) meaning rubbed or stirred, as the Gemara says, “did they ever stir the blood of the sacrifice before you?” for this occurs in a tender place (the opposite of anger), as it is said (Yechezkel, 46:14), “to stir [<i>laros</i>] the fine flour.”",
                    "<i>“And Moshe said to God, see, you say to me, bring this people up … And God said to Moshe, I will also do as you have spoken, for you have found favor in My sight, and I will know you by name.”</i> (Shemot, 33:12–17)<br>God addressed Moshe’s request by saying that God knows Moshe by name, which means that He created Moshe with good attributes in order to receive the <i>Chein</i>, the Grace of God. <i>Chein</i> itself is a free gift, that God created him with good attributes and owing to this he is in God’s favor (a play on words; to be in favor is also <i>chein</i>). First (for in verse 12 Moshe makes first mention of), “You said, I knew you by name,” that He chose him as he chose all the Patriarchs, even before they performed good deeds. And these attributes that were imprinted in their souls yet remain in us, for the three attributes that crown us (as a people), compassion, modesty, and giving loving-kindness, are not contingent on our good deeds but comes rather from the holiness of our Patriarchs, which they inherited to us.<br>This is why Moshe first said that God knew him by name, and then after, he found favor with Him, whereas when God in His answer to Moshe formulates it in the opposite way, first saying that he has found favor in His eyes, and after saying that He knew him by name. This means that God recognized his attributes, which are a vessel for receiving the Torah. In this way he would at all times desire and long for new words of Torah, and this is how he finds favor with God, meaning that he will always desire and strive for the “free gifts” (the reception of <i>Chein</i>). Towards this He created him with good attributes, as it is written (Daniel, 2:21), “give wisdom to the wise.”<br>This concerns what we find in the Gemara of Binyamin (<i>Yoma</i>, 12a), “Binyamin the <i>Tsaddik</i> was greatly concerned that the Holy of Holies fall in his domain. [For the Temple mount falls both in the portions of Yehuda and Binyamin, yet the Holy of Holies was in the portion of Binyamin, and because of his holy “distress” to take care of the area, the Altar was also allotted in his portion.] For this he was made a host for the Divine presence.” That is to say, since God recognized that if the Holy Temple (the house of the Holy of Holies) would be built in his portion then he would greatly desire that the outside Altar also be in his portion (the “free gift”). For this (desire) he was made its host.",
                    "<i>“And He said, My presence shall go with you, and I shall give you rest.”</i> (Shemot, 33:14)<br>God answered Moshe that at a time that a “garment” goes forth from Him that seems like a face of anger, then Israel shall be at peace. God has garments to He shows His jealousy, and at the time when God is in this attribute then the <i>Tsaddik</i>, who is the pillar of his generation, also takes on this attribute, like Pinchas in his generation or Eliyahu in his generation. This is because the <i>Tsaddik</i> is the garment of God, and then it seems as if he is bringing accusations against Israel, as when Eliyahu said (Melachim 1, 19:10), “for the children of Israel have abandoned Your covenant.” Then when God removes this garment, and conducts the world through His goodness and compassion, then the <i>Tsaddik</i> shows that at the depth of his consciousness he was never angry, God forbid, and then the heart of the <i>Tsaddikim</i> will also be at peace with Israel.",
                    "<i>“And I shall remove My hand, and you shall see my back, but my face shall not be seen.”</i> (Shemot, 33:23)<br>It is said in the Gemara (<i>Berachot</i>, 7a), “this teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, showed Moshe the knot at the back of his head <i>tefillin</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The knot of the head <i>tefillin</i> tied at the base of the skull.</i><i>Tefillin</i> hints at intense closeness and connection, as it is said (<i>Bereshit</i>, 30:8), “the wrestlings of God.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Naftulei</i>—“wrestlings” has the same Hebrew letters as <i>tefillin</i>.</i> This means that we are connected to the Holy One, blessed be He, and no matter what happens to us, we will not separate from Him. In the <i>tefillin</i> of the Master of the Universe it is written, “Who is a nation so great as to have God so close to it?” This means the God praises himself in that Israel is so connected to Him, and also that God is connected to them, even if they sin He will not disengage his love for them. “But My face shall not be seen” means that God showed Moshe all the events that happened in the past and saw clearly what God had built out of each action. This is “You shall see My back.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Back” represents the past; “face” the present.</i> “But my face shall not be seen” means that the Holy One, blessed be He, did not show Moshe what was happening in the present, because all the acceptances of punishment were transmitted through him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And would thus confront irreconcilable differences.</i> Therefore He could not, as it were, show him the present, meaning how God was completely reconciled with Israel in the present.<br>This is as it is said (Midrash Tanchuma, <i>Chukat</i>, 8), “that which was not said [revealed] to Moshe Rabeynu was said to Rabbi Akiva, as it is said [Iyov, 28:10], ‘his eye saw all the preciousness.’” This means that He showed Rabbi Akiva the whole <i>Tefillin</i>, and showed him how God was reconciled with Israel also in the present. This is as it is mentioned in the Gemara (<i>Makkot</i>, 7a), “Rabbi Akiva said, If I had been a member of a Sanhedrin, no one would ever have been sentenced to death.” This is because he saw how the Holy One, blessed be He, was always reconciled with Israel.",
                    "<i>“And he said to Him, if Your presence does not go with me, then do not raise us up from this.”</i> (Shemot, 33:15)<br>Moshe asked God that even while He is still dressed in this garment (see the previous discussion of “and He said, My presence shall go with you”) that even then, if any one of Israel sins, that the sin would not reach the depth of the heart. That even then, the sinner’s mind would not become so weak that he would, God forbid, remove himself from God, of whom he said (<i>Shemot</i>, 15:2), “this is my God,” and of whom he said, “and You have separated both Me and Your people from all the peoples on the face of the earth.” The difference between Israel and the nations is not only based on the performance of <i>mitzvot</i> and good deeds, for they too can perform actions that seem to be good. Yet the difference is, even when one of Israel sins, then the sin will not be like that of the nations.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With the nations the sin reaches the depth of their soul.</i> Rather it will only have effect from the edge and outside, with the depth of the heart remaining connected, even united, with God.<br>This is as it is written in the Gemara (<i>Berachot</i>, 32b) in the verse (Yeshayahu, 49:14), “And Zion said, has Hashem forsaken me? Has Hashem forgotten me? Can a woman forget her suckling child, the child of her womb? These too will be forgotten, but I will not forget you.” “The community of Israel said before God, Master of the Universe! Since there is no forgetfulness before Your Throne of Glory, perhaps you will not forget the sin of the golden calf? God answered, ‘these too will be forgotten.’ The Community of Israel said, ‘perhaps you will forget the day we stood at Mount Sinai?’ God answered, “but I [who said “I—Anochi” at Mount Sinai] will not forget you.’”<br>It may be asked of this, why does God say that he will forget one incident and remember the other? Truly, the sin of the golden calf happened because God wanted to show them the order that He had arranged in His Divine plan for all His attributes for all generations. He showed them that at one time He would conduct the world through one attribute, and at another time through a different one. This way they would not have to pray at each moment for God to show them which mode and which attribute He was now choosing, but rather He gave them all of His attributes at once (<i>Shemot</i>, 34:6–7), and they could proceed on their way ever confident, and since the sin would only reach from the edge and outward it was therefore forgotten. The <i>mitzvot</i>, however, are from the depth of the heart, an eternal memorial. There is a special reason why the passage discussing Shabbat is juxtaposed to the sin of the golden calf. This is because the root of the sin of the golden calf came to them at the very moment that the Holy One, blessed be He, and Moshe Rabeynu were involved in the study of Shabbat.<br>Shabbat hints at the day that is entirely Shabbat (the redemption), and at that time prayer will not be necessary because the Holy One, blessed be He, will make it clear to all the order of His attributes,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And at that time all will know God’s will with clarity.</i> for without His will nothing at all could be done in the world. Down below they felt vibrations that God was preparing to bestow unto them this complete good, and the effect in their actions was the sin of the golden calf. This is because a calf is something that is not yet complete,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is not yet a cow.</i> and one must wait for it to reach its completion. In the same way they wanted to receive the “day that is entirely Shabbat” before its time, for God will only bestow unto us this complete good in the future.",

This is “I will be gracious with whom I will be gracious,” meaning with that which I have been gracious and merciful with him from the beginning is exactly that which I will use to save him for his own good. By means of this one will not arrive at the portion of his fellow, as in the saying of the Midrash on the verse (Kohellet, 3:9), “what does one profit in working in that which he labors?”—“Each artisan is only permitted to dwell with his fellow craftsmen” (Kohellet Rabba, 3:9).",
                    "<i>“And Moshe made haste, and bowed his head to the ground, and worshipped.

Forgive our iniquities and sins and take us as Your inheritance.”</i> (Shemot, 34:8)<br>It is written in the Gemara (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, 111a), “What did Moshe see [that, immediately after receiving the thirteen attributes of mercy he ran and bowed in worship]? He saw the Long Suffering [patient].” Truly, what is the use of God’s attribute of patience if the sin is not erased? Is not the entire length of his life only temporary, and even all the <i>mitzvot</i> and good deeds that he does will not reach the depths, for they have not been done from the source of life? And even the children he fathers will only live out the number of their days, for their source is only in fleeting existence? However, the Holy One, blessed be He, showed him that in the depths He bears no anger towards Israel, and it is only from the edge and outward, for such anger could eradicate them, God forbid.<br>Then the Holy One, blessed be He, showed Moshe that He would also be long-suffering with them, that eternal life would remain within them, and all the <i>mitzvot</i> and good deeds that they did would last forever, and the children that they would have would continue forever. For their <i>mitzvot</i>, good deeds, and progeny were all rooted in the source of life, and would endure forever. Upon seeing this, Moshe then asked, “I pray that Adonai will go in our midst,” for the name “Adonai” necessitates service, meaning, let such service dwell in our hearts that we may perform <i>mitzvot</i> and good deeds that endure forever. This is “pardon our iniquity,” meaning to slowly remove the sin from our heart that only the good will remain. “And take us for Your inheritance,” meaning, take us as an inheritance and then we will be able to serve God with all of our qualities.",

And this is why if you exchange the letters of Pesach through the <i>atbash</i> system<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">89</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Each letter of the Hebrew alphabet is exchanged with its corresponding letter in the opposite order. <i>Aleph</i> with <i>tav, bet</i> with <i>shin</i> (hence, <i>atbash</i>), <i>gimel</i> with <i>reish, dalet</i> with <i>koof</i>, and so forth.</i> you arrive at the initial letters of Tisha B’Av, for in the future all the festivals will be nullified except for Tisha B’Av (which will be transformed into the ultimate festival), which contains all the festivals and is the father of them all. Also, the time of the month of Av that is now the father (first of the months), will also be in the time of the month of Av, and this is the meaning of “the time of the month of Aviv.”",

This is why it says, “all that opens the womb is Mine,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The essence of this explanation is that the word “womb” (<i>rechem</i>) is closely related to the word “compassion” (<i>rachem</i>).</i> every time an opening of compassion is opened it is only from Me, because I am called the Father of Compassion. It is only that you do not understand My intentions. Nevertheless, (as the following verse ends), “none shall appear before Me empty-handed,” meaning you are required to give at least a small gift to a poor man, even if you see that I am not compassionate with him. Even though we find in the Gemara (<i>Shabbat</i>, 151b), “Rabbi Yosef said: We assert that a scholar will not suffer poverty. But we see that he does suffer poverty. Even if he suffers poverty, he does not engage in begging,” yet if he is not a scholar and he must resort to begging, then you are required to give him something small to sustain his life.",

                    "<i>“And Moshe gathered together all the congregation of the children of Israel … six days shall you do your work and the seventh day shall be for you a holy Shabbat … take from yourselves an offering for God ….”</i> (Shemot, 35:1–5)<br>Why does the Torah mention Shabbat just before the work on the Mishkan (Tabernacle)? With the building of the Mishkan, all the hearts of Israel were united without anyone feeling superior to his fellow. At first, everyone possessing a heart of understanding performed his particular work on the Mishkan, and it was shown unto him that he had done wondrous work. Then afterwards, when they saw how all the disparate elements fit perfectly together, every curtain and board, and every element perfectly suited every other one as if it was the work of one man, they thus understood that all that they had done was only a product of their intellect out of the assistance of God to every one who contributed to the Mishkan, producing afterwards the perfection of the structure. So how then could one feel superior over another when all that was done was only with the help of God?<br>Similarly we find in the Gemara <i>Megillah</i> (9a), “It happened with Ptolemy [king of Egypt, 285–246 <small>BCE</small>], that he brought together seventy-two sages of Israel, and asked them all separately, ‘translate the Torah of your teacher Moshe.’ They all answered in exactly the same way [without consulting with each other, ‘E-lohim created in the beginning’],” each one in his heart intended towards the deepest of wisdom. Then when they saw that they were all of the same opinion then they understood that it came about through the assistance of God. This is why the Torah mentions Shabbat immediately before the work of the Mishkan, for the principle of their union was from the mitzvah of Shabbat, for Shabbat is included in all the <i>mitzvot</i> when one has the intention that they are for the sake of Heaven. This intention is called Shabbat. So too, with the work on the Mishkan, all their work was intended for the glory of Heaven in order that the <i>Shechina</i> (Divine presence) would have a dwelling place in Israel. For this reason they united together, for if so much as a nail were missing the <i>Shechina</i> would not rest in the Mishkan. Therefore no one could in any way feel superior to another, even the one who made the ark to the one the tent-spikes of the courtyard, for, as it says in the Gemara (<i>Sotah</i>, 40a), “what does it matter, both this and this serve to exult the Highest.” This is “and Moshe gathered together all the congregation of the children of Israel.”",
                    "<i>“…. see! God called in the name of Betzalel ….”</i> (Shemot, 36:30)<br>It is said in the Midrash (Sochar Tov, 21), “He gave majesty [<i>hod</i>] to Moshe and splendor [<i>hadar</i>] to Yehoshua.” <i>Hadar</i> is splendor or adornment, an action that brings honor (<i>tiferet</i>, also beauty and balance) to the one who does it, where his action arouses grace (<i>chein</i>) in the eyes of all, and all praise his action for it is clear to all that it was done with the intention for the sake of Heaven. <i>Hod</i>, or majesty, is an action that brings honor (beauty) “from the man himself,” that the one who does the action receives no praise from those who see it, for on the surface it seems to go against reason, only “bringing beauty from the man himself” for the (spiritual) form of man who descends into the awesome depths of the action itself. Yet on its surface it bears no beauty or honor.<br>This is “He gave majesty [<i>hod</i>] to Moshe,” that only at their depths were his actions for the sake of Heaven, yet on the surface they brought him no honor, as it is written (Midrash Tanchuma, <i>Vayaqhel</i>, 3), “they were murmuring against Moshe because he always appointed his relatives to high positions,” like the accusations of the followers of Korach that he was not commanded to do this by the mouth of God, where in truth there was no room to suspect him in this, God forbid, for all this had come from the side of God.<br>So too here, appointing Betzalel for the work on the Mishkan (Tabernacle) was from the mouth of God, for God gave Betzalel more wisdom and understanding than all the others who were working on the Mishkan. And this is, “see [plural]! God called in the name of Betzalel,” for God did not tell only Moshe, “see [singular]! I called in the name of Betzalel,” yet Moshe Rabeynu wanted to “clear his name,” so therefore he said, “see! If you will look with a good eye then you will see that it is God’s will that Betzalel is the principal one involved in the work on the Mishkan.” If you compare the curtain that Betzalel made to a curtain made by others you will see that this one has more grace and balance than all the others, even if the two curtains are fashioned in the same way (but there is something inside this one that the other lacks). This is certainly proof that God’s will is in him more than the all the rest, and this is “see,” a term denoting understanding, that from this you will understand that God has chosen Betzalel.<br>This matter also concerned Moshe Rabeynu, that even though he did not have a clear and revealed splendor (<i>hadar</i>), nonetheless, whoever looked at him with a good eye would see the majesty (<i>hod</i>), clearly noticing his awesome depths. This is the matter of the <i>Masvei</i>, the cover for his face (to cover the <i>keren or</i>, the beams of light that emerged from his forehead after he descended with the second tablets of the Law, light that was too much to bear for the unworthy), which is the numerical equivalent of <i>HAVA”YEI Elo-heicha</i> (Hashem Your God), for the <i>mem</i> and <i>hei</i> of <i>Masvei</i> equals the expansion of the Tetragrammaton equaling 45 (YHV”H may be spelled out—<i>Yud Vav Dalet, Hei Aleph, Vav Alef Vav, Hei Alef</i>; all together equaling 45), and the <i>Samech</i> and <i>Vav</i> (the last two letters) of <i>Mahsvei</i>, equals <i>Elo-heicha</i> (your God). The name <i>HAVA”YEI</i> teaches of majesty (<i>hod</i>), and <i>Elo-heicha</i> teaches of splendor (<i>hadar</i>), that even though the splendor was not seen explicitly in Moshe, just the same, both splendor and majesty were included within him, and who would look at him with a good eye would see that all his actions were done for the sake of Heaven.",
                    "<i>“… the people bring much more than is enough for the service of the work ….”</i> (Shemot, 36:5)<br>The great praise bestowed on Israel for mentioning their donations to the materials for the Mishkan so many times, and what is unique about this, must be understood, for who would refrain from giving all his wealth for the <i>mitzvot</i> of God, and in particular when it concerned the building of the Mishkan? In truth, man does not know the root of his heart—if he is truly giving. The test of this is, if one is asked one time to donate for a new mitzvah, then he can give abundantly, but after he has grown accustomed to this mitzvah he then closes his hand from giving. From this it is understood that he is not giving from his roots, for if it came out of his roots he would not refrain from giving. Here, with the Mishkan, God wanted only true donations from the center point of the root of their hearts, because it is in its essence an everlasting structure, and thus the <i>Kedusha</i> (holiness) of the donations also had to be enduring. So in the eyes of all of Israel it was made as if they were accustomed to it and it was not as a new thing, and still, time after time they gave from the center point of the root of their hearts, showing that their giving was refined. This is “the people bring much more than is enough,” meaning that they gave every time, so therefore the Torah praises their giving."

This is the meaning of the verse, “These are the accounts of the Mishkan, the Tabernacle of Testimony,” meaning the prominence of the Mishkan was that it was a Mishkan of Testimony. Testimony is something that is made quite clear, meaning that by means of the Mishkan it was made clear to the eyes of all the nations that the Holy One, blessed be He, rules, and exists in this lowly world. Who made this prominence? The verse states explicitly, “which was counted by the mouth of Moshe,” meaning that Moshe Rabeynu brought this prominence from the heavens to the earth in this world.",
                    "<i>“And he erected the courtyard around the Mishkan ….”</i> (Shemot, 40:33)<br>With the establishment of all the vessels of the Mishkan it is said, “as God commanded Moshe,” yet with the establishment of the courtyard this is not said. For the whole matter of “as God commanded Moshe,” was to say that the matter was as clear and explicit to Moshe at the time each vessel was established in its function as it was when God first spoke of it. This is as it is written (Torat <i>Cohanim, Tsav</i>, 1), “everywhere it is said, ‘<i>tsav</i>,’ ‘commanded,’ it means requiring alacrity when it was commanded and for all generations,” and for this reason it is said individually for each vessel, “as God commanded.” It is written (<i>Bamidbar</i> Rabba, 1:3), “before the Mishkan was erected the whole desert was suitable for speaking with God, and after the Mishkan was erected the desert was no longer suitable.”<br>Therefore after the courtyard was raised, and the erection of the Mishkan was completed in its perfection, it was no longer possible to say here, “as God commanded,” for “as God commanded” is said when the word is as clear and prominent as at the time when it was originally commanded from the mouth of God. This could not be so with the erection of the courtyard, for now the desert was not suitable for reception of the Divine word (only within the Mishkan itself), as now the Divine word was not explicit (in the desert). Therefore in the courtyard it is not said, “as God commanded.”"

                "Vayikra": [
                    "<i>“And He called [</i>Vayikra<i>] to Moshe ….”</i> (Vayikra, 1:1)<br>It is written in the Midrash (Tanchuma, <i>Vayikra</i>, 1), “How many times does the Torah warn concerning respect for the convert? Forty-eight times, corresponding to the forty-eight times ‘wellspring’ is written in the Torah.” Connected to this, it is written in the Gemara (<i>Rosh Hashana</i>, 21b), “Fifty gates to understanding were created in the world, and all were given to Moshe Rabeynu minus one.” Thus we find that Moshe Rabeynu had forty-nine gates, and all the rest of Israel forty-eight, as it is not in their ability to reach the level of Moshe Rabeynu, for “never will a prophet like Moshe arise again,” so therefore they can only attain the forty-eighth gate. Corresponding to this, “wellspring” is written in the Torah forty-eight times, for a wellspring represents the desire and will for words of Torah, and by means of the desire and longing of a man for words of Torah he may acquire all of the forty-eight gates.<br>Through this we can understand the intention of forty-eight warnings in the Torah to respect the convert. The convert came to bring himself close under the wings of the <i>Shechina</i> (Divine Presence) because of the great desire within him. For in the root of his life he is not cleaving to God, as cleaving to God at the source of life is a state of being only for those born of the seed of the Patriarchs. (It is solely from his great desire that brings him to a state of cleaving to God.) Corresponding to this there were forty-eight boards in the Mishkan (Tabernacle), and also concerning this it says in the holy Zohar (<i>Bereshit</i>, 125a), “each day forty-eight drops drip.” This is the meaning of the verse, “and He called [<i>Vayikra</i>] out to Moshe,” for calling out is the desire and longing of the heart. Since the Holy One, blessed be He, put “crying out” and longing in the heart of Moshe more than in all the rest of Israel, he therefore merited the forty-ninth gate.",
                    "<i>“And He called to Moshe.”</i> (Vayikra, 1:1)<br>It is written (Yesahya, 65:24), “And it will be, that before they shall call, and I will answer, they have not yet spoken, and I will hear.” Since God answers, what is the need of speaking and asking? Calling implies desire and expectation, and He said, “before they call I will answer.” Thus before even the desire to speak comes to the heart of one who longs for God, God answers him and burns out of his heart all lusts and all desires for worldly things, thereby making room in his heart to expect and long for God’s will. After this preparation, he can then receive in his heart the desire and expectation for things other than God. And then, “they have not yet spoken and I will hear.” It was just like this when the Mishkan was completed, and it was written, “and Moshe could not enter the tent of Meeting.”<br>Moshe thought to himself that until now the way God dealt with Israel was through the Torah, and in this he was the chosen one to receive the Torah and teach it to Israel. But now God created a new opening in His relationship with Israel, and in this way Aharon the Cohen was the chosen one. Though Moshe Rabeynu truly had a good eye upon Aharon, still he greatly desired the word of God, and would sit expectantly waiting to hear it. This is, “And He <i>called</i> to Moshe from the tent of Meeting.” Since Moshe had no desire for anything (except the word of God), and his name teaches of this, for Moshe means to take out, “for he was taken out of the water,” water representing desire; therefore God chose him first for Torah knowledge to be given from him. This is “before they shall <i>call</i>, I will answer.” Then afterwards when he longed for God to transmit that the laws of the sacrifices through him, this is “before they have even spoken, and I will hear.”",
                    "<i>“… and God spoke to him ….”</i> (Vayikra, 1:1)<br>God was telling him that though it is true that the performance of the Divine service for Aharon in particular, the transmission of God’s word and mitzvot are only for him. We can understand this from how the word <i>Vayikra</i> is written in the Torah scroll with a small <i>aleph</i>, which shows how the direct reception of God’s word went to Moshe Rabeynu, and thus he would not be jealous of Aharon, for his only intention would be to hear the Divine speech. This is as it is said (Iyov, 14:15), “You will call and I will answer You, you will have a desire for the work of your hands.” “You will call” means you have chosen me and given me yearning. “And I will answer You” means that then I am responsible for the materialization of your word in order to be drawn after Your will. “You will have a desire for the work of your hands,” means that since you (Moshe) have a desire for the completion of the work of your hands, therefore I (God) will ask you to do so.<br>The explanation of, “and it will be that before they will call and I will answer them, even before they speak I will hear them,” (Yeshiyahu, 65:24, see previous selection) has to do with two ways in which God may answer prayer, and both of them are not good. The first is explained in the Gemara (<i>Ta’anit</i>, 25b), where one is immediately answered even before he wants to pray, as is explained there. The second is only being answered after much pleading.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For a complete explanation of this, see the first selection in <i>Parshat Shlach L’cha.</i></i> Therefore first it is said, “before they call I will answer them,” and only after, “even before they speak,” for then I will hear with complete desire. This is as it is said in the Gemara (ibid.), “they said, ‘let the wind blow,’ and the wind blew. They said, ‘let the rain fall,’ and the rain fell.”",
                    "<i>“Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, a man who offers of you a sacrifice to Hashem—of the cattle, of the heard, of the flock you shall you offer your sacrifice.”</i> (Vayikra, 1:2)<br>The verse is not formulated “a man of you who offers a sacrifice” but “a man who offers of you.” This is in order to teach that when one offers a sacrifice to God, he should not do it with the desire for elevation to be higher than his fellow. Rather he should enter himself into the state of being equal with all of Israel.",
                    "<i>“… you shall offer your sacrifice.”</i> (Vayikra, 1:2)<br>“You shall offer,” that every one of Israel who truly discourses in the Torah for the sake of Heaven will merit a wise son or sagacious student. This is also the meaning of the verse (Malachi, 3:16), “then those who fear God will speak, one to his friend, and God will listen, and hear (understand), and write a book of memory before Him, for those who fear God and contemplate His name.” The “book of memory” of the Holy One, blessed be He, is when the word is engraved in the heart of Israel. This occurs when one truly cares enough for his friends that he also wants to effuse to them the good he has merited from God. This is “then those who fear God will speak, one to his friend, and God will listen, and hear [or understand],” to turn and fulfill His will with all he has been given from the Holy One, blessed be He, in order to engrave it within the hearts of Israel.",
                    "<i>“Each of your Mincha [meal] offerings you shall season with salt, you shall not cease the salt of the covenant with your God from your Mincha offerings, you shall salt all your sacrifices.”</i> (Vayikra, 2:13)<br>This is the opposite of good, for it will not foster expansion and growth of good, as a salted land does not produce. Yet it is something that can be combined with good, and that can add meaning to good (as salt adds flavor to food). In this way, the Hebrew word for a ship’s pilot, <i>malach</i> (sailor), is the same word for mixed, <i>memulach</i>, as he “mixes” the water in the act of steering the ship. (See the verses of the incense, <i>Shemot</i> 30:35, where Rashi explains, <i>memulach</i>, salted, as meaning mixed.) Concerning this it says, “each of your Mincha [meal] offerings you shall season with salt,” meaning that a man must deeply connect himself to God and not separate himself through anything of this world, but rather refine his connection as much as possible with good understanding and consciousness.<br>This concerns the actions of Amatsiya king of Yehuda, who, after slaying 10,000 Edomites in battle, and then driving 10,000 Edomite captives over a cliff, went and served the idols of Edom. Afterwards he sent a message to Yoash, king of Israel, saying, “let us see each other face to face” (Divrei haYamim 2, 25:17). Edom is the foremost of the <i>klipot</i> (forces of evil), greater in stature than that of all the other nations. This is mentioned in the Gemara of <i>Avoda Zara</i> (2b), where it describes how when God calls all the nations before Him, raising a Torah scroll and proclaiming, “let all the nations that occupied themselves in this come forward,” then Edom will come directly after Israel because of its importance. Right after this <i>klipa</i>, Israel begins. At present, Israel is not permitted to rule over them, but only in the future, as will be explained in its place. Amatsiya’s killing 20,000 Edomites signifies the ten levels in this <i>klipah</i>, one above the other. Twenty thousand hints at this, meaning ten levels from below to above, and above to below. Amatsiya thought that since he had vanquished them so strongly that surely with every subsequent action he would not remove his heart from God, and no evil force would have the strength to overpower him, as it will be in the future.<br>Therefore he experimented with serving Gods of Edom and sent to Yoash, king of Israel, “let us see each other face to face.” In this he was saying, “even though I have done something that seems evil, nonetheless I am still more deeply connected to God than you are.” Since this was not God’s will, he was punished and Yoash king of Israel captured him. And yet, it says there (verse 25), that Amatsiya lived fifteen years after the death of Yoash, which hints that in the fifteen levels existing within Israel Amatsiya was greater than Yoash, and his sin was only according to the border of man’s understanding. For those who understand the matters of the Kingdom of the House of David, know that all the kings of Yehuda are greatly beloved by God, and all their actions cannot be understood according to their surface meaning. One who understands Yeshayahu (7:3), “And God said to Yeshayahu, please go out towards Ahaz,” sees that “please” is a polite form of request, as with a father who had done evil to his son and estranged him, the father will try to appease him.<br>This is as Achaz said (Yeshayahu, 7:12), “and Achaz said, I will not ask nor will I tempt God,” like a son trying to free himself from sin before his father. Also with Menashe, who was born with a sense of the fear of God so overwhelming that the mortal mind cannot stand it, and so all the kings had great fear, though it was not in a state where it could be controlled. His entire sin was because he wanted to remove from himself this state of the fear of God, and in every instance the fear of God only became more clear to him. The exception is David haMelech, who was born with the attribute of love, and this was the primary attribute for which he was recognized, as is known."

These both hint that one who is clean regarding anger and lust may come close to God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It must be remembered that the word for sacrifice, <i>karban</i>, has the same root in Hebrew as <i>karov</i>—“close.” One comes close to God through the sacrifices.</i>",

That is to say, what for them is their crown, the <i>Cohen</i> does before every time he performs the service. Yet it says, “and he shall place them,” of which our sages explained (<i>Pesachim</i>, 28a), gently, “so as not to scatter them, but that they shall be hidden in their place.” This means not to deride this attribute, as our sages said (<i>Berachot</i>, 33b), “is the fear of Heaven a small thing?”",
                    "<i>“Speak to the children of Israel and say, he that offers the sacrifice of his peace offering unto God shall bring his sacrifice to God out of the sacrifice of his peace offerings. His hands shall bring the fire offerings of God, he will bring the fat with the breast, the breast to wave as a wave offering before God.”</i> (Vayikra, 7:29–30)<br>All of the sacrifices are set according to prayers, which is the service of the heart. Indeed, with all of the (other) sacrifices, “he shall bring his sacrifice … <i>his</i> hands shall bring” is not said, since those who bring the sacrifices do not have a portion in them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Those who bring the sacrifices do not eat them afterwards; this was the privilege of the <i>Cohanim.</i></i> With an <i>olah</i>, or ascent offering, even the <i>Cohanim</i> cannot partake of them (as they are burned on the altar in their entirety). With all of the sacrifices and the prayers brought close before God, before they are offered the one bringing them must first remove all <i>negiot</i> (personal motive, partiality),  from his side, and concerning this it is said that he shall bring “the fire offerings of God,” meaning to no other than God alone. That is why in this <i>Parsha</i>, which teaches of the eating of sacrifices, the verses mention “fire” several times, for fire teaches of the great fear of God, as it consumes everything. This <i>Parsha</i> is the garment in this world for the River Dinor in the world of <i>Atsulut</i> (emanation).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Daniel, 7:10, “a fiery stream [<i>nahar di nur</i>] issued and came forth …”</i><br>Therefore before each prayer for any kind of good one could ask from God, one must precede it with the complete acceptance of the yoke of the kingdom of Heaven. This is precisely why we recite the <i>Shema</i> before praying the <i>Amida.</i> The recitation of the <i>Shema</i> hints at the removal of <i>negiot</i> (personal motive, partiality), from the side of man,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Parshat Chukat</i>, in the selection “and Israel camped at Ovot,” for more from the author on the “removal of affliction.”</i> for the <i>Shema</i> hints that man exists only by God’s will alone. This is as Shlomo haMelech said (Melachim 1, 8:39), “[Man] whose heart You know,” meaning that if this good that you ask for is really for the glory of God, in order to do the will of your Owner, then He will hear you. However, if the good you request contains within it something that would prevent you from serving God, then He will not listen to you.<br>This is from God’s point of view, but man may go ahead and pray, as long as he first accepts upon himself the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven, as mentioned, for truly God desires to improve and not to cast away any prayer of Israel to irrecoverable exile. This notion refers to the rest of the forms of sacrifice, but the <i>Shlamim</i> peace-offering sacrifice teaches that man prays to God that He may allow him to taste of the good that is hidden for him in the world to come. This is because he wants to see his place, to see to whom he is greater in comparison, for he desires a state of spiritual elevation. On this it is said, “he shall bring his offering … his hands shall bring [the fire offerings of God].” This means to deliver over all his requests and prayers to God, and not plead with brazenness, for from this it could happen that he could become indebted to his fellow man. At present he seems to be on a similar level as his fellow, and afterwards he is elevated above him. Yet truly, in the future all of Israel will set in a place as one, and each one will show how he is in some way elevated above the rest of Israel. Nonetheless, each one is “burned by the canopy of his fellow.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This phrase is taken from a highly relevant passage in the Gemara (<i>Baba Batra</i>, 75a), which reads:<br>Rabbah in the name of Rav Yochanan said further: The Holy One, blessed be He, will make seven canopies for every <i>Tsaddik;</i> for it is said, “And the Hashem will create over the whole dwelling of Mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a cloud of smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a canopy” (Yeshayahu, 4:5). This teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, will make for everyone a canopy corresponding to his status. Why is smoke required in a canopy? Rav Chanina said: Because whoever is envious of the scholars in this world will have his eyes filled with smoke in the world to come. Why is fire required in a canopy? Rav Chanina said: This teaches that each one will be burned because of his jealousy at the superior canopy of his friend. Alas, for such shame! Alas, for such reproach!</i><br>This is as it is in this world, where there are many forms of wisdom, and one shows superiority in this kind, and another in that kind. Each one’s elevation is not equal, but rather according to the value of that in which he shows superiority. And in the future, even though it will all be in the realm of the Torah, still, great matters will be found where one’s kind of elevation is not at all similar to his fellow’s. This is taught through how it is formulated, “his hands shall bring,” meaning with two hands. If a man wants to taste from the good that is reserved for him in the world to come, and asks God to show him his place, then he must be clean. Then if God shows him that he is smaller in stature than someone whom it seemed to him that he was greater than in this world (if he is clean), it will not distress him. But if he does not pray over this matter in this world, it could be that he is greater than his fellow all the while in this world, and in the future he will not be at all distressed that he is now greater than his fellow. This too is a favor of God, who arranged that in this world he should become greater than his fellow. But, if he should want to make certain of this, it could be that he makes certain that he is smaller than his fellow, and it could be that he sinks lower than his fellow.<br>Thus if he wants to make certain, he may still ask (for elevation) and it will not distress him, since he wanted to know it clearly, as we find with Mordechai (<i>Megillah</i>, 16b), “For at first Mordechai was counted next after four, but afterwards next after five.” (At first it is written [Ezra, 2:2], Who came with Zerubabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordechai, Bilshan, and later it is written [Nechemya, 7:7], Who came with Zerubabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordechai, Bilshan.) This is “and his hands shall bring,” for it is with two hands, right and left. Right, for it could be that he is elevated. Left, for it could be that he is brought low by means of this prayer. And if a man agrees that he wants to make certain, even if he makes certain that he is smaller in stature, it will not trouble him, and he will subdue himself before his fellow who is greater than him. He will be put at ease by knowing clearly where his place is. Then he can bring the slaughter of his <i>Shlamim</i> peace offerings. This is “his hands shall bring”—towards this end. Understand this."

He who sees what will be born in the future.” On the one hand, we are told (<i>Devarim</i>, 18:13), “be honest [simple] with Hashem your God,” which means not to be overly clever (becoming involved in predictions of the future). Yet still, we are to fulfill the advice of “seeing what is born in the future.” One does this by looking into the very action he is doing, deeply investigating and contemplating whether this action is refined to the extent that it will endure for all time, even in the world to come. The matter of the incense offering<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The sons of Aharon each offered a censer full of incense but lit it from “outside fire,” and as R. Shlomo Carlebach once explained, they were trying to bring the Messiah, by making the outside fire like the inside fire.</i> is as is said in the holy Zohar (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 151b), “what is incense [<i>ketoret</i>]? It is the connection [<i>ketira</i>] of everything.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Perhaps because the smoke from the incense rises up to connect heaven and earth, or because the ten <i>sefirot</i> and the surrounding light out of which all is formed are hinted at in the eleven spices in the incense. Furthermore, as mentioned elsewhere, Rabbi Yitzhak of Acco writes in his explanation <i>Meirat Eineihem</i>, that smoke, <i>ashan</i>, is an acronym for: <i>olam, shana, nefesh</i>, meaning place, time, and soul, the three main components of existence, as discussed in the <i>Sefer Yetsirah.</i></i><br>This means that God is involved in all the actions that are done from the creation of the world until its end, and without His will nothing could be done. The incense teaches of this, as it taught in the <i>Mei HaShiloach</i> in <i>Parshat Tetsave</i> (v. “and he made”). For truly, the closer a man brings himself to God, the more he merits the light of God without its garments, which are the borders and fences that protect the Divine Law. The light itself is completely refined, with no fences or prohibitions, and there it is made totally clear that all the actions of man are wholly given over to God. This is the matter of the incense, which is a secret of the Torah and forbidden to delve into with guile. With the four sages who entered the garden (<i>Chagiga</i>, 14b, the mystic plane of Divine secrets uncovered) only Rabbi Akiva left in peace (one died, one stricken with madness, one abandoned the Torah).<br>This is why it says of Nadav and Avihu (<i>Vayikra</i>, 16:1), “who came close before God and died,” for they would bring themselves close to God, looking into the hidden depths, and wanted to stand on the refined, undressed truth of God’s conduct. This is why the cantillation marking on the word “not” [<i>lo</i>] in the verse, “which He commanded them not” (<i>Vayikra</i>, 10:1) is a <i>mercha c’foola.</i><br>This shows how their hearts burned with such an intense love of God that they gave over their very lives, for <i>mercha</i> is related to <i>rach</i>, or soft, that their hearts became weak; and <i>cfoola</i>, or <i>cfool</i>, meaning double, or an increase of good that God did not command. Since they were young, they were not included together with Moshe and Aharon, as it is said in the holy Zohar (<i>Shemot</i>, 37b), “they did not take their [Moshe and Aharon’s] advice.”<br>What advice did they disregard? One opinion in the Gemara tells us that “they were drunk from wine,” claiming that they came to this state of intense closeness and became, God forbid, irreverent. Thus their intention was to remove all borders, as is explained, and here we have (the other advice that they disregarded in) the Midrash, which says that they entered missing some of the priestly garments. The missing garment was the <i>me’il</i>, the coat (made entirely of <i>t’chellet</i>, sky-blue wool, teaching of the intense fear of God, see <i>Mei HaShiloach Parshat Tetsave</i>) (<i>Vayikra</i> Rabba, 20:6). Even though the <i>me’il</i> is only for the high priest, they brought themselves to a place where they needed to wear the <i>me’il</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meaning that anyone who merits to enter into a height of the secrets of the Torah as they did, must be as the Cohen Gadol, the high priest, and be enwrapped in the intense fear of God.</i> and understand.",
                    "<i>“And for the goat of the sin offering Moshe diligently inquired ….”</i> (Vayikra, 10:16)<br>(“Diligently inquired,” Rashi explains. “Two inquiries. Why was this one burned, and why were these not eaten?”) Why did he make two inquiries? This matter is hinted at in the Gemara (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, 106b), “concerning Doag and Achitophel who learned three hundred laws in the castle floating in the air hinted at in the ‘roof’ of the letter <i>lamed.”</i> (The letter <i>lamed</i> reaches higher than the other letters of the alphabet, and thus its roof is called a “castle floating in the air.”) The letter <i>lamed</i> teaches of a settled mind, and an understanding of the order in all the prohibitive mitzvot along with the uncertainties that arise from all these prohibitions. It also teaches of a settled mind in that it graphically represents the last turn in the swallowing of food from the palate into the esophagus and the body, as if to show the understanding of the proper place for the food to go. This is as Aharon answered him (<i>Zevachim</i>, 101a), “Perhaps you have heard of the special sacrifices of the hour, and have not heard of the regular sacrifices for all generations.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Nehemiah explains it in this way: ‘Wherefore have ye not eaten’ etc? (<i>Vayikra</i>, 10:17). ‘Perhaps,’ said Moshe to Aharon, ‘its blood entered the innermost sanctuary?’ [and therefore should have been burned]. ‘The blood was not brought into the sanctuary’, he answered. ‘Perhaps it was taken outside of the boundary [taken outside of the Temple, and therefore should have been burned]?’ he suggested. ‘It was in the sanctuary’, he replied. ‘And perhaps you offered it in a state of mourning, and thus disqualified it?’ ‘Moshe’, he answered, ‘did my sons offer it? I offered it.’ Then he exclaimed, ‘Behold, the blood of it was not brought within, and it was in the sanctuary, then you should certainly have eaten it, as I commanded, that they should eat it in a state of mourning.’ He said to him: ‘And there have befallen me such things as these, and if I had eaten the sin-offering today, would it have been pleasing in the sight of the Hashem (<i>Vayikra</i>, 10)? Perhaps you heard it in this way only about sacrifices of the hour (special sacrifices)? For if [you would apply it] to the [regular] sacrifices for all generations, [you may argue] <i>a minori</i> from tithe, which is of lesser holiness. For if the Torah said of the tithe, which is of a lesser holiness, “I have not eaten thereof in my mourning,” how much the more does it apply to sacrifices, which are more holy?’ When Moshe heard that, it pleased him. He admitted his mistake and Moshe was not ashamed to say, ‘I had not heard it’, but said, ‘I heard it and forgot.’</i> This is as it says, “and Moshe diligently inquired,” and he answered Moshe, “even if you have inquired all that you need to, still you are not to be lenient with the sacrifices for all generations.” This is why this passage follows the incident of the death of the sons of Aharon, for he saw that his sons were punished for wanting to look into hidden and future matters. From this we learn the stringency of the sacrifices for all generations, and how greatly beloved they are by God. Therefore they are not to be eaten. After the great tragedy they had undergone with the death of Nadav and Avihu, they merited greater boundaries to separate themselves with the following mitzvot of forbidden foods.",
                    "<i>“And Moshe heard, and it was well in his eyes.”</i> (Vayikra, 10:20)<br>Afterwards Moshe understood the matter, for Aharon had done well in not eating the goat offering of the new moon. Yet still, it was a wonder to Moshe how Aharon knew to make such a judgment. Is it not so that after all of the inquiries he should have eaten it, as it is written (<i>Vayikra</i>, 10:18), “you shall surely eat it in the holy place as I have commanded,” until Aharon answered him with the matter of the death of Nadav and Avihu. This subject contains great depths, for the goat offering of the new moon hints at bringing atonement for reduction in size of the moon.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The first dispute was between the sun and moon, who were originally both great lights, equal in size. The moon asserted “two kings cannot wear the same crown,” so God told the moon, “go and reduce yourself.” This is, as it were, the introduction of dispute in the world.</i> The first goat of the new moon was burned, for Aharon did not want to eat it, and from here Moshe understood until now. The matter is very deep.",
                    "The outward signs of pure birds. It is written in the Gemara (<i>Chullin</i>, 65a), “[These are the signs of a pure bird.] It does not seize its prey, it has a crop, a gizzard that can be peeled, and an extra toe.” These four signs are hinted at in the soul of man. “Seizing its prey” is explained by the Gemara as a bird that eats its prey immediately once it is captured, and does not wait until its prey dies. This teaches of anger. The second explanation of “seizing its prey” is that it clutches its prey with its claws while it eats, which teaches of a lack of trust in God, for it fears that the good that was given to it will be taken away. So, too, man must be clean in these two matters, not to become angry, and to trust in God. “An extra toe” teaches of a settled mind. By means of its toe it pushes its attention away from that which has become habitual,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Regel</i> in Hebrew means both “habitual” (<i>hergel</i>) and “foot.”</i> hinting at the ability to contain itself when it wants to fulfill its own will, lest it finds itself comfortably settling into old habits. “A crop” teaches of being filled with words of Torah, for after it has eaten its fill it places the remainder inside its crop, as a reminder to benefit from it afterwards. This is as it is written in the Gemara (<i>Berachot</i>, 28a), “When Rabbi Zeira was exhausted from his study of the Torah, he would go and sit in front of the door of Rabbi Natan bar Tovi, for when the sages would exit, he would stand in their honor. In this way he did not sit idle even for a moment.” “A gizzard that can be peeled” means not to let the power in the food spread into the body and cause any deviation, God forbid, from God. This also hints that the preciousness of the Torah scholar is concealed, for there is no comparison between the preciousness of his study in this world and the supreme preciousness of its light in the world to come.",
                    "<i>“Yet these you may eat of every flying creeping that goes on four [legs], which has legs above their feet, and uses them to leap on the earth.”</i> (Vayikra, 11:21)<br>This is similar to the matter discussed in the Gemara (<i>Berachot</i>, 33a), “Great is knowledge, since it is placed between two names of God [“For a God of knowledge is God,” Shmuel 1, 2:3]. Great is the Sanctuary [Mikdash], since it is placed between two names [“You have made, O God, the Sanctuary, O God,” <i>Shemot</i>, 15:17]. In refutation to this, one said, if so, you could also say, great is vengeance, since it is placed between two names [“God of Vengeance is God,” <i>Tehilim</i>, 94:1].” Meaning, the heavens corresponds to knowledge, and the Sanctuary (Mikdash) is that which is constantly surrounded by God’s will. This is “placed between two names of God.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meaning, if God’s name surrounds it, then it is always good.</i> Yet it is not so with vengeance, for vengeance is not always good. One must calculate the proper time, place, and person regarding the vengeance, for it must be set in accordance with God’s will, for it is not always proper in God’s view.<br>We find this in the incident with Pinchas and Zimri. Pinchas had to consider his intentions carefully (and in a split second). Even though the law says “zealots may harm them,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A zealot may harm one found having intercourse with an Aramite, as Pinchas did.</i> this was one of the ten miracles performed for Pinchas at that time, for if Zimri had separated and risen up to kill Pinchas, he would not have been punished (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, 82a), as is explained. This is the inner meaning of “that has legs above its feet, and uses them to jump,” meaning that a man must have the power in the aspect of vengeance at times, where he must intend the exact moment that is God’s will. Then he must have the ability to immediately “leap” and jump from this mode of behavior, where afterwards no remnant of anger and hatred will be left in his heart. Understand.",
                    "Signs of Pure Animals. “Whatever has parted hooves, is cloven footed, and chews the cud, of these you may eat” (<i>Vayikra</i>, 11:2). “Chews the cud” means one who does not snatch the good from God, and is always willing to return it. Even if he has already received it he is ready to return it, and he only receives it in a pleasant way. “That has parted hooves” means that his hands do not jump to seize that which God has allotted him, and this comes out of his great trust in God. “That has parted hooves” hints at this, as it is written (<i>Tehilim</i>, 18:37), “You have enlarged my steps under me,” meaning that he stands in a wide space.",
                    "Of the Camel it is written, “since it chews the cud but is not cloven-footed,” in the present tense. With the badger it is written, “and it will not split its foot,” in the future tense. And with the rabbit it is written, “it has not split its foot,” in the past tense. The camel teaches of quickness (rather, undue haste). This is what is said in the Gemara (<i>Shabbat</i>, 104a), “for what reason is the face of the letter <i>gimmel</i>—<span dir=\"rtl\">ג</span>?—turned towards the letter that follows it, <i>dalet</i>—<span dir=\"rtl\">ד</span> For it is the nature of those who do acts of kindness (“<i>gomlei chassidim</i>—the same letters as <i>gimel</i>, and the same letters for camel, <i>gamal</i>) to run after the the poor (poor, <i>dal</i> is the same letters as <i>dalet</i>).” When the kindness goes to a place that it is not warranted it is a result of undue haste, and also finds no favor in the surrounding creation. Therefore of the camel (<i>gamal</i>, the same as <i>gomlei chassadim</i>, those who do kindness, and the letter <i>gimel</i>), the nature of its hoof is expressed in the present tense, for immediately at the time of the action one sees that it is not proper. This is the nature of the letter <i>gimel</i>—for when it is spelled with a <i>yud</i> [<i>gimel yud mem lamed</i>] it means acts of kindness—<i>gemilut chassadim</i>—and when it is not spelled with a <i>yud</i> it teaches of undue haste, called <i>gamal</i>, the camel.<br>The badger teaches of a quality that appears to others as humility and a settled mind, yet truly it is behavior that God did not choose (meaning it is not genuine). This is discussed above in <i>Parshat Beshalach</i> on the verse (<i>Shemot</i>, 16:20), “and some of them left it [the manna] until morning, and it bred worms, and became loathsome.” That is, they fancied themselves as being humble in leaving it over, on the chance that the next day God would not consider them worthy to have given them manna, and then on the morrow they would still have some. This is defunct humility, which God did not choose, for one should not view himself as being the least important, and in this they took themselves out of the community of Israel, where all of Israel is worthy, and only they are not. This would first appear to be an expression of the good qualities of a settled mind and humility. At the time of the action (of their deeming themselves unworthy) it would find favor in the view of their surrounding community. However, in God view it is not proper, and of this it is said (<i>Shemot</i> 16:20), “and it bred worms and became loathsome,” for worm teaches of the quality of humility, as David haMelech said (<i>Tehilim</i>, 22:7), “and I am a worm.” However, the humility of David haMelech was favorable in God’s view, yet of them, it is written, “and it became loathsome.” Thus the sign of impurity for the badger is written in the future tense, for even though such an action appears favorable (appears to come from true humility and a settled mind) at the time of the action, it will later become clear that it was not a good attribute.<br>The rabbit teaches of brazenness. Even though he sees within himself that there is no root of life, nevertheless he wants things to go according to his will. This is brazenness towards Heaven. This is explained concerning the evil Bilaam, for even though the Holy One, blessed be He, told him not to go, nonetheless he was obstinate, and this is proof that there is a deficiency at the root (and thus, in the past). This is why the rabbit’s sign of impurity is mentioned in the past tense."

                    "<i>“A woman who conceives and gives birth to a man-child ….”</i> (Vayikra, 12:2)<br>It is said in the Midrash (<i>Vayikra</i> Rabba, 14:2), “I will raise my consciousness from far away, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker” (Job, 36:3). Rabbi Natan says (interprets this), ‘we think on the name of Avraham, who came from afar.’” We have written (in the blessing before the morning recitation of <i>Shema</i>), “Maker of new things,” “Who in His goodness renews continually the work of creation.” The question can be simply put; what new experience is there if He constantly renews the creation each day? Then the renewal will also become expected, commonplace, and what renewal do we experience? Yet here God takes the commonplace nature of constant renewal, and makes it ever new and fresh in our minds. We experience the renewal at every moment, and a feeling of wonderment comes to the heart of all who long for Him in everything, and on everything we ask, “who created these?” (v Yesahya, 40:26).<br>This is just as Avraham Avinu did. The world had been active for some years before Avraham Avinu arrived, yet there was no one to ask or wonder at the nature of its workings. But for Avraham Avinu it was a great wonder (<i>Bereshit</i> Rabba, 39:1), and he asked, “for could you say there is a city without a master? Who is the master of the city?” The Holy One, blessed be He saw that his question was not like a natural scientist or astronomer, but as one who truly wanted to know who had created all of these in order to serve Him. God saw how out of this longing to know he even despised the ephemeral delights of the world. Seeing this, God found it necessary to reveal Himself to Avraham, and to show him that He, may He be blessed, is the master of the city. On this it says, “a woman who conceives,” for in the supernal worlds to term, “born of woman,” denotes a lower level of creation. We find this in the Gemara (<i>Shabbat</i>, 88b, when Moshe ascended to Heaven to receive the Torah, and the angels asked), “what is one born of woman doing among is?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For we are all born of woman, a relatively low level in one respect in relation to the higher powers, “what is man that you shall be mindful of him?” in <i>Tehilim</i> 8:5, but our appreciation of the Creator and His creation makes us beloved in His eyes.</i> So it is said, “a woman who conceives,” meaning one who has true desire, with strength and vigor, for God. “And gives birth to a man-child,” for the giving birth to a male symbolizes the truest form of salvation, as all the good qualities of the world are included in the soul of the Israelite man.<br>This is the meaning of the Midrash, “we think on the name of Avraham Avinu,” meaning that Avraham himself realized that there is One in charge of the world, and we too can recognize this if we concentrate our minds on Avraham and contemplate his path. This is because the awakening experienced in the heart of Avraham will cause great wonderment in the eyes of all who understand why he caused such a stir and storm in his heart in order to know who created the world and its fullness. How many thousands of souls preceded Avraham and it did not occur to one of them to ask this.<br>So from this very awakening itself one may understand that there is a Creator and Master, for the desire that came to the heart of Avraham Avinu was only what God had sent to his heart. If this awakening had been a kind of natural phenomenon then why did it not awaken in the whole world? This is why the Midrash says, “we think on the name of Avraham Avinu,” because “name” signifies will (desire). In a practical sense we find that some people are called on the name of their actions and artistry, since all their will and desire is included in the action that they are doing. Also, the numerical value of <i>sh’mo</i>, “his name,” is the same as that of <i>ratson</i>, “will” or “desire” (both equal 356). This is “I will draw my consciousness from afar,” from the name of Avraham Avinu, “and to my Maker I will ascribe righteousness [recognizing Him as the Artisan of all creation based on the initial awakening from Avraham].”",
                    "<i>“A woman who conceives and gives birth to a man-child ….”</i> (Vayikra, 12:2)<br>“Will I break [bring to birth] and not complete the birth, says Hashem, and If I have completed the birth, have I then shut the womb, said your God” (Yesahya, 66:9). First this is voiced in the future, “will I bring to birth [break], and not complete,” and afterwards it is voiced in the past, “have I shut the womb?” At first, when one begins to bring himself close to God, then God hides His light from him in order to refine his desire. This continues until he breaks his heart and recognizes his deficiencies. By means of this he merits God’s revelation of the Torah more and more according to his desire, until the Holy One, blessed be He, gives him at his full capacity. This is the meaning of the phrase “will I break.” At the beginning of the process of his coming close I have broken his heart with the concealment of the Divine Countenance, in order to intensify his cry for Godliness and refine him so he can merit salvation. “And shall not complete the birth” is expressed in the future. At this point the heart of man does not yet believe that he will be born and merit salvation, because of the power of the concealment of Godliness. Then, after he has merited salvation in great abundance, he realizes that God was with him from the beginning until the end. This is “if I have completed the birth,” past tense, “have shut the womb.” He then realizes that there was no real Concealment of Godliness. He then understands that also at the beginning when he had this great cry of the spirit, this too originated from the power of God, who had built for him this entire salvation by means of the concealment. This is as it is written in Divrei haYamim (1, 28:9), “If you seek it, you shall find.” For if man has merited that God should find him (or reveal His light to him) certainly it is not by chance, but rather coming to this level of salvation was prepared for him from the very moment he was created (or the beginning of all creation). Nonetheless, from the side of man, he has choice, as it is written, “if you [choose to] seek it,” and this is a great wonder. This is also the wonder of this <i>Parsha</i>, “a woman who conceives and gives birth to a man-child,” for one cannot refine this depth. It is impossible that the alacrity of your desire will give birth to the salvation that seems as if it is by chance, and dependent on your choice. In fact, the true salvation was actually prepared this way by God from the beginning of creation. This is “and gives birth to a man-child,” meaning salvation that has been arranged from the beginning of creation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The connection between “male” (<i>zachar</i>) and “memory” (<i>zecher</i>) is apparent here, a male child symbolizing the memory of the initial preparation of salvation that comes to fruition after the process in serving God described above.</i>",
                    "<i>“A woman who conceives and gives birth to a man-child, she shall be unclean for seven days ….”</i> (Vayikra, 12:2)<br>We can understand the reason for this impurity with a parable. One comes with a request before a king, and writes his request on a crumpled scrap of paper. Even though he requested properly, and deserved what he had requested, and also the king answered him favorably, nonetheless, the king commands that he be imprisoned because he wrote his request on such a scrap of paper. Thus it is with a man’s prayer before God. At first it springs from physical events in this world, which was in a state of greatly constricted understanding and consciousness. By means of constricting himself in his reception of the benefits and delights of this world, the resulting response from God is to grant him everlasting life.<br>This is the explanation of “a woman who conceives” for prayer is signified by the term “conception.” When one sows a seed it seems as if he has lost what he has, yet he expects that later he will gain much more from the little he had set aside to sow. So too, “and gave birth to a man-child,” that by means of his prayer he merits that God gives him salvation, which is everlasting life without end. “She shall be unclean for seven days” means that his prayer came through the vehicle of the physical events of this world, similar to the parable mentioned above.",
                    "<i>“When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, or a scab ….”</i> (Vayikra, 13:2)<br>It is written in the holy Zohar (<i>Vayikra</i>, 48a), “there are many terms for man, and <i>adam</i> is above them all.” The term for man, <i>ish</i>, is in relation to the term for woman, <i>isha. Isha</i> means that she does not have the power to subdue the desire of her heart. <i>Ish</i> means that when he experiences longings and desires, he can overpower them. However, the term for man, <i>adam</i>, means a state of elevation above all lusts and desires, that no lust or desire will enter his heart save that which is God’s will. The term <i>adam</i> is used here in the passage discussing the procedure for treating biblical leprosy, for leprosy teaches of one who has a deficiency concerning anger. Such is the attribute (deficiency) most prevalent among great men, since they derive no satisfaction from the good of this world, and the good that is prepared for them in the world to come is hidden from them in this world. The advice given to deal with this problem is to strengthen oneself in looking at the rest of the world with a good eye (judging it favorably).<br>There are three sublevels in this attribute. The first wants the Holy One, blessed be He, to effuse His goodness to the whole world in general and to all of Israel. The second level is in a case where when his fellow also receives good; then the good he himself receives is limited; and still he looks on him with a good eye. The third level is when the effusion of God is only to his community, and he himself receives no portion in the good, and still he is happy that God effused goodness to others. This is the meaning of the verse (Mishlei, 22:9), “he who sees with a good eye shall be blessed,” for he is blessed with a good eye. Even though he has no portion in the effusion, still he is content that God effuses to his fellow, and his fellow receives good according to his desire."

                    "<i>“This shall be the law of the leper [</i>torat hametsora<i>] ….”</i> (Vayikra, 14:2)<br>It is written (Yirmiyah, 15:19), “If you take forth the precious from the vile, then you shall be as my mouth …” The formulation “you shall be as My mouth” hints at words of Torah, as it is written (Divrei haYamim 1, 16:12), “the judgments of His mouth” or (Mishlei 2:6) “out of His mouth comes knowledge and understanding.” This is “if you bring forth the precious from the vile,” for if one clarifies the deficiency within him, to bring out of it something precious, then “you will be as My mouth,” for that which comes forth from his mouth will be filled with words of Torah.<br>This is hinted at in the verse “this shall be the law of the leper [<i>torat hametsora</i>].” “This” hints at as one would say “this” itself (singling out the deficiency), which at first seemed as if it has no connection to the Torah; “this” itself will afterwards be clarified that it came from the Torah. This is because the source of leprosy is from the sin of <i>lashon hara</i> (not guarding one’s speaking evil of another), on account of the inability of a man to stop his breath, and consequently he says too much.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Isbitser says precisely “stop,” which is <i>ma’atsor</i> in Hebrew, comprised of the same letters as <i>metsora</i>, leprosy.</i> The rectification of this on the day of his purification does not come about in a natural way, for according to nature it would have been necessary to stop his breath and limit his speech. On this it says, “this shall be,” meaning in this specific way and not according to nature. Rather, he should take care that the very power of speech that was previously used to say things that were not connected to Torah will now be used to its full power to speak words of Torah and the goodness of discourse in the Divine Law.<br>This is, “and he shall be brought unto the <i>Cohen</i>,” that by means of Divine service the power of his speech will be transformed to speak words of Torah. This can be understood through of the Midrash (<i>Vayikra</i> Rabba, 16:2), with “the tale of a certain merchant [<i>rochel</i>] who would go from town to town and say, ‘who wants the drug of life? Who wants the drug of life?’ When Rabbi Yannai heard him he answered, ‘I want the drug of life!’ whereupon he [apparently the merchant] took out a book of <i>Tehilim</i> and showed him the verse, ‘who is the man who desires life … guard your tongue from evil …’”<br>The question is, what new insight into Torah did this merchant have that merited Rabbi Yannai’s praising him, and why did the Midrash specifically call the merchant by the term <i>rochel</i> (meaning also <i>rechilut</i>, tale bearing, or gossip)?<br>It seems that this man has the particular deficiency in his power of speech and in anger. Then after, when he saw that he could not mix in with society because of his deficiency, he then managed to come upon his lack, complete it, and then transformed this particular power into words of Torah. Then he would pass from town to town with a greatly benevolent eye in order to enter into all he would meet and thus clarify this verse for them. For indeed the power of speech that had initially caused him harm, stemmed from the root of anger within him, as it is written (Mishlei, 21:23), “guard your mouth and tongue, guard your soul from strife.” So afterwards he would run with a good eye and proclaim this verse, “Guard your tongue from evil!” Therefore he is called a <i>rochel</i>, for this particular verse was revealed to him the lack that prevented him from mixing in with society.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He took his very handicap of spreading gossip, and used its power to spread Torah.</i> Thus he saw that there is no room for this attribute even in our everyday dealings in the ways of the world, so therefore he is called a <i>rochel</i>, merchant, related to <i>rechilut</i>, gossip.",
                    "<i>“Speak unto the children of Israel and say to them, each man who has a running issue out of his flesh, this issue renders him impure.”</i> (Vayikra, 15:2)<br>Why, regarding this skin affliction, does the Torah preface it by saying, “speak unto the children of Israel,” where it does not say this before any of the other bodily impurities of which the Torah commands? It is written in the Midrash (Tanchuma, <i>Ta’azria</i>, 9), “evil shall not dwell [<i>yagorcha</i>] with you, means that evil shall not draw you along [<i>goreret</i>].” The afflictions discussed teach of a deficiency in the very essence of Jewish existence, God forbid. This began in the previous <i>Parsha, Ta’azria</i>, where it says, “a man who has in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or a bright spot.” Our sages said (<i>Shevuot</i>, 6b), “a scab is a derivative of both a rising and a bright spot.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Different forms of leprosy would create diferent levels of impurity. Here a scab would have been a secondary or derivative level of impurity.</i> This is a sign to include a rising with its derivatives, and a bright spot with its derivatives. After the leper has undergone two weeks of confinement, it is written, “the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is a scab,” because the rising and the bright spot are the primary transmitters of the impurity, and as such are completely separated from the very essence of Jewish existence.<br>This is “evil shall not draw you along,” for the very name “Israel” teaches of cleaving to God, as Yisrael can be divided into <i>yashar El</i>, or “straight ahead, God.” On the other hand, these primary transmitters of the impurity have no connection whatsoever to the name Israel or to intense cleaving to God. The scab, as it is secondary in connection to the primary transmitters of impurity, and it is judged according to its spreading, and it does not spread, then of it is said, “it is a scab, it is pure.” In other words, one understands from this that it is not connected to impurity at its root, only secondary and temporary. “And he shall wash his clothes, and be clean” (<i>Vayikra</i>, 13:6). This is as it is written in the Gemara (<i>Yevamot</i>, 47b), “Converts are as difficult to Israel as a scab.” Even though the convert has come to cover himself in the wings of the <i>Shechina</i>, nonetheless he needs to undergo great <i></i>clarifications regarding derivation from connections to impurity.<br>This is all related to the matter of afflictions, for the very <i>negia</i> serves to clarify from which root sprouts the deficiency in man, if the leprosy is in his head, or in the walls of his house, and the whole matter is exceedingly deep. For the affliction of the house teaches of how in the future God will cause the evil inclination to pass from the hearts of Israel. (See the verse in Yirmiya, 4:19 where the same word for wall, <i>kir</i>, is used for the chambers of the heart, <i>kirot libi.</i>)<br>The next section (in <i>Parshat Metsora</i>) discusses the impurity of one who has a running issue, and it is prefaced by saying, “speak unto the children of Israel.” (Which is, as was said at the outside, unique in all of the discussions of bodily impurity.) This is because this kind of impurity teaches of the upright of heart, whose actions are very precious, yet within them there is a slight mistake.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This matter is explained in the <i>Mei HaShiloach</i> on the book of Melachim 1, Ch. 22 concerning Rechavoam. There it says, “Then King Rechavoam sent Adoram, who was over the forced labor; and all Israel stoned him with stones, and he died. Therefore King Rechavoam exerted to mount his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. The matter is discussed in the Gemara (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, 48b), ‘Rechavoam had an issue [signaled in that he had to exert himself to mount his chariot]. This shows that his sin, for “issue” means rushing and preceding the proper time, even though afterwards the kingdom would be his. And thus, in the future the kingdom of the house of David will spread over all of Israel, yet here, with Rechavoam, he preceded his time, in exerting to mount his chariot.”</i> In truth, sovereigntry is proper only for the seed of the house of David, yet Rechavoam to seize it with strength before his time. At that time, it was God’s will temporarily to give the kingdom to Yeravoam, and because Rechavoam exerted himself in this (to seize the kingdom) he was punished with an issue. An issue is in itself something good, but it must be at its proper time, meaning to fulfill the commandent of “be fruitful and multiply.” His sin was only in forcing the hour prior to its time. This matter is hinted at in the forty-nine words from “and when he shall be pure” (<i>Vayikra</i>, 15:13), until “[he shall make an atonement before God] for his discharge” (<i>Vayikra</i>, 15:13). For there are forty-nine gates of <i>Kedusha</i> in the forty-nine days of the counting of the Omer between Pesach and Shevuot.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A time when we as a nation undergo spiritual purification in order to be united as a bride with her groom, with God on Shevuot.</i> Each of the days of the Omer corresponds to one of the forty-nine words in these three verses.",
                    "<i>“[This shall be the law of the leper on the day that he is purified] and brought to the</i> Cohen.” (Vayikra, 14:2)<br>It is written in the holy Zohar (<i>Vayikra</i>, 49b), “this is as it is said (<i>Shemot</i>, 27:7), ‘And the poles shall be put into the rings.’ ” (The same word above means “brought” and here means “put.”) The <i>Cohen</i> represents the fear of God, and the service of God. This is as it is written (Malachi, 2:5), “and I shall place dread upon him and he shall fear Me.” What this really means is that the <i>Cohen</i> has a confident mind in knowing that everything he does, small or great, is God’s will. This is a point that exists in every one of Israel, yet it is not always apparent, only at times when one is engaged in the service of God or His mitzvot at which time he is called a <i>Cohen</i> (priest).<br>This is the meaning of Rashi’s explanation on the verse (<i>Bereshit</i>, 49:28), “these are the twelve tribes of Israel.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Which could also be understood as “all of the tribes were twelve,” meaning he included all of them in the blessing.</i> This means that each of the tribes included all of the others. This is why the holy Zohar explains, “this is as it is said [<i>Shemot</i>, 27:7], ‘And the poles shall be put into the rings.’” That at the moment he is coming to the <i>Cohen</i>, then he himself shall bring out the quality of the <i>Cohen</i> inside himself, meaning the service and the fear.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As in the verse in question, where anyone of Israel who is afflicted and comes to the <i>Cohen</i> uses the word <i>huvah</i> (brought) a term that is only found elsewhere in the Torah with regard to the service of the <i>Cohen.</i></i> Then he should limit himself as much as is necessary when he begins to heal. This is because there is a deficiency at the root of his life, and the main point is to heal the source.",

This is as it is written in the holy Zohar (<i>Bereshit</i>, 122a), “for there is a field that is on the level of [<i>Devarim</i>, 20:19], ‘a man is a tree of the field,’ and there is is a field which is on the level of [<i>Devarim</i>, 27:27], ‘as the scent of a field which God has blessed.’” Understand this."

Concerning this, He warned Aharon not to imagine in his soul that he had the power to save himself from their fate. Rather, he needed to guard himself more than them, to be extremely vigilant of this, and know that he must always look towards divine assistance. “Yet thus shall Aharon go” (next verse) teaches that Aharon should go before God in the same way that Nadav and Avihu did, with <i>Kedusha</i>, purity, and great trepidation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shmira</i> or self-guarding.</i> However, in addition to how they went, God advised him to go with, “a bull for atonement.”",
                    "<i>“Thus shall Aharon go ….”</i> (Vayikra, 16:3)<br>It is written in the Midrash (<i>Bamidbar</i> Rabba, <i>Acharei Mot</i>, 21), “If you have made bundles of sins, make bundles of <i>mitzvot</i> corresponding to them. If you have been jealous [“high eyes,” meaning looking at what someone else has with jealousy], than place <i>totafot</i> [<i>tefillin</i>] between your eyes…” It would seem that the mitzvah corresponding to jealousy (“high eyes”) would be <i>tsitsit</i>, of which it is written, “and you shall see them.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And the word <i>tsitsit</i> is itself connected to the word for looking, <i>tsits.</i></i> However, we have the following saying from our sages. “At the time of the <i>yetser hara</i> [the inclination to evil], no one remembers the <i>yetser tov</i> [the inclination to good].” Even though <i>tsitsit</i> teach of the great fear of God and a constriction of one’s behavior, still, this reminder will be of no use at a time when the <i>yetser hara</i> is in control, for it will be impossible to keep your attention on them. <i>Tefillin</i>, on the other hand, teach of the final good that God will eventually effuse to each and every one of us. So when one puts his full attention on the great good, which is also hidden for him and his portion, then he will not be jealous when he looks on the portion of his neighbor. Then he will certainly refrain from jealousy, for he will be happy with his own portion.",

On the Day of Atonement he enters beyond and within (<i>lifnai</i> and <i>lifnim</i>, to the innermost holy of Holies), which is a completely unique place. This is as it is written in the holy Zohar (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 130b), “for there are two nostrils, one draws in life, and the other draws in the life of all life.” With all of one’s actions it is said (Mishlei, 16:1), “the preparations of the heart are made by man, and the answer of the tongue is from God.” Yet here it is different, as it is said, “and there shall be no man.” Thus when it comes to the service on the day of atonement and the effusion of Divine energy that flows at this time from God, there is absolutely no relevance to the borders of the comprehension of man, in his thought or understanding.",

Therefore it says afterwards, “but the land shall not vomit you out.” Your judgment shall not be the land vomiting you out as was their judgment, but rather (verse 29), “For whoever shall commit any of these abominations, the souls who commit them shall undergo spiritual excision among their people.”",

Therefore the advice given is to afflict your souls (a kind of spiritual preparation) in order that your mind is thoroughly settled. This is all so the effusion does not descend only according to your requests, for then it would just descend within the bounds of your comprehension. In this way it will come as an effusion from the side of God, and it will be the full amount of the Holy One, blessed be He, without any measure or limit."

                    "<i>“And God spoke to Moshe saying: Speak to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, and say to them, be holy, for I am holy, Hashem, your God.”</i> (Vayikra, 19:1–2)<br>“The congregation of the children of Israel” means any place where Israel gathers together for the sake of Heaven, as it is written in the Gemara (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, 38b), “whenever ten Jews gather together, the <i>Shechina</i> [Divine Presence] rests on them.” Every place where Israel gathers together for the sake of Heaven, there the <i>Shechina</i> dwells with them necessarily. This is as it is written (<i>Devarim</i>, 23:15), “For Hashem your God walks in the midst of your camp.” The term used for walk (<i>mithalech</i>, in the intensive form) denotes certainty, saying that it is certainly so. For this reason we are commanded to be refined and sanctified, as a king who says to one who loves him, “since you are obliging me to go with you, see to it that you do not lead me into any place of foulness.”",
                    "<i>“… you shall be holy, for I am holy ….”</i> (Vayikra, 19:2)<br>The word for holiness, <i>Kedusha</i>, is a term denoting preparedness, meaning that God warns Israel to always be in a state of <i>Kedusha</i>, and thus always ready, expecting at all times the salvation of God where He will illuminate their eyes to the Torah, “For I am holy.” In other words, God is saying that He, may He be blessed, is always ready to bring salvation to Israel, and because of this Israel must be always prepared and always expecting the arrival of Hashem. Thus they should not disturb themselves with the affairs of this world. This is as it is written (Mishlei, 3:3), “let not loving-kindness and truth forsake you,” but it is not written, “do not forsake loving-kindness and truth.” In this way he is saying that a man must always stand before God, and expect him to illuminate his eyes. Then, at the time when the Holy One, blessed be He, effuses the kindness of truth, which is kindness that endures forever, then the kindness (itself) will apprehend the man who waits expectantly for it. It will not forsake everyone who waits for the Torah to enter his heart. Man must be careful not to turn his back, but rather should stand before God face to face.",
                    "<i>“… you shall be holy, for I am holy ….”</i> (Vayikra, 19:2)<br>God commands Israel to sanctify themselves even concerning that which is permitted to them. He has already explained all forbidden actions, like certain foods and certain sexual relations, yet here the Holy One, blessed be He, adds that even that which is permitted to them they shall take care not to be steeped in lust. They will take care that where there is benefit derived in this world it should be done with a settled mind, and not in a state of panic. This is seen in the signs of pure birds as explained in the Gemara (<i>Chullin</i>, 65a), “a bird which seizes its prey is impure,” meaning that it does not have trust in God, so therefore all that it eats it clutches in its claws (for fear that it would lose it). Also from the second interpretation of “seizing its prey,” where it does not wait until its prey dies, but eats it immediately upon capture, we also see a lack of trust in God, for it fears that another would take from it that which it was given.",
                    "<i>“A man shall fear his mother and father, and you shall keep my Sabbaths ….”</i> (Vayikra, 19:3)<br>Here in this verse as it appears in our <i>Parsha</i> the honor of the mother comes first, followed by honoring the father, and afterwards the guarding of Shabbat. In the Ten Mitzvot, guarding the Sabbath comes first, followed by honoring the father, and afterwards honoring the mother. The holy Zohar explains (<i>Shemot</i>, 200a), “there are three points to the Torah.” This is, that in all the things that a man does and from which he receives benefit, he must consider his way, and make three <i>birrurim</i>. First, that the action should not involve any deviation from God’s will, even to a boundary from later sages. This is called “guarding the Shabbat,” for Shabbat is itself a name of God as explained in the holy Zohar (<i>Shemot</i>, 88b), “What is Shabbat? It is a name of the Holy One, blessed be He.” Furthermore, on Shabbat it becomes clear that nothing is really done from the actions of man.<br>It is also necessary to clarify concerning the entire community of Israel, that it should not receive any harm from this action. This is called honoring the father. The father teaches knowledge to the son. He does not concern himself with the understanding of the son, to whom it seems that his father is doing evil to him in obliging him to go in the way of good, since the father knows that in the end it will be good for him. He does not worry about his son’s temporary distress, for the father is only looking at the depths.<br>For the third <i>birrur</i> (clarification), the one doing the action must clarify concerning himself that he will not cause himself any harm from this action. This is called honoring the mother, for the mother’s desire while she is teaching the son to go in the path of good, is that even if it is goes against the wishes of the son, he will not see it as if she is causing him to suffer.<br>Thus are we commanded concerning these three warnings, which are guarding Shabbat, and honoring the father and the mother, which means to make these three <i>birrurim</i> for all matters. These <i>birrurim</i> are in the mind of everyone for every matter, as we see that a man’s conscience will not let him satisfy his palate for temporary benefit. On this it is said (Mishlei, 25:27), “it is not good to eat too much honey.” Even though at the time when one is eating it it is pleasing to the taste, he needs to make sure that actions will not harm the rest of the organs and limbs of his body, for if damage is done to the rest of his body, then eventually the damage will reach his palate. So it is that the man who thinks only of the moment is inferior in the eyes of the world. We find that the man who has a greater intellect will not only look at what is pleasing to his tongue, but will look after the good of his entire body all the days of his life. Even though this level is more honorable than the first, he still has not reached the final form of completion, for one must look towards God. With Him, may He be blessed, there is a depth far deeper than all the life of this world, for God endures from eternity until eternity. Therefore the most complete mind will take all matters and consider whether they will benefit him for all eternity.<br>Thus it is also with the entire community of Israel, for they are, as it were, the limbs and organs of the Holy One, blessed be He. Therefore, if one member of Israel wants to do an action from which he will receive benefit, he must make all of these <i>birrurim</i>, for if he looks only after his own benefit and not for the benefit of the community of Israel, then he himself will be, God forbid, harmed by that action. This is like praying for a cessation of rain for the convenience of travelers when rain is needed. Then he too will be harmed by this among the whole community of Israel, like one who eats much honey—the damage that is done to the rest of his body will eventually reach his tongue. If he considers his way enough so that his action will not affect all of Israel adversely, but still it is against God’s will, even down to a boundary instituted by a latter codifier of the law, then he also will not derive any benefit from this. But if it is God’s will, then he may do what his heart desires.<br>Therefore one must clarify himself with these three <i>birrurim</i>, regarding God, regarding all of Israel, and regarding himself. Only with the Ten Commandments, meaning at the beginning of one’s acceptance of the yoke of the Torah, when he wants to do something from which he will benefit, then the first <i>birrur</i> must be regarding God, then regarding all of Israel, and finally regarding himself. That is why there the mitzvah of keeping Shabbat comes first, then honoring the father, and then honoring the mother.<br>Yet here, the <i>Parsha</i> speaks of a one who is holy in his heart, refined, and drawn after God’s will. Here we are discussing one who does not want anything that is against God’s will, and all that comes to his mind is only that which God’s will had influenced upon him. For when it occurs to a man who is this holy to do something, even though it may seem as if it is against the community as a whole, he need not look on this, for he is the main principle and foundation of all Israel. All the community as a whole are before him as if each one individually were in his mind. This is as it says in the Gemara (<i>Berachot</i>, 6b on the final verse in Kohellet, “the conclusion of the matter in which everything is included, fear God and keep his <i>mitzvot</i>, for that is the whole man”), “[’For this is the whole man’ means] all the world was only created to command him to do it,” since he is its main point. All the world is before him like one’s garments, and what is good for him is good for all Israel at the depths, even though to the mortal eye it seems like the opposite, and this is also God’s will. So therefore the order here is first the mother, then the father, last the Shabbat. This is because when he has the will to do something it is surely for the good of the whole of Israel and God’s will. This is like the prayer of King David (<i>Tehilim</i>, 90:17), “May the pleasantness of Hashem be upon us, and the world of our hands be established for us, and the work of our hands be established.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is to say, the first thing he is asking for with every matter is that it be will of God, to such an extent that even his personal desires are God’s will.</i>",
                    "<i>“Do not turn to the idols and do not make molten gods for yourselves, I am Hashem your God.”</i> (Vayikra, 19:4)<br>“Idol” means fear based on nonsense. This is because the word for idol, elil, is reminicesnt of the word for tail, <i>aliah</i>, which is the limb of the body that is furthest away from the head, and thus its consciousness is greately constricted. This is said only for the perfect <i>Tsaddikim</i> is their heart drawn after God’s will. When any kind of desire comes to their heart, they constrict themselves through much careful consideration of the fear of God, and only act while trusting in God that He will not let anything evil befall them, God forbid. This is as it is written (<i>Kohollet</i>, 7:16), “Do not be overly righteous; nor make yourself too wise; why should you destroy yourself?”",
                    "<i>“… do not make molten gods for yourselves ….”</i> (Vayikra, 19:4)<br>A “molten god” is a composite of melted metals that cannot move. So too we find in man that he becomes so accustomed to receiving benefit from this world to the point where he cannot even do without a small delight. This is called a “molten god.” Therefore God commanded us not to say that we are so used to something that we cannot be separated from it. Rather, with all the enjoyable things in life that man receives, he must remove himself from any <i>negiot</i> (personal motive, partiality),.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Affliction” means a personal motive that would sway him from clearly seeing God’s will. See above, <i>Parshat Chukat</i>, under “and the children of Israel camped at Ovot,” for more on this.</i> Then, after the <i>negia</i> is removed, if the desire still remains, then he knows clearly that it is from God. This is as we find with the prophet Yirmiya (see Yirmiya, Ch. 42), when they asked him if they could return to Egypt, and he warned them to heed his voice and trust him, not to turn from his counsel in any way. Then when he said to them not to return to Egypt they said, “Baruch ben Neriya incites you against us” (Yirmiya, 43:3).<br>This was because they suspected that it was not God’s command to tell them this, but rather from his own mind, for they esteemed him as a prophet of God, and this matter was not written in the Torah. Thus they suspected that he wanted them to remain in Israel out of his love of Baruch ben Neriya. This was because he wanted Baruch to attain the level of prophecy, and all levels of prophecy begin only in the land of Israel, as is known. So out of his love he leaned in this way, and it seemed also as if God’s will leaned in this direction. Prophecy must also undergo great <i>birrurim</i> (clarifications), in order to verify that it is truly from God. We find this with Yirmiya himself at the time when he was in prison, and he received a prophetic message that he should buy a field from his uncle Chanamel ben Shalom. Then after, when his uncle came and offered to sell his field, Yirmiya said, “And I know now that this is the word of God” (Yirmiya, 32:8). The meaning is that until now he was uncertain whether the matter was really from God, or if he just wanted to buy the field.<br>Therefore (with the matter of the people wanting to go to Egypt), it seemed to him that this was also God’s will. This is called “a molten god,” meaning stubbornness over a single desire. Therefore with all matters a man needs to undergo <i>birrurim</i> within himself, and to remove any personal <i>negiot</i> (personal motives, partiality), that may impede the clarity of his vision. Yirmiya also went through this process of self-refinement, and afterwards it is said, “and it was, at the end of ten days,” he answered them not to go back, saying (Yirmiya, 42:10), “If you will still remain in this land, then I will build you, and not pull you down.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, it took him ten days to make sure that this was what God wanted and not just what he wanted.</i> He then received a prophecy that Baruch would not attain the level of prophecy, as it is written (Yirmiya, 45:4–5), “Thus shall you say to him … And do you seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them,” etc.<br>In this, he clarified and proved his righteousness to them, for he was no longer swayed (in this case, his <i>negia</i>) by his feelings for Baruch, for all he wanted was for Baruch to become a prophet, and now he knew that this would never happen. All the effusion of prophecy to the prophets was only for Israel, and while Israel is in exile the spirit of prophecy does not come to the prophets. Even though his warning not to go to Egypt (in Chapter 42) happens before this <i>birrur</i> took place (in Chapter 45), (this is of no consequence,) because “there is no before or after in the Torah.”",
                    "<i>“You shall not defraud your neighbor ….”</i> (Vayikra, 19:13)<br>Any time when one could provide something good for his fellow man. but does not, he is defrauding him. Even when he has the opportunity to pray for his fellow man, but does not, this too is called defrauding him. We find this regarding Shmuel, who said (Shmuel 1, 12:23), “God forbid that I would sin against God by refraining from praying for you.” The Gemara interprets this by saying (<i>Berachot</i>, 12b), “anyone who has the opportunity to pray for another and does not is called a sinner.”",
                    "<i>“You shall guard my statutes. You shall not breed-together two different kinds of your cattle. You shall not sow together two different kinds of seeds in your field. You shall not wear a garment woven of both wool and linen.”</i> (Vayikra, 19:19)<br>“In your field” means the abundance that man sows and then uses to influence his surroundings. In this God is warning man to take care that there is no admixture of evil, God forbid, in all the influence that he puts forth. “Your cattle” means reception. Wherever man receives good, as in eating and the like, it shall not be mixed (with evil).",
                    "<i>“A man who has sexual relations with a woman, and she is a slave betrothed to a man, she has not been redeemed or given her freedom, the matter shall be investigated, and she shall not be put to death, for she was not free.”</i> (Vayikra, 19:20)<br>In this we see the depth of the sin of Zimri with Cosbi daughter of Tsur. This is (<i>Vayikra</i>, 19:22) “and the <i>Cohen</i> shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering … and he shall be forgiven.” This hints at Pinchas,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here Pinchas is the <i>Cohen.</i></i> who killed Zimri, and then it is said, “the plague was stopped.”",
                    "<i>“Do not defile your daughter by making her into a whore, do not prostitute the land, and fill it with perversity.”</i> (Vayikra, 19:29)<br>“Your daughter” is like the expression “the pupil [literally, ‘daughter’] of the eye.” The Holy One, blessed be He, is warning us to guard the eye, lest, God forbid, it should bring perversity to the heart, for the land is hinted at in the heart, and “the muscles of the eye are connected to the heart” (<i>Avodah Zara</i>, 28b), and also “the eye is the pimp of the heart,” as it is said in the Gemara (Yerushalmi, <i>Berachot</i>, Ch. 1, <i>Halacha</i> 5).",
                    "<i>“You shall guard My Sabbaths and be in awe of My sanctuary, I am God.”</i> (Vayikra, 19:30)<br>“My Sabbaths,” because wherever the <i>Shechina</i> dwells (every place of Divine inspiration), at all times, even temporarily, is called “Shabbat.” God commanded us to respect all places of Divine inspiration, even if it is only temporary. “And you shall be in awe of My sanctuary” is rendered in the Aramaic translation “and you shall have the fear [of God] in the Holy Temple,” which means to expect the depth of good that exists in each commandment. At present, Shabbat is greatly constricted, but in the future, God will bestow upon us a day that is entirely Shabbat where there will be no need of work. We must greatly anticipate this. But for now, we must honor it also according to how God commanded us. This is likened to a king who is passing from place to place. Though his arrival home is anticipated, still, the place where he lodges on his way must be respected. There is satisfaction and desire in the Torah, as it is written (<i>Tehilim</i>, 145:16), “and satisfies the desire of every living being.”<br>This means temporary satisfaction, and desire for the good in the depth. This was the error of Chofni and Pinchas when they saw that the <i>Shechina</i> only rested temporarily on the Tabernacle in Shilo. Therefore it was less significant in their view, and of this it is said, “you have shamed My sanctuary.” Therefore the verse, <i>et shabtotai tishmoru</i>, contains thirty letters, and if the words <i>shabtorai tishmoru</i> are spelled out with two <i>vavs</i>, then the verse contains thirty-two letters; it is then the numerical equivalent of <i>lev</i>—“heart.” (“Desire for the good in the depth.”) This is as it is written, (Yeshayahu, 63:4), “for the day of vengeance is in my heart, and the year of my redeemed has come,” and the Gemara explains (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, 99a), “I have revealed it to my heart, but not to my other limbs.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is written in the Tikkunei Zohar, Tikkun 70, “ ‘Come and See! There are those who speak with eye movements, others with hand gestures, others with head movements, others with body movements, and others with leg movements. This is, everywhere his soul is, there that place moves more.’ Rabbi Elazar said, ‘father, is it not known that the soul [<i>neshama</i>] resides in the heart [mind], and spreads forth to all the extremities of the heart? He said to him, ‘My son, of this it is written (Ruth, 3:7), ‘she uncovered her feet, and laid down.’ According to the actions of man, thus the soul goes out of her place, and descends below her place.

                    "<i>“You shall sanctify yourselves and you shall be holy, for I am Hashem your God.”</i> (Vayikra, 20:7)<br>“And you shall sanctify yourselves” is God warning Israel to sanctify themselves and to place themselves in all the boundaries that are commanded to us, like forbidden foods or forbidden sexual relations, and the like. Then, after all the boundaries, if the heart of man is still not refined and drawn after God’s will, accordingly He assures us, “and you shall be holy.” In other words, God gives us a promise that we will be sanctified. For truly, the refinement of the heart to be drawn after God’s will is not in the ability of man, but comes only from God’s assistance.",
                    "<i>“Do not walk in the ways of the nation that I have cast out before you, for these they have done and I have loathed them. And I say to you that you will inherit the land, and I am the one who is giving it to you to inherit it ….”</i> (Vayikra, 20:23–24)<br>If Israel guards themselves from the lusts of the nations and from their desires, then God will give them all the delights that he has given the nations. Only they shall recognize that God is the one who is giving, and all the delights shall be in a state of <i>Kedusha.</i> This is as the Holy One, blessed be He, promises them, “I am the one who is giving it to you.”",
                    "<i>“You shall be holy for Me, for I am holy ….”</i> (Vayikra, 19:2)<br>(Here the word for I, <i>Ani</i>, is voweled with a <i>patach</i>.) At the end of <i>Parshat Shmini</i>, while discussing forbidden foods (<i>Vayikra</i>, 11:45), where it says, “for I am holy,” then the word for I is voweled with a <i>kamats.</i> With the <i>Kedusha</i> of foods that man receives, where it is written, “for I am holy,” I, <i>Ani</i>, voweled with a <i>kamats</i>, in order to show man to draw that which he receives from the attributes of the Holy One, blessed be He, for He, may He be blessed, is void of any physical qualities. Therefore Israel is enjoined to sanctify and constrict themselves only in the <i>Kedusha</i> of the Holy One, blessed be He.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is hinted at in the name of the vowel, <i>kamats</i>, which is related to the word for restricting, delineating, like the <i>komets</i> offering, a hand measurement of grain. Also, in the kabbalistic understanding of the vowel, <i>kamats</i> represents the Crown, <i>Keter</i>, which is wholly connected to what is above, <i>Malchut</i>, of the upper level. In a sense, separated from and encircling the body of its own arrangement of <i>sefirot</i> as a crown is on top of the head.</i><br>The word for I in the present <i>Parsha</i> is voweled with a <i>patach</i>, because we are discussing the <i>Kedusha</i> of Divine effusion (which reaches the physical world). All the influences that exist in the world are only from God, for it is His way to improve all of His creations and to effuse unto them from His great good. Therefore he warns Israel to only direct this effusion to a place where God desires. This is one of the meanings of the prohibition of certain sexual relations, meaning incest. That is to say, it is the nature of man to give foremost to his own family, and to restrict himself in giving to others. Therefore He forbade incest in order for man to bring his influence to a different family, in His will to improve His creation. The name of the vowel, <i>patach</i>, means to open, so “for I am holy” with a <i>patach</i> means that God opens his hands to bring His effusion of goodness to all of His creations.",
                    "<i>“You shall be holy, for I am holy, Hashem, and I will separate you from the nations to be Mine.”</i> (Vayikra, 20:26)<br>This verse greatly reinforces Israel, bringing them holy brazenness (<i>tekifut</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See note 61, <i>Sefer Shemot</i> for more on <i>tekifut.</i></i> This is needed; after all the fear of God warranted in the mitzvot throughout the Parsha to be sanctified with all kinds of holiniess, boundaried within all kinds of borders, and refined from all dross and refuse. If this verse were formulated in the opposite way, “and I will separate the other nations from you,” it would mean, like one separating the refuse out of the food, and then all that would be left is to good and cleaned. And now, since it is said, “and I will separate you from the nations,” this is as if one is separating the food out of the refuse, and all that can be called “food” he leaves to eat. In this way God promises us that He will separate us out from the nations, meaning that He will refine us in against the nations, so that even the smallest of Israel is good. Therefore the Haftorah, the reading of the Prophets, read with this Parsha, is (Amos, 9:7), “are you not like the Cushites [Ethiopians], children of Israel, says Hashem. Did I not bring Israel out of the land of Egypt? And the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Aram from Kir?” Then it says (Amos, 9:9), “For, behold, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like grain is sifted in a sieve, and not even the smallest grain fall upon the earth.”",
                    "In this <i>Sedra</i> we find mentioned twenty times “I am Hashem,” in a passage or series of verses that will also say “I am Hashem your God.” With each of these instances, in each sub-Parsha, there are differences in where this declaration occurs. Sometimes at the beginning of the section and at the end of the section we find “I am Hashem,” and in the middle of the section is mentioned “I am Hashem your God.” Sometimes we find the opposite. The declaration “I am Hashem” teaches of a place where it seems to the consciousness of man that he can perform a pure and refined action according to God’s will. Thus it will there say, “I am Hashem,” meaning that if I, God, join with you, and clarify you, then it will prove (the value of) your action, if it is correct before Me. This is as it is said, “who can say, ‘I have refined my heart?’ ” For “I am Hashem” is God saying I, between Me and Myself, and My will was not involved in this action, so how could the action be shown to be just? But if it says, I am Hashem <i>your</i> God,” then it means that God promises man that He dwells in his heart. (Or that he dwells in His heart.) This brings great <i>tekifut</i> (holy brazenness) to man. Then in a place where man becomes dejected, and it looks as if he, God forbid, has withdrawn from the realm of God’s will, then the Holy One, blessed be He, comes to him and assures him, “I am Hashem <i>your</i> God.”<br>This is expounded on in the Gemara (<i>Bava Metsia</i>, 61b), where it says, “What is the need of the commandment, ‘You shall not steal,’ which the Torah wrote?—For that which was taught: ‘You shall not steal,’ in order to distress someone; ‘you shall not steal,’ even in order to repay double [and thus be giving him a gift].” Even though the one who steals from his fellow man did it with the intention of bringing him benefit, and not as one who would steal in order that his fellow man would lack (and he would gain), nonetheless, since God enjoins us not to steal, it is forbidden to try to be overly clever with God’s words and say that his intention was good. In every place where God forbade something, even if one does it with a good intention, it is called deviating from God’s will. Sometimes we find the ramifications of God’s law reaching a place that seems to man to be extraneous.<br>We find in the Gemara (<i>Ketubot</i>, 49a), “you cunning man [related to the word for thief], why do you go round and round? If you assert that the law is according to Rabbi Meir, then say that the law is according to Rabbi Meir.” Therefore it says, “I am Hashem,” meaning, know who decreed this over you, and thus you will not exaggerate the attributes of the Holy One, blessed be He, and you will not be overly clever with all that God has decreed forbidden. This is why this first order is used with the commandment (<i>Vayikra</i>, 20:27), “a man or woman who has a familiar or is a wizard.”<br>Even though it has already been written (<i>Vayikra</i>, 19:31), “do not turn to the familiars,” this additional verse comes so that one would not say, “I know the meaning of the <i>mitzvot</i>, for a familiar, <i>ov</i>, comes from the word for father, <i>av</i>, as in, ‘a father in wisdom,’ and a wizard, <i>yedoni</i>, comes from the word for knowing (<i>yedia</i>), meaning knowing how God conducts the forces of His world.” In this way he could trick himself into devising ways around the warnings of God.<br>This is like the passage in the Gemara about Shlomo haMelech (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, 21b), where he said, “I will increase my number of wives, and my heart will not be perverted.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Yitzchak also said: Why were the reasons for Torah laws kept hidden?—Because in two verses reasons were revealed, and they caused Shlomo haMelech the greatest sage in the world, to stumble. Thus it is written, “He shall not multiply wives for himself.” To which Shlomo haMelech replied, “I will multiply wives yet let my heart not be perverted.” However, we read, “When Shlomo haMelech was old, his wives turned his heart away.” It is further written, “He shall not multiply to horses for himself”; concerning which Shlomo said, “I will multiply them, but will not let Israel return to Egypt.” However we read, “And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver.”</i> Therefore God warns, “I am God,” know who decreed this over you.” This was written before the warnings about the familiar and the wizard. “And you shall keep My statutes, for I am Hashem who sanctifies you” (<i>Vayikra</i>, 20:8), this means that all the words of God’s are on the level of immutable, inscrutable statutes, which may not be disputed or questioned. If a man were to come and say, “since the words of God are so detailed down to a hair’s breadth, how can it be possible for a man to guard them?” To this our <i>Parsha</i> says, “I am Hashem your God,” which is saying, “I am with you. All that is in your power, go ahead and do.” Then everyplace where our actions can reach, there the Holy One, blessed be He, promises us that we will not transgress His will.<br>Therefore the Haftorah, the reading Prophets for this <i>Parsha</i>, says (Amos, Ch. 9), “are you not like the Cushites [Ethiopians], children of Israel, says Hashem. Did I not bring Israel out of the land of Egypt? And the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Aram from Kir? Except that I will not completely destroy the house of Yaakov, and not even the least grain shall fall upon the earth.” This is to say, everywhere that the intention of man was for the sake of Heaven, even though the action itself seemed the opposite, like stealing in order to pay back double, there God promises that this intention will not fall down to the earth, as in “and not even the least grain shall fall upon the earth.” Corresponding to the twenty declarations of God’s name in this <i>Parsha</i>, “I am Hashem,” Shlomo haMelech listed twenty things that he did not know (see Mishlei, 30:18–33).",
                    "<i>“Do not round off the corners of your head, or the corners of your beard.”</i> (Vayikra, 19:27)<br>“Corners” (referring to <i>peyot</i>, earlocks) teaches of the fear of God. At the very place where <i>peyot</i> extend out, there is the birth of thought, and then the thought descends down to the heart. Thus this verse teaches that whenever one experiences an evil thought, he is immediately to enter into a state of the fear of God, and not let the thought rest in his heart.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This also shows how <i>peyot</i> teach of the essential connection between the intellectual and the heart, or kindness.</i> For “heart” refers to thought with greater strength. This is as David haMelech said (<i>Tehilim</i>, Ch. 5), “a song of victory on the <i>‘nechilot.’ ”</i> The matter of <i>nechilot</i> refers to hearing one’s cry.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Hirsch understands <i>nechila</i> as related to <i>nahala</i>, or inheritance, meaning, crying out for what God gives us based on our actions. The Meiri relates it to the sound of the crying itself, for the word <i>nechila</i> is related to the word for the drone of a swarm of bees.</i> “Listen to my words, Hashem, understand my contemplation.” “My words” relates to one’s thoughts, that God listen to them so they will be pure. “Understand my contemplation” means to ask God to bring an effusion of understanding to all my thoughts, and that I may purify them all so they will not turn from God’s will. “Listen to the voice of my cry, my King, my God.” “My King” means that God is king over all men, and can cause an effusion of thought to man according to His holy will. <i>E-lohi</i>—“My God” is that God causes an effusion of wisdom, because God’s name, <i>E-lohim</i>, teaches of wisdom."

                "Emor": [
                    "<i>“… say (Emor) to the</i> Cohanim, <i>the sons of Aharon, and you shall say to them, do not make yourselves impure from the dead of your people.”</i> (Vayikra, 21:1) <br><i>Cohen</i> represents the servant of God who sees all actions in the world as a result of the direct involvement (<i>hashgacha</i>) of God. He also sees that God’s desire is only to improve the creation. One who sees the world this way can will inevitably bear greivences when he confronts difficult situations in the world that are expressions of God’s stern judgment, (saying, “it’s not fair.”) One who believes that the world is run by chance has no address for his greivences.  When he confronts situations in the world contrary to his desires, he will say that it came about by chance. Thunderous anger is only possible for the believer who sees everything as a decree from Heaven.<br>For this reason the Holy One, blessed be He, commands the <i>Cohanim</i>, believers and servants of God, “do not contaminate yourself from the dead of your people.” In other words, don’t become angry at God when confronting pain and suffering, as this kind of anger is itself the contamination from the dead. It is a response to the God’s judgments that bring about loss and absence in the world, as discussed in the holy Zohar. Therefore God commanded, “<i>Emor el haCohanim</i> - say to the <i>Cohanim</i>.” “<i>Emor</i> – say,” means speaking softly.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Emor</i> is a soft language, a whisper, as it were, as opposed to <i>maggid</i>, a stern usage. See Zohar, <i>Vayikra</i>, 88b</i>. God enjoins us to whisper into the ears of the servants of God that they should not hold grudges when it comes to His stern judgment, for the intentions of God are always in order to improve. Even when He conducts the world with the attribute of stern judgment, then too, His intention at the depths is only to improve.",
                    "<i>“… say to the</i> Cohanim ….” (Vayikra, 21:1)<br>It is written in the Midrash (Tanchuma, <i>Emor</i>, 1), “a parable about a king who said to his cook, ‘I request that you not so much as look at the dead all the days of your life. Thus you will not defile my palace.’” The cook is, so to speak, responsible for the pleasure of the king, so therefore the king warned him, “Since your job is to see to my pleasure, be careful not to cause me sadness.” Witnessing death is the opposite of <i>simcha</i> (joy). This is “say to the <i>Cohanim”</i> to be careful not do the opposite of what you are supposed to do, since they were chosen to bring an effusion of <i>simcha</i> down from heaven into the world. The service of the Cohen is in order to give <i>nachas</i>, pride and joy, to the Holy One, blessed be He.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As a grandchild’s good or clever behavior would give <i>nachas</i> to his parents or grandparents.</i>",
                    "<i>“… say to the</i> Cohanim … <i>do not make yourselves impure from the dead of your people.”</i> (Vayikra, 21:1)<br>The <i>Cohen</i> is chosen as the vehicle through which all the actions of Israel will be rectified and acceptable before the Holy One, blessed be He. Therefore He warned them about impurity from the dead, for death brings about the opposite. There are three levels of soul found in man: (in ascending order) <i>nefesh</i>, <i>ruach</i>, and <i>neshama</i>. The vitality of the <i>nefesh</i> is only complete when it is connected to the higher levels of <i>ruach</i> and <i>neshama.</i> Therefore at night when the <i>ruach</i> and the <i>neshama</i> separate from the body, only the <i>nefesh</i> remains and has no ability to effect conscious physical action. This is why we say every morning, “Blessed are You, who straightens the bent,” for when the <i>ruach</i> and the <i>neshama</i> are reconnected to the <i>nefesh</i> and the body who were, so to speak, “bent over,” are straightened and upright.<br>As we find in man, so too do we find in the whole community of Israel. The <i>Cohen</i> is the head of the body of Israel. Just as there is the aspect of thought in in man’s soul, and the body is under the influence of his thoughts, so too the rest of Israel are all on different levels, one higher than the other. It is like the organs and limbs of man, starting with the head, and evolving out to the organs of action (fingers, feet, mouth). When man is awake the head controls the body, as in the famous saying of the Baal Shem <i>Tov</i>, “a man is where his thoughts are.” When he is asleep, there is no difference between the head and the rest of the body. Therefore God warned the <i>Cohanim</i> not to become impure from the dead, since the <i>Cohen</i> is in charge of the body of Israel and has the power to rectify all of their actions. Death teaches of the opposite of this, for in death he has no power of action to fix all that he has perverted in his life. The Cohen’s unique ability to rectify the actions of Israel is so that nothing would become irrecoverably lost in exile.",
                    "<i>“That which is bruised or crushed, broken or cut [referring to castration of an animal], you shall not offer to God, you shall not do this in your land.”</i> (Vayikra, 22:24)<br>This means not to deride any aspect of God’s creation. The Gemara (<i>Chagiga</i>, 14b) derives from this verse that it is forbidden to castrate an animal as this would be mocking the creation. In this same passage of the Gemara they asked Ben Zoma, “may one castrate a dog?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse “you shall not offer,” refers to animals fit to offer in the temple. What about an animal where even its price cannot be used to buy a temple sacrifice?</i> Ben Zoma answered by quoting this verse, “you shall not do this in your land.” You shall not do this to everything in your land. Then they asked him, “is a pregnant woman who still shows signs of virginity fit to marry the <i>Cohen Gadol</i> [high priest, who may only marry a virgin]? Ben Zoma answered them, “Shmuel could [as he claimed to have been able to perform ‘<i>hayaya</i>’ and impregnate a woman without removing any sign of her virginity]. But there is no alive today who can do as Shmuel did.”<br>They asked Ben Zoma these questions after he did not “return in peace” (after entering the “orchard” of the secrets of the Torah with Rebi Akiva) as it said, “He gazed on the mysteries and was stricken with madness.” They sensed that his mind was damaged<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or damaged, for prior to this experience he was considered one of the great homiletic interpreters of the Torah in his generation.</i> and he wanted to know if he would make mistakes in interpretation. So they asked him these questions in order to test his mind and see if he could easily deride any aspect of the God’s creation. This is why they asked him if it was permitted to castrate a dog, for a dog represents the lowliest of the creation. They asked him if castration was permitted in order to see if it would be easy for him to nullify its existence, and he answered them that it was forbidden, because “you shall not do” includes everything in your land. This means that it is forbidden to deride even the lowest of all creatures, since it is a part of God’s creation.<br>Then they wanted to test him in the opposite direction, to see whether he made the mistake in believing that elements of the creation had more power than they really had. This is why they asked him if a virgin who was pregnant was permitted to the <i>Cohen Gadol </i>(the High Priest in the Temple), who is only permitted to marry a virgin. The <i>Cohen Gadol</i> is the greatest of all created beings, and perhaps he understood that the he had more power he really had. He answered them that there is no one who can do this today as Shmuel did, meaning that he did ascribe a power to the <i>Cohen Gadol</i> beyond his abilities. Neither would he be overly stringent with the <i>Cohen Gadol</i> than necessary, as there was no one like Shmuel in that generation who could have impregnated her, and thus she was permitted.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Gemara goes on to discuss whether or not she could have been impregnated by semen in a bathtub.</i> <br>Yet Ben Zoma was indeed damaged. He made his great error in measuring the difference between the waters above the firmament and the waters below the firmament described in Genesis 1:7.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In truth there is only the difference of a hair’s breadth that the firmament separates between them, but they must be accepted according to God’s will. Similarly it is with the lamb offered with the omer-barley offering, which is placed double—two <i>esronim</i> of barley representing the lower waters and the upper waters, and the lamb hints at the firmament separating between them. <i>Tashlum.</i></i> This is as Ben Zoma said in the Gemara (<i>Chagiga</i>, 15a), “between the upper and lower waters there is the distance of three finger widths, and they said, ‘Ben Zoma is still on the outside.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“On the outside” means he did not have a clear understanding of the mysteries of creation. The Steinsaltz Gemara quotes the explanation of the “Otsar Hakavod,” which interprets the upper and lower waters as purely spiritual matters, and the discussion is trying to find the source of supernal entities and of the lower entities. According to R. Yehoshua, on the first day of creation there is no separation between any of these entities at all, and everything existed as a single unified creation. Ben Zoma understood that the description in the Book of <i>Bereshit</i> describes the order of creation, and R. Yehoshua understood that there were elements mentioned in the creations of the first day that only came into being later.</i> In this, Ben Zoma understood that there was a great difference between good desire and evil desire.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ben Zoma made the mistake in understanding there to be a great difference between the upper waters and the lower waters, for truly they have one source, as water signifies desire. Man possesses two kinds of desire, one that was imprinted in him from his birth, as explained in the Midrash (Rabba <i>Bereshit</i>, 8), that the world is filled with kindness (<i>chasadim</i>), and with this undiscerning kindness one could make the mistake of being merciful with the cruel. However, when man focuses his natural inborn kindness on following God’s will, this is greater than anything he could do with his intellect. And still, if a man were to direct the kindness in his lower nature to God’s will, then it is even far greater than anything he could do with his intellect. <br>Therefore it does not say in <i>Tehilim</i> (148) “May the waters that are above heavens shall praise the name of God,” but not the waters below the heavens, for what is man, and what can he do with his intellect? Man’s godly power is actually that which he can do with his lower nature. Thus Ben Zoma understood a great difference in upper and lower desires, where truly, in the future, when God will make it clear that everything in the world came from Him, then it will be clearly seen that nothing separates between the upper waters and the lower waters. This is why, before entering into the garden of the secrets of the Torah, Rabbi Akiva warned (<i>Chagiga</i>, 14b), “when you arrive at the stones of pure marble, do not say, ‘water, water,’ ” He warned us not to identify water twice, because at their source they are one. <i>Giliyon Mei HaShiloach</i> by Gershon Chenoch Lainer, the Rebbe of Radzin ZY”A.</i>",
                    "<i>“An ox, or lamb, or goat which is born, shall remain seven days under its mother, and from the eighth day on it will be acceptable as an offering of fire to Hashem.”</i> (Vayikra, 22:27)<br>The holy Zohar (<i>Vayikra</i>, 91a) explains that this is in order for the animal to live through one Shabbat. If this is so, then it should be acceptable as an offering immediately after Shabbat, even if it was born on Friday. Why then does the Torah stipulate that it should live seven complete days before being sacrificed? We find that God created seven forces of goodness in the world, “Yours, Hashem is the greatness, and the strength, and the splendor…” (Divrei haYamim 1, 29:11), and each of the seven days of creation contains one of these forces of goodness, as is known. Shabbat is the foundation and principle of all of the forces of goodness, for Shabbat teaches of the glory of Heaven. <i>Kedusha</i> spreads forth from Shabbat to the six days of creation and the goodness of the six days are included in Shabbat. This is why the Torah stipulates seven days in order for man to offer something complete before the Holy One, blessed be He.<br>Passing through all six days of creation and Shabbat is to acknowledge that the Holy One, blessed be He is sovereign over them. Then he may offer it before God. If it had not passed through the six days of creation, then it would not have received all God’s goodness, and how then could a man offer to God something that is not complete? Even if it experienced the Shabbat it still would not have received the completeness of the creation. Yet, when it experienced the six days of creation and also the Shabbat, meaning that it drew within it all the forms of goodness and crowned the Creator over all of them, then the offering is acceptable. Therefore it is written, “and you shall give it to Me on the eighth day.”",
                    "<i>“An ox or a ewe, do not slaughter it and its young in the same day.”</i> (Vayikra, 22:28)<br>The Targum of Yonatan ben Uziel<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The more interpretive of the ancient Aramaic translations of the Torah.</i> renders this verse, “Just as your Father is merciful, so too shall you be merciful in the land. An ox or a ewe, do not slaughter it and its young in the same day.” On this we find in the holy Zohar (<i>Vayikra</i>, 92b), “We have learned that actions below arouse corresponding actions from above. If a man acts properly below, it arouses a similar power from above. If a man acts with kindness in the world, it arouses kindness from above, etc. And as for the opposite, if a man is cruel in the world, cruelty is aroused from Heaven on that same day, and strikes him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or strikes that day itself, imbuing it with cruelty (Sulam).</i> As man deals with the world, so is he dealt with.” This explanation is in order to teach the children of Israel the attribute of kindness.<br>The Gemara (<i>Megillah</i>, 25a) relates how, “one was leading the prayer service before Rava and said, ‘You who were merciful with the bird’s nest [and commanded that the mother be driven away before taking her eggs], be merciful with us! You who were merciful in saying, ‘do not slaughter it and its young on the same day, so too be merciful with us!’ Rava said, ‘this student really knows how to appease his teacher [God].’ Abaye answered, ‘but we are taught that one who prays in this way should be silenced!’ [And this is the Halacha.].” This is because he is falsely claiming that all of God’s attributes are mercy.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Gemara says that Rava had only said this to sharpen (test) Abaye.</i><br>Yonatan ben Uziel and the holy Zohar teach us that the law of  “<i>oto v’et b’no</i> - it and its young,” is only in order to teach the children of Israel the way of kindness. The holy Zohar calls the mitzvot “advice.” (<i>Shemot</i>, 82b)  Thus the mitzvot are given to the children of Israel in order to advise them how to behave.<br>Thus it is puzzling that the man prayed, “just as You were merciful,” and still we are told that he is to be silenced. In prayer, we are forbidden from ascribing any attributes of man’s limited understanding to God. This is because the function of prayer is to allow God to enlighten the eyes of man to a place that he otherwise could not have reached. Attributes of behavior are something that man can comprehend, and yet the Pesikta says “to call directly to Him, and not to call to His attributes.” When a man prays and mentions one of God’s attributes, it might seem that he is praying, God forbid, that the attribute save him (“May God’s mercy save me! May His strength save me!”) But the attribute only contains that which God measured into it. For this reason an attribute is called a <i>midda</i> (<i>moded</i>, measure; <i>midda</i>, attribute). The one and only address of prayer is God’s very essence, may He be blessed, which “no mind can comprehend” (<i>Patach Elyahu</i>, in the Tikkunei Zohar, 17a).",
                    "<i>“… and you shall bring an omer [a measurement, tenth of an</i> ephah<i>] of the first fruits of your harvest to the</i> Cohen.” (Vayikra, 23:10)<br>It is said in the writings of the Ari’zal (R. Yitschak Luria, 1534–1572) that “<i>omer</i>” is the numerical equivalent of <i>yakar</i>, meaning precious (both equal 310). This is because on the first night of Passover such a great and precious light is opened up for Israel. All of God’s goodness is open before them, and then afterwards, it is closed. Therefore, on the second night of Passover, a great cry remains in the heart of all of Israel, and they cry out to God, “how precious [<i>yakar</i>] are Your kindnesses, E-lohim!” wanting God to return to them the illumination of His <i>sefira</i>. On this, King Shlomo said in his prophecy (Mishlei, 8:17), “I love those that love Me,” meaning that for them I will open up the illumination of my countenance, and this corresponds to Passover, a time when the love of God opens up for Israel. Furthermore (as the verse in Mishlei continues), “those who rise early will find Me,” meaning that after they strive and wake up early to receive God’s goodness, then He will fix a complete and uninterrupted illumination in their hearts. This happens (50 days later) on the festival of Shevuot.<br>We find the Hebrew word for “they will find Me” is written in this verse with an extra letter <i>nun</i> (yimtza’uNaNi). The letter <i>nun</i> is numerically equivalent to 50, and represents the <i>nun sha’arei bina</i>, the fifty gates of understanding in the Torah. Then on Shevuot<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shevuot is fifty days after Passover, and until then each day is ritually counted with a blessing (<i>sefirat ha’omer</i>), each day representing one of the fifty gates.</i> the ability to be drawn after God’s will is instilled in all of us. We do this by fulfilling the mitzvah of counting the days of the Omer between Passover and Shevuot. This is why the Omer is an offering of barley (<i>seorah</i>), as if to say be scrupulous in following God’s will and not deviating from it even a hair’s breadth (<i>sea’rah).</i> Through this one merits <i>Binah</i>–Understanding and being instilled with the illumination of God.<br>On Passover they only received a temporary illumination, which was then immediately concealed. They saw the preciousness of God’s light but were unable to be drawn after His will. This is why our Sages say, “a maidservant saw more at the splitting of the Red Sea that the prophet Yechezkel.” Namely “a maidservant,” for all of Israel were like maidservants in the servitude of God, and were unable to fulfill their personal desire in His desire. Then on Shevuot, with the giving of the Torah, God fixed <i>Binah </i>the hearts of all men that they could understand God’s will in the depths of their souls. This manifestation of <i>Binah</i> is called “the moon.” The moon intimates the understanding of the heart, whereas the sun intimates <i>Chochma</i>, wisdom that is clear to all. <i>Chochma</i> is the 613 <i>mitzvot</i>, so that a man uses his wisdom to know the proper course of action by means of the principles of the <i>mitzvot.</i> With these principles he knows what is permitted and what is forbidden. The moon, however, teaches of the understanding in the heart with which a man may sanctify himself even in (delineate himself from) that which is permitted to him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An example of this in the Talmud is although a husband and wife can agree to have whatever kind of intimate relations they want, still they are asked to “sanctify themselves, and limit the extent of their relations. “Don’t be like a rooster with the hen,” who was overly engaged. This may be applied to all permitted desires, such as money, food, and honor.</i> This means that he has a deep and instinctive feeling for where he needs to draw his boundaries, knowing how to recognize the boundaries of God’s will, and any further is not God’s will. Man needs this kind of understanding in all circumstances.<br>This is why it says in the Midrash (<i>Bereshit</i> Rabba, 6:5), “The nations of the world measure the year by the sun, and Israel measures the year by the moon.” This is because the sun is the <i>Chochma</i> which is in man’s power of comprehension, but the moon teaches of life that is above the intellect. We see this in the very word for moon, <i>yareyach</i>, which is similar to <i>reyach</i>, smell, for Israel can “smell” the roots of everything in the lives of the world to come. This is even so with the moon exists, as it were, under the sun, as we find in the holy Zohar (<i>Bereshit</i>, 237b), “which of them is greater? Certainly the moon is above, and the sun of the nations of the world is under this moon, and this sun receives its light from the supernal moon, and illuminates. See the difference between them and Israel. Israel holds on to the moon and evolves (receives a concatenation of light) from the supernal sun. It is thus unified in the place of the illumination of the supernal sun, holding on to it. This is as it is written, ‘you who cleave to Hashem your God are all alive today.’” The sun receives its light from the supernal moon, and the only one who could ever merit the direct illumination of the supernal sun was Moshe Rabeynu.",
                    "<i>“And you shall count from the day after the Sabbath [first day of Passover] from the day you brought the omer of the wave offering ….”</i> (Vayikra, 23:15)<br>We count the Omer because the seven weeks between Passover and Shevuot require a special vigilance, as it is written (Yirmiya, 5:24), “in the weeks [<i>shevuot</i>] the laws of the harvest are guarded for us.” It is written in the Midrash (<i>Vayikra</i> Rabba, 28:3), “then He will guard us from evil winds and evil dews,” for this time of the year needs special protection from the forces of nature and evil spirits. Therefore God commanded us at this time to count, and each day to anticipate eagerly the moment of the giving of our Torah. In this time we are especially enjoined to guard the <i>mitzvot</i>, for those who adhere to the <i>mitzvot</i> will not know misfortune, and through them we merit salvation.",
                    "<i>“… on the festival of Succot seven days unto Hashem … And on the first day you shall take fruits of the citron tree, palm branches, boughs of thick trees [myrtle], and willows of the stream, and you shall rejoice ….”</i> (Vayikra, 23:34–39)<br>The <i>succa</i> and the four species correspond to the “ten depths” mentioned in the <i>Sefer Yetsira</i> (the Book of Creation, the most ancient of all kabbalistic texts, attributed to Avraham Avinu). They are the depth of the “six directions”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They are: above, below, east, west, north, and south, which are the six walls of the <i>succa. Tashlum.</i></i> the depth of good and its opposite, the depth of the beginning, and the depth of the end. The <i>pri eyts hadar</i>, the fruit of the citron tree, corresponds to the “depth of good,” since the citron has both taste and smell,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The four species waved on Succot are divided into that which has both taste and smell, that which has taste but no smell, smell with no taste, and neither taste nor smell.</i> meaning the good that endures in the world to come, of which we may eat in this world. Palm branches correspond to the “depth of the end,” as it is written in the Gemara (<i>Ta’anit</i>, 29b), “to give you hope for the end [Yirmiya, 29:11] Rav Yehuda son of Rav Shmuel son of Shilat said in the name of Rav, ‘this means palm branches.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Even Yisrael (Steinsaltz) comments that this is because palm branches are something that last a long time and are always useful. Rashi says that there was an industry surrounding them in the ancient world.</i> Another reason is because date palms are the last mentioned in the enumeration of the seven species of the land of Israel,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Devarim</i> 8:8, where honey means dates.</i> and this hints at the end and hope. Branches of a thick tree (myrtle) correspond to the “depth of the beginning,” because they have a scent, meaning a man may sense this scent to the very depths the foundations on which the world was created. Willows of the stream correspond to the “depth of evil,” as they have no taste or smell. Concerning this it says in the Gemara (<i>Baba Batra</i>, 61a), “anyone who gives his life to die for words of Torah, do not quote the Law in his name.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Shmuel 2, 23:16. “And the three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water from the well of Beth-Lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David. Nevertheless he would not drink of it, but poured it out to Hashem. And he said, Be it far from me, Hashem, that I should do this; is not this the blood of the men who went risking their lives? Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men do.”</i> It seems that this deed will not bring him any benefit in this world or the world to come. Still, we are told to bind the willow together with the other species, hinting at man’s completion. In order for man to be complete he must find this power, that he could surrender himself to death all the while knowing that this will give him no benefit whatsoever in the world to come. If man succeeds in finding this power, then he will understand all the other depths in their completeness. Therefore it is called “a depth,” for even in the evil he will find good, and in the future God will return to him all that he lost in delivering his life over for the study of the Torah.",
                    "<i>“And you shall take fine flour, and you shall bake twelve loaves of bread [</i>challot<i>], two tenths of an</i> ephah <i>in each one.”</i> (Vayikra, 24:5)<br>Israel is called the challah (bread) of the Holy One, blessed be He, for they sustain the glory of God in this world the way bread sustains the strength of man. For this, God sustains them in two worlds, as it says with the creation of man (<i>Bereshit</i>, 2:7), “and He formed,” “<i>vaYYatser</i>,” with two <i>yud</i>s, hinting at endurance in two worlds. This is also hinted at in the “two-tenths of an <i>ephah</i> in each one.”",
                    "<i>“On the day of Shabbat, on the day of Shabbat [meaning every Shabbat] you shall arrange them before Hashem ….”</i> (Vayikra, 24:8)<br>Why is the cantillation marking on the first “on the day of Shabbat” <i>kadma ve’azlah</i>, and on the second “on the day of Shabbat” is <i>munach revi’i</i>? The <i>Lechem haPanim</i>, the twelve loaves placed before God in the Temple, intimate God’s love for Israel. This is as we find in the Gemara (<i>Chagiga</i>, 26b), “see the great love the Omnipresent has for you when you are before Him [for when the old breads were removed after six days before the coming Shabbat, they were as fresh as when they were first placed].” From this great <i>tekufut</i> (strength)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tekifut</i> or <i>azut d’Kedusha</i>, meaning holy brazenness; see note 61, <i>Sefer Shemot.</i></i> wells up in Israel, and for this reason God commanded that two lambs be offered with the bread. Shabbat is the internal quality of the six days of the week. This is explained in the Gemara (<i>Pesachim</i>, 106a), “from the fourth day until Shabbat is called before Shabbat, and from Shabbat until the third day is called after Shabbat [the internal quality of the weekdays comes out of Shabbat].” Therefore God commanded us to offer two lambs, meaning to give thanks for the past, and to cry out for the future. From the loaves, <i>tekifut</i> will come to Israel over the past, for surely God will complete them for the good. This is why the cantillation marking on the first “on the day of Shabbat” is <i>kadma ve’azlah</i>. That is to say that even with the failures of the past (over which we have lost hope), God will help and make it for the good. (<i>kadam</i> means “came before,” and <i>azal</i> means “used up or failed”). The cantillation marking on the second “on the day of Shabbat” is <i>munach revi’i</i>. <i>Munach</i> means to put.  That is to say man has to cry out for the future, gaining composure and putting his mind to all of this as far as is humanly possible in order to not deviate from God’s will. If a man accepts that from now on he will do all that is humanly possible to not deviate God’s will, then God will help him with the past. In this way he will see that everything he did was according to God’s will.",
                    "<i>“And the son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and this son of the Israelite woman and a man of Israel fought together in the camp. And the Israelite woman’s son blasphemed Hashem’s name ….”</i> (Vayikra, 24:10)<br>A passage in the holy Zohar reads (<i>Vayikra</i>, 106a), “boring a hole in something that was closed,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is because <i>yikov</i> means both to bore or pierce and to blaspheme.</i> as one would say, ‘and he bore a hole in his door.’” This is because he wanted to open up the depth that is hidden in the future, where God will refine all of Israel to the point that they will be clean of all sin. Then he would be a full member of Israel. This is as the Gemara writes (<i>Yevamot</i>, 23a), “If a <i>goy</i> or a slave who has intercourse with a Jewish woman, the child is fit to enter Israel and he is not a bastard, but he is called ‘a tainted Israelite.’” As he felt incomplete, or “tainted,” he wanted to open a force where in the future the Holy One, blessed be He, would make such <i>birurim</i> (refinements) where there would not even remain a residue of sin among the sinners of Israel. This is as the holy Zohar says (<i>Vayikra</i>, 106a), “He took the final <i>Hei</i> in God’s holy name and cursed him, in order to defend his mother.” This is because the final <i>Hei</i> hints at the world of <i>Asiyah</i>, the world of action. Though God desires that we fulfill His mitzvot with our actions, still He wanted to create an opening whereby He would bring about salvation even without the actions of man.<br>This is as it is said in the Midrash (Tanchuma, <i>Emor</i>, 23; see Rashi on this passage), “This incident was a reaction to the previous section [in Ch. 24, on the twelve loaves in the Tabernacle]. The king usually eats warm bread. Would he eat cold bread?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meaning that one who cursed was denying the miracle where the twelve loaves in the Tabernacle stayed warm and fresh all week. <i>Eyts Yosef.</i></i> In this world, all the divine  effusion that man receives from the Holy One, blessed be He, is received in time through Shabbat, in place through the Mikdash, and in person through the Patriarchs and the community of Israel. However, he asserted that God could bring about salvation at any time, at any place, and for any individual, by themselves.<br>Also the Gemara writes (quoted in Rashi on this passage), “He was responding to a previous incident (where the court had judged him guilty). He went to pitch his tent in the encampment of Dan.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He asserted that he was of the tribe of Dan, but this was so only from his mother’s side. They told him that they only camp “according to their father’s house.” So he left angry and blasphemed.</i> The passage about the one who cursed is included in the Torah in order to show us just how much one needs to hold back from bearing all kinds of grudges against God. Since the one who cursed distanced himself from the encampment of the Israelites, he left Moshe’s court with a guilty verdict and stood and blasphemed. His intentions were good in that he wanted to live in the encampment of the Israelites, being an Israelite from his mother’s side. But from his Egyptian heritige, he voiced all of his grudges. A man of Israel’s heart cleaves to God and his intentions are for the sake of Heaven even if God denies him some benefit. Even if God denies him something good and pushes him away, in this too he is fulfilling God’s will and is called an <i>eved Hashem</i>, a servant of God, and for this he merits great reward. We find an example with a descendant of Aharon haCohen who is unfit for service in the Holy Temple because of some physical defect. In the very act of being pushed away from the holy service he merits great reward. However, one who is not of the root and branch of Israel, if he is distanced from some benefit, then he cannot contain himself and lashes out in scorn.<br>This is as we find in the Gemara (<i>Avodah Zara</i>, 3a), “in the future God will offer the nations the mitzvah of <i>succa</i>. Then he will take the sun out of its sheath, and make it unbearably hot, so they will not be able to sit in the <i>succa.</i> Upon leaving, they will kick their <i>succot.</i> It is asked, ‘are not Israelites also exempt from the mitzvah of <i>succa</i> if the weather makes it unpleasant?’ Yes, but they would not kick it upon leaving.” With the nations, even if their intention is to fulfill the commandment of God, if they are prevented from it, they will lash out in scorn (literally, kick).<br>Therefore the great test of serving God will be with the commandment of <i>succa</i>, for this commandment enjoins us to leave a permanent dwelling and reside in a temporary dwelling. This requires being drawn to any place God’s will wants us to go, and not to complain even if God prevents us from performing His mitzvot. For since this is God’s will, in not doing the commandment one is now also fulfilling His will. If one who lashes out in scorn when he is prevented from the mitzvah, then this proves that when he was doing the mitzvah, his intentions were not for the sake of Heaven. This is why God commanded, “go and take out the one who cursed,” for when he wanted to pitch his tent in the camp of the Israelites, his intentions here were also not for the sake of Heaven.<br>This section is juxtaposed with the section that follows immediately, “He that kills a man shall surely be put to death. He that kills an animal shall pay etc.,” It is the way of God that after He meets out what appears to be stern judgment and sentenced the one who cursed to death by stoning, notwithstanding all the shame he suffered, He warns us to honor human dignity, including the honor our fellow’s flesh and blood as evinced by warning us not to cause blemish to an animal. For this reason it is said (<i>Vayikra</i>, 24:19), “and if a man cause a blemish in his neighbor, thus shall it be done to him [paying restitution].” This is to say that there shall be one system of justice. There is justice for the one who has false greivences against God and for all of mankind. “Thus shall it be done back to him” (<i>Vayikra</i>, 24:20) is saying that it will be clear that the accuser himself bears the blemish he claims to be in the accused.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his soul.</i><br>For this reason the section discussing the <i>succa</i> is juxtaposed with the section discussing the menorah. (Like the light of the menorah in the Temple,) God illuminates the eyes of man, and shows him that God is in charge. So too with the section discussing the twelve loaves, which hints at Gods love for Israel, saying (<i>Chagiga</i>, 26b), “see the great love He has for you! All that God does is only for the good of Israel.” Yet when one who is not of the root and branch of Israel finds it necessary to voice his greivences against God, not able to contain himself and spitting it forth from his lips, the result is as we have explained above with the one who cursed. (Namely that if he is rejected from doing something good or beneficial, he lashes out, unlike Israel, who accept their rejection as a service and fulfillment of God’s will). No such greivences come from Israel, for they know that everything is for their good.",
                    "In this week’s <i>Sedra</i> (<i>Parsha</i>) there are five passages preceding the passage about the festivals. This corresponds to the five kinds of grudges a man can bear over the stern attributes of the Holy One, blessed be He. The first passage warns the <i>Cohen</i> against becoming contaminated from a dead body, and this corresponds to the anger one can have in his heart over death and absence.<br>The second passage discusses the physical defects that would render a <i>Cohen</i> unfit to serve in the temple. A <i>Cohen</i> in this state could harbor anger against the severe judgment of the Holy One, blessed be He. Why would God plant him among the root of Aharon where he would have been fit to offer sacrifices to God and serve Him? Why then did He create him with a defect that prevents him from this <i>Kedusha</i> (holiness), for the <i>Kedusha</i> of a <i>Cohen</i>’s service is immeasurable? Just as we see how much <i>Kedusha</i> there is in the mitzvah of eating matsah, how much more so when the <i>Cohen </i>eats of the sacrifices, <i>kodshei shamayim</i>, God’s own food, as it were! As we find in the Gemara (<i>Pesachim</i>, 57a), “[how immeasurably awesome it was] when those in the temple would go in and eat of the <i>kodshei shamayim.</i>” We see just how precious eating the sacrifices was in God’s eyes, and all the more so the <i>Kedusha</i> of the <i>Cohen</i> in his service before God. So even just seeing a <i>Cohen</i> who is rendered unfit to serve can cause one to be angry at God. Even though the blemished <i>Cohen</i> may eat of the sacrifices, he is distanced from the actual service.<br>The third passage is about the <i>Cohen</i> who becomes impure. Since the <i>Cohen</i> guarded and purified himself as much as possible in order to serve God, avoiding even an improper thought, then how much more so would he then guard himself from defiling his body! Then after, when something happened that pushed him away serving God and eating the sacrifices, then overwhelming tears would take him, asking, “why doesn’t God help me so I am not pushed away from the service?”<br>The fourth passage discusses blemishes in the sacrifices themselves, where a great cry wells up among those bringing the sacrifices, asking, “why did God bother to give me goodness and property that I can’t offer?”<br>The fifth passage concerns a thanksgiving offering, of which it is said, “he shall eat it on that day.” This means that a man is required to give thanks over the past and cry out for what is to come, so as not to trust in tomorrow, but rather always stand in prayer and the fear of God. Thus he is not released from this requirement when the future day comes. This brings bitter anguish to the hearts of mankind, asking why God cannot simply be a constant refuge of strength, and let them do everything with complete confidence that God will help them. On this, David haMelech said (<i>Tehilim</i>, 92), “Mizmor Shir, a song of the day of Shabbat,” meaning (<i>Tamid</i>, 33b) “in the future, the day which is eternally Shabbat, over this  [as the <i>Tehilim</i> continues,] it is, ‘good to give thanks to Hashem.’” In this way the Holy One, blessed be He, will teach <i>Binah</i>–Understanding to Israel, causing them to understand that all the events of the past were all for the sake of man’s benefit. This is why <i>Tehilim</i> 92 continues, “and to sing to His supernal name,” for the place from which God conducts the world above the level of man’s intellect is called “supernal.”<br>Corresponding to these five passages, God gave Israel the five passages about the yearly festivals. It is from (the spiritual power of the festivals) that man receives <i>tekifut</i> (unbridled strength) and an expansion of consciousness in order not to voice his greivances as mentioned above. God gave them the passage about Passover corresponding to the first passage, for Passover is the beginning of the illumination of life that God gives to Israel. Shevuot corresponds to the passage dealing with a <i>Cohen</i> who is unfit for service, for with the giving of the Torah all those who were sick or lame, deficient in any way, were healed, and Shevuot teaches us that God will heal everything. Rosh Hashanah corresponds to the passage about a <i>Cohen</i> who had become impure, for impurity is really sadness, as has been explained (in the second piece in this week’s <i>Parsha</i>). Therefore on Rosh Hashanah there is the mitzvah of sounding the <i>shofar</i> so as to drown out the sound of anything that may depress him. Yom Kippur corresponds to blemished sacrifices, for at the moment Israel abandons all forms of pleasure and benefit in this world in order to fulfill God’s will, then strength and encouragement will come to all their goodness and property. Corresponding to a thanksgiving offering, which teaches man to have the constant fear of God, they were given the mitzvah of <i>succa</i>, meaning that God will protect man and surround him (just as a <i>succa</i> does even though it is not a permanent structure). The festival of Succot is called “the time of our joy,” meaning that God will give man joy, promising never to abandon him."

                "Behar": [
                    "<i>“And God spoke to Moshe at mount Sinai, saying: Speak to the children of Israel and say unto them, when you enter the land which I give you, you shall let the land rest a Sabbath unto Hashem.”</i> (Vayikra, 25:1–2)<br>Here God promises Israel that when they come to the land of Israel their hearts will be at peace. “Land” teaches of the heart. This is “let the land rest,” that their hearts shall be at peace.",
                    "<i>“Speak to the children of Israel … you shall let the land rest a Sabbath unto Hashem.”</i> (Vayikra, 25:2)<br>Three subjects are discussed here: <i>Shmitta</i>, the seventh “release” year when the land lies fallow, freeing slaves, in the fiftieth year, the <i>Yovel</i>, and <i>Ribit</i>, the prohibition of lending at interest. In all three, God is warning Israel against putting their trust in anything in the world that, from man’s view, it is possible to rely upon. These three subjects—<i>Shmitta, Yovel</i>, and <i>Ribit</i>—each take a category of place, time, and person (<i>olam, shana</i>, <i>nefesh</i>). The acquisition of fields and vineyards is an acquisition of place and putting his trust in it. Concerning this the Blessed One commanded the <i>Shmitta.</i> That is to say, mankind cannot put his trust in places, but should rather see that they belong to God, for in the seventh (<i>Shmitta</i>) year there is no recognition of ownership in one’s acquisitions. Anyone can come and eat from his field. And thus he sees that the land is God’s.<br>Corresponding to placing one’s trust in time, meaning, relying on amassing wealth from selling time, which we call taking interest, the Torah says, “do not take interest from him.” The whole point of interest and the sale of time is discussed in the Gemara (<i>Baba Metsia</i>, 63b) which says, “all compensation of money for waiting [postponing paying a debt] is forbidden.”<br>As for man’s acquisition in people, where he trusts his ability to use servants for his needs, God commanded Israel to free slaves in the <i>Yovel</i> (the fiftieth year, the Jubilee). Thus he sees that he has no ownership of their bodies and must set them free. Even when they are slaves, God commanded “not to force him to serve with hard labor,” and to understand that the body of a servant is not his domain.<br>God commanded these three <i>mitzvot</i> to show man that he may not put his trust in anything connected to time, place, or person. Our trust is in God alone. This is why these three sections end with the statement, “I am Hashem your God who brought you out of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan.” Man cannot assume that since these things are prohibited God’s influence towards us is in any way reduced. “I am Hashem your God who took you out of <i>Mitsrayim</i> (Egypt).” <i>Mitsrayim</i> comes from the word for narrowness, <i>meitzar</i>, meaning limitation. This is to show how pleasures of the world that do not come from Holiness are rooted in narrowness and constriction. “To give you the land of Canaan,” that the goodness that God gives will be that of <i>Kedusha</i> (holiness) and we can extend it into our surroundings, for the goodness of <i>Kedusha</i> that is our inheritance from God<i> </i>is <i>“</i>an inheritance without narrowness [limitations].”",
                    "<i>“… and give the land a Sabbath unto Hashem.”</i><br><i>Shmitta</i> (the Sabbatical Year), is a sign for Israel that “the land is God’s and the fullness thereof.” Concerning this the holy Zohar says (<i>Bereshit</i> 3b), “[God created] large letters and small letters” referring to the occasional large or small letter in the Torah scroll. The word for sign as well as a letter in Hebrew is <i>oat</i>. The small <i>oat</i> is <i>Shabbat</i>.<i> Shabbat</i> is a sign for Israel. Shabbat is a sign that God motivates everything and man’s actions do nothing. The large letter is <i>Shmitta</i>, for with the passing of seven years there must necessarily be an entire year in which it is clear that the land is God’s, and that no man has the power of action, only God alone.",
                    "<i>“and you shall count seven Sabbaths of years … then proclaim with the call of the shofar… and each man shall return to his portion … in the</i> Yovel <i>year each man shall return to his possession.”</i> (Vayikra, 25:8–10)<br><i>Shmitta</i> and <i>Yovel</i> correspond to the behavior mentioned in the <i>Pirkei Avot</i> (Ch. 5:10), “[one who says] what is mine is yours, what is yours is yours [is a hasid].” <i>Shmitta</i>, the seventh rest year for the land,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shmitta</i> is the sabbath of the land, once every seven years, where agricultural work in the land of Israel is suspended, and the land lies fallow. Also the produce within fields and orchards are free for public consumption.</i> corresponds to the attribute of “what is mine is yours.” In one sense, “the land was given to mankind” (<i>Tehilim</i>, 115:16). One can acquire the land, bringing forth from it all the good things of the world. All manner of goodness in the world are included in the land, as it is written (<i>Kohollet</i> 3:20), “all was from the dust.” But still, in the seventh year he returns the land to God. At this time he voluntarily ceases from toil and working according to God’s will, keeping His ordinances. This is called “what is mine is yours.”<br>The <i>Yovel</i>, the fiftieth “jubilee” year,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the <i>Yovel</i> (Jubilee) year, once every fifty years, slaves are freed, and acquired property returns to its original owners.</i> corresponds to the next mode kind of behavior mentioned in the Mishna in <i>Avot</i>, “what is yours is yours.” This is because the commandment of <i>Yovel</i> requires that everyone gets back his possessions and returns to his family. Truly, God was fair in how He placed man in the land, dividing up the inheritance to each one according to his level and based on the root of his particular soul. He upheld each one on his particular banner, saying to them, “they are My servants” (see <i>Vayikra</i>, 25:42). And yet, a progression of events caused mankind to demand so many accounts from each other. This one had the merit of ascending and extending into another one’s land, or to purchase a slave to serve him, and the other descended and had to sell his possessions until he eventually had to sell his very body into slavery.<br>Yet since the word of God endures forever and cannot change based on the actions of mankind, God’s temporary judgments that pass over man will not reach the depth of the root of his soul. This is because God created a time for everything to return to its initial portion. Thus He created the <i>Yovel</i> year so that each could return to his place and to the portion God gave him, as it is said, “the <i>Yovel</i> year shall be holy to you” (<i>Vayikra</i>, 25:12).<br>During the <i>Yovel</i>, the light of God’s <i>Kedusha</i> will one day be revealed to all by means of the blast of the <i>shofar</i> on Yom Kippur. Each one will then recognize that the portion of his fathers that was given to him by God and will remain with him. But what of that which came to him from the actions of man? Even thought there was a purchase and sale placing him under another’s domain up to this point still he does not belong to the other one at his roots! He must be returned to the place that was initially given to him. This is God’s illumination in the <i>Yovel</i>, that everyone can return to his place, that everything has its own place. This recognition and understanding can come only after fulfilling the mitzvah of <i>Shmitta</i>, that is, delivering everything over to God, and by means this reaching the attribute of “what is yours is yours.”<br>This is recognizing the place ascribed to everything at its root, as in the saying of the Midrash (<i>Bereshit</i> Rabba, 43:19), “all is in the possession of the blind until God comes and opens their eyes.” This means that even though the mortal eye will see that this servant belongs to this master, and this field to this one who bought it, still, whoever God shines His light into and opens his eyes will see that all the actions of man will not create even the slightest change in the depths of God’s will. In the <i>Yovel</i> this light will be revealed. This is the attribute of “what is yours is yours,” and is greater than the attribute of “what is mine is yours.”<br>By means of <i>Shmitta</i> and <i>Yovel</i> he sees that all the good and wealth he has amassed not according to God’s will, but by his own efforts, does not belong to him even though it is in his possession. Therefore this <i>Parsha</i> warns against theft, deception, and interest, to show that in the future it will be clear that anything that came by means of these methods is not his. This is to counter the one who says to himself, “if it is true that eventually a person will have only what was originally given him by God, then all efforts to gain wealth, to acquire things or expand borders, are in vain. Only what God gave him will remain his.” Concerning this Shlomo haMelech said (Kohollet, 10:1), “a little folly is more precious than honor or wisdom.”<br>Although a man would tend to refrain from toil and acquisition if he understands that nothing gained by his own efforts will remain with him, there is this “little folly” pushing him to gather wealth even though he knows it is only temporary. Just the same, he is rewarded with the merit of the energy he exerted to a certain degree. Even though the time will come for everyone return to his portion and everything to return to its place, he still profits, for he will return to the other only the physical measure of what is allotted him. Yet the limit and the border that God set to recognize between one man’s portion and another’s will be added to his border since at the beginning he extended his border into theirs. In his very efforts to extend, a little security in the value of his toil remains for him, even from the other’s portion that will be returned. Thus from all the efforts that one exerts in this world, this understanding will remain with him forever.",
                    "<i>“And you shall not wrong one another, and you shall fear your God ….”</i> (Vayikra, 25:17)<br>This verse is also directed to great and precious souls who see another going against God’s will, accusing him and deeming him fit for punishment. On this the Holy One, blessed be He said, “do not wrong one another,” and similarly did David haMelech say (<i>Tehilim</i>, 50:20–21, following R. Hirsch’s translation), “You sit and speak against your brother, you slander your own mother’s son. You have done these things, and I stood by in silence, so you thought I was the same as you. Therefore I will reprove you, and set them in order before your eyes.” “You sit and speak against your brother, you slander your own mother’s son” means that he does so even though he is obliged to love his neighbor, as is commanded of him (<i>Vayikra</i>, 19:18), “you shall love your neighbor as yourself.” Man is supposed to pray to God to be merciful with his fellow, yet here he is judgmental and accuses! Therefore God says, “you have done these things, and I stood by in silence.” If God sees fit to clarify matters, then even the actions of the <i>Tsaddikim</i> will not be meritorious in His eyes, for in the presence of God who can justify himself, and who can say, “I have refined my heart?” (Mishlei 20:9) And still, God is silent, not revealing the shame of any man even if he sins.<br>“You thought that I was the same as you,” for he who brings accusations against his fellow man considers himself and his actions as refined as the very will of God. He believes wholeheartedly that it is God’s will when he accuse the man who sins. To this grave error God says, “Therefore I will reprove you, and set them in order before your eyes.” God will reveal the truth to the face of one who points to the guilt of his neighbor and declares that it is God’s will that he do so. God reproves him by showing that His will is only to conceal all the sins of Israel. This is it written (Micha, 7:19), “and cast all their sins to the depths of the sea.”<br>He will conceals man’s sins them to the point where they are never seen again. So how could one say that God wants us to expose our neighbor’s guilt, expanding upon their sins?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, of blessed memory used to say, “Before Passover, don’t mess around with another man’s Chametz.</i> Even though God indeed commanded man to reprove his neighbor when he sees wrongdoing, and to try to distance his fellow from all evil as much as is possible, this is only possible in a place where he clearly knows he can help him by bringing him to the good,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Yevamot, 65b, “just as it is a mitzvah to say something that will be listened to, it is a mitzvah not to say something that will not be listened to.”</i> or through prayer, which arouses God’s compassion and returns him to the observance of the Torah. However, if he cannot return him to the fold, he should rather judge him meritoriously and not accuse him. Thus it is inconceivable that one could judge his neighbor as guilty, for perhaps his neighbor’s <i>yetser hara</i>, his inclination to evil, is greater than his own. Or, perhaps what he sees as an error or sin is actually permitted to his neighbor, for there are many things that are forbidden to one but permitted to another.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Such as how a Cohen cannot marry a divorcee and the like. Furthermore a posek [halakhic authority] can give rabbinic dispensation to a person and permit something that would otherwise be forbidden. Here the author refers to cases withing the bounds of the law (issur ve’heter). In other places in the book the so called sin is evaluated according to the more radical Izbitzian sense, i.e. though it may look or even be wrong in the eyes of the community, it is infact God’s will.</i>",

This passage teaches that such a situation only arises when man sins in affairs between him and the Omnipresent. Although this arouses the attribute of stern judgment, forced to sell his property or be sold as a servant, it is not forever! He will go free in the <i>Yovel</i> and return to his portion. However, a man may arouse God’s judgment when committing a sin between him and his fellow man, and the prime example of this is (the grave sin of) shaming another person in public.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Talmud in Bava Metzia 58b equates public shaming with murder</i> This is what the verse meant when it said, “if a man shall sell his house in a walled city.” The tongue is “a house in a walled city,” as it says (<i>Arachin</i>, 15b), “I have given you two walls, the lips!” By means of this he could, God forbid, sell and lose all his merits, and another could buy them. On this Shlomo haMelech said (Mishlei, 25:28), “He who cannot control his own spirit is like a city with its walls broken down.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It needs to be noted that the word <i>ruach</i>, “spirit,” can also mean breath, and hence one who refrains from using his breath and voice to shame another.</i> The advice?  Reconcile with him within a year, as it says, “for a full year he shall have the right of redemption.” “And if it not be redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established forever to him that bought it throughout the generations,” as if to say that if he does not reconcile with his fellow man, then all his merits will permanently remain with his fellow.<br>This is the explanation of the difference between the “<i>kri </i>and the <i>ketav</i>.” Sometimes a word in the Torah is spelled one way, the <i>ketav</i>, but read another way, the <i>kri</i>. “The house that is in the walled city” or “the house which has a wall” is written in Hebrew <i>asher lo homa. Lo</i> is written in Hebrew <i>lamed aleph</i>, which would mean “which does not have a wall.” However, we read it as if it were written as <i>lamed vav</i>, “has,” or, “which has a wall.”  A man who has no control over his emotions has no wall, and the one who controls his emotions has a wall.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Isaac of Komarno ztz”l in his Otzar HaChaiim teaches that the <i>kri</i> “sweetens” the <i>ketav</i>.

This is a problem. As we read in the Sifre (<i>Shoftim</i> 6), “even though it was beloved before Me in the days of the Patriarchs,” in our generations, man only sacrifices his life to avoid three cardinal transgressions (sexual offence, idolatry, and murder). It is only in the <i>Beit Hamikdash</i> (the Holy Temple) that a man can completely abandon his intellect before God."

                "Bechukotai": [
                    "<i>“If you walk in My statutes ….”</i> (Vayikra 26:3)<br>It is written in the Midrash (<i>Yalkut Shemoni</i> Mishlei, Ch. 22), (<i>Tehilim</i>, 111:10) “The beginning of wisdom is the fear of God. It is also written (Mishlei 22:4), ‘following humility [on the heel of humility] is the fear of God.’ The same thing that made wisdom a crown for the head, made humility the heel for the sole.” Through contemplation and investigating God’s intentions for all that He created, you may naturally come to the conclusion that there is a Creator and Master of the world. But this is only when he starts to bring himself close to Torah Study, and at that time this wisdom is called <i>Yirah</i>, the fear of God. This is because once you know that there is a Creator and Master, you will listen to God’s voice and experience <i>Yirah</i> before Him. Yet if you achieves the quality of <i>Anavah</i>, humility, then you can attain <i>Yirah</i> in the blink of an eye, with no need to search your soul in order to achieve it. Rather, it is simple and clear. This is, “If you walk in My statutes (<i>chokim</i>).”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Statute,” <i>Chok</i> in Hebrew, is closely related to the word for carve, <i>Chokek.</i></i> Then (through this process) God’s statutes will be carved (<i>chakuk</i>) into your hearts.",
                    "<i>“If you walk in My statutes, and keep My mitzvot, and do them.”</i> (Vayikra, 26:3)<br>All the while that God’s <i>Kedusha</i> is not carved<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See previous note.</i> and permanently installed into man’s heart, he is called “standing.” In this state he needs to constrict himself for the time being, not extending himself according to his own will. For now it is preferable to refrain from action. And with regards to walking? When a man turns to the Torah to the extent that it is carved in his heart, installed in his being, he can then extend himself and go wherever his desires leads him, for God is with him. This is as it is said in the Midrash (<i>Devarim</i> Rabba, <i>Parsha</i> 2:1), “Is there is a Jewish stranger?!” As the story goes (Yalkut  Vaietchanan Rabba, 825 ) there was a ship filled sailors there was one Jew. They sailed across the heart of the sea, and when they reached a port the sailors told the Jew, “go to town and bring us food and drink.” He said to them, “but I am a wayfarer, a stranger. They don’t know me at all and won’t sell me anything.” The sailors said, “Is there such a thing as a Jewish stranger? Wherever you go your God is with you, as the Torah says, (Devarim 4:7), ‘For what great nation is there that has a god so close at hand as is the LORD our God whenever we call upon Him?’” (The wayfarer thought he was standing, but the sailors reminded him that he has the natural ability to walk, i.e. go from place to place without even thinking because he has internalized the Torah to the point where it inseparable from his being.) Similarly we read in the Gemara (<i>Shabbat</i>, 31b), “when it says in the Torah, ‘At the commandment of the Hashem they encamped, and at the commandment of the Hashem they traveled,’ it was like demolishing in order to rebuild on the same site.”",
                    "<i>“If you walk in My statutes, and keep My mitzvot, and do them.”</i> (Vayikra, 26:3)<br>It is written in the Midrash (<i>Vayikra</i> Rabba, 35:1), “I considered my way, and I turned my feet back to Your testimonies (<i>Tehilim</i>, 119:59). Each day I would plan on going to a certain place, but my feet brought me to the house of prayer and the house of study.” Would it ever occur to you that David haMelech walked around and wasted his time with the mundane and the insignificant!? Furthermore, if his feet would lead him to the house of study and his intention was not for the sake of Heaven, then it would be like the principle “I worked hard and did not succeed,” and there is no success without struggle.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the last selection in <i>Parshat Vayeitse</i> on “I worked hard but didn’t succeed.”</i> A man must struggle in this world. If he brings himself to be purified, yes, (as the Midrash says) he will be helped to find all goodness, but not without a struggle. When you go deeply into one subject in Torah you will find it so incredibly precious that other subjects in the Torah will seem small in comparison. This is as we find in the Gemara (<i>Shabbat</i>, 10a), “Those who occupy themselves with prayer but neglect to study Torah are called abandoning eternal life and occupied with temporary life.”<br> With all subjects in the Torah there are so many levels, higher and higher. With regard to this the Gemara (in <i>Megillah</i>, 15a) tells us, “The way of the Holy One, blessed be He, is not like the way of flesh and blood. Man first prepares the pot on the fire, and then pours the water into it. Hashem first pours the water, and then prepares the pot, as it is written (in Yirmiya, 10:13), ‘with the sound of His gathering a multitude of water in the heavens. (First God set the multitude of waters in place, and then after He created the heavens to hold them.) It is man’s nature that when he wants to do something he first imagines it, considering what benefit he will receive from the action, and then does it. This is called “preparing the pot.” He prepares the vessels of reception, i.e, thinks if and how to receive. Then he receives. In other words his action is the reception of that which he has prepared.<br>The way of the Holy One, blessed be He, is not thus. Rather, He first places the water, and then prepares the pot. With regards to Torah and the mitzvot, He commanded us to learn and do with all our hearts and souls, but not according to the measurement of the boundary of our intellect by estimating the how good the action is. Rather, His will must be fulfilled without any human preparation, just to gaze at His presence and be drawn after His will. Then after, the Holy One, blessed be He, will show man the depth of wisdom and the good hidden within the action. This is called “pouring the water.”<br>That is, man is to first fulfill God’s will with simplicity, and then afterward God “prepares the pot,” showing him the benefits of the action. This is as David haMelech said, “I considered my way. Each day I would plan on going to a certain place.” He feared that he might fulfill God’s will only according to the (human limitation and the) understanding of his intellect. The awesome depth of God’s will is here like a mundane action, because God wants us to fulfill His will without any preparation from our side (see previous section on Vayikra 26:3).<br>This is as it is said, “ ‘I considered my way.’ The way is bothersome, the way is troulbled.” (<i>Berachot</i>, 11a) Even if he goes to perform a mitzvah it is still called “his way,” for when he goes even to do a mitzvah, yet does it only according to the limittions of his intellect, he is troubled. This is not the case when his path is to fulfill God’s will with simplicity, for then he is not at all troubled but rather trusts that God will help him since he is acting with simplicity. “And I turned my feet back to Your testimonies.” Here David haMelech is saying, “even though I thought that perhaps I was not completely fulfilling His will, God showed me that I had not turned away from it even to a hair’s breadth. I was in the houses of prayer and the houses of study.” Thus his desire was only in places inhabited God, (where God’s presence is revealed.)<br>This is the explanation of “and I turned my feet back to Your testimonies.” A testimony is something clear. When man stands firm before God without turning to any human wants, his mind is clear, undisturbed, and strong. He is not afraid. We find (in <i>Devarim</i> Rabba, 2:2) that when Moshe Rabeynu desired to enter the land of Israel, “his desire melted like a moth” (Tehilim 42:12).” The Gemara (in <i>Sotah</i>, 14a) asks, “did he need to enjoy of the fruits of the land?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The text of the Gemara (<i>Succa</i>, 14a) reads: “Why did Moshe Rabeynu desire to enter the land of Israel? Did he want to eat of its fruits or satisfy himself from its produce? But Moshe said, ‘Many precepts were commanded to Israel which can only be fulfilled in the land of Israel. I wish to enter the land so that they may all be fulfilled by me.’ The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, ‘are you looking only to receive the reward? I will count it as if you performed them.’”</i> He great desire was to fulfill the mitzvot that could only be done in Eretz Yisrael and receive their eternal reward, and still, “his desire melted like a moth.” From the point of view of God’s will Moshe’s heavenly desire was akin to an earthly desire, as the fulfillment of mitzvot and God’s will must be without any kind of external hue.<br>This is the explanation of “if you will walk in my testimonies.” The formulation “If” points to uncertainty. Even if a man goes in the way of the Torah, still he needs to be uncertain if he is completely fulfilling God’s will, for God’s will is so deep and who can fathom it? This is as we find with David haMelech, who feared that perhaps he was not completely fulfilling God’s will. He said (in the <i>Tehilim</i>, 18:12), “God spreads out darkness as His secret place, and His immediate surroundings are His covering, darkness of waters, thick clouds of the heavens.” “He spreads (<i>yashet</i>) darkness as His veil” is to say that man’s darkness is his uncertainty. He fears that he is not completely fulfilling God’s will. Through this the secret place the truth of Torah will be revealed to him. Here, <i>yashet</i>, “He spreads out,” means revelation, as in (Shmuel 1, 2:8), “[for the pillars of the world are God’s] and He has set (<i>yashet</i>) the world revealed upon them.” By means of the very darkness the hidden depth is revealed to him, precisely because it brings about uncertainty over the Torah Study. Through this process (of confronting his uncertainty about the Torah and fulfilling God’s will) he will arrive at their truth.<br>This is as it is written in the Gemara (<i>Baba Metsia</i>, 84a), “Reb Yochanan said that Reish Lakish used to offer him twenty-four difficulties in the law, and then he would give back twenty-four possible solutions. The in depth challenge deepened his understanding of the Law.” Thus when man experiences uncertainty, perhaps he is distanced from God and now knows that he has to bring himself closer. “His immediate surrounding are His covering [literally, <i>succa</i>].” Then God reveals to man that He is surrounding and covering him even in places he cannot reach. And in those places,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Places he does not understand.</i> God will guard him from deviating from His intentions. “The darkness of waters,” or a man whose lusts and desires bring him into a place of darkness. This frightens him and causes him to question whether he is fulfilling God’s will. Here water symbolizes desire, for the most compelling desire in the world is thirst.<br>“Thick clouds of the heavens.” His desires place him in the darkness, so God reveals to him that he has the power to fulfill mitzvot that seem to contradict one another. “Thick clouds” are practical mitzvot, from the term “thick” (tangible). <i>Shechakim</i>, “the heavens” are subjects that contradict one another, for when two opposing forces meet they will pound (<i>yeshachaku</i>) each other. God will shine into his eyes to the truth of these seemingly contradictory mitzvot. We confront mitzvot like the eradication of Amalek which appears to be extreme cruelty. And of the <i>mesit</i>, a Jew who incites other Jews to abandon of the Torah, the Torah tells us (<i>Devarim</i>, 13:9), “do not be merciful.” And yet we see how Holy One, blessed be He, warns of being ever compassionate. Just as it is easy for man to be compassionate, so too it will be easy for him to do the opposite. He is drawn after God’s will and according to God’s will it is easy for him to do it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Man cannot conceive of two opposites being true. This is because man wants to be at peace without simultaneously fighting two opposites. But indeed, one who is drawn after God’s will is not partial to any one side, and God will shine this knowledge into him. Therefore the Patriarchs are called a <i>merkava</i> (chariot) for the <i>Shechina</i>, because they are drawn after God’s will. <i>Tashlum Mei HaShiloach.</i></i> We find an example of this with the war of Avraham Avinu. Even though his main attribute was <i>Chesed</i> (kindness) he stood firm when tested on all sides and routed the kings of Sodom according to God’s will.",
                    "<i>“And you shall eat old store [the obsolete], and you shall take out the old because of the new.”</i> (Vayikra, 26:10)<br>“Old” is a place where man begin to give up on something. “Obsolete” is when he has already given up completely. The Holy One, blessed be He, promises him that he will yet see benefit from these actions, for God will heal and give them for the good. This happens when man takes it upon himself to fulfill God’s words in justice and refrain from transgressing His will. When the verse says, “He will take out the old because of the new,” it hints as man’s resolution to fulfill God’s world with justice and not trust that the Holy One, blessed be He, will be compassionate with him. This is as it is said in the Gemara (<i>Chagiga</i>, 16a), “do not let your evil inclination incite you by saying, ‘sin, and God will forgive you.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Gemara (<i>Chagiga</i>, 16a) reads: “Rabbi Yehuda son of Rabbi Nahmani, the translator of Reish Lakish, expounded: What is the meaning of the verse, “Do not trust in a friend, do not put your confidence in a familiar friend?” If the evil inclination say to you: Sin and the Holy One, blessed be He, will forgive you, do not believe it, for it is said: ‘Do not trust in a friend,’ and ‘friend’ means none other than one’s evil inclination, for it is said: ‘For the inclination of man’s heart is evil.’ And ‘familiar friend’ is none other than the Holy One, blessed be He, for it is said: You are the familiar friend of my youth.”</i> Rather, consider all of your actions carefully. This is as has been explained on the verse, “on the day of Shabbat, on the day of Shabbat you shall arrange,” above in <i>Parshat Emor.</i>",
                    "<i>“And you shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall devour you.”</i> (Vayikra, 26:38)<br>It is written in the Gemara (<i>Makkot</i>, 24),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The text of the Gemara (<i>Makkot</i>, 24a) reads: Rav said, “I have misgivings about that verse, ‘And you shall perish among the nations’” (<i>Vayikra</i>, 36:38). Rav Papa challenged this, saying, “Could it not perhaps rather be taken in the sense of something lost and searched for (as <i>avad</i> in Hebrew could mean both perished or lost), as it is written, ‘I have gone astray like a lost sheep, seek Your servant’” (<i>Tehilim</i>, 119:176). But it was the latter part of the verse that perplexed Rav, “And the land of your enemies shall eat you up.” Mar Zutra then pointed out a difficulty, saying, “Might it not be understood in the way that cucumbers and pumpkins are eaten? (For they ripen at different times in different parts of the country. This could hint at national schism and strife that would lead to conquest by a foreign nation.)”</i> “‘Rav said, I have misgivings about that verse, ‘And you shall perish among the nations.’ Rav Papa responded, ‘Could it not perhaps be understood as something lost and searched for, as it is written, I have gone astray like a lost sheep. Seek Your servant.’” Rav was perplexed at the sin of a nocturnal emission, where it seems in this case that man is lost and there is no way to rectify the situation. Therefore he was answered with “perhaps it could be understood as something lost and searched for,” meaning that God has the power to return everything to <i>Kedusha, </i>(Sanctity. R. Pinchas of Koretz ztz”l mentions in his work <i>Imrei Pinchas</i> that regardless of the Zohar’s claim that there is no way to repent for wasting seed, this is only from man’s side, but God can be merciful.) After this, the Gemara continues, “what really perplexes me is the second half of the verse, ‘and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.’” This refers to the sin of having relations with an Aramite (i.e. a Gentile) which seems to be even further from the possibility to rectify (as the offspring isn’t Jewish). Thus he was answered, “It is like the way squash and pumpkins are eaten.” It is the nature of squash and pumpkins that once they are plucked from above to ground, they immediately return and sprout again. In the same way, God can fix even this (such as sending the son or daughter the desire to convert back to Judaism), for he will make it clear that no sin existed in Israel at their roots, God forbid.",

Four kinds of redeeming are mentioned: houses, fields, people, and animals. This corresponds to the four times the word “seven” is written in the verses of rebuke.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As in (<i>Vayikra</i>, 26:28), “and I will chastise you seven times over your sins.”</i> “Seven” represents how God is exacting down to a hair’s breadth. For this, He gave us four ways to redeem ourselves. This is not that the man himself does the redeeming, but rather that if one sees that another needs redeeming, he can redeem him. This is as it is said in the Gemara (<i>Arachin</i>, 20a), “one who says, ‘the value of so is upon me.’” In the section dealing with values for redeeming (Ch. 27), we find thirty-three verses, not counting the verse “and God spoke,” and the final verse “these are the mitzvot,” which do not deal with the subject of values. These correspond exactly to the thirty-three verses of rebuke. Corresponding to the verse (<i>Vayikra</i>, 26:38), “and you shall be destroyed among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall devour you,” which is the greatest of all fears, is the verse (<i>Vayikra</i>, 27:25), “and every estimation shall be according the holy shekel.” In this way, every verse in the section of values for redeeming corresponds to a verse in the <i>Parsha</i> of stern rebuke in order to bring redemption to all that is said there."

                    "<i>“And God spoke to Moshe in the wilderness of Sinai in the Tent of Appointed Meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year from their departure from the land of Egypt, saying, Raise [count] the heads of all the congregation of the children of Israel.”</i> (Bamidbar, 1:1–2)<br>“Raise” signifies importance. By means of counting the numbers of each tribes, every individual will know his special importance. This is as it is written (Hoshea, 2:1), “And the number of the children of Israel will be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or counted.” This verse seems to contradict itself (v. Gemara <i>Yoma</i>, 22b), for at the beginning it says, “and the number,” implying that they can be counted, and at the end it says, “which cannot be measured.” But in truth, the community of Israel as a whole is without number, and what was said, “and the number,” was said concerning the specific souls of Israel, that each one should have a number.<br>This is said in the sense that something that is counted will be important in the eyes of God, as it is written (<i>Tehilim</i>, 87:6–5, Tr. of Hirsch), “God will count when he registers the peoples.” “But of Zion it is said, every man that was born there, the Most High maintains her thus.” “God will count when He registers the peoples” meaning that the Providence of the Holy One, blessed be He, also extends to the nations of the world. Not in an individual way, but in a general way for the maintenance of the species. “But of Zion it is said, every man that was born there, the Most High maintains her thus” means that the Providence of the Holy One, blessed be He, is over each individual soul.<br>This is the meaning of “and the number of the children of Israel,” that each and every one will be absolutely necessary. The greatness of God is seen in the entire community of Israel as a whole, and if just one member of that community is missing then the mixture will be deficient. It is as if the image of the king were made up of a mosaic of many small parts, and if just one of the parts were missing, then the picture of the king would be lacking. So at the time when each member of Israel is counted, then He is the greatness in all of Israel, for each one of Israel is a portion of God. This is as it is written (<i>Devarim</i>, 32:9), “for His nation is a portion of God.” Each individual possesses one of the attributes of the Holy One, blessed be He, and at the time when that individual is counted, then God himself is present in that attribute which he possesses, and clearly whatever is being counted is at that time the greatest of all. This is how each member of Israel has a special state of elevation.",
                    "<i>“… in the wilderness of Sinai, in the Tent of Appointed Meeting ….”</i> (Bamidbar, 1:1)<br>It is written in the Holy Zohar (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 117a), “since the Torah and the <i>Mishkan</i> [Tabernacle] were established, the Holy One, blessed be He, wanted to count its soldiers, how many soldiers there were for the Torah and how many soldiers there were for the <i>Mishkan</i>.” This can be understood through what is written in the Tikkunei Zohar (70a), (the word) “In the Beginning (<i>Bereshit</i>, in Hebrew, which can be divided into, <i>Bet Reshit</i>) means two beginnings. These ‘two beginnings’ are the two mitzvot, ‘and you shall contemplate [the <i>mitzvot</i>] day and night,’ and the commandment of the king to write a second Torah scroll [in addition to the one that every Jew is commanded to write].” Even when man thinks about doing something good, still he needs to refine and clean his heart from all dross and refuse. If he does not, then this action will also not be complete but lacking. We find this even with the Patriarchs, all of whose actions were for the sake of Heaven. However, at the times when their intentions were not the deepest levels of God’s will, this manifested itself in later generations in souls that were not good. For when it comes to thought, then there is no <i>tsaddik</i> in the land who can say, “I have refined my heart and purified my mind,” as is explained in the verse (<i>Shemot</i>, 13:18), “and the children of Israel left Egypt armed.”<br>This is as King David said (<i>Tehilim</i>, 93:2), “Your throne is <i>meaz</i> (henceforth) established, You who are everlasting,” and Holy Zohar (in <i>Shemot</i> 54a) shows how the word <i>meaz</i> which is made up of an <i>aleph</i> and a <i>zayin, “aleph</i> rides on <i>zayin.” Aleph</i> teaches of the beginning of a thought, and <i>zayin</i> (also meaning seven) teaches of the completed action, for <i>zayin</i> corresponds to the seven days of creation. So when the thought is connected to the action it is then called <i>az</i>, <i>aleph</i> and <i>zayin</i> together. This is the explanation of the two mitzvot mentioned above. “And you shall contemplate the Torah night and day” corresponds to thought and will in complete accordance with God’s will, and the commandment for the king to write an additional Torah scroll corresponds to action. This is why it is called “a commandment for the king,” because the actions of King David were greatly refined in God’s will. This is the explanation of “soldiers of the Torah and Soldiers of the <i>Mishkan</i>.” “Soldiers of the Torah” is the power of thought and the desires of Israel for the Torah Study. “Soldiers of the <i>Mishkan</i>” are Torah Study that is instilled as a dwelling in the heart of Israel to the extent that even the actions that come into being are an expression of God’s will.",
                    "<i>“Count the heads … number them according to their armies, you and Aharon. And a man of each tribe shall be with you ….”</i> (Bamidbar, 1:2–4)<br>The matter of counting relates to what is said in the Gemara (<i>Berachot</i>, 58a), “one man’s mind is not similar to another’s.” God allotted goodness and life to each individual, and no one is similar to his fellow. Therefore it is said, “count [literally, “raise”] the head,” or to stand each one in his proper place. By means of this he will be in his place, prominent and elevated. Therefore it is said, “you and Aharon,” because Aharon corresponds to the “soldiers of the Mishkan [Tabernacle],” which signifies Divine service, and Moshe signifies the “soldiers of the Torah.” All of the life of Israel is included in these two, Torah and service. “And a man of each tribe shall be with you,” for the prince of the tribe knows the proper place of each one in his tribe. If he were to exchange one man’s place for another’s, then the condition of the tribe would be incomplete. This may be likened to one who plants a garden in an intricate order, where if one planting is missing or exchanged for another, then it will be clear that the garden is not complete. And Israel is called (Yesahaya, 61:3), the planting of God in which He is glorified.”",
                    "<i>“And with you shall be a man of each tribe, he is the head of his father’s house.”</i> (Bamidbar, 1:4)<br>This shows that each tribe needs three; a Moshe, an Aharon, and the prince of the tribe. This was according to the law and judgment whereby a portion of the <i>Kedusha</i> of the Patriarchs exists within each tribe. The number of the members of each tribe went according to the way in which these three saw how many souls this <i>Kedusha</i> could be divided and spread forth, and this was the number of the members of the tribe. We find this in the Gemara (in <i>Baba Batra</i>, 121b) which says, “Yair son of Menashe was equal to the greater part of the Sanhedrin,” and they needed these three: Moshe, Aharon, and the prince of the tribe. This intimates what is written in the holy Zohar (<i>Shemot</i>, 200a), “there are three points to the Torah.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This Zohar is discussed in the <i>Mei HaShiloach</i> in <i>Parshat Ki Teitse</i>, “if you happen on a bird’s nest.”</i> Thus we find that when one wants to enjoy anything in this world should see that it meets three qualifications. First, it should be sweet to the palate. Second, it should not damage his health. This is as it is written in the Gemara (<i>Pesachim</i>, 42b), “Everything that is good for this one is bad for the other one.” And third, he should not be too immersed in this delight and make sure that he is well for the rest of his life. If the delight disturbs him too much, he will not take care to prepare tomorrow’s needs.<br>Thus it is with matters of Torah. First, a man must look towards the world to come and not disturb himself with worldly matters. Second, he must not harm anyone of Israel, as all of Israel makes up one body and if he harms another it is as if he is harming one of his own limbs. Third, the man must take care that it is also good for him. Thus the Zohar (<i>Vayikra</i>, 53b) calls Moshe Rabeynu, “the agent of the King,” as he was appointed by God to see that when the nation of Israel expands, it does not, God forbid, expand against God’s will. Aharon is called “the agent of the Queen,” and it was his job to see that when each tribe expands it does not do so in a way that distresses other tribes. Each prince would stand by its tribe when it was drawing a flow of goodness and increase, making sure that the increase was for the good. Just as these three judged the situation according to these three points, so would be the number of people in the tribe.",
                    "Of the tribe of Gad it is said, “the family of Izni.” In <i>Parshat Pinchas</i>, Rashi explains, “Izni is the Etsbon family, and I do not know why the name was changed.” This can be understood according to the passage in the Gemara (<i>Ketubot</i>, 5b), “Why are the man’s fingers [<i>Etsbaot</i>, like the name of the Etsbon family] of man shaped like a spike? This way, if he hears something improper, he can close his ears with his fingers.” Therefore when they descended into the impure air of Egypt, they went by the name Etsbon (like finger), for they would close their ears in order not to receive anything that was not God’s will. Then when they entered the land of Israel, where the air is filled with <i>Kedusha</i>, they were called “<i>Izni</i> [whch means ear],” for their ears were open to hear and receive the <i>Kedusha</i> of God from the goodness of the land.",
                    "<i>“And God spoke to Moshe and Aharon saying, each man shall camp according to his banner, with the sign of his father’s house, the children of Israel shall camp encompassing the tent of appointed meeting.”</i> (Vayikra, 2:1)<br>On the verse in Shir HaShirim, “What will we see in the Shulamite, as the dance of Machanayim,” the Midrash (Tanchuma, on <i>Bamidbar</i>, 11) tells us that this verse refers to the camping of the tribes. It tells us that the Nations say “return—we will make you leaders and noblemen,” and Israel responds, “you could not come close to giving us the greatness that Hashem gave us in telling us how to camp in the desert.” When we camped according to the banners, each one was standing on his rightful place at his root, and he knew his place. In the same way the names of the princes of each tribe teaches of the preciousness included in every member of that tribe.<br>“[The prince] of Yehuda was Nachson ben Aminadav.” <i>Nachson</i> teaches of anger as it is related to the word for snake, “<i>nachash</i>.” It appeared as if the tribe of Yehuda was angry. Therefore God testified that Yehuda’s anger was actually filled with the spirit of generousity. The last three letters in Aminadav, are the root of the word for generosity, <i>nedivut</i>. <i>Ben, </i>“son of,” shares two letters with <i>havanna</i>, or understanding. He was called <i>Ben Ami Nadav</i>, which could be interpreted to mean, “one who understands from My generous people.” At the depths he was filled with the generosity. This is akin to what we find in the holy Zohar (in <i>Vayikra</i>, 40b) about King David, from the tribe of Yehuda. The holy Zohar says, “[The king establishes the land by justice,] but he who demands gifts overthrows it (Mishlei, 29:4). ‘He who demands gifts’ is Eisav. But did not David also demand gifts? With David it is different, for of him it is written, ‘with beautiful eyes.’ [Shmuel 1, 16:12].” Because the Torah describes David’s red hair, he appeared angry. This is as we find in the Midrash (<i>Bereshit</i> Rabba, 63:11), “when Shmuel saw the redness of David, he feared that he was one who would spill blood like Eisav, so the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, ‘look at his beautiful eyes.’ This one [Eisav] takes it upon himself to kill. Yet David doesn’t, but rather follows the judgment of the Sanhedrin.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Eyes hint at the Sanhedrin, as it is written in the Eyts Chaiim of the Ari’zal, (Gate 8, Ch. 1) the eye corresponds to wisdom, which are the vowels, and this is why the sages the community are called the “eyes of the congregation,” as it is written (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 15:24), “if a mistake is made that is not seen by the eyes of the community.”</i><br>“Of Yissachar was Netanel ben Tsooar.” “Netanel” which literally means “given from God,” means that God gives <i>Chochma</i> (wisdom) in his heart. “Tsu’ar” is related to the word <i>tsa’ir</i> “young.” He saw himself as small and young, and as such knew that he had no power from his own side. Thus he was a vessel ready to receive all of God’s effusion. “Tsu’ar,” in the sense of young, also shows that he knew his place, and knew who he was smaller than in comparison. God effused understanding unto him, and the Midrash tells us that he was the first one to give the advice to offer sacrifices at the inauguration of the Tabernacle (<i>Bamidbar</i> Rabba, 12:19). This advice was effused unto him directly from God, so therefore his very name means “given from God,” as God gave him <i>Chochma.</i> Notwithstanding his divinely bestowed wisdom and understanding, he still knew his place, knowing who he was younger and smaller than. In this he knew that Yehuda was sovereign over his brothers and should offer the first sacrifice.<br>“And for Zevulun, Eliav ben Cheilon.” There is great strength in this tribe. The name “Eliav ben Cheilon” teaches of this. <i>Cheil</i>, (as in <i>eshet chayil</i>) means soldiers, valor, strength. All their strength was only from the forms of <i>Chochma</i> that God effused unto them. Thus even when they were occupied with worldly matters God effused strength and vigor unto them in order to succeed. This is Eliav ben Cheilon, for <i>Av</i>, meaning “father,” represents wisdom,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As is understood from the verse in Mishlei, “a father in wisdom.” Also God’s name E-l refers to strength.</i> and, <i>Cheilan</i> represents strength, as mentioned above.<br>“For Reuven, Elitsoor ben Shdeioor.” <i>Elitsoor</i> means strength, from the word for rock, <i>Tsoor</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">God, in His attribute of power, is also called <i>Tsoor</i>, the Rock.</i> <i>Shdeioor</i> teaches that all his strength comes from the great light that God illuminates (<i>Shadday</i> is God the Almighty, and <i>or</i> is light). This is precisely true for the tribe of Reuven, as Reuven signifies sight (<i>Reu</i> means see, hence light). Thus he sees in every situation how he is standing in the presence of God. In this he is aroused to great <i>simcha</i> (joy), as it is written (Mishlei, 15:30), “Joy comes to the heart from the light of the eyes.”<br>“For Shimon, Shlumiel ben TsooriShaddai.” <i>Shloomiel</i> means that his heart is faithful to God (<i>Shloom</i>—<i>Shalem</i>, or faithfulness. <i>E-l</i>—God). <i>Ben TsooriShaddai</i> and because his heart is faithful God will save him. (Again, <i>Tsoori</i>, “my Rock” and Shaddai as the Almighty God who brings salvation.)<br>“For Gad, Elyasaf ben Deu’el.” In other words, even though God gives him the power to gather (<i>assaf</i>) all the good in the world, still, he recognizes that the Creator is in control (<i>Deu’el</i> means “knows God”), and will not cease from upholding the Torah even when wealthy. At times when he is in the attribute of love he is called <i>Reu’el</i>, from the word for beloved friend, <i>Reiah.</i> Then at the time when he is in the attribute of the fear he is called <i>Deu’el</i>, the fear that brings about the knowledge of God. Owing to this, in the section of the offerings of the princes, he gave the sin offerings, meaning that each one understood where he was lacking and there precisely was the principal state of completeness, for real completeness is when one recognizes his deficiency. This is as it is written (Kohellet, 10:1), “more precious than wisdom or honor is a little foolishness.” This is why he is called <i>Deu’el</i> when he is offering the sacrifices, for when a man comes to the state of completeness he needs fear.<br>“For the tribe of Yosef, Efriam Elishama ben Amihud.” This concerns the place when one is overpowered by the lust for any good, for the name, <i>Elishama</i> is related to (Mishlei, 15:30), “a good report [<i>Shmua</i>] fattens the bones.” All kinds of good come forth from the place where man is overpowered by lust, and this is “<i>ben Amihud</i>,” “<i>Imo Hod</i>,” the majesty is with him. <i>Hod</i>, or majesty (also splendor) is a place where a man yearns, and then is wholly subdued before the object of his yearning, dwelling beneath it. In a place of evil God commanded, “you shall not bow yourself down,” meaning not to be subdued beneath it. So was it with Yosef, even though he did not listen to his master’s wife, as it is said in the Midrash (Tanchuma, Nasso, 28), “He listened to God [similar in meaning to “Elishama,” “Hear, God”], and did not listen to his master’s wife. And still, he married her daughter.” This is hinted at in “<i>ben Amihud</i>,” (meaning “the Majesty of God is with him”) for he yearns for the good according to God’s will.<br>“For Menashe, Gamliel ben P’dahtsoor.” The name Gamliel is connected to the letter <i>gimel</i>, where the foot at the bottom left, “stepping outside,” as is said in the Gemara and the holy Zohar (<i>Bereshit</i>, 244b), “The <i>gimel</i> brings.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Parshat Shmini</i> (see “of the Camel”) refers to the following Gemara (<i>Shabbat</i>, 104a): “For what reason is the face of the letter <i>gimel</i> turned towards the letter that follows it, <i>dalet</i>? For it is the nature of those who do acts of kindness (<i>gomlei chassidim</i>—the same letters as “<i>gimel</i>”).</i> “<i>ben P’dahtsoor,”</i> even in a place where he goes outside,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meaning, surpassing the limits.</i> God, the Rock, will redeem him (<i>P’dah</i>—redeem; <i>Tsoor</i>—rock).<br>“For Binyamin, Avidan ben Gidoni.” Since Binyamin would stand on the border of Eretz Yisrael and gather in all kinds of goodness from among the nations, bringing them into Israel, he was therefore called “ben Gidoni,” as he knew which kind of “goodness” was not proper, hewing it down (<i>gadar</i>) and not gathering it.<br>“And for Dan, Achiezer ben Amishaddai.” “Achiezer,” (meaning “helper of my brother”) as he knew how to save himself and where to limit himself, so his encampment to the north which teaches of limitation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">North represents the <i>sefirah</i> of <i>Gevurah</i>, strength, which is the limiting force.</i> “Ben Amishaddai (‘son of the people of Sha”ddai,’ ‘God who limits’),” for God would also help him.<br>“For Asher, Pagiel ben Achran.” He would do away with good that had become turbid with uncertainty (<i>Achoor, </i>turbid) with uncertainty. (“Do away with,” literally, “spoil.”) If he was not certain that it was God’s will, he would do away with it.<br>“For Naftali, Achira ben Einan.” One who is immersed in lust (or alternatively, the love of any one thing) does not know what his portion is. “Achira,” or “too late,” even though lust prevented him and he was too late to receive the good, still he keeps himself together and is not immersed in the lust. “Ben Einan,” (like <i>Ayin</i>, eye) means that he has the beautiful eyes that see his rightful portion. God allotted a portion to each tribe and effuses the light of life to each one unto itself, with no one tribe’s portion similar to another’s."

                    "<i>“And God spoke to Moses saying, also count the number of the sons of Gershon according to their father’s house and their family, from age thirty and upwards, all who are eligible to serve in the army, to perform the service in the tent of appointed meeting ….”</i> (Bamidbar, 4:21–23)<br>This <i>Sedra</i> explains the completion of the place of the paramount concentration of God’s will. From the first time building the <i>Mishkan</i> (the Tabernacle) is mentioned in <i>Parshat Truma</i> until now, there are seventeen <i>parshiot</i>, seventeen being the numerical equivalent of the word for good (<i>Tov</i>), hinting at the primary goodness of place. This relates to the verse (in <i>Shmuel</i> 2, 7:10), “I have made a place for my people Israel, and planted them, and they will dwell there, and will no longer be disturbed” etc.<br>So we find that when the Mishkan was completed and the Tribes camped around it, God’s <i>Kedusha</i> (holiness) was fixed in the heart of Israel that they would be drawn after His will. Earlier, with the Exodus from Egypt, though there was a visual apprehension of the Illumination of God, we could still not be drawn after His will, as it is said (Mehilta <i>B’Shelach</i>), “a <i>maidservant</i> saw [at the splitting of the Red Sea more than the prophet Yehezkiel].” At this time Israel was still subject to the mentality of slavery, hence the Mechilta says, “a maidservant,” and we did not yet have the power to choose whether or not to follow the Illumination of God. And with the giving of the Torah, though words of Torah were fixed in our hearts, they were not fixed with the strength to last the length of eternity.<br>However, with the completion of the Mishkan, the words of Torah were fixed in our hearts to last for all time. For this reason we did not enter the land of Israel immediately after leaving Egypt, because when we left the <i>Kedusha</i> of God was not yet permanently installed in our hearts. At that time the land was still under the power of the seven nations, called the refuse of God’s seven attributes (from <i>Hesed</i> to <i>Malchut).</i> Therefore, before the giving of the Torah and the completion of the <i>Mishkan</i>, since <i>Kedusha</i> was not yet fixed in the hearts of Israel, we could not at this time overpower the seven nations (inhabiting the Promised Land). So before entering the land, God commanded that words of Torah and <i>Kedusha</i> be fixed in our hearts in order that we could later emerge victorious over the seven nations.<br>In this way, we are obliged to fix the Torah in our hearts before turning to the affairs of this world in order that we may later overpower whatever comes against us. The families of Gershon, Kehat, Merrari, Moshe, and Aharon constructed and carried the <i>Mishkan</i>. The sons of Kehat were the “masters of the Torah,” since they bore the Ark of the Covenant, and they knew the law of the Torah for any situation they would encounter. The sons of Gershon were the “masters of the fear [or awe of God].” They bore the curtains covering the <i>Mishkan</i> likened to the heavens, and the boards seen in the <i>Mishkan</i> like the stars, two thing the contemplation of which arouses us to fear or awe. The sons of Merrari were the “masters of <i>mitzvot</i> and good deeds,” for they carried the planks of the <i>Mishkan</i>, which represent practical <i>mitzvot</i>,  which all in Israel have an understanding. And Moshe and Aharon and his sons are the “masters of the Love of God,” who constantly saw to it that the Torah was dispersed among the people, and this is called Love. Actually all those mentioned had within them all these good attributes, yet in each, one attribute was more apparent than the rest.",
                    "<i>“Count the number of the sons of Gershon, them also according to their father’s house ….”</i> (Bamidbar, 4:22)<br>“Them also” is said with the sons of Gershon, where it is not said with the sons of Kehat. For “count,” literally “raise,” <i>nasso</i> in Hebrew, refers to <i>hitnasoot</i>, a state of spiritual elevation, or importance.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Mei HaShiloach</i> uses the term <i>hitnasut</i>, for a state of spiritual elevation.</i> The sons of Kehat achieved this by deliberately entering themselves into situations of doubt and uncertainty, and by being tested. Of this it is said (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 7:9), “and he [Moses] did not give [wagons] to the sons of Kehat, upon them is a holy service, <i>yisa’u</i> - they shall carry upon the shoulder.” In other words, from <i>yisas’u</i>, the act of carrying on their shoulder, a cognate of <i>nasso</i>, or raise, we learn that they had reached the state of patience necessary to enter into and cope with places of uncertainty. We also learn this from the name of the chief of the tribe of Kehat, Elitsafan ben Uziel. <i>Tsafan</i> comes from <i>tsafoon</i>, meaning hidden, that is, it was hidden in his heart that God was his strength and that he would not depart from God’s will. With this he entered into places of uncertainty, thereby achieving <i>hitnasut</i>.<br>However, the special quality of the sons of Gershon was the fear of God, and with this they would get away from uncertainty in every situation that was not clear. In such an instance of uncertainty they would refrain from action, constantly proceeding with surety. For this reason it says “them also,” meaning that they also achieved a state of patience from the ability to remove themselves from uncertainty, thereby also achieving <i>hitnassoot</i>. With the sons of Merrari there is no mention of a leader (whereas with Kehat it is said, “and Moses and Aharon and the chief of the community numbered the sons of Kehat…”) since they occupied themselves with practical <i>mitzvot</i>, of which all of Israel, not just the leaders, has an apprehension. The name of their chief teaches of this, Tsooriel ben Avichail, which translates as “rock of God, my Father of valor,” that is, they had a stronghold from not departing (from the <i>mitzvot</i>), since they acted with simplicity and without doubt.",
                    "With the sons of Kehat and the sons of Merrari it says that they were numbered, “by the hand of Moses” (see 4:37 and 4:45), while with the sons of Gershon (4:41) “by the hand of Moses” is not mentioned. Moses teaches of refined wisdom<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Chochmah mvurerret.</i></i> and intent for the sake of Heaven. The sons of Kehat derived their strength from the goodness of their intentions, and the sons of Merrari derived their strength from purity of action apparent to all. Yet the quality of the sons of Gershon’s was the fear of God and getting away from uncertainty, which could not have been pure if they did not act when God commanded action.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Parshat Toldot, where Yitschak wants to bless Eisav rather than Yakov because he was willing to take risks. One who takes a risk when God’s will is doubtful, and succeeds, is greater than one who never took the risk.</i> In the end, when all are counted (4:49), it says “by the hand of Moses.” In the end, everything was purified and went according to God’s will.",
                    "<i>“… and you shall send out of the encampment all who are leprous, and all who suffer from an gonorrheal emission, and all who have come in contact with the dead.”</i> (Bamidbar, 5:2)<br>“Leprous” means anger, for the word for leprosy, (<i>tsara’at</i>) contains the word “evil,” <i>Ra’a.</i> (Gemara, <i>Arachin</i>, 15b). A “<i>Zav</i>,” is  man who suffers from a gonorrheal emission, a man who entertains lusts. “One who comes in contact with the dead” is depression.

In the middle there was the <i>Machanei haLevia</i>, permitted only to <i>Cohanim </i>and Levites. On the outside was the <i>Machanei Israel</i>, the encampment of the rest of Israel.</i> because the attribute of anger has no place in all of Israel. The <i>Zav</i> was sent outside both the encampment of the Levites (see previous note) and the encampment of the Shekhina, for Torah Scholars, exemplified by the <i>Cohanim</i> and the Levites, may not be steeped in lust. “One who has come in contact with the dead” is only sent outside of the Machanei haShechina, for Torah scholars also succumb at times to the attribute of sadness, as it is written in the Gemara (<i>Ta’anit</i>, 4a), “the Torah causes him to boil,” and this “boiling” is depression. Tainted by sadness, he is forbidden from entering into in the place of the <i>Shechina </i>(The Tabernacle in the desert or the Temple in Jerusalem, and so too the place where you have the greatest feeling of God’s presence.) because “strength and joy are in His place” (Divrei haYamim 1, 16:27).",
                    "<i>“Speak to the children of Israel</i> … <i>a man or woman who commits any of the sins that men commit ….”</i> (Bamidbar, 5:6)<br>The sin mentioned is stealing from a convert who dies before compensating him for the loss (see Rashi on Bamidbar 5:8). Here it appears that <i>teshuva</i> (repentance) is of no use.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The author is making an oblique reference to the sin of spilling semen. On this the Zohar (in <i>Bereshit</i>, 219b) writes, “Rabbi Yehuda said, there is no sin in the world for which there is no <i>teshuva</i> (repentance) to rectify it except for this, and and there is no evil one who cannot see the face of the <i>Shechina</i> except for one who does this, as it is written (Yeshaya, 60:21), “and Your people are all righteous .…” Although there is nothing man can do from his side, God can surely rectify it. (R. Pinchas of Koretz, “Imrei Pinchas”)</i> However, the Torah teaches that nothing will stand in the way of <i>teshuva</i>, and God gives advice as to how nothing will fall irrecoverably into exile. So, too, with robbing a convert, it also seems as if it cannot be rectified. The intention of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai in the Zohar was that the sin in question causes man to tremble to the core of his inner being and propels man to plead with God, pouring his heart out before God. For it is indeed an extremely grave sin. Knowing this, when the sin does not come to man, he would, of course, be overjoyed.",
                    "<i>“… a man whose wife is unfaithful, and commits a trespass against him.”</i> (Bamidbar, 5:12)<br>In the Torah, the section discussing the waters of <i>Sotah</i>, the ritual and judgment for a suspected adulteress, precedes the discussion of the laws of the Nazirite. In the Gemara, the tractate <i>Nazir</i> precedes the tractate <i>Sotah. Sotah</i> teaches of one looking into his own deficiencies, withdrawing, and keeping himself within the boundaries of the Torah. Therefore the Torah first mentions <i>Sotah</i>, and afterwards the law of the Nazirite, who takes upon himself extra boundaries. Truly (<i>Gittin</i>, 43a), “one can only truly uphold the Torah if he has failed in it.” After failing, we have a deep understand the meaning of the mitzvot. However, our Sages of blessed memory, who we call “the Torah of your mother,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Rashi on Mishlei, 1:8</i> who love man and desire his well-being, purposely put the tractate <i>Nazir</i> before the tractate <i>Sotah.</i> This means for man to first separate himself like the <i>Nazir</i> and prevent transgression. It will suffice for him to contemplate the passage about the <i>Sotah</i> in order to understand where he needs to guard himself, thereby preventing failure. (His Torah study enables him to understand and foresee possible stumbling-blocks so as to avoid them.)",
                    "<i>\"May God bless you and keep you.\"</i> (Bamidbar, 6:24)<br>The holy name associated with the priestly blessing contains twenty-two letters, as is known.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Elie Wiesel once mentioned that when Hassidic texts say, “as is known,” it means, “as virtually nobody knows.”</i> The first holy name, which is the theurgic <i>kavonna</i> on the first word of the blessing, <span dir=\"rtl\">יברכך</span>, is <span dir=\"rtl\">א\"נ\"ק\"ת\"ם</span>. This name signifies a time when a man has not yet received his portion of the Torah, and cries out to God to save him from the thoughts and desires that confuse him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the last line in the liturgical poem for Rosh Hashannah, “<i>Taalat zo c’chefetz lehat’il</i>,” which reads “<i>enkat asir</i>  - the cry of the bound, the prayer of the prisoner …” <i>Enkat</i>, the cry, is the same as the first holy name. i&gt;  Afterwards, God has mercy upon him, and releases him from the confusion that disturbs him. This release is hinted at in the second name, <span dir=\"rtl\">פ\"ס\"ת\"ם</span>, the <i>kavonna</i> for second word in the blessing, God’s name YHVH, where the first two letters, <span dir=\"rtl\">פ\"ס</span>, are related to expansion, as in (<i>Tehilim</i>, 72:16), <span dir=\"rtl\">פּסּת בּר</span>—\"the abundance of a grain field.\" This signifies how God grants him the expansion necessary to relieve him of his confusion. The next holy name (intended on <span dir=\"rtl\">וישׁמרך</span>—and keep you) is <span dir=\"rtl\">פ\"ס\"פ\"ס\"י\"ם</span>, which means that God grants him <i>hitnasoot</i> (elevation, importance, exaltation. Two times <span dir=\"rtl\">פ\"ס</span>, more than expansion—elevation.) There is a dilemma regarding <i>hitnasoot</i>, but it leads to an understanding of great depth. How can God grant <i>hitnasoot</i> to two <i>Tsaddikim</i> in one generation, where each one is elevated in his portion and status over all, even the second one? This is as we find with Moshe and Aharon, where each one was altogether unique in his generation. This is understood through the fourth name, <span dir=\"rtl\">ד\"י\"ו\"נ\"ס\"י\"ם</span>. The first three letters of this holy name is the <i>kavonna</i> on the word <span dir=\"rtl\">יאר</span>, “shall shine,” and the last four on God’s name YHVH, which follows directly after. <span dir=\"rtl\">ד\"י\"ו</span>—<i>Diyo</i> is like \"Duo,\" or two, for God grants both of them <i>hitnasoot</i>. <span dir=\"rtl\">נ\"ס\"י\"ם</span>, or <i>nissim</i>, means miracles. This paradox is only resolved through a miracle. The words of the priestly blessing hint at these four levels; crying out for his portion of Torah, God granting him the expansion necessary to receive it, being granted <i>hitnasoot</i>, and the miracle of allowing the “crown” of <i>hitnasoot</i> to two in one generation.</i>",
                    "The <i>Birchat</i> <i>Cohanim</i>, the priestly blessing, contains eleven words, not counting the repeated words. These correspond to the eleven spices in the incense offering. (A possible connection between the two besides the numeric equivalence is that just as the <i>Birchat Cohanim</i> brings down blessing to the world, similarly the incense with its ascending smoke lifts blessing heavenward.) \"<i>eleicha</i> - Unto you,\" and \"<i>lecha</i> - to you,\" are two different words. \"May God raise His countenance unto you\" means <i>hitnasoot</i> (exaltation). He will draw them all to you – you will not have to face opposition. \"And give to you peace,\" means the greatest <i>hitnasoot</i>. Furthermore - even if you have many opponents, do not fear them, for God is with you. This is the meaning of, \"to you,\" for you personally.",
                    "<i>“And they brought their offerings before God; six covered wagons and twelve oxen, one wagon for every two princes, and a bull for each one, and they offered them before the Mishkan.”</i> (Bamidbar, 7:3)<br>Truly, they had great mercy on the Levites who had to carry the heavy loads of the Mishkan without the aid of wagons (see verse 9). But what could they do? Moshe had not been given any specific instructions to tell the Levites to use or not to use wagons. They were concerned that perhaps the Levites needed to toil with their bodies in order to refine their hearts, for sometimes one cannot refine his heart until he serves God with his body. Perhaps this mercy was not coming from God, but rather from something in their own hearts and in a place that God did not desire? Perhaps they were actually exemplifying “the cruel mercy of the wicked?” Therefore it was proper that each pair of Levites would bring one wagon, and thus God would agree with their action. This is as it is written (Mishlei, 11:9), “<i>Tsaddikim</i> will be saved through knowledge.” This is when two Torah scholars, “one wagon for every two princes,” agree on the same opinion. “A bull for each one.” This is as it is said (Rosh Hashanah, 4b, “if you take hold of too much you may lose your hold,) <i>Tafasta mu’at tafasta</i> - If you take hold of less, you will hold it.” In this context the phrase means not to rely on your own knowledge.(If you feel you really understood something new with ease that you have not really learned it, as the learning process requires difficulty and perplexion.) Each prince did not want to rely on his own knowledge, but when he saw that the other prince agreed to his opinion, he knew that it was from God.<br>This is as we find with Yirmiya (32:8), who had a vision that told him to buy Chanamel’s field, and he was uncertain about it. Then, after Chanamel came to him and offered him to buy his field, he said, “now I know that this matter is from God.” This is as already has been explained on the verse, “do not make yourselves molten gods,” in <i>Parshat Kedoshim.</i> When Moshe Rabeynu saw this he was shocked, thinking that God related the instructions to them without his knowledge. Then God said to him (verse 5), “take it from them,” in order to tell him that it was done only of their own minds, but regardless, “take from them,” for their intention went according to the truth of My will. In this way God was saying, “it was My will that they should each volunteer one bull, and two wagons for each prince.”"

You could say there were actually six, three on each side of the central light, with the central light being in its own category. Even in a place where one’s intention is for the sake of Heaven, we need to stop and reconsider how to proceed and insure that the action follows God’s will. This is why it says “seven lights.” The seventh light stands for intention for the sake of Heaven. The “<i>ner hamaravi</i>” bended away from the other six, bending towards the <i>Shekhina</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Rashi’s interpretation of “towards the front,” that the six lights on the side were burning towards the central light.</i> That is to say, we must strive to understand the awesome depth of God’s will and in which direction it is leaning.<br>This very matter is found at end of the <i>Parsha</i> where a “sin” is ascribed to Moshe, Miriam, and Aharon, and hints at the verse (Kohollet, 10:1), “more precious than wisdom or honor is a little foolishness.” That is to say, Aharon and Miriam agreed to take the “folly” or sin upon themselves in order to complete God’s will. It is precisely in this week’s <i>Parsha</i> and by means of this event that Israel truly saw the greatness of Moshe Rabeynu, as God says, “I speak with him mouth to mouth.” Miriam and Aharon agreed that the sin should be ascribed to them in order that the levels of Moshe Rabeynu could come to light, be understood and recognized. This is also the explanation of (the line in the <i>Amida</i> for Shabbat), “purify our hearts to serve You in truth.” Why do we add, “in truth?” If it were not true it would not be called the service of God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So the words “in truth” would seem to be superfluous.</i> Yet when it comes to understanding the intention for the sake of Heaven, we find that in the service of God there is a depth far deeper than it is possible for the human consciousness to perceive. Sometimes we find that a little foolishness is more precious than wisdom or honor, and thus it says, “a <i>little</i> foolishness.” Man must reduce his service of God so as to not let anything come to action until its lacks or defects have been removed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a deeper level of consciousness, basically beyond our ability to comprehend, which the Author is paradoxically urging us to keep in mind in our service of God. This is signified by the seventh (middle) branch of the Menorah. In this way Moshe’s level of prophecy required him to remain apart from Tsipporah, the depth of which Miriam and Aharon were not aware of in their initial criticism of him. Yet the “little foolishness” was the public awareness of their error in order to reveal the level of Moshe Rabeynu to Israel.</i>",
                    "<i>“And thus Aharon did …. ”</i> (Bamidbar, 8:3)<br>“<i>Vaya’as kain Aharon</i> – thus Aharon did.” Rashi comments on the seemingly extraneous word, “<i>kain</i> – thus,” and says that it is order to tell the praise of Aharon <i>shelo shina</i> - who did not deviate from God’s word. However, <i>Shelo Shina</i> could also be understood as “who did not learn,” in the sense of something learned and repeated so much that it becomes habitual. We praise Aharon in that he did not let the action deteriorate into habit. Rather, for Aharon the mitzvah was something constantly new, which one would do with joy and alacrity. This is the meaning of the Gemara (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, 16b), “a man must purify himself at the festival, as it is said, ‘do not touch a dead carcass.’” When the life has gone out of something, it becomes a “carcass,” a mitzvah devoid of joy or vivacity, performed out of habit, or just to fulfill and obligation. It has no life. Thus, “one must purify himself at the festival.” <i>Regel</i> (festival) shares a root with <i>hergel</i> (habitual), meaning we have to purify ourselves in what has become for us a habit. God bestows life to Israel, and we need to accept that life with joy.",
                    "<i>“And thus Aharon did …. ”</i><br>“<i>Kain</i> - Thus” is added to the verse in order to tell the praise of Aharon who did not change (Rashi). The Liqutei Torah of the Ari’zal states (<i>Parshat B’ha’lotcha</i>), that it says “he did thus,” since it seems as if he had indeed changed. The commandment was “seven lights shall shine,” meaning that they would shine <i>by themselves</i> and he would not be the one to bring about their illumination. After it says, “<i>he lighted</i> its candles,” which means that he would do all the lighting. For this it says, “thus did Aharon.” Being a <i>Cohen</i> means to constantly refine and purify the actions of Israel before the Omnipresent. Even if the actions seem improper, Aharon haCohen would raise them up in his sanctity and prayer until they became meritorious. And yet, this is all after the action. Before the action, no one could rely on Aharon, but rather needed to be as careful as possible.<br>This is the explanation of “when you kindle [literally “raise”] the lights,” since truly Aharon would fix and raise the actions of the children of Israel, illuminating them. Yet nonetheless, “over against the front of the Menorah <i>they shall illuminate</i>,” warning them that before each action they need to take care to make it shine on its own accord. This means doing things in a clean and pure way, not relying on Aharon to raise them. This is “and thus did Aharon.” Aharon would warn them to take care not to rely on him to fix each and every one of them, but for actions already done he would fix everything. This is, “he lit [raised] the lights,” stated in the past tense (things already done), and this is as Rashi explains, “it [says “thus”] to praise Aharon, that he did not change.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He did not automatically change the action before the fact so that it would be acceptable before God. This all touches upon ‘<i>Yediah </i>(Providence) and<i>Bechirah</i> (Free Will), a great theme in the Author’s writings and a major theological issue. Based on several passages in the Mei HaShiloach, the message is that it is his best to stand the test and always choose to do what is right.

                    "<i>“Thus do to them [the Levites] to purify them. Sprinkle upon them waters of purification, pass a razor over their entire skin, launder their clothes, and they will be purified.”</i> (Bamidbar, 8:7)<br>These three actions (of purification) correspond to what our Sages of blessed memory warned in the <i>Pirkei Avot</i> (3:41), “Look on three things and you will never come to sin. Know from where you came, and to where you are going, and before whom you will give a reckoning in the future.” “From where you came” corresponds to “pass a razor,” for hair teaches of anger (Zohar, <i>Bamidbar</i>, 151b). This relates to “know from where you came,” for when one understands how his origins come from a putrid drop he will be rendered unable to get angry even at the smallest part of creation. Rather he will see its value.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For he too came from something so seemingly insignificant.</i> “Sprinkle upon them waters of purification” corresponds to “to where you are going [to dust].” Man will have peace of mind in everything he does if he sees to it that his actions are those that lead to everlasting life, even after his body turns to dust. This relates to the <i>mei chatat</i> (waters of purification), spring water mixed with the ashes of the red heifer, for it had already been burnt down to ash.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Something that has become ashes signifies something that continues to live even after it has lost all physical attributes.</i> “Launder their clothes” signifies “before whom you will give an account [the King of kings]” that is, that one will constantly purify and refine his actions so they will be in a state of deep purity, as it is said (Kohollet, 9:8), let your clothes always be white.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The color white is far from any color. Many inanimate things are created white, for white is constantly ready to be painted. In this way we should be constantly ready to receive the salvation of God. <i>Tashlum</i>.</i> “And they shall be purified” teaches of making boundaries, going that extra step in order to protect our service of God. We are advised to sanctify ourselves even in that which is permitted to us, for the boundaries we make for ourselves are of far more benefit in protecting us from evil than the actual prohibition or warning.<br>As it says in the Gemara (<i>Nedarim</i>, 8a), “From where do we derive that you may swear to perform a mitzvah, since it says, ‘I have sworn and I will fulfill’” etc. This is what lasts for him even at a time of testing, as it says (<i>Nedarim</i>, 32b), “at the time of the evil inclination no one mentions the inclination for good.” At such a time one forgets all the substance of the prohibition in the action, as elsewhere explained on the verse, “what profit in that we slay our brother” (<i>Mei HaShiloach Vayeshev).</i> Yet the boundary one makes will last and stand for him even at the time of testing. A great and holy one<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This could be the Chozeh (Seer) of Lublin. As a young man he had run away just before he was to be wed.

While his desire was growing within him, he thought to himself, “I am doing nothing wrong, but what pleasure will I give God from this?” Suddenly he remembered that he was forbidden from remaining alone in a secluded place with a woman. Upon remembering this, the woman and the house vanished before him.</i> once told of such a situation he had encountered, when he was tested and forgot the essence of the prohibition. Yet before he had succumbed, he remembered that he had made himself a boundary not to do anything from which God would not derive pleasure. He said to himself, “even though there is no law against what I am doing, what pleasure will God receive from this?” and when he put this to his heart he immediately remembered the severity of the prohibition involved in the action.",
                    "<i>“And you shall pass a razor over all their flesh ….”</i> (Bamidbar, 8:7)<br>The <i>Kedusha</i> (sanctity) of the Levites is represented by shaving their hair, but with the Nazir, it is written that he is to let his hair grow. (If he broke his vow by coming into contact with the dead or drinking wine, he is required to shave all his hair and bring a sacrifice.) Hair teaches of anger, as we find in the holy Zohar (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 151b), and as the Levites were cleaned and purified from desire they had to remove their hair. A Nazir, his desire led him into the attribute of lust. The Gemara (in <i>Nedarim</i>, 9b) explains. “Said Shimon haTsaddik, all my life [as a <i>Cohen</i>] I never ate from the sacrifice of a Nazir who had broken his vow except once. [Because he always was suspicious about why the Nazir took this vow. Was it out of anger or didacticism, but not the purity of the heart? If so it was easily broken. Rav Steinsaltz.] Once I saw a Nazir come to the Temple [to offer a sacrifice for breaking his vow of Nazir] from the south, who was exceedingly beautiful, with magnificent curls about his head. I said to him, ‘my son, what have you done to come and destroy such beautiful hair?’ He said, ‘I was a shepherd for my father in my town, and I went to draw water from the well. I looked at my image reflected in the water, and my inclination to evil overcame me, trying to drive me from the world.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“My evil inclination overcame me” could mean that while gazing at himself he had a strong desire for women, a strong desire for men upon seeing the male form, or that he was simply overcome with pride.</i> I said to my own nature, “Evil One! Why do you boast over a body that is soon food for worms in the grave! I swear on the service in the Temple that I will shave you for the sake of Heaven.’ ”<br>Upon hearing this, Reb Shimon haTsaddik kissed him on the head and said, ‘My son, such as you shall men and women become Nazirim in Israel, as it is written (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 6:2), ‘a man or woman who separates to take a vow of Nazir unto God.’ ” One who wants to overcome his desire is advised to get angry, as it is written in the Gemara (<i>Kedushin</i>, 40a), “he shall wear black,” meaning a black melancholy, which also refers to anger. This is why the Nazir is required to grow his hair.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Through anger he can overcome his evil desire. It could be that when the Nazir directed his anger at his own evil inclination, he then managed to overcome it. Then he had no more need of his vow of Nazir, not just because it was driving him in the opposite direction, but because he had fought his inclination to evil and won. ‘Anger’ against inclination, as in: “A person should always make his good inclination angry against his evil inclination.” (Brachot Ch.1)</i> This is explained in the <i>Mei HaShiloach</i> in <i>Parshat Noach</i> on the verse, “and he sent out the raven.”",
                    "<i>“And it was, when the Ark would journey, Moshe would say, Arise, Hashem ….”</i> (Bamidbar, 10:35)<br>A journey is when a man goes out on the road, not knowing what will transpire for him. Then he must become impassioned and cry out to God. This is why before each journey of Israel in the desert they would sound blasts of the shofar (<i>teruah</i>). <i>Teruah</i> teaches of the voice of thunder (an impassioned cry). So too on festivals they would sound the shofar, for when there is a marked change in time one must also cry out to God to guard him from any evil that may come upon him. Now that they were about to journey into the land of Israel with the Ark was traveling towards the land, Moshe preceded the arrival by praying, “Arise, Hashem.” Now they begin to pray that they would journey in peace, safe from any mishap on the way.",
                    "<i>“And when the people complained it was evil in the ears of Hashem ….”</i> (Bamidbar, ll:l)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“And Moshe said to Hovav [Yitro]” (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 10:29). The order of these events [the tribes marching under their banners and bringing Yitro close] shows that when they were close to entering the land, signified by the march of the banners, Moshe felt weak because he knew that he would not be the one to lead them into the land. He thereupon brought Yitro close for encouragment. <i>Tashlum</i>.</i><br>“Converts are as difficult for Israel as a sore on the skin” (<i>Nidda</i>, 13b).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It says in Yesahya 14:1, “and the strangers shall be joined to them, and they shall cleave [<i>nispechu</i>, which also means causing a sore on the skin] to the house of Jacob.” Rashi comments, “Because they will not be expert in the <i>mitzvot</i>, and will bring misfortune, and further, Israel may learn from them bad behavior.” Rashi ends by saying, “all Israel are responsible for one another, but not responsible for the converts.” Another interpretation is that converts often become so expert in the performance of <i>mitzvot</i> that they make other Jews look less than sufficient in their service of God.</i> Israel is called a coal, and the nations are called a flame. The hearts of Israel are filled with <i>simcha</i> (true joy), and the nations, though they appear joyful, are filled with sadness. So when Moshe said to Yitro, a convert, (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 10:32), “And it shall be, if you go with us, then the good which Hashem does to us, we will do to you.” At the moment words of Torah entered Yitro’s heart, the sadness left his heart. This was difficult for Israel. Therefore the verse following this says, “and when the people complained,” as when you stir up water and becomes muddy, and then it settles and returns to its initial clarity.",
                    "<i>“From where do I have meat to give to all these people?”</i> (Bamidbar, 11:13)<br>Moshe was on the level of the Manna, as it is written (<i>Shemot</i>, 16:4), “God said to Moses, Behold, I will rain on you bread from Heaven.” “From Heaven,” with utmost clarity. From Moshe’s point of view, this bread was clearer and finer than all the goodness of the world. Meat means “better than bread,” for meat is expansion. Thus, when it was said (<i>Devarim</i>, 12:20), “when God shall <i>expand your borders</i>, when He spoke to you and <i>said, you may eat meat,”</i> from Moshe’s perspective it was not from this world at all, only from the life of the world to come. Therefore he said (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 11:21), “the people, among whom I am,” meaning, from where I am standing how could I give them meat?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is only possible for God to bring something from the world to come.</i> However, God gave them meat when the reign was passed to Yehoshua, for on Yehoshua’s level meat was like freedom from enslavement to the kingdom. Therefore Eldad and Meidad prophesized, “Moshe will die, Yehoshua will bring us in.” So here too the meat was like expansion into a taste of the world to come. Even when they saw that their friends were dying they did not prevent themselves from eating meat, because in one moment of clarity the world to come is worth more than all the life of this world.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meat teaches of the aspect of the Torah where, in the phrase of the Gemara, “man cannot uphold the Torah unless he has failed in it.” Similarly the children of Noach were not permitted to eat meat until after the flood, which was itself like the failure of all mankind until then, and then it was the desire of all the creation to cleave to the soul of man. Previously the creation did not want to cleave to mankind and enter into uncertainty lest mankind would descend from their level in which they trusted. Why should they enter into uncertainty if they could be more successful otherwise? Better to get by on less, for at least you can rely on it. Then, after mankind sinned even on their superior level, and thus they did not have what to trust in, then creation was willing to enter into uncertainty on the chance that they would reap greater rewards. This is because something that is unsure can enter into greater uncertainty, but not with something that is certain.<br>Therefore Moshe said, “where do I have meat from,” for Moshe’s portion was Shabbat. That is to say that God will make it clear to all of Israel that they need no service, but they must serve Him even with all the uncertainty. This is as God answered him that He has another realm of service that is beyond the conscious grasp of man, and man should direct himself into this. So therefore he needs meat, meaning failure and the service even without man’s conscious understanding, and in all his haste he will find <i>tsimtsum</i> (constriction) without his conscious mind. This matter teaches of the holy name of forty-two letters, “Shem Mem Beit,” which “ascends and does not descend,” for in all the actions of man it is not man’s mind that controls them, but only God. <i>Giliyon Mei HaShiloach</i>.</i>",

Would that all of God’s people were prophets, that God would put His spirit upon them.”</i> (Bamidbar, 11:29)<br>“For my sake” means something that comes from me. The very prophecy of Eldad and Meidad was from Moshe Rabeynu, as it is written (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 11:25), “and He took of the spirit that was on him (Moshe) and placed it upon seventy elders.” The verse “would it were that God made all his people prophets, and put His spirit upon them” means that just as God puts His spirit upon them and it is not from me, so too should I not be jealous of them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, even if their prophecy is coming from Moshe, it is really all coming from God.</i>",
                    "<i>“And Miriam and Aharon spoke against Moshe … for your prophecies of God come in visions … not so with My servant Moshe, I will speak to him mouth to mouth, not in riddles, the similitude of God does he see ….”</i> (Bamidbar, 12:1–8)<br>It is written in the Gemara (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, 104b), “Who decides who has a portion in the world to come or not? [Isn’t this matter only in the hands of God?] Rav Ashi said, ‘the members of the great assembly decide [for among them were prophets of God].’ Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav, they wanted to count Shlomo haMelech among those who did not have a share in the world to come, so a vision of his father (David haMelech) and bowed down before them (pleading that they not do so). They paid no attention. Then fire came from Heaven and burned under their benches, but they paid no attention. Then a voice called to them from Heaven, saying (Mishlei, 22:29), ‘Do you see a man diligent in his business? He shall stand before kings, he shall not stand before men.’ Meaning, Shlomo built My house [the Temple] before he built his own. Also, he built My house in seven years, and his house he built in thirteen. [He built Mine with even greater alacrity, so one who ‘stands before kings’ should not be considered wicked.] But they paid no attention to this. Then a heavenly voice called out and said [Job, 34:33], ‘should he requite it as you see fit, when you refused his judgment? Shall he say, You shall choose, and not I? Speak what you know!’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, only God decides who has a share in the world to come, and it does not depend on mankind (Steinsaltz). Also, if God does not see fit to punish the wicked, then will you become fed up with His decision and punish Shlomo haMelech yourself? (Malbim.)</i><br>Truly, all the laws were delivered to the members of the great assembly exactly as they transmitted them. Therefore it was according to the <i>halacha</i> that they wanted to count Shlomo haMelech among those who did not have a share in the world to come, until the final voice from Heaven announced, “shall he requite it as you see fit?” In this way, the light of Shlomo haMelech explicitly opened up for them, and then the light of Shlomo haMelech became increasingly clear in their understanding. After that they had no response and could not challenge heaven. In this vein God said, “it is not so with My servant Moshe.” Immediately after the word came forth from God in this verse, they explicitly saw the light and level of Moshe Rabeynu’s apprehension, “eye to eye.”  (See Bamidbar 14:14) Then when God said the word “unto him” [verse 6], it was hidden from them. They knew that the vision was not theirs but only Moshe’s, and in this way they understood the level of Moshe Rabeynu.<br>Similarly, when God said the word, “a vision of God” (verse 8), then the light and apprehension of Moshe Rabeynu entered their hearts, and when He said the word “he shall behold,” it was closed from them. Also later, some of this understanding remained in their hearts so at times they would understand with the very understanding of Moshe Rabeynu. Still, they knew that it was not coming from them, but only from the level of Moshe Rabeynu. They knew what they lacked in comparison to him. Before that, they thought that there was no level higher than their own level, and afterwards they knew that there was a higher level. Yet at the time of the sin they did not understand that this light was not a part of their portion, believing that this understanding was for them, and not from the side of God who wanted to show them the level of Moshe Rabeynu.<br>Therefore they tasted a greater light than was in their own ability to taste when they knew that it was not a part of their portion. For then, they could only taste that which came to them through the contemplation of their fellow man’s portion, but not as he himself would have appreciated it. So when they were in the realm of sin, asserting that it was in fact their own portion, they then tasted the taste of a man appreciating his own. This happened because the Holy One, blessed be He, wanted to show them the level and value of Moshe Rabeynu in its full capacity.<br>This is as it says in the Gemara (<i>Berachot</i>, 35a), “all who enjoy from this world without pronouncing a blessing on the enjoyment are stealing.” For the act of enjoyment with a blessing is to say he recognizes that it is not his own, but only God’s. Therefore one will not enjoy the <i>Kedusha</i> (sanctity) of anything unless he does so as one who sees (that it is not his, and his enjoyment will be limited). Then when it happens that a man benefits without a blessing, then it is as if he is enjoying the Holy Sacrifices of Heaven in all their completeness, and it is as if he has stolen from God. Investigate and contemplate this matter further, for it is intensely deep."

                    "<i>“And God spoke to Moses saying, send people .…”</i> (Bamidbar, 13:1-2)<br>It is said in the holy Zohar (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 159a), “The Holy One, blessed be He, has three worlds—the world that is hidden within Him and is not known at all, the world that is always known, and the world that is known and not known.” For one kind of person prayer is of no benefit, and this is called the world that is not known at all. For this one, God withdraws His glory above. The world that is always known corresponds to a person who God always helps even if he does not pray, so he has no use for prayer. The world that is known and not known corresponds to a person who God does not help without prayer, yet if he prays he is answered. This one will have the desire to pray, yet the first two will not have any desire to pray. Both the person who prayer does not help anyway, and the person who is helped without prayer, will not find any desire in their hearts to pray.<br>When a man finds that he has no desire to pray he needs to understand why. Is it because it will not help him, or because he does not need it? It was similar with the spies, for no prayer would have benefited the spies. Therefore they had no will in their hearts to pray. The exception was Calev, who had a need for prayer (the world that is known and not known), and that is why he alone went to Hevron to throw himself down on the graves of the patriarchs in prayer. Yehoshua did not need to pray because wherever he went he was helped by God, as it says in the holy Zohar (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 158b), “Moses blessed him with supernal assistance,” therefore he didn’t need to pray.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">All the matters of prayer are included in this <i>Parsha</i>, for whosoever needs great mercies, God sends to the heart of the <i>tsaddik</i> or righteous leader of the generation to bless him and pray for him. Thus with Yehoshua, our teacher Moshe blessed him and prayed for him. Calev didn’t need Moshe’s prayer, and therefore the desire to pray for him didn’t enter Moshe’s heart. Prayer would not have helped the spies, so he did not have the desire to pray for them either. The righteous leader of the generation [<i>Tsaddik haDor</i>] needs a great depth of understanding to know why the desire to pray for some would not enter his heart, whether it is because he is helped without prayer or because prayer would not help anyway. <i>Tashlum</i>.</i>",
                    "<i>“… and Moshe called Hoshea bin Nun Yehoshua.”</i> (Bamidbar, 13:16)<br>The letter <i>yud</i> hints at straightforwardness, for its form is a small dot. This is why Moshe added the <i>yud</i> to his name, as it says in the Gemara (<i>Kiddushin</i>, 58b), “If one says to his friend, go [be my representative] and betroth this woman for me, and the friend goes and betroths her for himself, she is betrothed to the friend.” The Gemara adds to this that he had acted deceitfully. Thus it seemed also with Yehoshua for Moshe had asked him to investigate the land (so Moshe could enter it, i.e., become “betrothed” to it), and in the end he scouted it out just for himself. Therefore it seems that his excursion was not at all straightforward, so the <i>yud</i> was added to his name signifying that he was indeed straightforward in all his actions. This is further seen in the Aramaic translation of Yonatan ben Uziel, “when Moshe saw the <i>humility</i> of Hoshea, he called Hoshea bin Nun Yehoshua.”",
                    "<i>“And they told him and they said we went to the land … [we can do] nothing, for the people are strong .…”</i> (Bamidbar, 13:27–28)<br>They derided the land with ten statements of derision, for there were ten spies and each one said one. The name of each spy teaches of the statement he said to deride the land, and the one who understands will understand.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Bamidbar</i> Rabba, 16:7; Midrash Tanchuma, Shlach 6; also the Gemara in <i>Sotah</i>, 34b, says, “Rabbi Yitzchak said, we have a tradition from our forefathers that the spies were called according to their actions. We only know how to explain one of them, “Satur ben Michael,” <i>satur</i> that he contradicted (<i>satar</i>) the acts of God. [That he made God his enemy, Rashi.] “Michael” that he made God lowly (<i>mach</i>). [Weak, Rashi.] Rabbi Yochanan said, we can also say Nachbi be Vafsi, “Nachbi” that he hid [<i>hechbi</i>] his words [and did not say things as they really were, Rashi], <i>vafsi</i> that he stepped over [<i>pisea</i>] the attributes of God [skipped over them, not saying when they were, Rashi.].” The Holy Isbitser is saying that the work of the “one who understands” would be similarly to match each name of the spies with each one of the statements of derision of the land. In my small understanding, this would be something like “Palti ben Rafu said, ‘the people are strong’ for he felt weak [<i>Raf</i>] before them, and sought refuge [<i>miflat</i>]. See Midrash Tanchuma (<i>Ha’azinu 7</i>), where R. Moshe Hadarshan explains all of these names in this fashion.</i>",
                    "<i>“And the children of Israel were in the desert, and they found a man gathering wood on the day of the Sabbath .…”</i> (Bamidbar, 15:32)<br>It is written in the Mishna (Menachot, Ch. 5), “there are offerings that need oil and frankincense, or oil without frankincense, or frankincense without oil.” Oil teaches of (an action) “bringing honor from the community [<i>Pirkei Avot</i>, Ch. 2.1],” in other words, that a man should strive to be righteous and pure (hence oil) to the depths of his heart, and should have intentions for the sake of Heaven. Frankincense teaches of “bringing honor to he who does it,” that is, that the action should serve to adorn the one who does it in the eyes of his surroundings. All actions should (ideally) bring honor to one’s self and honor to one’s surroundings. Yet sometimes we find it is “a time to do for God.” At this time one doesn’t have to make sure that the action brings himself honor, just that it is done for the sake of Heaven.<br>This is as it is written (<i>Tehilim</i>, 119:126), “it is time to act for God, for they have made void Your Torah.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is here interpreted that even if the act is contrary to the letter of the Torah it is still for the sake of Heaven.</i> Sometimes this is God’s will. At other times the opposite is true, that even if his intentions are for the purest of goals, it is still forbidden to act against the Torah. Thus it is with the one who was gathering wood on Shabbat (sometimes identified as Tslofchad). Even though his intentions were for the sake of Heaven, he was nonetheless punished for it, for it was not God’s will that a man should enter himself into such a situation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tslofchad’s act of transgressing the Sabbath was unprecedented, so Israel did not yet know the great depth of Shabbat until they found someone breaking it. Seen in this light, his transgression turns out to be a form of valiant self-sacrifice. This is a classic “one cannot uphold the Torah until one has failed in keeping it” situation, a recurring theme in the Holy Isbitser, which Reb Shlomo Carlebach ZTs’L had often explained.</i> Yet when someone falls into a situation (beyond his control) that would bring honor to his surroundings, he does not need to consider whether it will bring honor to himself. Still, it is improper to enter premeditatedly into such a situation. Rather, before acting he needs to see that the action will (Mishlei, 3:4), “bring favor and good understanding in the eyes of God and man.”",
                    "<i>“… and they shall make for themselves</i> tsitsit <i>.…”</i> (Bamidbar, 15:38)<br>Why is the section of <i>tsitsit</i> (ritual fringes) juxtaposed with the section of the one found gathering wood on Shabbat? <i>Tsitstit</i> teaches of the fear of God, as it is said, “and you shall see them and you shall remember all the mitzvot of God (which would inspire fear).” Shabbat teaches of <i>tekifut</i> (the strength of acting without deliberation),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tekifut</i>. See note 61, <i>Sefer Shemot</i>.</i> for it hints at “the day which is all Shabbat [the messianic era],” when all fear will be removed.

The wood gatherer understood that on Shabbat there is no need to use the attribute of fear.

                    "In this week’s Torah portion we find six subsections, corresponding to the six sayings in <i>Tehilim</i> 19. “The Torah of God is perfect, restoring the soul” corresponds to the section about the wine offerings (see <i>Bamidbar</i>, 15:7). God gave Israel the commandment of the wine offering after the event of the spies in order to revive them and restore their soul. The section of wine offerings hints at joy, as Rabbi Tanchuma said (Midrash Tanchuma Shlach, 14, referring to the juxtaposition of the discussion of taking challah from bread and the wine offering), “go eat your bread in joy” (Kohollet, 9:7). That is to say, the offerings would bring God joy. God gave them these mitzvot after they believed that they had sinned down to the depth of their very lives. This is the intention of the Midrash (<i>Bamidbar</i> Rabba, Shlach, 16:4), “the spies were Gentiles” (figuratively), for the root of the Gentile is anger, and this characteristic has no place in Israel.<br>For this it is said, “the Torah of God is perfect, restoring the soul.” Truly they intended to fulfill God’s will, according to the saying of God (<i>Bereshit</i>, 15:16),” and the fourth generation will come here again.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The spies truly believed, based on this verse, that the generation of the desert was not ready to enter the land.</i> It was in their power to praise the land, yet God sent them the understanding that they should deride it. Thus even in the derision their intention was to fulfill God’s will, and in response He commanded them concerning the wine offerings. This is called (Shir haShirim, 5:1), “I have drunk my wine,” in other words, they gave God joy in that they let themselves be conquered by God, and this can only be done by Israel. The other nations could not bring a wine offering without an animal offering; only Israel could do this, as it is said in <i>Menachot</i> (73b), since the Gentile cannot agree to be vanquished by God, as is explained.<br>The next saying in <i>Tehilim</i> 19 is “the testimony of God is faithful, making the simple wise.” A testimony is something clear, and this corresponds to Yehoshua, for as long as the reasons behind the <i>mitzvot</i> are not clear one may be easily tempted into anything that confronts him. Yet when the meaning of the <i>mitzvot</i> are clear he may no longer be tempted. We find that Yehoshua’s attribute was honesty or naivete, so therefore God placed him in Moshe’s tent. Under the influence of Moshe Rabeynu, he let himself be tempted only from the good, this is why his name is Yehoshua [meaning God will save (protect) you].<br><i>Tehilim</i> 19 continues, “the statutes of God are straightforward, gladdening the heart.” “The statutes or charges of God”—in other words harsh decrees or Divine warnings, though they seem difficult, severe, at their depth they are filled with mercy and love. This corresponds to the passage about the one who was found gathering wood on Shabbat. Even though the warnings about Shabbat are voiced harshly, as in “he who desecrates it will surely die …”, this is only because Shabbat contains the deepest good and He feared we might not completely receive it. Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, warned not to miss the good, yet rather accept it in all its completeness, as a father who strongly reprimands his son out of his love.<br>“The mitzvot of God are clear, illuminating the eyes” corresponds to the passage of <i>tsitsit</i>. <i>Tsitsit</i> teaches of the fear of God, and by means of the fear that comes to man, God illuminates his eyes. As it says (<i>Menachot</i>, 43b), “all who are careful regarding the commandment of <i>tsitsit</i> will merit to receive the countenance of the <i>Shechina</i> [Divine Presence].”<br>“The fear of God is pure, standing forever” corresponds to the commandment of taking <i>challa</i> (the tithe from the dough). A man should not refrain from crowning God King over him even for a second. Even though we make God King by separating tithes from the produce, nonetheless when he wants to enjoy it and eat the produce it needs to be with the fear of God, thereby establishing God’s sovereignty through taking the <i>challa</i> from the dough.<br>“The judgments of God are true, altogether righteous” corresponds to the section (15:22), “and if you have erred.” This hints at the complete absence of contradictions in God’s mitzvot. This is as it is written the Gemara (<i>Horaiot</i>, 13a), “even though it says here [15:24] ‘a bullock for an ascent offering,’ whereas in <i>Parshat Vayikra</i> it says, ‘a bullock for a sin offering,’” the Gemara resolves the seeming contradiction. Here it refers to erring in idolatry, and here it refers to erring in all other mitzvot. Then there is no contradiction."

                "Korach": [
                    "<i>“And Korach took .…”</i> (Bamidbar, 16:1)<br>The Midrash (in <i>Bamidbar</i> Rabba, <i>Korach</i>, 18:17) tells us, “he saw the great chain of generations that would come out of him.” Since he saw this he became arrogant, daring to believe that surely he was the greatest of God’s servants. Of this it is said (Mishlei, 27:1), “Do not boast of tomorrow, for you don’t know what the day may bring forth.” Even if a man understands that has hope (promise of future rewards or success), he is to beware of putting his trust in this for he does not know how God may conduct Himself in any present moment.",
                    "<i>“And Korach took .…”</i><br>It is said in the Midrash (<i>Bamidbar</i> Rabba, <i>Korach</i>, 18:2), “Why does the passage about Korach follow immediately after the section on <i>tsitsit</i>? Because Korach took a <i>talit</i> made entirely of <i>techelet</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“<i>Techellet</i>” or sky blue, referring to the blue thread required on the <i>tsitsit</i>, made from the blue dye of the Chillazon snail. See <i>Bamidbar</i>, 15:38.</i> came before Moshe, and asked, ‘does this <i>talit</i> require <i>tsitsit</i> or not?’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Korach had already made up his mind that it was exempt, and knew that Moshe would say that it required <i>tsitsit</i>, but used the disagreement as a pretext for challenging Moshe’s authority.</i><i>Techelet</i> teaches of the fear of God, and Korach asserted that the fear of God was something completely revealed to him at all times. He understood that everything comes from God, even the fear of God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the Isbitser’s original take on the famous rabbinical saying, “all comes from God, except the fear of God.” See how this is explained in <i>Parshat Vayiera</i>, in the selection, “And Sarah denied it, saying, I did not laugh.”</i> If so, how could anyone ever do anything against God’s will? Since all will and all action come from Him, may He be blessed, how could anyone do something not according to His will? For this reason Korach asserted that a <i>talit</i> made entirely of <i>tchelet</i> (i.e., constantly conscious of the fear of God) would be exempt from <i>tsitsit</i>, because <i>tsitsit</i> teaches of the fear of God. Yet in truth, God’s will as it exists in this world depends on how each one sees it. This relates to what is said in the Gemara (<i>Chagiga</i>, 13b), “The prophet Yechezkel prayed on the face of the ox [on the chariot], and it turned into a cherub.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The first vision of God’s chariot has four faces, man, lion, ox, eagle (Yechezkel 1:10), and the second (10:14) says cherub, man, lion, eagle. The Gemara attributes the transformation of the ox to the cherub to the prayer of Yechezkel, for he didn’t want anything that would remind of the sin of the golden calf in God’s holy chariot.</i><br>“Ox” teaches of wisdom that is greatly refined, and at the deepest level everything really does come from God, our free choice is no more consequential as a peel of garlic, only according to one’s particular state of mind. God hid His way from mankind because He desires that we serve Him, and if everything (in God’s consciousness) were clear to us, we would not experience the desire to serve Him. Because of this Yechezkel prayed and changed the face to a cherub, that God’s way would be hidden, and it would appear to mankind that we are able to make choices. In this way the desire to serve Him would come to our hearts. This is the meaning of (ibid.) “the cherub is a small face.” <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Small meaning God’s way is hidden, as opposed to the ox; refined wisdom and God’s way, or will, revealed.</i>, <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Two levels are operating here simultaneously. The high level, after the final <i>tikkun</i>, where God’s way is completely apparent to all—“the face of the ox”—where all comes from God including the fear of God. This is happening now, constantly, yet we have no apprehension of it. The normal mode of existence, before the final <i>tikkun</i>, is the illusion that we have free choice, for the way of God is hidden—“the face of the cherub”—all comes from God except the fear of God, which creates the necessity of our service. Korach, operating only on the first level, saw all through messianic eyes, essentially believing that his generation was that of the final <i>tikkun</i>. Though it was not to be, still we have a tradition that he will be reincarnated as the High Priest when the temple is rebuilt, soon and in our days.</i>",
                    "<i>“… and why do you raise yourselves above the community of God?”</i> (Bamidbar, 16:3)<br>Here Korach’s assertion was that there is no favoritism in Israel, that God doesn’t elevate one above the other, for God dwells among them all equally. This is similar to what is said in the Midrash (Gemara <i>Ta’anit</i>, 31a), “In the future God will make a circle dance of the righteous, and all will point to God saying, ‘this is our God whom we have hoped for.’” A circle dance, for all points in a circle are equidistant from the center, no one closer than another. Korach asserted that now it is also like this, yet concerning this King Shlomo said (Mishlei, 20:26), “a wise king scatters the wicked, returning the wheel over them.” This means, concerning the “crown”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Scatters” in the verse is <i>m’zare</i> in Hebrew, and the Holy Isbitser related this to <i>Zer</i> or crown.</i> that God gave them, that is, the crown of the <i>Levi’im</i> that gave the sons of Levi an exalted status, concerning this, “he returns the wheel over them.” That means, He answers them (return, <i>meishiv</i> in Hebrew, also means answers), “when I gave you an elevated status as <i>Levi’im</i> you didn’t refuse it and claim that there is no one in Israel who receives special status above another.”",
                    "<i>“And Korach took .…”</i><br>This relates to “why did your heart take you away …” (Job, 15:12). That is, that his heart took him. Concerning this Moshe our teacher cried out in prayer (<i>Tehilim</i>, 90:1), “God, you have been our dwelling place in every generation. Before the birth of the mountains, and the formation of the earth …” Mountains signify powers and desires. On this he prayed to God, for He is the one who gives power and the desire to act, thus if one cannot overcome his desire he is not culpable, for all his power comes from God. Concerning this he said, “teach us to number our days,” which is now interpreted (<i>yameynu</i> is days, <i>yamIno</i> is power) as asking God to give us the power to overcome our desires, and not to receive desires greater than the power to control it. Rather, our desires should be on the level of our restraining power. “When will you Return, God, and console your servant?” In other words, that God should grant Korach the understanding that he can use to overpower his desire (for honor or control).",
                    "<i>“For all the congregation is holy and God is among them .…”</i> (Bamidbar, 16:3)<br>This relates to the verse (Mishlei, 12:19), “a lip of truth shall be established forever, but a lying tongue is for but a moment.” Those who spoke truth will endure forever, and the lies of their mouth will be immediately nullified. From this verse they (the sons of Korach) will be rectified in the future. Because King David established the lineage of the sons of Korach to their father (in <i>Tehilim</i> 44–49), they were returned to his community. If they would not derive any good from being called in their father’s name, then they would not have been specifically related to this evil, God forbid. As it is said in the Gemara (<i>Shabbat</i> 55b on another matter), “could it be that he sinned and still the Scriptures relate his progeny?” This is one of the thirteen principles with which the Torah is expounded, “everything that was in the general principle, but was taken out … you may not return it to its general principle until the verse does it explicitly.” Here King David returned them to his community (<i>klal</i>, also general principle) explicitly. This is seen specifically in the enactment of the Ari”zal to say the chapter of <i>Tehilim</i> is “a song of the sons of Korach” before blowing the <i>shofar</i> on Rosh Hashanah, a custom that has been accepted by all the communities of Israel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is quite striking, for the thirteen principles of exegesis are usually used in the Talmud for deriving Torah laws from verses. An example of the particular principle mentioned above is in <i>Vayikra</i> 22:12, which says that a <i>Cohen’s</i> daughter who marries a non-<i>Cohen</i> may not eat tithes, offerings, reserved for <i>Cohanim</i>. If she divorces or becomes a widow she would not be allowed to return to eating from the offerings, if it weren’t explicitly stated in verse 13. [Example from the Artscroll prayerbook.] The Holy Isbitser in classic hasidic fashion takes the principle out of the realm of exegesis and uses it to show how the sons of Korach receive a fixing of their souls in later generations. This fixing takes the form of having the <i>Tehilim</i> they composed recited before the blowing of the <i>shofar</i>, something so high the Zohar says is the meaning of “all that comes out of the mouth of God.” [Zohar <i>Yitro</i>, 81b]</i>",
                    "<i>“Why do you raise yourselves above the congregation of God?”</i> (Bamidbar, 16:3)<br>It is written (Yesahya, 51:15), “And I will place my word in your mouth, and I will cover you in the shadow of My hand.” There is a good and precious point in every soul of Israel specifically given by God. However, in this world, that point is dressed in a garment that makes it appear to be the opposite of its true nature, and this is called “covered in the shadow of My hand.” It is also this way with precious souls, for God made garments which cause them to look like the opposite of their preciousness. It is like this with Moshe Rabeynu, of whom the Torah testifies that he was “the most humble of all men,” and this was covered with a garment that made the opposite seem true. Therefore they claimed that he wanted to raise himself above the rest.<br>This is also the case with David haMelech, whose essential attribute was the betterment of all of Israel, as is written in the Midrash Sochar Tov (<i>Tehilim</i> 1), “the one who shall request Will is David haMelech, who loved Israel.” Of him it was written (<i>Devarim</i>, 17:15), “From among your brethren appoint a king over yourselves,” (“from among your brethren”) meaning one who has love for the entire community of Israel. On the surface it seemed that David was the opposite, as it is written (Gemara, <i>Bereshit</i> Rabba, 63:11), “at the time Shmuel haNavi saw the red-haired David he feared that he might be one who would shed blood, so God answered him, ‘see how he is with beautiful eyes.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, see into his true nature; see Shmuel 1, 17:42.</i>",
                    "<i>“And Moshe said to Korach, you and all your congregation were [</i>hayu<i>] before Hashem .…”</i> (Bamidbar, 16:15)<br>“<i>Hayu</i>.” With these words were they cast down into hell. These three letters (of “were,” <i>hayu, Hei Yud Vav</i>) form a holy name that signifies the “seal of that which is below,” as is written in the <i>Sefer Yetsira</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Sefer Yetsira</i> is the most ancient of kabbalistic texts, whose authorship is attributed to Avraham Avinu. This phrase is mentioned in the first chapter. According to the Ari”zal’s “Shaar haCavanot,” on the festival of Succot, the six permutations of <i>Yud Hei</i> and <i>Vav</i> signify the six directions of the <i>succa</i> and all space.</i> the “Book of Creation,” “the direction below is sealed with Hei Yud Vav.” When Moshe saw that their Divine decree had been sealed (to cast them below), he chose these words, “were (<i>hayu</i>) before God.”",
                    "<i>“… you have killed the people of God.”</i> (Bamidbar, 17:6)<br>Truly, the people knew that this act had come from God, yet their claim was God visited upon them because Moshe and Aharon hated them. This is why Moshe Rabeynu said to Aharon, “take the incense censer [to stop the plague],” to show the people God’s great love for them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That Moshe and Aharon went out of their way to demonstrate God’s great love for the children of Israel shows that they really did love them.</i>",
                    "<i>“The dead in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides those that died in the matter of Korach.”</i> (Bamidbar, 17:14)<br>Here we find that whenever <i>Kedusha</i> (sanctity) descends into the world, it does not come “for free,” but comes at the great cost of lives of Israel. For instance, before David haMelech merited knowing the place of the Mikdash (Holy Temple in Jerusalem), many lives were lost and many tragedies suffered. Thus it was before the world merited the <i>birrurim </i>(clarifications) involved in recognizing the soul of Aharon haCohen, for this was not made entirely clear until after the controversy of the staves, as is known (see <i>Bamidbar</i>, 17:16–26). This was also acquired at a great price, namely 15,000 lives, for 14,700 died in the plague, 250 were swallowed by the earth in the controversy of Korach, along with fifty people close to Datan, Aviram, and Korach. This 15,000 is hinted at in the verses in <i>Bereshit</i> concerning the creation of light. From the verse, “and God said, let there be light” (verse 3) until the completion of light (the end of verse 5), we find the letter <i>aleph</i> fifteen times.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It must be remembered that the word <i>aleph</i> means both one and one thousand, depending on the vowels.</i> This hints that before the light of Aharon haCohen was made completely clear in this world, fifteen thousand lives of Israel had to be lost. Then afterwards, the light of Aharon haCohen emerged clear and refined.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Completion of the light in <i>Bereshit</i> equals <i>birrur</i> of the light of Aharon haCohen, who kindles the light of the Menorah in the Mikdash and the light of all the souls of Israel.</i>",
                    "<i>“And God said to Moshe … take from them a staff, a staff from each father’s house .…”</i> (Bamidbar, 17:16)<br>Why did God command them to take staves after the Korach affair? The staff (or branch) hints at life as is known, as it is written (Zechariah, 8:4), “every man with his staff in his hand from many days” (long life). God commanded them to take staves for in the future God will show each one that he will arrive at his place and true portion of eternal life, and will not desire the portion of his neighbor. For before it will be clear to each one what his portion is, he will want the portion of his fellow. It was like this in the controversy of Korach, as he longed for the portion of Aharon haCohen. This is the meaning of the staves, that God showed each and every one his place, that everyone has a good place, and that no one would complain about (be jealous of) the portion of Aharon. This is seen in the Aramaic translation of Onkelos, “and they saw, and each man took his staff.” “Saw” is translated as “and he made it known.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is like two brothers who have not seen each other for a long time, and afterwards they see each other and recognize each other. Thus here God showed everyone his portion of life, and they recognized it, for each has already seen it before coming into the world. <i>Tashlum</i>.</i><br>That is, that they understood and established in the clarity of the situation, recognizing the depth of the root and source of each one. Even though it only says that Aharon’s staff blossomed, really all the staves blossomed, yet Aharon’s staff went on to give fruit. The portion of Aharon is the completeness of every action in this world, and he would not have done anything that would have to go through another process of purification. Not so with the other tribes, whose actions achieve this purification only after time. This is so even though there are other tribes whose preciousness is greater than that of <i>Kehuna</i>, priesthood, like the tribe of Yehuda (from which grows King David’s line). Nonetheless, their completion takes time, and this was once against the opinion of Aharon, who at first considered himself the greatest, and this troubled him greatly.<br>Therefore God had Israel give him the twenty-four gifts of <i>Kehuna</i>, to show him that all the actions of Israel have to be in this world according to the level of Aharon haCohen, for in this world God chooses the action in its completeness. On this it is written in the <i>Sefer Yetsira</i>, “the Book of Creation,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See note 43.</i> that there are twelve permutations of the four letters of God’s name (each tribe associated with one permutation). The permutation for Aharon is in its natural and complete order, <i>Yud Hei Vav Hei</i>, for this is the name that rules in this world.",
                    "<i>“And the Levites shall perform the service .…”</i> (Bamidbar, 18:23)<br>It is written in the Holy Zohar (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 178b), “the Levite completes the left side by means of his service.” At a time when man’s heart is overcome with lust, and he overpowers it with all his strength and prevents himself from it, then he succeeds in completing himself by filling the deficiency that he has carried from his birth. For everyone is born with a deficiency that he must fix. This is why the prophet Yeshayahu said (Yeshaya, 48:8), “you are called a criminal from the womb.” This is called the “left side,” which God leaves for man to fix."

                    "<i>“This is the statute of the Torah.”</i> (Bamidbar, 19:2)<br>(Concerning the ashes of the red heifer mixed in the purifying waters, used to purify one who has come in contact with a dead body,) it is written in the Midrash, “Since the other peoples of the world challenge us, saying, ‘what is this mitzvah and what is its meaning?’ Therefore God called it a <i>Choq</i> [a statute, an unexplainable, immutable law], ‘a Divine decree before Me, and you do not have the permission to wonder at its meaning.’” Concerning this, King Shlomo praised the life of Israel versus the life of the other nations, as it is written (Shir Hashirim Rabba, 5:9), “[the nations ask Israel,] what is your beloved from our beloved [how is your God any different from our gods?] … my Beloved is pure and ruddy …” In other words, God deals with Israel in a different way from that in which He deals with the other nations. There are three ways that evil does not reach the depth of the life of Israel. First, loss or death doesn’t really befall them, for death in Israel is not like death in the nations—with the nations death is like a vessel that is broken and cannot be fixed. With Israel death is like a vessel made in sections that is merely taken apart.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Torah is called “a tree of life for those who hold on to it.” For the present consciousness, life is defined by connection to the Torah.</i><br>Second, Israel has never been under the “yoke” of a king or ruler at any time, because we understand that all is really in the hands of God. Third, King Shlomo praises the wisdom of Israel versus the nations, for no nation has an understanding of God as Israel does. Concerning these three things the nations are challenging us, for in them it seems on the surface that there is, God forbid, no difference between them. This is why it says (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 19:2), “they shall take unto you” (Rashi notes that “you” means to Moshe), that is, take unto the level of Moshe our teacher that exists in all of Israel. This is because Moshe Rabeynu is the source of wisdom for all of Israel, and to him alone the meaning of the red heifer became clear.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the same <i>Choq</i> of which Rashi said, “we may not contemplate its meaning.”</i> Heifer, <i>parah</i>, in Hebrew, teaches of life that has gone through a process of purification.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The root of cow, <i>par</i>, is also the root of fruitfulness, <i>priya</i>, hence life, as the Holy Isbitser mentions elsewhere.</i> “Red” teaches of strength.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Later the Isbitser adds to this “joy.”</i> “Whole,” in other words, whole in its redness, that no limb of the body should weaken and lose the power of this strength residing in it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The body here is both physical and spiritual, the 248 limbs of the body associated with the 248 positive mitzvot.</i> “Having no imperfection,” that there shall be nothing lacking in its wisdom of Israel, only purified wisdom. “Which never carried a yoke on its back,” that Israel has never been subjugated to any form of slavery, for God rules over us alone. As the prophet Zechariah said (10:6), “and it will be as if I had never neglected them.”<br>This reality becomes clear in the story of Joseph and his brothers, for it seemed as if they were in great trouble, but afterwards it was made known to them that they were all the while before their own brother. Then it became clear that they were never in danger, and their trouble was only temporary (and even illusory). So it will be in the future, that God will make it clear that all suffering in Israel was temporary (an illusion of this world) and no soul in Israel was ever really in danger.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is not to deny the great suffering in the world, which the author well knew, but rather the messianic time represents a time of complete clarity of understanding of all the events in the world and God’s intentions. See the second selection in <i>Parshat Vayigash</i>, “and Yehuda drew close to him.”</i> This is what King Shlomo said (Kohellet, 7:23), “I said I will be wise, and it is far from me.” Even though he understood all of this clearly, still, King Shlomo’s wisdom was in a form that was to be clear to everyone. That is why he said “I will be wise,” I will grant everyone the wisdom to understand this, and added, “and it is far from me.” (I.e., it is for others, not me.)<br>To Moshe it was said (Midrash Tanchuma, <i>Chukat</i>, 8), “to you I will reveal,” for the wisdom of Moshe Rabeynu was in order for him to understand but not to make another wise,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On this, it may be asked, does it not say “the testimony of God is sure, making the simple wise”? Yet <i>Pirkei Avot</i> says that Moshe delivered the Torah to Yehoshua, and not directly to the elders. It could only be transmitted through Yehoshua.</i> and the kind of wisdom that Shlomo haMelech possessed was understood, but not in his (own) wisdom! For his wisdom was in order to cause others to understand, and this is why it says “for it is far from me,” meaning, “it is beyond the limit of my own wisdom.” The reason why the passage about the red heifer comes before the death of the “three shepherds” (Miriam, Aharon, Moshe) is in order to let Israel understand know that they should not be distraught (for there is no death, as it is usually understood). The sprinkling of the waters of purification (made from the ashes of the red heifer) hints that in the future all will return to them.",
                    "<i>“They shall take unto you a perfect red heifer .…”</i> (Bamidbar, 19:2)<br>In the future God will reveal His glory to Israel without any separation whatsoever, for now this (reality of) life exists in the depths of Israel, yet it is hidden and only revealed in “garments.” These garments are the Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>, for one may only enter into the depths of God’s will through the Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>. This is “they shall take unto you a heifer,” which stands for life, as is known, and at the present moment we are commanded that this life be clothed in garments, that is, the Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>. “Perfect red” means explicit strengths, without any separation or defect. “With no blemish in it” means that no foolishness would be found in any action.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As the Isbitser later mentions, just as a mentally deficient <i>Cohen</i>, once called a “fool,” is disqualified from service, so any action done in foolishness is deficient.</i> “Which never carried a yoke on its back” teaches that Israel (at the depths) never experienced helpless agonizing and effort. This is as it is said in Zechariah (4), “two olives” standing solid.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Two olive trees stood on either side of his vision of the menorah, standing for the “anointed ones standing by the Master of all,” <i>moshiach</i>. Perhaps what the holy Isbitser is saying is that just as the two olives stand solidly and effortlessly, so will it be clear with the redemption that all the toil and strife was as nothing, that we were always receiving God’s providence.</i> All of this is now hidden in the Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>, yet in the future God will show it to us without any separating “garments.” As it is said in the Midrash and in the Gemara (<i>Nidda</i>, 61b), “the <i>mitzvot</i> will be nullified in days to come [of the final redemption].” Then God will show us that we never really suffered under the “yoke” of a power in this world since He, may He be blessed, controls them all, yet all is in a state of concealment. This is the meaning of “that never had a yoke upon it.”",
                    "<i>“… a perfectly red heifer, without blemish, which never carried a yoke.”</i> (Bamidbar, 19:2)<br>“Heifer” represents the central point of life, which causes fruition and increase (the word for heifer, <i>parah</i>, is similar to the word for fruitfulness, <i>priya</i>). “Red” represents strength and joy. “Perfectly” meaning complete in its redness (in its strength and joy), without any folly in the actions of Israel, for “an imbecile is blemished.” “Which never carried a yoke” means freedom from any (earthly) yoke (kingdom, or enslavement, in any physical or spiritual form).",
                    "<i>“One who touches the dead .…”</i> (Bamidbar, 19:11)<br>One could become angry at God for a variety of reasons. Yet it is forbidden for him to harbor any complaint or anger at God for something that has already happened, just as one who is sick should not prevent himself from praying for God’s healing and mercies. (We are encouraged to pray to change God’s decrees in the present, yet accept the past as God’s will regardless of how we may feel about it.) “The dead,” means something that has happened in the past, and concerning this it is forbidden to become angry at the attribute of severe judgment. This is the meaning of “one who touches the dead,” one who became angry, raising complaints, the waters of purification purify him, meaning that the power of the four species in the purifying waters—ashes of the heifer, hyssop, cedar, and scarlet—will be revealed to him. Contained in these four elements is the root of everything. Because of this, the one who was pure becomes impure.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Cohen</i>, in a state of purity, by sprinkling the waters of purification on the one who became impure through contact with the dead, in turn becomes impure for a day.</i> That is to say, the one who is not in need of purification (like the <i>Cohen</i> performing the act of purification) should not look at this (, that though he deals with purifying he himself does not need it). In this way he will not become irreverent, saying, God forbid, there is no Judge (after being so perplexed that the one purifying would become impure). Rather, at that moment he is to just see that his efforts to purify succeed, and fix the man.",
                    "<i>“And the children of Israel journeyed and camped at Ovot.”</i> (Bamidbar, 21:10)<br>“Ovot” (a place name) signifies the principles of Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>, comparable to the expression “<i>av</i> [like <i>ov</i>] <i>b’chochma,”</i> a father in wisdom. It is written in the Gemara (<i>Berachot</i>, 54a), “ ‘it is a time to act for God, for they have made Your Torah void’ (<i>Tehilim</i>, 119). Rebbe Natan says, ‘It is a time to do for God, for they have made void your Torah.’ This means, since they have made your Torah void, act only [in the will] of God.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The laws are temporarily suspended in order that the Torah can later be strengthened. (Steinsaltz)</i> At a time when it is perfectly clear that it is a time to act solely for God, like Eliyahu on Mount Carmel,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Kings 1, Ch. 18, where though the building of an altar outside of the temple was not permitted at that time, still Eliyahu had to do it to show the greatness of God.</i> then it is necessary to put aside the principles of the holy Torah and act only in the understanding that God instills in you.<br>Rebbe Natan is saying that at a time when this God-given understanding is not completely clear to you, you must act according to the principles of the Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> without stepping out of the bounds of the <i>Halacha</i>. Yet Rebbe Natan is also saying that if your heart is drawn after God’s will, and have removed from yourself any kind of impurity (anything that could bring you down), afterwards God may provide you with an opportunity to act in a way that may seem as if, God forbid, you have removed yourself from the bounds of the principles of the Torah. Concerning this Rebbe Natan said that for the one whose heart is drawn after God and has cleaned himself from any <i>negiot</i> (personal motive, partiality), certainly God will not let him fall into a transgression, God forbid. He will surely then know that it is “a time to act for God.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is one of the classic teachings of the Mei HaShiloach and the one that has perhaps engaged him in more controversy with his opponents than any other. It could be easily misinterpreted as being antinomian, that God forbid the Torah is not absolute and we may choose to act based on our own perception of what God wants. This is not what he is saying. It is rather the deepest expression of how one may at times be drawn after God’s will, what Reb Shlomo Carlebach ZTs’L used to call being “beyond choice.” As the author mentions twice, it only happens in a state of complete clarity and after a process of being purified from any affliction or ulterior selfish motive. Then, once this has been clarified, he must start over and inspect himself again. Of course it is not a way to make anything permitted, as only a fool would interpret it, and some fools in our generation have. It is relevant when we find examples of our holy forefathers seemingly “breaking” the Torah, when in fact they are doing God’s will.<br>Take Lot and his daughters, an act of incest, which created the line of David. Yehuda and Tamar, also making way for the Moshiach. Tslofchad, who was killed for gathering wood on Shabbat, actually making us aware of the awesome greatness and depth of Shabbat. Aharon and Miriam’s “little foolishness” [see the end of Mei HaShiloach <i>bha’alotcha</i>] speaking against Moshe, which made us aware of the greatness of Moshe, and Korach’s challenge of Aharon, which revealed to us the great depth of the level of Aharon haCohen. One would also include Zimri, who is described in <i>Parshat Pinchas</i> as one who was on the highest level of separation from licentious behavior, so his incident with Cosbi can only be understood as an act of God’s will. The author mentions Eliyahu on Mount Carmel. This is a central theme of the Mei HaShiloach, and one that must be investigated further.</i><br>Thus it was when Israel camped at Ovot. For the entire time that Aharon was with them they would conduct themselves according to the understanding of their hearts, which was completely clear to them, as we understand from the clouds of glory in the desert.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is expression of God’s will, where the clouds went, they went.</i> Yet when the clouds of glory left them (after the passing of Aharon), they began to conduct themselves according to the principles of the Torah. This is like now, with our Holy Temple destroyed, where the only dwelling place of the Holy One, blessed be He, is within the four cubits of the <i>Halacha</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 8a). Thus they began to act according to the principles. This is <i>Ovot</i>, or the principles (<i>ovot—av b’chochma</i>—wisdom of the Torah), as explained above on the verse, “Do not make molten gods,” in <i>Parshat Ki Tissa</i>. However, they understood that through conducting themselves only according to the principles their hearts could not become sufficiently purified so as not to be detracted from the goal of God’s will.<br>This is as it is written (21:1), “and the Caananite heard … that Israel came by the way of the spies [through Edom].” In this, they saw that Israel was confused, for according to the principles it was not yet the time to enter the border of Esav as it is written (<i>Bereshit</i>, 33:14), “until I shall come to my master in Seir [Esav].” The Caananite is Amalek, as explained by Rashi, who saw that God presented them with a situation not in accordance with the principles. Thus (God) advised them to clean themselves from all forms of <i>negiot</i> (personal motive, partiality), and then any suspension of the Torah would be only because it is “a time to do for God.” This is why it says that they camped at <i>Iye Ha’avarim</i> (21:11), for there they inspected themselves concerning the two prohibitions (<i>avarim</i> is similar to <i>averot</i>, transgressions) “do not kill” and “do not commit adultery,” two laws that are the foundation and root of the entire Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is what the Author seems to have been referring to in the “removal of all affliction.”</i><br>Thus the advice given if you happen upon a situation that seems to you is against the Torah, you must inspect yourself concerning these two transgressions. The place name “Iye Ha’avarim” hints at this, for Iye shares the letters of <i>ya’im</i> (like a dustpan, <i>ya’e</i>)<i></i>, meaning to remove these transgressions from yourself. &lt;<i>i&gt;Avarim</i>, like <i>avera</i>, Hebrew for transgression, that you have purified yourself from these two sides. If you put your power into this process of purification, then you arrive at the meaning of what is said, “and they camped by the stream of Zared,” meaning that God gives us special strength.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tekifut. See note 61, <i>Sefer Shemot</i>.</i> For <i>zared</i> is strength, as it is written (<i>Yoma</i>, 47a), “all the women did valiantly, but the valor [<i>zered</i> or strength] of my mother exceeded them all.” And in the desert, when they had inspected themselves and removed any trace of <i>negiot</i> (personal motive, partiality),  from what had been prohibited, then God heard their voice.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is referring to arriving at Be’er, where they merited receiving a spring of water, and sang [<i>Bamidbar</i>, 21:17].</i>",
                    "<i>“Hear you rebels! Shall we bring you water from this rock? And God said to Moshe and Aharon, ‘since you did not believe in Me … therefore you will not bring them into the land .…”</i> (Bamidbar, 20:10,12)<br>Moshe said to Israel, “shall from this rock, concerning which we were not commanded, we bring you water?” (Midrash Tanchuma, <i>Chukat</i>, 9). Israel was claiming that since this came through a miracle, what is the difference which rock it comes from? Even though a particular rock is special in its ability to give water, God can bring water out of any rock, so why should there be any particular order in a miracle that it is only possible from this rock? Concerning this Moshe was exacting and said to them, “from this rock?” to show them that with miracles there is also an order, and actually requires this special rock. Thus the Holy One, blessed be He said to him, “since you did not believe in Me, then you will not bring them in,” not to be exacting, but rather as an answer, measure for measure.<br>Moshe Rabeynu knew that it was not for him to bring Israel into the land; this was the portion of Yehoshua, where Moshe’s portion was the Torah. Since they entered the land by means of miracles, such as conquering the kings, then God could make Moshe the instrument to bring them in, for God can do anything. This is the real reason for “because you did not believe in Me.” Since you yourself explained to Israel that with miracles there is also an order, therefore “you will not bring them in” (measure for measure) that selfsame reason necessitates that you will not bring them in. This is not in your portion, but the portion of Yehoshua, for he is the instrument prepared for this (This will be My order.) This is because with miracles there is also an order.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We see that God must also act according to His own order. We see, in order to be ethical, God creates His own limitations. An example quoted above concerns the sin of the prophet Hoshea who said (<i>Pesachim</i>, 87a), “exchange them [Israel] for a different people.” “The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Hoshea, ‘Your children have sinned,’ to which he should have replied, ‘They are Your children, they are the children of Your beloved ones, they are the children of Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov. Show them Your mercy.’ It was not enough that he did not say this, but he said to Him: ‘Master of the Universe! The whole world is yours. Exchange them for a different people.’ The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘What shall I do with this old man [who does not know how to defend his people]? I will order him: ‘Go and marry a whore and raise children of whoredom’; and then I will order him: ‘Send her away from your presence.’ If he will be able to send her away, then I too will send Israel away.’ For it is said, And the Lord said unto Hoshea, ‘Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredom and children of whoredom,’ and it is written, ‘So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Divlaim.’”</i>",

Because Edom (Esav) is the primary opponent of Divine service, asserting that since he is clean regarding his mother that he does not need such service. Aharon is the most refined of all the souls of Israel, and is deeply connected to service, and by means of this the seed of Esav is eradicated. (Esav’s claim is that his mother Rivka was exceptionally righteous so she must have given birth to him in a great state of purity. [Hagahot Peretz])",
                    "<i>“… and they camped at Iye haAvarim, in the wilderness before Moav, towards the east where the sun rises.”</i> (Bamidbar, 21:11)<br>They camped at <i>Iye haAvarim</i> because of the suffering they had just experienced (“and the people complained against God … and He sent snakes”). Therefore it says, “in the wilderness before Moav, towards the east where the sun rises,” which means that they begged God to refine their hearts, not through suffering, but by understanding all through the words of the Torah. For words of Torah refine the heart of man, and suffering refines the heart of man. They asked that their hearts be refined by means of the Torah, as it is written (<i>Tehilim</i>, 74:12), “fortunate is the man whom God punishes, and teaches from Your Torah.”",
                    "<i>“And from there to Be’er [“the well”], that is the well which God spoke of to Moshe, ‘gather the people and I will give them water.’”</i> (Bamidbar, 21:16)<br>Meaning, at a time when God wants to grant Israel salvation, He first wakes up their desire (symbolized by water and the well).",
                    "<i>“The well that the princes dug .…”</i> (Bamidbar, 21:18)<br>“Well” means <i>simcha</i> (true joy) and a good heart. The Patriarchs yearned for this. “The princes” means the Patriarchs.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A well of water connotes Joy, as in the verse (Yeshaya, 12:3</i>, “You shall water from the Well of Salvation with Joy.”)",
                    "<i>“And God said to Moshe … Take Aharon and Elazar his son, and bring them up to mount Hor … and Moshe stripped Aharon of his garments, and gave them to Elazar his son .…”</i> (Bamidbar, 20:23–28)<br>In this <i>Parsha</i> the Holy One, blessed be He, shows Israel that they are living and enduring forever, in what He said to Moshe, “Take Aharon and Elazar his son.” In the future the principal honor in the world will come from this, that the power of man will spread forth to other souls, as all the High Priests descended from Aharon.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Principally from this action of dressing his son in his garments before his death.</i> In the future they will all surround Aharon, crowning him, and his principal honor will come from them. It is the nature of life that lust is drawn into the heart in childhood, and later jealousy, yet the principal desire in old age is for honor, and honor will last forever also, as it is written (Mishlei, 3:35), “the wise shall inherit honor.” So it was with Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov, where the principal honor materialized in Yaakov Avinu in the twelve tribes that he established, as is explained in the Mei HaShiloach on the Gemara (<i>Breachot</i>, 26a), “Avraham established the morning <i>shacharit</i> prayer.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Avraham established the Morning Prayer, Yitzchak the afternoon prayer, and Yaakov the evening prayer.” Prayer is the device through which man connects with God. “Avraham established the Morning Prayer” means that man expresses thanks over the past and prays for the future, that God should increase his good. “Yitzchak established the afternoon prayer” means that man shows that he has received the light that was increased for him today, and he is happy with his portion. “Yaakov established the evening prayer,” means that man needs God at every second, and will only see light in His light. Therefore the evening prayer is not fixed, and would it only were that man would pray the entire day.<br>On this it is said, “Ekev anava Yirat Hashem,” “Following [or on the heels of, or because of] humility is the fear of God.” In childhood, when the main struggle is the control of lust, then the principal wisdom is the fear of God. When this struggle is no longer necessary, then he must follow the middle path, meaning <i>Ekev</i>, following, or the heel, (though corresponding to Yitzchak, the connection between <i>Ekev</i> and Yaakov, <i>Tiferet</i>, the middle column, is also relevant) meaning a balance between love and fear. Afterwards, when man’s heart is sufficiently purified so as to be drawn after God’s will, then he is permitted to expand into the world and taste of its good. There were the levels of the Patriarchs. Avraham was “the beginning of wisdom is the fear of God,” Yitzchak was “following humility,” and Yaakov could taste from all the delights of the world and experience the taste of the source of life.</i>",
                    "<i>“… and they took his whole land from him [Sichon king of the Amorites].”</i> (Bamidbar, 21:26)<br>The Gemara says (<i>Gittin</i>, 38:1), “Ammon and Moav became pure in Sichon.” (The following explains this.) This is as it is written (<i>Tehilim</i>, 136:23), “He remembered us in our lowliness.” The Holy One, blessed be He, promised Avraham Avinu that his sons would inherit ten nations, and these ten nations correspond in a spiritual sense to the ten forces of <i>kelipa</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Kelipa</i> means peel or husk that surround the sparks, in Lurianic Kabbalah, meaning forces of “the other side,” impurity, or evil.</i> for God created one according to the other.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Every force in holiness has a corresponding force in evil. The source of this phrase is Kohellet 7:14.</i> The seven nations<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The seven nations who dwelled in the land of Canaan before the arrival of Israel, Hitti, Emori, etc., which we were commanded to eradicate.</i> stand for external, revealed forces, i.e., actions. The remaining three (who we met on the way and were not commanded to destroy), Kini, Kenzi, and Kedmoni, who are actually Ammon, Moav, and Edom, correspond to the internal forces, that in the realm of holiness correspond to thoughts, gut feelings, the will of the heart.<br>Thus in the level of action—the external forces—Israel is in a state of purity compared to the seven nations, and thus it was within their power to conquer them. Yet on the level of thought, we were and still have not been purified, for there is no righteous one on earth who has not sinned in his mind. Yet in future times, when Israel will achieve purity even on the level of thought, then it will be within their power to conquer even the three remaining nations. And now, “even in our lowliness He remembered us,” taking the lands of Ammon and Moav and giving them to Sichon, the the king of the Emorites from among the seven nations, (who were conquered by Israel). And with whom in comparison Israel was in a state of purity.<br>This is hinted at in the practice of Israel to wear two head coverings (a stricture observed by Hassidic Jews while praying), which hints at <i>hod v’hadar</i>, majesty and splendor. For <i>hod</i> (majesty) is the internal level, and <i>hadar</i> (splendor) is beauty, apparent to all. The nations are only on the external level, which is beauty revealed for all to see, but on an internal level they are far from God, whereas Israel is united in her heart with God, her insides are imbued with the love of God. Therefore they go with two head coverings to hint that their insides are like their outsides. The nations cry out over this, and make it known from their cries that the salvation is near, for whenever God desires the salvation of the world it wakes an accusing spirit among the nations, and it is a time of suffering for the nation of Yaakov. Then from these times they will be helped, until it becomes clear that Israel is cleaving to God even on the level of thought. Then the final redemption will come. (Then there will be no more accusations or suffering.)"

Here God showed Moshe in a prophetic message what Balak was thinking and how he feared Israel. Also concerning Rachav (Joshua, Ch. 2), when Israel saw that fear of them had spread over the nations, they then understood that God is giving them the land as an inheritance.",
                    "<i>“And Bilaam said to God, Balak son of Tsippor sent to me.”</i> (Bamidbar, 22:10)<br>Since Bilaam was sitting and longing that some nation would send for him (to curse Israel), thus it arose in the heart of Balak to summon him. Bilaam had entertained desires to uproot Israel even when they were in exile in Egypt, as it is said in the Midrash (<i>Shemot</i> Rabba, <i>Parsha</i> 1:12), “three advised Pharaoh, Bilaam, Job, and Yitro … Bilaam advised him to destroy them.” Yet after he saw them go out of Egypt and God performing miracles for them he feared cursing them by himself, and waited expectantly for a nation to send for him, and that gave him an excuse to ask of God. Also, this is the ninth verse in the <i>Parsha</i>, and every time the ninth verse appears it contains an intention far deeper than it would seem at first glance according to its plain meaning.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The ninth hints at the attribute of Yoseph the <i>Tsaddik</i>, [the <i>sefirah</i> of] <i>Yesod</i>-foundation, and there is something hidden within it. This is as it says in the Holy Zohar [<i>Bereshit</i>, 3a], ‘[because nine is the Hebrew letter <i>tet</i>, the first letter in <i>tov</i> or good] letter <i>tet</i>, your good is closed within you and hidden within you. See below, in <i>Parshat Devarim</i>, “I alone cannot bear you,” in the notes, where the secret of one of the ninth verses is explained.</i>",
                    "<i>“For there is no divination in Jacob and no magic in Israel, thus in time it will be said to Jacob, what has God wrought?”</i> (Bamidbar, 23:23)<br>Divination (<i>nachash</i> in Hebrew) is stubbornly holding on to something without letting that thing go out of one’s mind. Magic (<i>qesem</i> in Hebrew) is the opposite, that is, when one equivocates over something, whether to do it or not, waiting and seeing if it turns out well, then doing it, and if doesn’t, then not doing it. This is magic,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The main point of <i>qesem</i> as understood here is not related to conjuring or supernaturally manipulating nature.</i> or waiting to see how something will act of its own accord. Both (<i>qesem</i> and <i>nachash</i>) are forbidden when not used in their proper place. This means that at a time when one knows God’s will with clarity, it is forbidden for him to remain silent and let things happen of their own accord, but must rather strengthen himself like a lion and act with strength. In a place where one is uncertain it is forbidden to act with force, but rather to consider how the action may come out of its own accord without his mental input. This is as we find in the Gemara, (<i>Chullin</i>, 95a), “Rav examined a ferryboat,” for when he reached a river the boat just came to him, without any effort of his own. From this he understood that it was from God, and without this sign he would not have traveled.<br>Therefore divination (<i>nachash</i>) is written with Jacob, for Jacob is called a man who is not yet in a state of completeness and whose heart is not yet drawn after God’s will. We find that when the prophet is expressing the smallness of Israel he calls it in the name of Jacob, as in (Amos, 7:2), “how shall Jacob stand for he is small?” Therefore he said that there shall be no <i>nachash</i> in Jacob, for at a time when a soul in Israel is uncertain about something not to act stubbornly, but rather remove all <i>negiot</i> (personal motive, partiality),  from himself, and see that however God acts, that is how he will act in the matter. And no <i>qesem</i> in Israel, meaning that for one whose heart is completely drawn after God, whatever thought that falls into his head is only from God’s will and has been (Divinely) bestowed upon him. (Acting upon this thought) would not be irresponsible but should rather be done with force, for if not, he would, God forbid, be acting against the understanding of God. With this Bilaam was praising Israel, for each one recognizes his level.",
                    "<i>“… thus in its time it will be said to Jacob and Israel, what has God wrought?”</i><br>This means that at every moment each soul in Israel, from the small to the great, shall know what God wants in the present. Each one shall see God’s will according to his understanding, and not according to the principles (of the Torah).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, <i>Parshat Chukot</i>, “and Israel traveled and camped at Ovot,” for more on this idea.</i>",

As it is said in the Holy Zohar (<i>Parshat Balak</i>, 212a), “his seed in the great waters” means that Israel would be in a place where their prophetic spirit would neither grow nor increase.” “Great waters” means the nations, as it is written (Song of Songs, 8:7), “great waters cannot extinguish [love].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The love mentioned is our love for the Torah.

If his intention was only for those who were alive, it would have been enough to say “all the descendants of Noah,” for all the life in the world was only from Noah’s offspring. Yet he said “Seth” because his intention including everything from creation, even those who are not now alive. The reason he said “descendants of Seth” and not “descendants of Adam” was because he could not see Cain and Abel, who were born in the garden outside of this world, and Bilaam could only see in this world.",

You must have seen that she has a portion in the world to come. I too see that the woman of Midian has a portion in the world to come.” On this it is written, “Do not praise tomorrow, for you do not know what the day will bring forth” (Mishlei, 27:1), for even if you see that the future will bring something good you still do not know how God will act at any present given moment. Yet since God shined into Moshe how to act in the present moment, therefore she was permitted to him. And in the future God will make it clear that the soul of this woman of Midian was connected to the root of his soul, as is explained in the writings of the Ari’zal; therefore he is afterwards called “a man of Israel.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">75</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Perhaps saying “from the children,” at least in this case, makes Zimri a little more disconnected, as he was doing something seemingly against his soul’s root, whereas “a man of Israel” has less disconnection, i.e., after it is clarified that Cosbi is connected to him at his soul’s root.</i>"

                "Pinchas": [
                    "<i>“And God spoke to Moses saying, ‘Pinchas son of Elazar son of Aharon haCohen has removed My fury from being sent upon the children of Israel in taking My vengeance among them, and I did not destroy .…”</i> (Bamidbar, 25:10)<br>It is written in the Gemara (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, 82b), “The ministering angels asked to punish Pinchas. God said to them, ‘let him go, he is a zealot, the son of my zealot [being from the tribe of Levi], an appeaser of my wrath, the son of one who appeased my wrath [being the grandson of Aharon who appeased God’s wrath in the affair of Korach].’” “The angels asked to punish Pinchas,” for a man may not take up the vengeance of God unless he is clean in this aspect. On this God testified, “he is a zealot, the son of my zealot,” to show that (just as were Shimon and Levi when they destroyed Shchem) he was clean and pure in this aspect. Furthermore, the tribes began to shame him, saying that he did it because of his hatred for Zimri. God answered them, “in taking up My vengeance among them,” meaning that his vengeance was owing to his great love for Israel, hinted at in the words “among them.”",
                    "<i>“And Pinchas son of Elazar son of Aharon haCohen saw … and took a spear .…”</i> (Bamidbar, 25:7)<br>It would not, God forbid, occur to anyone to say that Zimri was licentious, for the Holy One, blessed be He, would never have dedicated an entire <i>Parsha</i> in the holy Torah to licentionsness. Rather, there is a secret in this whole affair. There are ten levels of lechery. the first (and lowest) level is when one dresses up and goes intentionally to commit a sexual transgression, meaning one who deliberately invites the evil inclination upon himself. After this there are nine other levels, with each one a man’s power of free choice is taken from him a little more. (With the first level it was totally within his power to refrain), and with each level it becomes more and more difficult to escape the transgression. Finally at the tenth level, where one distances himself from the evil inclination and guards himself from transgression with all his power until it is impossible to guard himself anymore, if his evil inclination still overpowers him and he does such an action, then it certainly must be God’s will. Such was the case with Yehuda and Tamar, for she was his true soulmate. This is also the case here, as Zimri truly guarded himself from all evil desires. And now it occurred to him that she was his soulmate, since it was not within his power to remove himself from the action. Pinchas said the opposite, that it was still in Zimri’s power to refrain.<br>This is hinted at in the Gemara (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, 82b), “six miracles were performed for Pinchas,” and as it is said there, “if Zimri had separated from Cosbi, and risen up to kill Pinchas, then Zimri would have been found innocent of murder [acting in self-defense. That he did not do this was the miracle.]” Here there was a deliberation of each side, for with Pinchas there is also room for criticism. It seemed as if Pinchas was angry. Truly they claimed this against him, and here the judgment is at the discretion of the judge. As Rabeynu Tam explained (Tosefot <i>Baba Batra</i>, 35a,), “it is possible for the judge to give to those close to him,” therefore Pinchas emerged blameless because he was close to Moshe Rabeynu. This is why it said, “the name of the Israelite man who had been struck,” for afterwards, the Holy One, blessed be He, showed Pinchas with whom his struggle was really with (because he was Zimri— “who truly guarded himself,” etc.). He was not to think that Zimri was completely lecherous, God forbid. And in Pinchas’s eyes, since he had come from the seed of Yosef and had become purified concerning this through mortification of the flesh and trials, Zimri’s action was a great evil.<br>On this it is written (Hoshea, 11:1), “for Israel is a child, and I loved him.” This is precisely the matter of Pinchas, for he judged Zimri as lecherous, and in this case the judgment is that a zealot may kill him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the Mishna in <i>Sanhedrin</i> 81b, where if one sees another having intercourse with an Aramite, he may kill him in the heat of zealotry, but if he stops to consider the situation, there must be a trial.</i> However, the depth of the foundation of the matter with Zimri was hidden from him. Cosbi was indeed his soulmate from the six days of creation, as explained in the writings of R. Isaac Luria, Z’L. Owing to this, Moshe Rabeynu didn’t become involved and sentence Zimri to death. Pinchas’s response in this action is thus compared to a child, meaning that he didn’t know the depth of the situation, seeing only through human eyes and no further. Nevertheless, God loved him and agreed with him, for in Pinchas’s mind he had done a great and self-sacrificing act in his zealotry.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Regarding the verse mentioned above in Hoshea (11:1</i>, “Israel is a child, we find that Yosef, Pinchas’ predecessor, was also called “a lad” (Breishiet 37:10) when he resisted his evil inclination when he was tempted by in Egypt by Potiphar’s wife. The Midrash tells us that he was rewarded, seing in a vision that his children would actually descend from her. And so it was that he married her Daugther, Osnat.[Hagahot Peretz]) <br><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The references to the writings of R. Luria <i>Z’L</i> are from <i>New Writings of Chaim Vital</i>, Jerusalem 5748, where it is written:<br>Dinah’s root was in <i>Gevurah—Dina Qashia</i> or severe judgments—therefore Shimon took her. (Shimon was also rooted in <i>Gevurah</i>.) Since she was not yet purified, and also had intercourse with the Canaanite, who is the snake, of whom it is said, ‘cursed is Canaan,’ as is known, therefore Shaul son of the Canaanite descended from her (perhaps was reincarnated, or really descended). Our sages say Shaul is the same as Shlumiel ben TsooriShadai (prince of the tribe of Shimon), who is actually Zimri ben Salu. (See <i>Sanhedrin</i> 83a, which says that these are three different names for the same person.) The power of this contamination (of the snake) had been contacted by Cosbi, for Cosbi is also from the remains of the <i>klipah</i> (force of evil) of Dinah mother of Shaul, and she was his soulmate, except that she “ate an unripe fruit,” meaning that she was still not ready for him. Therefore he was called Shlumiel ben “Tsoori” Shadai and she was Cosbi bat “Tsoor.” Yet “Tsoor,” the father of Shlumiel, was Shimon, where “Tsoori” (“My rock” in Hebrew) is “Shaddai” (the name of God the “Almighty’), which survives the <i>klipot</i> and subdues them, and not so the “Tsoor” of the side of evil the father of Cosbi. We return to the subject. All the actions of our Biblical forebears, and all that is mentioned in the Torah, is not understood only according to its simple meaning and is not governed by chance, God forbid. So do not think that Shlumiel, who was the second-greatest prince, the chosen of the generation of the desert in the days of our master Moshe, was rushing out to commit forbidden sexual acts, as is understood in the small minds of fools. I have not come to explain all the verses necessary for these homilies, for the time would end but not the verses, for the Torah is not “old wives’ tales,” or the chatter of birds, God forbid, and this will suffice for those who understand. For these things are the furnace of the universe, and if these matters were to fall into the hands of one who has no brain in his skull to understand, he will just speak insolently, for a fool does not desire wisdom. Though these things appear strange … they stand at the pinnacle of the universe.</i>",

However, when Israel has transgressed God’s will, it was not from within themselves, but from the power of the nations that entered into them. The nations are filled with lusts and evil desires, and the heart of Israel can be affected by their power. This is as the verse says, “for they harass you in their wiles,” meaning that by means of their evil thoughts they will also harm you. Yet when the evil power in the nations has been destroyed, then the heart of Israel will be connected to God without the slightest deviation.",
                    "<i>“And Moses brought their case [of the daughters of Tslofchad] before God.”</i> (Bamidbar, 27:5)<br>It is said in the Midrash (Rabba, 21:13), “they came before the princes of tens and the princes of hundreds, and all feared to rule on their case, and even Moshe Rabeynu feared this until he brought the case before the Holy One, blessed be He.” Here we may explain that the sin of the one found gathering wood on Shabbat (Tslofchad) was that he sinned against Moshe Rabeynu. It is said in the Zohar (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 205b), “the portion of Moshe Rabeynu was Shabbat, as it is said [in the morning prayer of Shabbat], ‘Moses rejoiced at the granting of his portion.’” Tslofchad did not uphold the Shabbat on the second Shabbat that was commanded of Israel (since the giving of the Torah), yet if he had only fulfilled the commandment of Shabbat on this second Shabbat, the level of Shabbat that is the level of Moshe Rabeynu would have been immediately revealed to all. Because of the sin of Tslofchad, who had transgressed the second Shabbat, this light was closed from Israel. Because of this Moshe Rabeynu was uncertain whether he could be lenient (with Tslofchad’s daughters) or not. In the realm of physical damage it is forbidden for a scholar to be lenient (<i>Yoma</i>, 23a), yet with monetary damage he has the option to be lenient. As it also says there, “all who restrain their anger and act towards others with lenience, all their sins are forgiven.” Monetary damage is something of this world and can be returned, while physical injury is something that leaves a scar forever.<br>Moshe was thus uncertain. Perhaps this action was (on the level of) monetary damage, meaning that in the future the Holy One, blessed be He, would return this light to Israel, and it would be clear to all of Israel the goodness of the level of Shabbat, and that it was only lost temporarily. Or maybe it was (on the level of) physical damage, that if the souls of Israel only knew the precious depth of Shabbat, with what great strength and awe they would have served God. Because Moshe was uncertain of this, all the judges were afraid to rule on the case of the daughters of Tslofchad fearing that they would insult Moshe Rabeynu. God answered Moshe that since the light of Shabbat was only closed from them temporarily, it is called monetary damage, and he could be forgiving."

                    "<i>“And Moshe spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel saying, this is the word which God has commanded.”</i> (Bamidbar, 30:2)<br>“All the prophets prophesied with ‘Ko,’ ‘thus [spoke God],’ Moshe was superior to them all, saying, ‘<i>Ze haDavar</i>,’ ‘this is the word’” (Sifrei <i>Mattot</i>, 2).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One explanation: The prophets of Israel received their prophecy in a vision or a dream, but Moshe, the greatest of all prophets, would see God’s word clearly and lucidly before him, saying, “this is the matter, this is the word.”</i> Moshe’s level of prophecy only occurred in this (Moshe’s) generation. That is to say, all the prophets had a mission to Israel in conveying of their prophecies according to the particular time in which it was said and according to the power of their understanding. They would prophesize within these parameters. It occurred to them in their prophetic spirit that whichever particular word of prophecy they were speaking was enduring for all eternity. Yet truly, there were changes according to the quality of each generation. On this, “Moshe Rabeynu’s level of prophecy was superior to them all, prophesizing with ‘this is the word.’” This means that he understood the prophecy according to its time and place, understanding that a prophecy is only relevant for a particular time, and later God may desire something else. This is why the <i>Parsha’s</i> discussion of the laws of vows opens with “this is the word,” even though it is a commandment incumbent on every generation. This is understood from the Gemara (<i>Baba Batra</i>, 120a–b), “from sacrifices slaughtered outside.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“From sacrifices slaughtered outside” of the temple, and afterwards brought to the temple. This command is introduced with “this is the word,” and ends saying that it is for “all generations.” The Gemara compares it with the laws of breaking vows, saying that both are relevant in all generations, and then depending on the time and place.</i> Nonetheless it is introduced with “this is the word,” for one who vows not to do something does so according to the level of his understanding that this abstention will bring him to the service of God. He also understands that this action has nothing inherently good about it. Therefore it is said, “this is the word,” for one must understand that the particular action is only temporarily forbidden to him, and that God can give him the power to receive all the good of the world without being disconnected from the service of the Divine. (When one vows he accepts upon himself to abstain from something permitted, that he won’t eat this food or won’t speak to this person et al, because he knows that he cannot serve God with this action. <i>Zeh hadavar</i> is to say that after the vow is no longer relevant he needs to know that God can give him all manner of goodness from any action that he might have for a vowed to abstain from for a period of time.)",
                    "<i>“A man who makes a vow .…”</i> (Bamidbar, 30:3)<br>This is as it is written (<i>Tehilim</i>, 104:24), “How great are Your works, God, You have made them all with wisdom, You have filled the land with your possessions.” Here is the root of the matter of the prohibition of vows. Truly, all the boundaries and “fences” (used to protect the source of the law), whether involving an action, or whether involving refraining from an action, are included in the 613 mitzvot. The 613 mitzvot are necessary in every time, for all of Israel, without any kind of change or deviation from the source in any form. Still, we find situations in the world that are temporarily forbidden. In such a case, if one deems it necessary to forbid himself something, or (a legal authority) declares something forbidden to his whole generation, delineated to a specific time, thus it would only carry the weight of a rabbinical prohibition and a “fence.” For this reason, the Torah gives us the discussion of vows, where for the specific time each fence is deemed necessary it will be included in the Torah and carry the weight of a scriptural prohibition. Then when it becomes necessary it will be like one of the 613 <i>mitzvot</i> delivered to Moshe, different only in that it can be changed according to the specific time. Thus any time one takes upon himself a vow, delineating his actions by refraining from something, he is completing the entire structure of the Torah.<br>This is as we have in the Gemara (<i>Shabbat</i>, 119b), “all who say, ‘[thus the heavens and the earth] were completed,’ it is if he is made a partner with the Holy One, blessed be He, in the act of creation.” For the entire purpose of the creation of the world was in order for us to praise God, and at the time each one stands to give praise and thanks for this creation, he is completing it, or made a partner in it, as it were. Similarly, when making a “fence” or a vow for a specific period of time, one is completing the honor of the Torah. On this it is written, “how great are your works, God … You fill the land …” This means “You fill the land,” even now at each and every moment, “with Your possessions,” that is, with the completion of the Torah, to make this completion with words and fences to form Torah-ordained prohibitions.",
                    "<i>“A man who makes a vow .…”</i> (Bamidbar, 30:3)<br>It is said in the tractate <i>Nedarim</i> (vows) (10a), “what is <i>konam</i>? [Used as a proclamation when one makes a vow of abstinence.] Rabbi Yochanan said it comes from a foreign language. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said that it is a term that sages reserved for vows.” This is similar to what is written (Job, 28:28), “The fear of God is wisdom, to turn from evil is understanding.” Wisdom is when one considers everything carefully, understanding with his approval that the action is proper to do, and separating himself from that which is not proper. Understanding is when his heart is refined to such a degree that nothing against God’s will enters it, nor will he desire anything against the will of the blessed One. For all whose hearts are not yet refined need boundaries and “fences,” so as not to come to failure. Therefore Rabbi Yochanan said that all the terms used for vows of abstention are from foreign languages. In the eyes of the sages foreign languages were likened to stammering, and thus it is with one who has not internalized the concept of understanding, having it fixed in his heart so as not to need the boundaries and fences (of the law). Therefore it is called a “foreign language.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Uncertainty as to God’s will is likened to the uncertainty or even confusion of stammering.</i> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said, “it is a term separated for vows by the sages.” Each one explained <i>konam</i> according to the root of his soul. Rabbi Yochanan was completely righteous from his birth. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, however (a famous <i>Ba’al Teshuva</i>), understood according to his root that “[the Divine attribute of] ‘great mercy’ is a staff tilting those unworthy to the side of mercy” (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, 17a). He saw how even those terms from foreign languages were designated by the sages, for God in his great compassion will not abandon any intention for the sake of Heaven even if it is not yet complete.",

All of Israel equally was given the Torah to guard in its totality, yet at times the evil inclination comes to the heart of Israel from the power of the nations, depending on the particular kind of inclination according to the character of the nation it comes from. Thus Israel must guard itself more in that aspect of Torah more than any other in order not to come to a point of failure. Also here, Moshe Rabeynu chose the specific warriors who would fight Midian, choosing the people who could stand against the evil inclination of the Midianites. Furthermore, “wage war” (<i>yits’be’u</i>) comes directly from the word for army (<i>tseva</i>), referring to the way each troop is bannered, “displaying their colors,” as it were, for those who were chosen were exemplifying certain characteristics in Israel that they could use in order to stand against the Midianites.",

We find Zimri claiming to Moshe (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, 82a), “Who made Yitro’s daughter, a Midianite, permitted for you to marry?” His claim is that just as Moshe Rabeynu understood that Tsipporah was connected to him in his soul, so is Cosbi connected to Zimri, as in the writing of the Ari”zal, that Cosbi was a reincarnation of Dinah, and he was of Shchem. Pinchas saw his mistake and killed him, as is explained there, for God did not choose this matter to come about this way in the world. Here Moshe Rabeynu showed Pinchas that he is now making the same mistake in letting the Midianites live, as it erroneously occurred to him that he could bring them into a state of <i>Kedusha</i>. For here they did not actually see the action (as with Zimri), and it seemed to Pinchas that they would be permitted to live, yet Moshe Rabeynu understood that at the depths they are forbidden.

                    "<i>“And Elazar haCohen said to the men of war who were coming to battle .…”</i> (Bamidbar, 31:21)<br>It seems as if it should have been said, “who came <i>from</i> the battle,” as it said earlier (in verse 14). Yet truly, since Moshe Rabeynu’s rage had been kindled, when he said, “you let all the females live,” they had an answer to give him to justify their action.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, they could say that if they were truly correct at this time, he would not have displayed any anger, as with all the other times he spoke God’s word to them. See Rashi on this verse, which says that when one enters the realm of anger, he is liable to make an error, such as the incident of Moshe with the rock (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 20:11).</i> However, Elazar haCohen saw that if they had given an answer to contradict Moshe Rabeynu, they would have done irreparable damage. At this time Moshe Rabeynu was standing with absolute clarity on every matter directly to the life of the world to come, with no connection whatsoever to this world. Until now it was within Moshe Rabeynu’s power to be forgiving, but at this moment he was not able to be forgiving. Elazar haCohen understood this and why it was happening, so he quickly signaled Israel not to, God forbid, contradict Moshe Rabeynu at this time. With the intention of the heart of Israel to come and enter into an argument with Moshe, they were “coming to battle,” as it were, for the battle here was now between them and Moshe Rabeynu. So here Elazar taught them the laws of purifying the vessels of idolaters, for even a prohibition that had “absorbed” anger by the one who taught it is not to be regarded. When they heard that a vessel that had absorbed impurity was forbidden, they said, let us go and offer a sacrifice to complete what we cannot do with our thought alone. So too rust, which our sages taught must be removed before the purification process [see Rashi here], hints at anger.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this way Elazar diverted them from entering into controversy with Moshe, who was in a state not comprehensible by those in this world.</i> This is why Pinchas (Elazar’s son) was called “an appeaser of My wrath, the son of one who appeased my wrath,” and we see as mentioned above how Elazar managed to appease God’s wrath (by making peace in Israel)."

From God’s perspective, the entire creation was to exist equally on the same level, where all, from the small to the great, receive their existence from the essence of God. However, He created a variety of trials before man so that one may rise above another based on his actions, thus coming to a state exalted above his peers.<br>Because of this, at first, when it is written, “according to God,” it says, “their departures to their journeys,” for from God’s point of view one has no advantage over another, for they all live in an existence coming from God’s essence (all departing from—coming out of —God equally). Also there is no advantage in one’s actions. That which he desires he chooses. For when they left Egypt, the redemption was by means of a “leap,” as in “leaping on the mountains” (Shir Hashirim, 2:8). As the Ari”zal explained, God did not distinguish anyone based on actions (no matter how low, they “leapt” into redemption), for also against Israel there were accusations, such as (<i>Bamidbar</i> Rabba, 23:2), “both these are idolaters, and those are idolaters.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Claiming that there was no difference between Israel and the Egyptians to warrant Redemption.</i><br>Yet still, God redeemed them in His great compassion, for with Him they were all purified and all of Israel were devoted to God.

Therefore when it says first, “according to God,” meaning from God’s point of view, that first by the fact of their departure they found grace and goodness with God, and afterwards, “in their journeys,” that it was revealed and clear that they were good in their roots.

These are the 613 mitzvot. The whole point is to understand at every moment God’s will in words of Torah, knowing His will at all times, within the context of that particular time. Thus light emanates from th words of Torah to the hearts of Israel in order for them to understand the depth of God’s will, according to the time.

He did not say, “at the Aravah you sinned with the Baal Peor, at at Shittim with the Moabites, etc.” This was so as to honor them and not be overly harsh in his reproof. The Author takes this further, with a simple question. Why not mention the times instead of the places?) <br>This is in order that man does not think that they sinned according to their power of choice, and that they had the choice to remove themselves from the sin.

But still he wanted Israel to pray to God saying that they did not want another leader (than Moshe, in effect to change God’s will). This is hinted in the way he said, “I alone cannot bear you.” (Not alone, but if all of Israel prays, then perhaps.) Even though we find later (at the beginning of the next <i>Parsha</i>) that he asks God to be the one to bring them in, he says it to them here in order for them to understand that he needs their prayers now.

This is why <i>Vaetchanan</i>, Hebrew for “and I pleaded” (the verb for giving mercy, <i>chanan</i>, is intensified into meaning imploring for mercies), because he was made full of entreatment for God’s mercies, and his prayer flowed naturally from his mouth. This is a kind of proof that God sent him the awakening from below to pray. Therefore he surely would not be turned away empty-handed. This is hinted at in “at that time,” for even though God had already promised me that I would not enter the land, still it did not prevent me from praying.<br>This is as it is written in the Gemara (<i>Berachot</i>, 10a) of Hizkiyah king of Yehuda who said to the prophet Yeshayahu (who had just prophesied that he would die), “Son of Amots! Stop your prophecy and leave, for thus I have received from my father’s house [David, that even in the face of certain death], never to prevent oneself from praying for God’s mercies.” For there is nothing that stands to prevent one from the mercies of God. [And that it said that Hizkiya turned his face to the wall to pray.] The Gemara learns from this there should be nothing separating one from the wall (during prayer),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note that according to Halacha one may pray with something before him, i.e. a person or a pillar and the like, during prayer.</i> meaning that there should be nothing preventing one from prayer, and not to lose heart even if it seems that the decree has come from God, for “wall” teaches of the source of life.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As in Yirmiya, 4:19 where the same word for wall, <i>Kir</i>, is used for the chambers of the heart, hence source of life.</i> Even though it may seem that there is no salvation from the source, one may not withhold himself himself from God’s mercies.",
                    "<i>“You who began to show me .…”</i> (Devarim, 3:24)<br>In other words, that Moshe asserted to God, “You sent me the will to pray, creating an opening for me.” God answered him, “Rav Lach! You have had enough!” (<i>Devarim</i>, 3:26), meaning that all the spiritual awakenings that I have sent you were in order that Israel could learn from you for all generations how to pray to God, and not to withhold themselves from praying, and now “it is enough for you.” You have received and transmitted a sufficient amount for them to take care of all their needs.",
                    "<i>“See! I have taught you statutes and judgments as God has commanded me .…”</i> (Devarim, 4:5)<br>The Patriarchs also fulfilled the entire Torah, and taught it to their children, as it is said in the Midrash. Still, before it was commanded by the mouth of Moshe Rabeynu they were performing the precepts of the Torah even though they were not obliged to do so, acting of their own accord. Now Moshe Rabeynu renewed the Torah for them so they would be commanded and then fulfilling what was required of them, which is greater than doing even though it is not required.",
                    "<i>“See! I have taught you statutes and judgments as Hashem my God has commanded me .…”</i> (Devarim, 4:5)<br>When Moshe Rabeynu saw that he was not to enter the land of Israel, yet they would enter, he feared that the <i>Kedusha</i> (holiness) of the land of Israel would be less significant in their eyes. He feared they would say, “If it had great <i>Kedusha</i> then Moshe Rabeynu would have been able to go in.” Therefore he said to them, “as Hashem my God has commanded me …” This means “God, who loves me greatly, and if I also entered the land, he would have commanded me also concerning these Words of Torah.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus he said, “as My God has commanded me,” and not “as your God has commanded you.”</i>",
                    "<i>“And you shall keep them and do them, for it is you wisdom and your understanding in the eyes of the nations .…”</i> (Devarim, 4:6)<br>It is written in the Gemara (<i>Shabbat</i>, 75a) that this wisdom is the <i>sod ha’ibbur</i>, the secret of the calculation of the calendar and establishment of leap years, by which Israel knows how to set the calendar so it will endure throughout the hot and cold seasons. And when the nations see that Israel calculates and sets the calendar so it corresponds precisely to the world’s natural phenomena, and that they are doing so not according to their intellect and understanding, then they will understand that Israel is drawing its energy from a source above their intellect.",
                    "<i>“For who is a such a great nation who has God close to it .…”</i> (Devarim, 4:7)<br>Whenever we cry out, we have to be intensely close to God, for the meaning of crying out is desire and yearning for something. On this King David said (<i>Tehilim</i>, 131), “A song of ascents. God has not made my heart proud or my eyes high … if I have not quieted myself, as a weaned babe by its mother, so my soul is weaned beside me.” “Weaned” is when a small child is separated from its mother’s breast. In the same way when a small child wants something it will turn its head and look towards its mother so she doesn’t go away from him, so too must every soul in Israel look to God as not to be immersed in desires and pleasures. Then one will not, God forbid, forget God, but rather to think of His ways. This is as it is said in the Gemara (<i>Beitsa</i>, 11a), “a small bird that hops will not hop far from the nest,” and the community of Israel is likened to a dove (Gemara <i>Shabbat</i>, 130a).",
                    "<i>“[Guard yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of Hashem your God, which He has made with you,] and you make any graven image, even the likeness of anything of which Hashem your God has commanded you.”</i> (Devarim, 4:23)<br>This means not to give credence to any external surface appearance,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Gaven</i>, in Hebrew, meaning literally tint or coloring.</i> even concerning the <i>Mitzvot</i>, which God has commanded you, as is discussed in the holy Zohar (II Yitro, 87a-b).

This is why this verse is juxtaposed to the discussion of the cities of refuge, as it was the portion of Moshe Rabeynu to make known that God rules even in the air, and nothing happens outside of His will. In this he made a shield of defense for one who acts unintentionally—for how could the axe, slipping from the hand of its owner, cut a path through the air and kill another, if not according to God’s will? And so it is with all unintentional acts.",

                    "<i>“Hear O Israel, Hashem is our God … And you shall love Hashem your God … And it shall be when God shall bring you into the land .…”</i> (Devarim, 6:4–5, 7:1)<br>Concerning the progression of these verses, we learn that a man must refine himself in all his affairs in five areas (based on the following five verses). “Hear O Israel” means that a man must see that everything is in the hands of God, and that He is One. “And you shall love” means that one must be able to abandon all the pleasures of this world for the love of God. “And it shall be when God shall bring you” means service, that a man must serve God with all his soul, as it is written, “and He you shall serve [<i>Devarim</i>, 6:13],” and as it written there, “houses filled with all good things.” (No matter how much wealth and comfort one has) he shall not forget to serve God.<br>“Do not test God [<i>Devarim</i>, 6:16]” relates to once one has already refined himself in these three areas, then when God bestows good upon him, he shall not fear and be uncertain that maybe this will not be for his well-being. This is as “Do not test God” continues, “as you did at Massa.” In the incident at Massa (<i>Shemot</i>, 17:7), when the people complained for water, it says, “is God among us or not?” (Not to do this, but rather) to trust that indeed God is giving generously. “Do not show them mercy [when you eradicate the nations from the land (<i>Devarim</i> 7:2])” means not to be enamored of anyone who hates God. This is as it is written (<i>Eruvin</i>, 21a), “Until Zechariya ben Edo came and explained it … so we find that the entire world is one three thousand two hundredths of the Torah.”<br>“Three thousand” corresponds to the first three verses: “Hear,” “And you shall love,” “And when He shall bring you.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It seems that “thousand,” “<i>eleph</i>,” in Hebrew, is the same word as “learn,” “<i>aleph</i>,” in Aramaic, meaning that “once you learn these three attributes.”</i> “Two hundred” corresponds to “do not test,” and “Show no mercy.” Zechariya managed to uphold these Words of Torah (the above five stages of refinement) after his father Edo the prophet had first failed in them when he ate with the false prophet (see the whole story in Kings 1, Ch. 13). Edo truly had a reason to rely upon when he decided to eat with him, for after God told him not to eat, he had absolutely no desire to eat. Due to the purity of his heart, after he was warned he had no appetite. Then when the false prophet came to him and offered him food he was immediately hungry. With this he had proof that the matter was from God, for when two opinions agree with each other, then it is clearly God’s will. Similarly Yirmiya had put his trust in this as is explained on the verse “Molten images” (Mei HaShiloach <i>Parshat Mishpatim</i>). But he had to understand that all his desire was only that which the false prophet had awakened in him, and after this incident a new law was enacted that one may only learn a Torah law from someone he knows to be righteous. (In this way his son managed to uphold the Torah. Hence it was precisely through Edo’s son who enacted this law. After his father had ostensibly erred in his observance, then the Talmudic statement, “one can only uphold the words of the Torah if he has erred in it,” took effect, meaning his error retroactively deepened his understanding of the Torah. Thus he could then truly transmit the Torah through his lineage. [Hagahot Peretz])",
                    "<i>“And you shall love Hashem your God with all your heart, and all your soul, and all your possessions.”</i> (Devarim, 6:5)<br>(This is in the first section of the <i>Shema.</i> And in the second section,) “And it will be, if you will surely hearken” (it says, “all your hearts, and all your souls”) but it does not say “and all your possessions.” For “your possessions” is literally “your <i>much</i>.” This means to be so greatly (much) willing to deliver over your whole life for the sanctity of God’s name, even if this means sacrificing your life in the world to come.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is quite striking, as it would seem that one would be willing to give over his life in this world. But what does it mean “to give over your life in the world to come” for the sake of the <i>mitzvot</i>? Here are two possible solutions. It has been said that the true test of the sincerity of an action is if one is willing to do that action for all eternity. “The world to come” is eternity, and thus one would be willing to stake their eternity on the performance of the <i>mitzvot</i>. A second solution could be that this is hinting at the necessity to go outside of the principles of Words of Torah in order to fulfill God’s will, and thereby forfeiting his share in the world to come. See the first piece in the Agra DePirka of R. Zsvi Elimelech of Dinov, zts”l.</i> Yet this is all only before it is entirely clear to a person his portion connected to him at the root of his soul. For everyone has a particular mitzvah that by fulfilling he thereby achieves the world to come, and according to this mitzvah and its fulfillment is the essence of that person’s whole existence. Before one’s portion is clear to him, he must serve God in such a way that there is nothing that he would not give over to sanctify God (“and all your <i>muchness</i>”). Yet after it is clear what his portion (and particular mitzvah) is, God no longer wants him to serve in the previous manner, for God does not want to take away from him this quality for which he had been suited. From man’s point of view even though he is only required to give his life for the three prohibitions of idolatry, forbidden sexual unions, and murder, yet for the particular mitzvah known to him connected to him at the root of his soul he must give his life to fulfill it. This is reminiscent of Daniel who was willing to give his life to stand and pray, though he was not required as such by the law. Similarly Mordechai would not bow down before Haman, which would have been a small price to save his life<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Sanhedrin, 61b, Rava’s opinion</i>. Yet they understood that that particular mitzvah was connected to them at the root of their soul, (and worth dying over,) as is explained on the verse, “if you happen upon a bird’s nest” (above in <i>Parshat Ki Teitse</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">All this explains the absence of “all your <i>muchness</i>” in the second section of <i>Shema</i>, corresponding to after it is clear what his portion is, and only for that to be greatly willing to deliver over his soul.</i>",
                    "<i>“And these things which I command you today shall be upon your heart.”</i> (Devarim, 6:6)<br>It is written in the Gemara (<i>Pesachim</i>, 55b), “The men of Jericho would ‘wrap’ the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>. This they would say, ‘these things that I command you today shall be upon your heart’ [without pausing after ‘today,’ as if to say, ‘today they shall be upon your heart, but not tomorrow.’ The author will depart from this explanation].” Jericho hints at scent.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Reyach</i> means scent, and its letters are found in the Hebrew word for Jericho.</i> Furthermore, Jericho is called the “city of date palms,” which means that its inhabitants deeply understood the meaning of dates being the last of the seven species found in Israel (see <i>Devarim</i> 8:8). They understood that in the end Words of Torah would be fixed in the hearts of Israel according to God’s will. Thus they said, “<i>today upon</i> your hearts,” meaning that today Words of Torah are only on your hearts, but tomorrow they will be fixed within your hearts. The sages did not agree with their practice, asserting that it is not within the power of man to hasten the Salvation, unless it happens by God’s will. Therefore this was only the practice of the men of Jericho because Jericho teaches of scent, as explained, meaning that they would smell the approaching salvation from afar. Furthermore, it is called “the city of date palms” (<i>Devarim</i>, 34:3) and dates are the last of the seven species, meaning that they looked onto the end of the matter.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note: Scent is the highest and thereby most tenuous of senses and alludes to the loftiest perceptions of Divinity (<i>Likutei</i> <i>Halachot</i> ‘<i>Rei’och</i>’</i> – especially to connect to the vaguest thing to grasp – the Final End. Yericho imbued its inhabitants with power to link to ethereal levels not so readily available to others. Many other places in Rabbinical literature we find that places can influence for good or for better those who rest in them. Yericho ‘Date City,’ “Date tree takes seventy years to fully mature” (Baba Batra 80b).

                    "<i>“You [plural] shall surely guard the mitzvot of Hashem your God, and His testimonies and statutes which He has commanded you [singular].”</i> (Devarim, 6:17)<br>Why does the verse begin in the plural, “You shall surely guard,” and then end in the singular, “which He has commanded you”? God gave the 613 mitzvot equally to all the people of Israel, and one is just as obligated to fulfill them as another. Yet as for “His testimonies,” meaning the meaning behind the mitzvot, each one feels the unique meaning of a commandment that another does not feel, nor does he have the understanding of his fellow. We find an example of this in the Gemara (<i>Pesachim</i>, 53b), “even though one says to light, and another says not to light, they both had the same intention.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is discussing whether or not to leave a candle lit on the eve of Yom Kippur. One says that if there is light he is less likely to engage in intimate relations, and another says if it is dark and he does not see his wife, then he will be less likely to succumb. Both opinions are in order to distance one from sin.</i> For at first it seemed as if one disagreed with the other, yet truly there was no disagreement for they both intended the same thing. Thus one does not call to question the attributes of his fellow, for he understands that his fellow can only keep the mitzvah in his own way, and not in his way. Therefore it says (in verse 19), “to cast out all your enemies from before you,” which is referring to those involved in fierce disagreements in Israel. Yet the meaning is not that they should be destroyed, God forbid, but rather to cast out their kind of service from before you, so as not to disturb you from your own service.",
                    "<i>“When your son asks you in the future, saying, what are the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments which Hashem our God has commanded you?”</i> (Devarim, 6:20)<br>What he is really asking is why God chose us in His great love, so therefore you answer him (verse 21), “we were slaves.” This means that we were downtrodden, and it is the way of God to dwell in the downtrodden and low of spirit. This is as it is written (Yeshayahu, 57:15), “I dwell in a high and holy place, and also with the downtrodden and meek of spirit. I revive the spirit of the lowly and the heart of the downtrodden.” And when God desires to save, He does so with the full greatness of His awesome power.",
                    "<i>“And it shall be righteousness for us, if we keep the mitzvot to do them .…”</i> (Devarim, 6:25)<br>The Aramaic translation of “righteousness” is <i>Zechuta</i> (meaning both “merit” and “pure”). This means that God will testify that our actions are pure from the depth of the heart. For a Gentile who gives a coin in charity solely in order that his son will live is called wicked. Yet an Israelite who does this is wholly righteous.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the Gemara, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 4a. Many commentaries point out that this seems to contradict the Mishna in <i>Pirke Avot</i>, “do not perform the mitzvot in order to receive a reward.” The Maharal of Prague explains that if one is doing a mitzvah for the sake of the Holy One, blessed be He, then even if he expects to receive some reward, he is considered righteous. </i> This is because the Holy One, blessed be He, testifies that the depths of our hearts are refined according to His will.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Also – Torah affords the Jew ability to utilize life in this world for spiritual purposes and so giving Charity for the sake of material benefit can be considered “for the sake of Heaven”.

                    "<i>“And it will be, on account of your understanding these judgments [and keep them, and do them, and Hashem Your God will keep the covenant and the loving-kindness which He promised to your forefathers].”</i> (Devarim, 7:12)<br>“And it will be” is always a term denoting <i>simcha</i> (joy), as it is said in the Midrash (<i>Bereshit</i> Rabba 42:4). The verse says <i>ekev</i>, meaning both “because of” and “heel”—and thus signifies “the end.” This is in order to show that in the future God will reveal to each soul in Israel the understanding that no statute or law in the Torah, no matter how inscrutable, was without meaning. At present, all the difficulties that Israel suffers over the fulfillment of <i>mitzvot</i> are due to an inability to understand the depth of the good contained in the <i>mitzvot</i>. It appears to them that these statutes are without meaning, and therefore they suffer from them. Yet when it becomes perfectly clear that everything was done in justice for the benefit of Israel and was not without meaning, “then our mouths will be filled with laughter,” (<i>Tehilim</i>, 126:2) and we will rejoice<i>.</i>",
                    "<i>“And it will be, on account of .…”</i> (Devarim, 7:12)<br>It is said in the Midrash (<i>Devarim</i> Rabba, 3:1), “What is the law for a man of Israel who has a lamp that separates into parts, may he carry it on Shabbat? Our rabbis taught that if he assembles it he is liable for the prohibition of building on Shabbat.” What is the point of teaching this law precisely here (at the beginning of the Midrash on <i>Parshat Ekev</i>)? Carrying such a lamp was prohibited on Shabbat from the suspicion of building, for even if the branches were joined together quite loosely they feared that they might tighten through the very motion of carrying, and he would thus be building. Since there was no precise measurement given as to how much one would have to build to be liable for building, even the smallest amount was forbidden, and with this it is impossible to be precise. Consequently one may, God forbid, accuse God of being tyrannical with His creation, giving mitzvot that are impossible for them to perform.<br>Therefore the Midrash follows immediately with, “How did Israel keep the Shabbat when it was first given to them in Alush, where it says, ‘and the nation rested on the seventh day’ (<i>Shemot</i>, 16:30)? Perhaps they would say that for your detriment was Shabbat given to you, when it was only given for your good.”<br>This was in order to show that even the fulfillment of the <i>mitzvot</i> is in the hands of God, for He gives man the power that he needs to fulfill them. In the frail mortal intellect it is impossible to understand how Israel kept the first Shabbat in all its details, to which they were completely unaccustomed to (as they were immersed in slavery), immediately, the first time. All of Israel did not transgress even the minutiae of Shabbat, and the verse testifies to this. In this is proof that God completes us and prepares all of our actions for our welfare. This is, “And it will be, because you surely hearkened …” (<i>ekev</i>, meaning both “because” and “heel” thus signifying the end), because at the end God sees that all of Israel went after His holy will.",

Do not fear them, remember well what Hashem your God did to Pharaoh and all of Egypt.”</i> (Devarim, 7:17–18)<br>How is it possible to warn of something that happens of its own accord without the input of man’s will, and command concerning it, “be not afraid?” Will not the heart fear it anyway (as it is out of our hands)? Yet we find that the contents of a man’s heart are known through his actions, and by means of the mitzvot the depth of his heart will become clear. For example, one who does not rule over his fellow even though it is within his power to do so, from this we see that he fears God. If he adorns the mitzvot “<i>hiddur</i> mitzvah,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“<i>Hiddur</i> mitzvah” means going beyond what is asked to perform them in beauty and splendor, marking their centrality.</i> to a high degree, as our sages have said (<i>Baba Kama</i>, 9b), this is proof that he loves God from the depth of his heart, and not superficially. Similarly here God warned of the necessity to remove illusion from the heart of Israel. Truly the heart of Israel contains a special power, so it is necessary to remove the illusion from their heart, for in truth God does not desire that we fear anything illusory. This is as it is written (Yesahya, 45:19), “I have not said to the seed of Jacob, ‘seek me in <i>tohu</i>’ [chaos, baseless void].” <i>Tohu</i> means the fear of the illusory, and a man must know that there is a force running the world, and He wants His creations to have a calm mind. That which He warned here, “do not fear them” means not to fear the superficial (the illusions of the surface), as is explained on the verse, “when you see the horse and chariots, a people more powerful than you…” (Mei HaShiloach <i>Parshat Shoftim</i>).",
                    "<i>“Guard yourselves, lest you forget Hashem your God to not keep His mitzvot … lest you eat and are satisfied and build good houses … and you say in your heart, ‘my power and the strength of my hand has made for me this wealth.’ And you shall remember Hashem your God for He is the one who gives you power .…”</i> (Devarim, 8:11–18)<br>In <i>Parshat Va’etchanan</i> it says the opposite. There it said, “and it shall be when He shall bring you … to give you great and good cities which you have not built, vineyards which you did not plant … guard yourselves lest you forget … fear Hashem your God, serve Him,” etc. (<i>Devarim</i>, 6:10–13). There it teaches of a time when one sees that God grantes him goodness, and it appears to him that all this God-given abundance will come to him without any effort. Then, lest he think that he does not have to serve or fear God, it says, “fear Hashem your God and serve Him” (<i>Devarim</i>, 6:13). But here it is the opposite, for when one builds houses, plants fields, and succeeds, it may seem to him that his own power and strength effected this. Therefore it says, “and you shall remember Hashem your God for He is the one who gives you power,” for without God’s will the actions of man are nothing. This is also the case with great situations when God gives abundance to man without his effort and it seems that he does not need the service of God. Concerning this it said, “fear Hashem your God,” for God does not give for free. He will only bestow it upon you for the prayer and service within you, and will give to you according to this.<br>And if one says that he will serve God by himself based on his own power, without the assistance of God, for this it says, “remember Hashem your God for He is the one giving you strength.” This means that all the power we have for prayer and <i>avodat Hashem</i> (service of the Divine) is coming from God, as it is written (<i>Tehilim</i>, 10:17), “You prepare their heart, You will incline Your ear.” For surely God has arranged the mitzvah for you without your own awareness, and “one mitzvah draws another mitzvah” (<i>Pirkei Avot</i>, 4:2). By means of this the power for <i>avodah</i> (Divine service) exists permanently within your heart. Since this <i>avodah</i> has been fixed in your heart He will bestow goodness upon you.",
                    "<i>“You shall not say, when Hashem your God casts them out before you, that because of my own righteousness He let me inherit this land, rather because of the wickedness of these nations does He drive them out from before you.”</i> (Devarim, 9:4)<br>At the beginning of this statement it seems as if it is also not because of the evil of the nations that He is giving you the land, but at the end it says, “because of the wickedness of the nations.” Truly God has chosen Israel even regardless of their actions. This is as it is written (Malachi, 1:2), “is not Eisav a brother to Yaakov1? Yet I love (only) Yaakov.” Also in Egypt there were accusations pointed at Israel. This is as it is written in the Midrash (<i>Vayikra</i> Rabba, 21:4), “The angels of the nations of the world came to accuse against Israel before the Holy One, blessed be He, saying, ‘Master of the Universe, these are idolaters and these are idolaters, these are promiscuous and these are promiscuous, these are murderers and these are murderers!’” Nonetheless, God chose Israel because at their depths and at their roots they are a portion of God from on high, as it is written (<i>Devarim</i>, 32:9), “His people are a portion of God.”<br>One could assert that when God commanded us to eradicate the seven nations that He was telling us to act with rampant cruelty, God forbid. But we also see that the Holy One, blessed be He, hates the nations precisely because of their cruelty. From this matter it is seen that what is evil among the nations becomes good with Israel, for God testifies that it is all done from His will. This is the explanation of “for because of the wickedness of the nations” (<i>Devarim</i>, 9:5). Because of this very matter, that with Me they are called evil and doers of evil, in this itself you are called ones who do My will. This is proof that it is not for your righteousness, and not even for the wickedness of the nations, that God brings you into the land. Rather, He desires you regardless of any behavioral criteria. Even though you act as they do, God still desires you. Therefore, “for the wickedness of the nation” is a term denoting “for this reason, because of.” From this we understand that purely because you are His portion will God agree to all that you do, and it will be good in His sight.",
                    "<i>“And now, Israel, what does Hashem your God ask of you but to fear Hashem your God, to go in His ways, and to serve Hashem your God with all your heart and all your soul.”</i> (Devarim, 10:12)<br>It is written in the Gemara (<i>Berachot</i>, 33b), “Is the fear of God a small thing? Yes, for Moshe the fear of God is a small thing. It is as if someone is asked for a great object, if he has it, it seems to him like a small object. If he is asked for a small object, and he does not have it, it seems to him like a great object.” The words of the Gemara are not clear. Why would the fear of God be compared to a small or great object? Yet truly, the fear of God is likened to bread that gives life to man. So when one is described as being poor, you would say that he does not even have a loaf of bread. But if you describe a rich man, you don’t talk about bread, for that is something that everyone needs; rather, you describe how he has all kinds of precious and rare objects that most people do not have. This is what the Gemara means when it says, “a great object, and it seems to him like a small object.” In describing the man who is complete in all ways, you do not describe his fear of God, because this is the very first level that one must reach. This is as it is written (<i>Tehilim</i>, 111:10), “the beginning of wisdom is the fear of God.” Yet when you describe a man who is wholly incomplete, you say that he does not even have the fear of God, and then it seems to him like a great object. For this is the principle (for spiritual completeness), as bread is the principle that sustains the life of man.",

Indeed Korach truly had a great love of God and according him his intentions were for the sake of Heaven. They, however, were only interested in their own self-aggrandizement. Furthermore, this Parsha will speak of the love of Torah scholars, and one should be willing to give all his wealth to Torah scholars in God’s will. This is called “the <i>Shmitta</i> year,” the seventh year of release, when one is required to open all his property to all (at least his field and its produce) in honor of God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The correlation is that just like <i>Shmitta</i> the sevevnth year is holy in the domain of time, so are Torah scholars holy in the domain of soul. As explained in Sefer Yetsirah, they are connected an correlate to each other. [Hagahot Peretz]</i><br> This is as it is written in the Midrash (<i>Vayikra</i> Rabba, 1:1), “The mighty in strength who fulfill His word [<i>Tehilim</i>, 103:20]. Of whom does the Torah speak? Rabbi Yitschak said, of those who observe the <i>Shmitta</i> [sabbatical] year.” Korach had this power, yet he asserted that he was the true Torah scholar of his generation, and this is called “the price of a whore” (see <i>Devarim</i>, 23:19), giving in a place where it should not be given. This is not so with Datan and Aviram, who were not at all on this level, but rather acted with pure chutzpa against God. With them it is called (ibid) “the price of a dog.” Therefore the verse (<i>Devarim</i>, 11:6) “and all the substance that was under their feet [in their possession],” did not mention Korach, because he was clean in this aspect, but they were not.",

This is as it is written (<i>Tehilim</i>, 134:3), “God will bless you from Zion, the Maker of heaven and earth.” At the time of the acceptance of the yoke of the Torah all of Israel were equal, for all want to serve God. Yet with the memorial (<i>tsion</i>, in Hebrew, here signifying an impression and effect) that the words of Torah make in the heart of man, meaning when they are instilled in his heart, here there are differences, and one’s mind is not similar to his fellow. Thus it is that the reception of reward depends on what is brought in and the impression it makes. Therefore the verse begins in the plural, meaning the acceptance of the yoke of the Torah (if you will surely hearken), for all accept it equally. Afterwards, the following verses are discussing the reception of reward, which depends on the impression fixed in the heart, so therefore it is written in the singular, for in this one does not resemble his fellow. Therefore it is written in <i>Tehilim</i> (128:5), “and you shall see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life.” Jerusalem hints at the fear of God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The first three letters in Jerusalem, <i>yiru</i>, mean fear, or reverence, and the last three spell <i>shalem</i>, hence complete reverence.</i> According to the fear of God and the constrictions one goes through to honor God, accordingly he will receive reward and God will effuse unto him expansion.",

In times of trouble it is the man’s nature to shout and cry out to God, “what have You done to me?” Yet at the time when God bestows His goodness man’s eye is clouded from seeing that it is from God. Then he says, “my power and the strength of my hand has made me this wealth [<i>Devarim</i>, 8:17],” therefore God shows him, “See! I give before you,” meaning that everything is from God.",
                    "<i>“See! I give before you today a blessing and a curse.”</i> (Devarim, 11:26)<br>This means that each time the Holy One, blessed be He, bestows goodness to man, He dresses it in a garment where it appears on the outside to be the opposite from that goodness. (This is explained in the Mei HaShiloach in <i>Parshat Korach</i>, on the verse, “and I put my word in his mouth.”) In this way man may refine himself by his actions and bring to light the goodness that is at the depths. Then it will be called “the work of his hands.”",

Only in the place that God will choose .…”</i> (Devarim, 12:13)<br>The language of warning is doubled here, saying “be careful,” and then “lest.” This is because the sacrifice mentioned is an <i>olah</i>, a burnt offering, and it signifies a place where man receives no benefit whatsoever from his action. An <i>olah</i> is given completely to God (it is burnt in its entirety), and no benefit is left for the one who offers it. It is forbidden to use (anything similar to an <i>olah</i>, devoted entirely to God,) in any other capacity, only for God alone.",
                    "<i>“Only in the place that God shall choose .…”</i> (Devarim, 12:14)<br>From this we learn the way of prayer, how to pray to God, as it is written in the Gemara (<i>Berachot</i>, 28b), “direct your heart to the house of the Holy of Holies.” When you want to pray, see to it that from the outset that the matter that you want to pray for is God’s will. This is the meaning of “direct your heart to the house of the Holy of Holies.” We understand this by saying that if you then have the desire to pray and your lips are filled with its bounty (i.e, the prayer comes naturally), you can then know that it is God’s will, and you will understand that the entire matter is from God. This is explained in the Mei HaShiloach in <i>Parshat Va’etchanan</i>. In this way King David said (Divrei haYamim 1, 17:25), “You have uncovered the ear of Your servant [to hear Your command] … therefore Your servant has found it possible to pray.”",
                    "<i>“When God shall enlarge your borders … and you will say, ‘I shall eat meat’ … you shall eat meat according to the desire of your soul .…”</i> (Devarim, 12:20)<br>It is not said that they will go outside of their borders, but only that their borders will become enlarged. In truth, God’s name, <i>Hava’ye</i> (YHVH, called the Tetragrammaton) signifies that from God’s perspective He has chosen Israel, He has no borders, and thus He permits one to extend freely in all the goodness that God gives. However, from the name <i>Adon-ai</i>, signifying man’s understanding and the limit of his apprehension, we derive all borders, knowing that “until here it is permitted to expand” and “from here on it is forbidden.” This means that according to the amount of strength one finds to serve God may he extend himself in God’s goodness. This is the meaning of “when God shall enlarge your borders.” That is, when one first enters into <i>avodat Hashem</i> (service of God) it is forbidden to extend himself freely, for if he goes too far he may, God forbid, remove himself from the fear of God. Yet when his strength for <i>avodat Hashem</i> increases, and with it his fear of God, then he may extend himself further than his level of <i>avodah</i>. This is the meaning of “when God shall enlarge your borders,” meaning that He will give you such great strength for <i>avodah</i> until all (previously constricted) borders will be removed from you to the extent that you may also eat meat without surpassing your boundaries.",

This bears the appearance of extreme cruelty. Therefore it says, “and give you compassion, and be compassionate with you,” for regardless of the cruelty, by means of fulfilling the commandment of God you will come to internalize the attribute of compassion, and you will show compassion in a place where compassion is due.",

A man’s mind is at repose when he is in his own place, but when he is in a foreign place his mind is unsettled.

This is why it then says (in verse 20), “so that you shall live,” for nothing will be lost when man acts with the spirit of justice, (with a reckoning of his actions.) This is discussed in the Holy Zohar (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 178a) on the verse (in Kohellet 9:10), “… there is no action, no account, no knowledge, no reckoning in <i>sheol</i> (the grave, or purgatory) ...” That is, an action done with careful consideration will not fall into <i>sheol.</i> In the beginning of this week’s <i>Parsha</i> we find six warnings corresponding to the “six sides on which thought depends.” They are 1) Judges and officers, 2) Do not plant an asheira tree near the Altar, 3) Do not erect a monument as was practiced by idolaters, 4) Justice, justice, you shall pursue, 5) Do not sacrifice a blemished animal, and 6) The rebellious elder.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We learn from Kabbalah that not only are the six lower attributes born from thought, i.e. the upper three, but, regarding our discussion here, they embody and give voice to thought.

Thus it is with the order of subjects in the <i>Parsha</i>, the discussion of the judges or scholars preceding the discussion of the king, the sage coming before the king even though the king is greater than the sage. According to the protocol in Jewish law, we find that the Sanhedrin (the Torah scholars) appoints the king (Tosefot <i>Sanhedrin</i> 83), then the high priest, and afterwards the prophet. Yet once appointed, the king takes precedence over the scholar, as all that comes out of the mouth of the king are the words of God.<br>This is as the Gemara explains (<i>Shabbat</i>, 56a), that when Uriah the Hitti said something seemingly inconsequential (“my master Yoav,” disrespecting David’s kingship), he was branded an inciter to rebellion, which shovws that even though it seemed to be mundane chatter, it was from God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Providence manifested through the king is so intense that even what others say to him is akin to prophecy. [Hagahot Peretz]</i> The high priest feels in his understanding how something is God’s will. With the prophet, at the time when he says, “Thus spoke the Lord,” all must heed his words, yet when he speaks only from his own knowledge he has the status of a sage.<br>“Judges” hints at Moshe Rabeynu, for he was a judge and not a king (Gemara <i>Zevachim</i>, 102a). God said to Moshe at the burning bush, “do not approach, remove your shoes .…” (<i>Shemot</i>, 3:5), as if to say that he was only a king for his own generation. (See Devarim 33:5, “there was a king in Yeshurun”). For this reason he does not receive the title of king. The discussion of the king (<i>Devarim</i>, 17:14) hints at King Shlomo, and these two were the paramount of all generations, Moshe was the paramount of all judges, and Shlomo the greatest of all kings. The development of events that Moshe Rabeynu wrote in <i>Parshat Hazinu</i>, King Shlomo also wrote in the <i>Shir haShirim</i> on a different matter. And there is a difference between them, for they both wrote of the course of events from the beginning to the end of all generations, and at present the Holy One, blessed be He, agrees with Moshe Rabeynu, because the section of judges precedes the section of kings. Yet in the days to come, with the resurrection of the dead, the Holy One, blessed be He, will make it clear that both of them are true. <i>Amok. amok</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">King Shlomo was greater than his father King David in that he ruled over the whole known world (Gittin</i>.

How so? If he can abandon the transgression owing to his love of God, very well, and if not, he may contemplate that he will receive some reward in this world for his abstention. “In all your gates,” meaning desires; “for your tribes,” meaning all the diverging views.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">All views and scenarious that result in the deep contemplation of God’s will [Hagahot Peretz]</i>",

Then afterwards he realizes that without the Torah he may not even reconcile the most simple matters. “He will redeem us,” means that in the end God will show man that all the ways He dealt with him were only for his good. He shows him that man did not remove himself from God’s will even when he acted without thinking, for God will immediately rule over all the powers that are not in the control of man, like sight and hearing. On this it is said (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 23:22), “He has the power of the horned beast,” meaning, God alone will control the powers that are beyond the control of man.",

For with God there is a depth far deeper than his understanding, as it says in the Gemara (<i>Shabbat</i>, 10a), “every judge who makes a judgment that is true to the deepest level of truth is made a partner with God in the work of creation.” There are judgments that are true but not on all levels of truth. For example, one who denies the crime and is deemed exempt (because of a lack of evidence, a lack of reliable witnesses, and the like), though it could be that though he denied everything he was in reality guilty, yet (to the limit of the judge’s knowledge) he was innocent. This is a true judgment, yet because he was guilty the judgment was not true on all levels. Here it must be understood that it is not in the natural ability of man to know this, and only one who has assistance from the Divine will not fall into a judgment that is not true in its deepest form.<br>An example is the “cane of Rava.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Nedarim</i>, 25a. One had not paid another a debt, and the other asserted that he had paid it. They told him to swear on a Torah scroll, and before doing so, he said to his lender, “hold my cane,” inside of which he had hidden the amount owed. He then swore on the Torah that all the money he owed he had paid to his hand. Which, of course, only he could know was true. The lender was furious at the apparent false oath and broke the cane, the money spilling onto the floor.</i> “At that moment the matter was revealed that the debt had been settled,” and this could not be known by man’s knowledge, but only with Divine assistance. Therefore it is forbidden to bring judgments to Gentile courts, because even though they may judge true judgments, they do not have the special Divine assistance to judge on the deepest level of truth. As we find in the Gemara of <i>Rosh Hashana</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, 25a. Rabbi Yehoshua had calculated the new month, and came out on a different day than Raban Gamliel, so Raban Gamliel made him swear that he would visit him using his (Rabbi Yehoshua’s) calculation, on his Yom Kippur, with his staff and his money. Eventually Rabbi Yehoshua did so, and Raban Gamliel kissed him and called him “my student, my teacher.”</i> that even though Raban Gamliel called him “my teacher in wisdom,” because the judgment was as Rabbi Yehoshua had said, still God had agreed with Rabban Gamliel, for he was the <i>Nasi</i> (leader) from the edict of God. In saying, “my student because you have accepted my word,” he meant that in the understanding of the heart he was the one who is aligned to the depth of the knowledge of God.",

A man must make a great reckoning for every gate through which he receives goodness, and in a place where man influences others he must make an even greater reckoning. “For your tribes” means the twelve powers in man with which he can influence others. Among them there are revealed powers, and among them are hidden powers. The two arms, the two legs, and the torso are the revealed powers. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, intestines, and two kidneys are the hidden powers. The liver, which gives way to anger, must incur judgment in order to be angry only if it is God’s will. The spleen, which laughs, must incur judgment in order not to deride, and so for all of them.",

It is very difficult for one to fulfill them, for “one can only uphold the Torah if he has failed in it.” In order to understand with wisdom, the truth in justice must be clean regarding the four elements found in man. (The four statements at the beginning of this <i>Parsha</i> hint at the following four elements.) “Do not pervert justice,” this means that one must not possess any partiality. For this, one must be stripped of desire, which corresponds to the element of water, as mentioned in several places.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Elsewhere in the <i>Mei HaShiloach</i> it is written that the greatest desire one experiences is the thirst from being deprived of water.

This is so even if he judges in truth, for as for lies it is said, “Do not pervert justice.” “Justice, Justice,” this is the element of fire, which destroys the other elements and does not let them spread and become powerful. “That you may live,” by means of this you will come to the source of life, “and you shall inherit the land,” meaning by means of the constriction (following all the above) you will merit increase.",

With prayer, however, we may not defer to any outside appearance (any human trait, such as honor, power, wisdom and the like), for the altar is a place of prayer and <i>avodah</i> (Divine service). This is as the Gemara tells us, “it is forbidden for one to pray behind his Rav” (<i>Berachot</i>, 27b). It is forbidden to pray to any appearance (human trait), for example, praying for God’s salvation to the ends of being great in Torah like his Rav is forbidden. In prayer, one must understand that he is praying to God alone who is the source of salvation, that He may save him without boundary or limit, as explained on the verse “an ox or a sheep,” in <i>Parshat Emor</i>.",
                    "<i>“Do not erect a stone monument.”</i> (Devarim, 16:22)<br>This means that a man must not be stubborn with anything, even in <i>avodat Hashem</i> (Divine service). This is the meaning of (what Rashi commented) that this is so even though it was a beloved way of <i>avodah</i> in the days of the Patriarchs. The Patriarchs possessed <i>tekifut</i> (unbridled strength) to the extent that they would lay down their lives for the smallest matter. At that time, the world was not aware of God’s <i>Malchut</i> (sovereignty), and thus it was necessary. Yet now, one only lays down his life for the preservation of the three cardinal sins (idolatry, sexual offenses, and murder). This also hints that one should not be stubborn regarding his peers, so as not to tell him that he must accept his opinion even if it seems that he is right, as is explained in <i>Parshat Va’etchanan</i> on the verse, “you shall surely guard.”",

Achiya was from Shiloh, and from the tribe of Yosef. Of Yaravam it is written (Melachim 1, 11:26), <i>efrati</i> (“from Efrat,” as sign of being from Yehuda) and he was greatly adorned and warned concerning “do not commit adultery,” which was the inheritance of Yosef. We do not find this with Yehuda, for of Shlomo it is written (Melachim 1, 3:1), “And Shlomo pleaded with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he took Pharaoh’s daughter,” and of David haMelech it is written (Shmuel 1, 17:2), “son of an Efrati man.”<br>For this reason, Achiya saw that it was correct to anoint him. Then afterwards, when he sinned with the two golden calves, and Achiya prayed over this mistake, God then showed him that this love was only for Aviya the son of Yaravam, and it contained something good. (See Melachim 1, 14:13, “yet still something good was found in the house of Yaravam.”) For this, from the time that he anointed Yaravam, until the time it said “and the child died,” when the word of God went forth, it does not call Achiya by the name of prophet or the Shiloni, but simply Achiya. However, in this section (Melachim 1: 14:18), it says, “according to the word of God through Achiya the prophet.” For God had established this.

Israel, on the other hand, is completely without surface appearances. This is why it says “I will place over me a king,” where by means of him we will take on an appearance (of good).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">(And so – although we have a connection to Above that is too lofty to cause us to experience the fear necessary to keep ourselves in line, through having a King we too will be granted an earthly expression that warrants reverence and helps us to behave properly as a nation.

Yet there are times when we find that a man’s <i>yetser hara</i> overpowers him until he cannot move at all, and then it is clear that this state came from God, as we find with Yehuda. The Torah revealed this so that someone caught in this state would not become depressed.",
                    "<i>“If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son …”</i> (Devarim, 21:18)<br>Consider the order of these matters. First desire consumed the heart of the man to take a woman of the war captives for a wife, and surely it seemed to him that her actions were good, for we are not dealing with foolishness. Then afterwards he comes to hate her on sight, as her actions are not at all what he thought they were, and he hates her strongly and is disturbed, wondering where his initial desire to take her came from. So he consoles himself, saying, maybe a good son will be born from her. Then he sees that the son born to them is stubborn and rebellious, and they bring him to the court of law, and kill him. Then pain and mercy fill his heart over his executed son, for he was innocent, as it says in the Gemara (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, 72a), “He will be killed for eating over a <i>tartemar</i> (180 cc.) of meat and drinking over a half <i>log</i> (37 ml.) of wine.” He becomes increasingly disturbed from the series of events that passed over him. Therefore, the very next verse is “for he who incurred the death penalty … do not let the corpse of the hang overnight … for a hung corpse is a dishonor to God.” (<i>Devarim</i>, 21:23).<br>In this God is consoling his father’s conscience, telling him that surely there was something good in him, or else God would not be so careful as to not let him hang the body overnight. From this, it is apparent that he is not like an inanimate object, but rather, there was something good in him that required clarification. Thus, the desire of the father to take the mother was not in vain. Following after is the section dealing with returning a lost object. This shows how with God there is a fixing for everything, so that any desire and any action done among Israel would not be lost to irrecoverable exile, and everything happens with God’s involvement (<i>hashgacha</i>). That he took the mother was from the desire for the good in her, and his hate for his son was only for the evil in him, and his execution was not in vain for in this it becomes clear that he was innocent.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As Rashi notes, since we are certain that he would go on to commit more and more serious crimes, better that we kill him now while he is innocent than later when he is guilty.</i>",
                    "<i>“If you come upon a bird’s nest … you shall surely send away the mother bird, and the chicks you may take for yourself …”</i> (Devarim, 22:7)<br>“Mother” means the principles of the Torah, for one must always examine himself according to the principles of the Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As we find in the book of Mishlei, “do not abandon your mother’s doctrine. [Hagahot Peretz]</i> As it says in the Holy Zohar (<i>Shemot</i>, 200a), “there are three points to the Torah.” This means that he should clarify that none of his actions should have anything in the slightest way against God, against the community of Israel, and against the man himself (this was explained earlier in <i>Parshat Kedoshim</i> on the verse, “his mother and father a man shall fear”). A man must conduct all his affairs according to the principles, and these principles require that he shall not lay down his life for anything except the three known <i>mitzvot</i> (incest, idolatry, and murder). However, the mitzvah of sending away the mother bird (the principles) teaches of a place where a man is certain that a particular mitzvah is tied the root of his soul. In such a case, he must give his life for its preservation even if it is a “minor” mitzvah. “You shall surely send away the mother” hints at this, meaning that at this time one need not heed the above principle, yet to go ahead and lay down his life. We find examples of this in Daniel who was ready to give his life for prayer, with Mordechai who would give his life not to bow down to Haman, and with Rabbi Akiva who gave his life for <i>netilat yadaim</i> (ritual handwashing. See Eruvin 24b.)<br>Although these were not according to the principles of the Torah, each one understood that that particular mitzvah tied to him at the root of his soul. For everyone has a particular mitzvah deeply connected to him as is explained in various places, and this is the meaning of “and the chicks you may take for yourself,” meaning that in this case only to heed the understanding of your heart. This is as the sages said (<i>Chullin</i>, 139a), “‘If you happen upon the bird’s nest,’ only applies if you come upon it without premeditation, for it is forbidden to fashion for yourself this mitzvah [climbing trees, houses,] for you would be putting yourself in danger.” Only if you happen upon such a case, yet do not prepare it. As is explained in the Gemara (Mishna, <i>Brachot</i>, 33b), “[If the prayer leader says in the <i>tachanun</i> section of supplication, ‘just as you had mercy on the mother bird] by the bird’s nest so may your mercy arrive,’ [you must silence him].” (And this is the <i>Halacha</i>.) For it is in the power of God to save so that man doesn’t need even this, as is explained earlier on the verse, “An ox or sheep, do not slaughter it and its offspring on the same day” (<i>Parshat Emor</i>).",
                    "<i>“You shall surely send away the mother bird, and take the chicks for yourself.”</i> (Devarim, 22:7)<br>The Gemara says that there are two <i>mitzvot</i> where the Holy One, blessed be He, explained their reward; one is the easiest of the easy, and one is the most difficult of the difficult (<i>Chullin</i>’s explanation of sending away the mother bird). Sending away the mother bird teaches that a man may abandon all the good in this world for the honor of God. This is called “the easiest of the easy,” for every soul in Israel is ready to do this. In a place where one abandons a worldly good, in this aspect he is exceptionally clean. Respecting parents teaches of a mitzvah where there is a bodily benefit, and this is called “the most difficult of the difficult,” for in a place where one receives benefit, there it is difficult to remain clean without becoming tainted. Therefore with the sending away of the mother bird it says first, “that it may be good for you,” and afterwards, “and lengthen our days.” This is because here it seems as if he is abandoning all the good of this world, so God stresses, saying first, “that it may be good for you.” This is certain, for one will understand this, and in addition, He promises the length of days. With honoring parents it says first “that it may lengthen your days” and afterwards “and that it may be good for you.” This means that even though you benefit from this in this world, it will also be good for you in the future.",

If there is a man among you who has become impure from a nocturnal emission, and he shall go outside of the encampment, he shall not enter the encampment.”</i> (Devarim, 23:10–11)<br>This particular stumbling block comes to man from looking into words of Torah that are not his portion. Therefore it says, “and he shall go outside of the encampment,” to show that this [area of study] was not his place, for he stands in an area outside of it.",

Then, “and you shall dig therewith,” meaning that it shall be set before you and you shall be ashamed of it. In examining the formulation of this verse, compare it with (lyov, 39:29), “from there he seeks his prey” (Both “dig” and “seek” use the word <i>chafar</i>.) “And turn back and you shall cover it,” means that afterwards find a way to do the same action in a way that is permissible (see <i>Yoma</i>, 87a). “And you shall cover that which came out of you” means that the next time you do it you atone for the past. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Avoda Zara, 17a, where Dordiya came close to sinning with a prostitute, and subsequently made <i>teshuva</i> (repented).

At that time, the Romans passed an edict that anyone found wearing <i>tefillin</i> would have their brain pierced by the authorities. Elisha went out in the marketplace wearing his <i>tefillin</i>, and a commissar spotted him. They chased him, and just before he was caught, he took off his <i>tefillin</i> and put them in his hands. The commissar ordered him to open his hands, and when he did so, they contained the wings of a dove. He first went outside in his <i>tefillin</i> because he had confidence that surely no one could do him any harm, since he was fulfilling the commandment of God. Then when the commissar caught him, he also trusted that God would not let harm befall him, so he did not bring angry complaints against God’s of judgment, for God sent him confidence even then. Therefore, God answered him, and he found the wings of a dove in his hands. This means that he put himself in a position where he would be enticed by God, as it is written (Hoshea, 7:11), “a tempted dove.” The miracle he experienced made it clear that when he first went outside wearing <i>tefillin</i> it was only a result of the <i>tekifut</i> that God had sent him, and by means of it he was saved.",

This is why the verse says “and grabs him by his shame,” meaning something that he is ashamed of. Thus with the penalty, in the next verse, it is written, “then you shall cut off her hand,” meaning that by shaming his friend he will lose all his merits, for hand signifies the right hand, or one’s power (<i>Menachot</i>, 9b, and hence merits).",
                    "<i>“Remember what Amalek did to you, on the way when you were leaving Egypt.”</i> (Devarim, 25:17)<br>It is written in the Midrash (Tanchuma, <i>Ki Teitsei</i>, 7), “here it says, remember, and with Shabbat it says, remember. We can understand this with a parable. A king prepared a feast. When the tray was brought before him filled with all manner of delicacies, he said, ‘remember this one who loved me.’ Then when the plate was wiped clean, he said, ‘remember that one who hated me.’” In the future, with the eradication of the inclination to evil, then, from the side of man’s nature, lust and desire will not be able to exist in the world as it does now, when the inclination to evil entices man to sin. Therefore, when it overpowers him, then he shall make God’s will as the great victorious one.<br>This is as the holy Zohar explains the verse (Kohollet, 10:1), “more precious than wisdom or honor is a little foolishness.” So it is with the great rest a man first rests after ceasing from the hard work of servitude. Then when he becomes accustomed to it, he does not feel the taste of the rest as he did at first. Therefore it says “remember,” for he shall remember each time the difficulty of the servitude, and how our inclination to evil overpowered us. From this, new desire will come to us each time, and we will feel the greatness of the rest. This is the meaning of “when the plate was wiped clean,” for all the sins and suffering and controversies that exist among Israel come from the power of Amalek, for he is “chief of the nations.” This is as it is said (<i>Shemot</i>, 17:16), “a war of Hashem with Amalek from generation to generation.” Then when his strength is nullified, when we remember his power our desire will be renewed."

This is to show that even when the intention is for the sake of Heaven, if if it appears unpleasant on the surface he will not do it, because its inner nature must be like its outside appearance.

Even though he did not join with their intention, and his own intention was for the sake of Heaven, it says in Mishlei, (1:15) “do not go in the way with them,” meaning that even if you do not go with them, still, refrain from giving the appearance that you are going with them.

[Hagahot Peretz]</i> This jades the mind, putting him in a continual state of fear and worry. Since this is common, man’s mind is not confident and settled. This is as we find with the sons of Shmuel who erred after greed. Of this the Gemara says (<i>Shabbat</i>, 56a), “because they wanted to increase the salaries of their teachers and scribes.” Truly their intention was for the sake of Heaven, for basically their teachers and scribes were <i>Tsaddikim</i>, and they only wanted to create their livelihoods. Nonetheless it says that they erred after greed, because a man cannot guard himself from his mistakes if his intention was not God’s will. This is “my father was an Aramean about to perish.” “Father” is called thought,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is hinted at in the phrase <i>av b’chochma</i>, a father in wisdom.</i> and by means of the mitzvah of the first fruits (where he makes this declaration) a man will merit being saved from mistakes and need only to look to God in all his actions. This is why he then immediately says (in verse 26:10), “[And now I have come with the first fruits of the land] which You have given me, Hashem” meaning that he speaks with God face to face.",
                    "<i>“An Aramean sought to destroy my father …”</i> (Devarim, 26:5)<br>The reason the section of the first fruits begins in this way is similar to the following passage in the Gemara (<i>Berachot</i>, 34a). “In the order of the prayer of the eighteen benedictions, the first three blessings are like a servant who arranges his praise before his master. In the [nine] intermediate blessings he asks for his needs. In the last three he is like one who has received a reward from his master, is dismissed, and must bow before him while leaving.” The last three blessings are, so to speak, “returning the good.” For example, one asked God to grant him wealth. If God helped him and he profited, he must deliver everything back to God by asking God to teach him what to do with every penny, that it should not be dispensed, God forbid, in a place that is against God’s will.<br>This is the explanation of “like one who receives a reward … he must bow.” This also has to do with the first-fruit offering. When you come into the land and you receive all the good, you must return it to God, that is, to the <i>Beit HaMikdash</i>, the Holy Temple, by giving the choice produce to the <i>Cohen</i>. In doing this you know that all is still in the hands of the Creator. Yaakov had established this whole practice, for Avraham Avinu served God in the attribute of “with all your heart,” Yitzchak Avinu with “all your soul,” and Yaakov with the attribute of “all your abundance.” This means that after receiving all the good, to return it to Him, as Yaakov said, “all that you give me I will surely tithe it to You.”",
                    "<i>“Look down from Your holy dwelling, from heaven .…”</i> (Devarim, 26:15)<br>“Look down” uses the special term <i>hashkifa</i>, meaning to look into everyone and not just in general. Every time that God looks at man individually, then great fear wells up in the heart of man, for before God who may say, “my heart has been purified?” Only when God looks at mankind in general is man’s heart at ease, as it says (Kings 2, 4:13), “I sit among my people.” When God inspects man in general, then one evaluates his fellow man for the good, for each soul is clean in one aspect, as is known. Yet here, even though God looks at each man individually, it is also good. This is because when man brings <i>trumot</i> and <i>maasrot</i> (tithes), he is coming to God with strength, as it is said in the Midrash (Tanchuma <i>Tisa</i> 14), “there is no coming to God with strength like when one brings tithes.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Truly, the Holy One, blessed be He, is filled with good will to diffuse goodness to Israel and “will not see any iniquity in Jacob” (Numbers 23:21). Therefore when accusations come from the stranger, orphan, and widow, they arouse transgression. Yet when Israel separates tithes and gives them to the strangers and orphans and widows, and the accusations cease, then man can say before God to look at him individually, for then God only looks at the good. On this it says of future good (Yesahya 11:13), “Efriam will not be jealous of Yehuda and Yehuda will not distress Efriam,” and by itself only good will be aroused concerning them. This is why the heavens are called here <i>maon</i>, or dwelling, as it says in the Gemara (<i>Chagigah</i> 12b), “a dwelling [<i>maon</i>] where legions of ministering angels who sing at night and are silent in the day, in honor of Israel.” From here begins the revelation of God’s good for Israel that, as it were, contracts the supernal glory from the song of the angels, in order to make room to include the songs of Israel, and from here is diffused only good. <i>Giliyon Mei HaShiloach</i>, by the Isbitser’s grandson, Gershon Henoch Lainer of Radzin.</i>",
                    "<i>“You have praised Hashem this day to be your God … God has praised you today .…”</i> (Devarim, 26:17)<br>(First it must be noted that Rashi tells us that the word translated here as “praised,” <i>he’emarta</i>, appears nowhere else in the Torah for its meaning to be made clear. He first says it means “separated,” that we have separated God to be ours from all the strange gods. Then he shows its use in <i>Tehilim</i> 94:4, “all the workers of iniquity praise [<i>yit’amru</i>] themselves,” which is closer to the holy Isbitser’s rendering of its meaning as “exaltation.”) “Praised,” in Hebrew <i>he’emarta</i>, is a term denoting exaltation, that a man exalts and prides himself in God, “who is like Hashem our God?” “God has praised you today” means that God takes pride in Israel, as in “Israel in you I will adorn myself” (Yesahya, 49:3). <i>He’emarta</i> is also connected to boasting, as in “all the workers of iniquity praise [<i>yit’amru</i>] themselves,” meaning that they boast and say that they are acting with wisdom by sinning, and in opposition to them Israel prides themselves to be God for you” (<i>Devarim</i>, 26:17). This means that Israel is drawn after the knowledge of God just as He will conduct them and negate their knowledge against His. Corresponding to this God prides Himself, as it were, in Israel, as it is written, “to be His most beloved treasure,” (<i>Devarim</i>, 7:6), as He has said to you.",

Thus when they arrived at the depth of the words, then he said, “He sends His word and it melts them, He blows His wind.” Thus it was in God’s will to improve Israel, as we have matters in Torah that one may uphold only if he first fails in them (<i>Gittin</i>, 43a). Therefore the Torah was written among the nations in order that they would see and understand that the way of the Torah is good. Nonetheless they could not overpower their inclination to evil, and from them Israel would learn that they need not fail. There they would see how the wicked are paid back, and on this he said, “He sends His word and it melts them,” meaning that when God sends Words of Torah to the nations it causes them to melt and become lost. “He blows His wind,” means that the water of life will flow to Israel.",

This explains the verse, “Only with your eyes shall you gaze and see the recompense of the wicked” (<i>Tehilim</i> 91:8).

The Holy Isbitser will interpret this in a different realm from these commentators.</i> This is as it was with Yiftach, of whom our sages said (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, 25b), “Yiftach was in his generation as Shmuel was in his.” This means that Yiftach has completed all that God asked from him in this world as Shmuel had done in his generation. This perplexed King Shlomo, and he said (Mishlei, 30:18), “three things are beyond me, and four I did not know … the way of man with woman.” This means the choicest elements in Israel, like the one who completes God’s will, and in this way, “with the young woman [<i>b’almah</i>],” meaning it is so also with the meekest of Israel. This is the explanation of “You are standing.” That is to say, you are connected to God. “Your leaders,” meaning those at the greatest level; “your water carriers,” to the lowest level; “all of you” are bound up with God. “Your wood choppers” means those with the least fear of Heaven, and “your water carriers” are those with the least love of God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Simply put, all, from the highest to the lowest, are deeply connected to God, and it seems that “the way of man with woman” is being taken out of the context of physical union, to say that it is a wonder to King Shlomo how all elements in Israel at their core experience an intense spiritual union with God.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Wood choppers” cut to pieces and thereby utilize the attribute of gevurah [power] to have the strength to chop to bits, and this brings <i>yirah</i> (awe and reverence) to the Soul. “Water carriers”: water always naturally flows and represents pleasure, which draws one after itself, associated with the attribute of <i>chesed</i> (kindness) (Tanya).

Then accordingly, when any mistake happens even to the youngest children, it affects even the heads, for the <i>taf</i> possessed a little consciousness from the head. “Your tribes,” meaning expansion, for all of Israel were hidden in the root of Yaakov Avinu, and there they were as one soul. Thus when they were divided into tribes certain souls in different generations experienced expansion. This is in juxtaposition to the women, because all expansion comes from birth, for when the child is hidden and included in the soul of the father then there is no expansion; only when the child is born does it begin to expand. “Your elders” means the one who has acquired wisdom.<br>“Your elders,” is juxtaposed to “your convert,” for according to the original insights into the Torah made among Israel, so will converts come to and increase among Israel.

Rashi’s intention in this is in order to explain that the covenant is dealing with the realm of thought, as it says later (verse 28), “the secret things [meaning thoughts] belong unto Hashem our God.” (Where Rashi seems to say that God may punish an individual for his thoughts.) But in truth, God does not punish one for his thoughts. Nonetheless, even though God ony punishes for actions, still, one is not considered close to God if his thoughts are not cleaving to God. Therefore Rashi explains “that you should enter,” meaning that just as He gives you the ability to choose for yourself, free of any warning of punishment, so may you (choose to be) a servant of God even in your thoughts.",
                    "<i>“The secret things belong unto Hashem our God, and the revealed things are for us and our children, forever, to do all the words of this Torah.”</i> (Devarim, 29:28)<br>It is written in the Gemara (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, 44a),<br>The Tannaim (Talmudic Masters) argue the following point. The secret matters belong unto God, but revealed matters belong to our children and us forever. Why are the words <i>Lanu u-lebanenu</i> [unto us and to our children] and the ‘<i>ayin</i> of the word <i>‘ad</i>, [forever] dotted? In order to teach that God did not punish secret transgressions until the Israelites had crossed the Jordan. this is the view of Rav Yehuda. Said Rav Nehemia to him, “Did God ever punish all of Israel for crimes committed in secret? Does not the Torah say forever? But just as God did not punish Israel for secret transgressions [at any time], so too did He not punish them as a whole for revealed transgressions until they had crossed the Jordan.” So why where they punished in the case of Achan? It is because his wife and children knew thereof [so the transgression was no longer secret], therefore all of Israel was punished.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Chapters 6 and 7 of the book of Yehoshua, it relates how the spoils of the battle of Jericho were banned, saying, “cursed be the man who rises up and builds of this city.”Achan had taken some of the spoils, and God related to Yehoshua that because of this 30,000 of his men were killed in the battle of Ai that followed.</i><br>One could say that the answer of the Gemara, “because his wife and children knew thereof [so the transgression was no longer secret],” is not enough, for from this it would seem that not all of Israel, but only the ones who knew of the transgression should have been punished. We can explain this in the following way. When a man transgresses in secret, unknown to anyone else, then his sin is not pertinent to the whole community of Israel, but it is rather of the secret things that belong to Hashem our God (and He decides how to deal with that individual). God is called, <i>Rav Chesed</i>, the Great One of Kindness, and He is called the one who tilts the unworthy to the side of mercy. He clarifies the action for the good, but we only find this attribute in God. However, if there is another person who witnessed or knows of his fellow’s sin, then the sin becomes pertinent to the whole community of Israel. This is because the very act of witnessing another’s sin is testimony that the very deficiency also exists within him, or within another member of Israel, (even if with him it never materialized in action). For this reason, God made him witness the sin. Certainly the one who saw his fellow man’s evil action felt a stir of <i>teshuva</i> (repentance) in his own heart. Therefore, this affair pertains to the entire community of Israel, for “all of Israel are responsible for one another.” In this fashion does it say in the passage about the one who cursed in <i>Parshat Emor</i> (<i>Vayikra</i>, 24:14), “and they shall lay their hands upon the head [of the one who cursed].” They placed their hands on his head exactly as they did with an animal brought for sacrifice in the Temple. All of Israel needed atonement because they had heard the curse, and in him, they achieved atonement.",
                    "<i>“And it shall be, when all of these things come upon you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you, and you shall take them to your heart among the nations, to where Hashem has driven you. And you shall return unto Hashem your God, and heed His voice … And if your exiles shall be in the outermost regions of the cosmos, from there Hashem your God will gather you, and from there He will take you … And Hashem your God will circumcise your heart … to love Hashem your God … And Hashem your God will put all these curses upon your enemies and on those who hate you … And you shall return and listen to the voice of Hashem, and do all His mitzvot, which I command you this day.”</i> (Devarim, 30:1–8)<br>The way the Torah says “the blessing and the curse” has a special meaning. Within the curse, the blessing also exists in secret. “You shall take them to your heart,” means that you shall take to your heart that the blessing also exists within the curse. “And you shall return unto Hashem your God, and heed His voice” means the inner voice that exists in everything. This is as it is written in the Holy Zohar (<i>Bereshit</i>, 50b), “and Hashem your God shall return your captives and be merciful with you.” This means mercy in the purity and wholeness of heart that God will give you in words of Torah and the study of Torah with desire and wholeness of heart. “And if your exiles shall be in the outermost regions of the cosmos” means a place your whole understanding tells you is far from your ability to fix, “From there Hashem your God will gather you, and from there He will take you,” meaning that even there will God fix you.<br>“And Hashem your God will circumcise your heart… to love Hashem your God,” means that he will take the desire you have for matters that are not good in the eyes of God, and fix it at the time when you return in complete <i>teshuva</i> (repentance) in the love of God and the desire for words of Torah. “And Hashem your God will put all these curses upon your enemies and on those who hate you” means he will take the evil lusts that exist in you and place them upon your enemies and those who hate you. “And you shall return and listen to the voice of Hashem, and do all His mitzvot” means that God will clarify all the lusts within you, and give this desire back to you to use in the fulfillment of His <i>mitzvot</i> and statutes.",
                    "<i>“It is not in heaven, that you should say, who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it to us, that we may hear it, and do it? Nor is it beyond the sea, that you should say, who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it to us, and make us hear it, and do it? But the word is very near unto you, in your mouth, and in your heart, that you may do it.”</i> (Devarim, 30:12–14)<br>The Holy Zohar (in <i>Bamidbar</i> 176 and other places,) tells us, “How precious are the words of Torah! This seems as if it is beyond the sea, and then it says some more supernal words of Torah, and it seems as if it is in the highest heavens.” This can be understood through what is written in the Tanna Dvei Eliyahu (Zuta, Ch. 12), “A parable. A mortal king builds a wall by way of which one enters vast palaces. In the wall, he opens a narrow passageway, so narrow that one who does not love the king will not exert himself to enter. Yet one who truly loves him will push himself for he knows that after difficulty, great delights await him.” So too here, where initially he not yet understood words of Torah, how high and precious they are. Then when one comes to the meaning of words of Torah, then “it is not in heaven, and not across the sea … but it is near unto you, in your mouth,” etc. Therefore, Moshe Rabeynu specifically wrote these words in this <i>Parsha</i>, which follows the fiftieth <i>Parsha</i> in the Torah, for then he had attained this level (the fiftieth gate of understanding), that of “it is not in heaven, but near.”<br>This means that even though a man needs fences and boundaries while he does not yet understand words of Torah, once he understands them, he does not need this. “It is not across the sea,” that is to say, he does not need to be far from the delights of this world, which we call, “a sea,” for “sea” teaches of desire. Only at the beginning, for he can only initially enter into words of Torah through great restraint and separation from earthly delights, but this is not the main principle. The main principle is in the doing (the performance of God’s will). This is “in your mouth and in your heart to <i>do</i> it. This is the principle, as it is said in the Tikkunei Zohar (on what Isaac said to Yaakov), “‘make me tasty delights that I love’ [<i>Bereshit</i>, 27:4], these are positive mitzvot [that are done].” This is as it says in the Gemara (<i>Ta’anit</i>, 10a), “better a flooded land than a dry land.” It is good have even a little desire instilled in him and not to be completely dry, as we have explained on the verse (Mishlei, 19) “the desire of man is his kindness;” see there."

                    "<i>“And Moshe went and spoke these words ….”</i> (Devarim, 31:1)<br>The verse says specifically “and Moshe went” and “going,” <i>halicha</i>, signifies being disturbed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Perhaps because when one is disturbed by something he may be inclined to move his place.</i> It was difficult for him to understand how man could fix the deficiency imprinted on the root of his soul from the day of his birth passed on from his mother and father, for his mother conceived him in sin.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This phrase is borrowed from <i>Tehilim</i> 51:7. The idea needs investigation. Was he not conceived in the mitzvah of <i>pru u’vru</i>, [be fruitful and multiply]? Yet this is something that is very easily contaminated because of its great holiness. So this statement, especially when someone on the level of David haMelech says it about himself, is quite revealing of the human predicament. It seems here that along with the fixings needed for physical union, he is also talking about everything inherited from our parents that needs fixing.</i> However, when the commandment to gather the people was said to him (<i>Devarim</i>, 31:12, “Gather the people, the parents, the children … that they may learn, and fear God”), it was intimated to Moshe that man may fix the sin he is born with, which comes from his root and the root of his parents. Then joy filled his being, as it is written (Yirmiya, 4:1), “If Israel will return … return unto Me.” When a man commits a transgression, God forbid, then in his mind he is ashamed before his friend. Even though his friend does not know about it, he is anyhow uncomfortable because he feels that his friend is better than he is. This is not <i>teshuva shleimah</i>, complete return to the Torah. This is why the prophet said, “you shall return to Me,” meaning that one should rather be ashamed before God so as not to do something that God did not command.<br>God commanded 613 mitzvot, and each one is advice to Israel as to how one may remove the evil desires rooted in his heart, rooted there due to the impurity of mortal existence. This is as it says in the Gemara (<i>Kiddushin</i>, 40b), “[Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Tsaddok said: What is a <i>Tsaddik</i> compared to in this world? A tree that exists in a place that is wholly pure,] yet part of it turns to a place of impurity.”<br>So therefore, God gave man advice as to how he may remove himself from desires, such as the mitzvah of <i>tsitsit</i>, which reminds man to have the fear of God, and <i>tefillin</i>, which teaches of the <i>tekifut</i> (unbridled strength) of <i>Kedusha</i>, a notion previously explained (see above, Devarim, 17:13). Yet, in response to the evil attributes that are imprinted in man from the day of his birth derived from the root of his father and mother, as the prophet said (Yesahya, 48:8), “For I knew that you would surely act treacherously, and you were called a sinner from the womb,” we received the section of “gather your people” (<i>Devarim</i>, 31:12). This is as it says in the Gemara (<i>Chagiga</i>, 3a), “Why did the infants also come? To reward those who brought them.”<br>This means, by means of the longing of the father and mother to bring words of Torah into the ears of the infant—even though he does not understand anything at all. An example of this is found in the Talmud Yerushalmi (<i>Yevamot</i>, 1:6), “See who teaches knowledge. Rabbi Yehoshua’s mother would bring him in his cradle into the house of study so that his ears would absorb Words of Torah.” This shows how it is possible to fix even the attributes imprinted in man from his mother’s womb. This longing on the part of the parents is called “serving the Torah is greater than studying it,” for by means of this he may heal what came before. This is “[to reward] those who brought them,” meaning that even the father and mother are also fixed by this, since it fixes what came before, namely the desire of the father and mother at the moment of conception, and then it follows that he was clean regarding his mother. When Moshe Rabeynu understood this, he was filled with <i>simcha</i> (joy).",

All the while one is not complete he may still apprehend more and reach greater heights. Yet he may also, God forbid, lose that which he has already received. After one has reached the state of completion, he will not lose anything he has previously apprehended, nor will he apprehend anything further. This is what Moshe Rabeynu meant when he said “I can no longer go out or come in.” “Going out” means that he was complete and God signed His name on his actions so that it would be impossible to lose what he had apprehended. “Coming in” means that also he would apprehend nothing further.",

Succot, following Rosh Hashanah, is already in the eighth year. Yet all produce where you did not bring a third thereof in the seventh year, you treat it also in the eighth year as you would have in the seventh.” This is according to the verse (<i>Tehilim</i>, 115:16), “The heavens are the heavens of God, and the earth was given to man.” This is just the way it seems. Yet King David said (<i>Tehilim</i>, 135:6), “all that God desired, He did, in the heavens and the earth.” It is well-known that all the actions of man, even though the power of choice was given to man, are something as insignificant as a peel of garlic. This is why we say on the first day of the week (Sunday) (while reciting the daily Levitical songs in the morning service), “the earth is God’s and the fullness thereof.” The point of Shabbat is to know that man has no real power, for the thirty-nine forms of work created in the world with which man may do all he wants are all prohibited on Shabbat. Yet when the weekdays start, and work is again permitted, God forbid that man may say, “my strength and the power of my hands have gotten me this wealth” (<i>Devarim</i>, 8:17). Therefore our sages established that we say immediately after Shabbat, “the earth is God’s and the fullness thereof.”<br>It is similarly so with the seventh <i>Shmitta</i> year that the Torah commanded, which makes it known to us that the earth is God’s and all its fullness. Then when the eighth year comes, plowing and sowing are again permitted in order that we can reap from the land without say, God forbid, “my strength and the power of my hands have gained me this wealth.” This is why with produce that a third was not brought as a tithe in the seventh year, “you treat it also in the eighth year as you would have in the seventh,” in order to remember that “the earth is God’s and the fullness thereof.”"

Yesahya is the heart of all of Israel, and the matter of the heart is that it constantly cries out for salvation, and can only accept things that are comforting. This is the matter of the name of Isaiah, Yeshayahu in Hebrew, meaning salvation. And this is “Give ear, O heavens,” meaning the great powers, which are called heavens, which is the brain, which has the power to accept everything. “And I will speak,” the term “speak,” <i>dibbur</i> in Hebrew, always denotes difficulty (and is therefore used here with “heavens”). “And may the earth hear the sayings of my mouth,” for “saying,” <i>amirah</i> in Hebrew, always denotes softness. In other words, you will call to the heart, which is called the earth, which is always thirsty for salvation, in the language of softness and comfort. The verses continue, “My doctrine shall drip as the rain” (“dripping,” <i>arof</i> in Hebrew, sounds just like the word for neck), meaning that for one who resists coming close to it, the Torah will strongly clutch the back of his neck, so to speak, and against his will he will have to accept the yoke of the Torah. Immediately upon accepting it, “my saying will flow like the dew,” meaning that Words of Torah will then be with him in comfort and joy.",

No one’s deficiency is similar to any others; therefore in that particular aspect where each one knows that he is deficient, the corresponding aspect in Torah must be reinforced in that very place until it is eventually completed. This is “the heavy rains upon the grass,” “heavy” meaning in great measure, or to increase the measure of Torah specifically in the place that is lacking.",
                    "<i>“When I call in the name of God, ascribe greatness to Hashem.”</i> (Devarim, 32:3)<br>Moshe Rabeynu said, “why am I silencing all the powers of the upper worlds, called heavens, and all the powers that exist in the earth? In other words, I am doing this because I am calling and crying out to bring the words of Torah into the heart of each one in Israel, called the name of God. “Ascribe greatness unto Hashem” means to a place of expansion, that they should all be moving towards this and none should be preventing it. Even all the “external” forces, Nebuchadnezzar and his entourage, all the powers of this world, all of which are called fine dust almost not seen to the eye<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of which Nebuchadnezzar said, “all the inhabitants of the earth are as nothing” [Daniel, 4:32]; see Gemara <i>Yoma</i>, 20b.</i> and were greatly harrowing the heart of man, all have been nullified in order that Words of Torah may enter into the heart of Israel. So now he began to speak Words of Torah to Israel since everything was silenced.",
                    "<i>“The Rock, whose actions are perfect, for all His ways are justice, God of truth and without iniquity, He is just and right. Is corruption His? No, the blemish is His children’s, a crooked and perverse generation.”</i> (Devarim, 32:4)<br>In this you are to know and understand that every action that you do is from Him, may He be blessed, and without Him, a man will not raise an arm or leg to do anything. So there is no need to boast of your achievements. “Is corruption His? No!” This means that lest you say that since everything is in the hand of heaven, then therefore any faults on my part are also really from heaven, God forbid. Do not say this, rather all the good that you do ascribe to God, and all the faults ascribe to yourselves. “The blemish is His children’s,” this means that in the same place where they are His children, when they are very good, there we also found their imperfections. For whoever is greater than his peer, his inclination to evil is also greater (<i>Sotah</i>, 52a). “A stubborn and crooked generation,” “stubborn” meaning one who is obstinate with God and refuses to do His will because he is constantly drawn after his own personal quest for pleasure. “Crooked”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>petaltol</i> in Hebrew is not really “crooked,” but as Rashi points out, an intensive form of <i>petil</i>, or wick, like a string wrapped many times around a wick to make it thick, “twisted.”</i> means the opposite. “Crooked” is one who goes to great lengths mortifying his flesh and dedicating himself to God in places that are totally unnecessary, excessively restraining himself, and this is also a transgression, for “he who is cruel troubles his own flesh” (Mishlei, 11:17).",

The father-in-law, however, seeks a husband for his daughter who is exceptional in his behavior and filled with good qualities. This is as it says, “is He not your father,” for God is merciful with us like a father with his son even if the son does not act in a good way. “The One who has acquired you,” that God takes pride in that you are exceptional and praiseworthy in your attributes, as a father-in-law does with a good son-in-law.",

Ask your father, and he will tell you, your elders, and they will say unto you.”</i> (Devarim, 32:7)<br>“Consider the days of old” means all that is in <i>Parshat Bereshit</i> until “and the heavens and the earth were complete” (i.e., the first chapter the book of <i>Bereshit</i>.) “Fathom the years of many generations,” means the two <i>Parshiot</i> of <i>Bereshit</i> and <i>Noach</i> (Chapters 2 through 11 in the book of <i>Bereshit</i>), which includes the ten generations from Adam to Noach, and the ten generations from Noach to Avraham. What is to be fathomed, or understood, is the way in which God would deal with these twenty generations. “Ask your father, and he will tell you” means to study the <i>Parshiot</i> that deal with Avraham Avinu, which are <i>Lech Lecha, Vayeira</i>, and <i>Chayei Sarah</i> (chapters 12 through 25:19 in the book of <i>Bereshit</i>). “Your elders, and they will say unto you” means the <i>Parshiot</i> that include Yitzchak and Yaakov, which is the rest of the book of <i>Bereshit</i>, and to understand all the great dealings and spiritual exchange God had with the Patriarchs.<br>Therefore when it hints of Avraham it says “<i>vayagedcha</i>” (“and he will tell you,” in a single word) rather than “<i>vayaged lecha</i>” (the same but spelled in two words). This is because Avraham Avinu caused such a tremendous tumult in the world, to such an extent that he made it possible for each and every one of Israel to be able to tell individually of the greatness of God. This is represented by “<i>vayagedcha</i>—and he will tell you,” all in one single construction (meaning, for all), as opposed to “<i>vayaged lecha</i>,” in two words (where the word “two you” is singled out, as if it is possible for a select few). This represents how, by himself, each and every one could tell of the wonders of God.",

The nations then take this refuse, and derive their existence from it. This is as it is written (in the next verse), “for God’s portion is His people, Yaakov is the cord of His inheritence.” The main point is Israel."

Yaakov Avinu was completed at the time that he descended to Egypt, and the seventeen years he spent there were <i>me’eyn olam haba</i>, likened to the world to come.

(<i>Sanhedrin</i>)</i> “And rose up from Seir unto them,” “<i>Seir</i>” hints at anger (as it sounds like the word for storm, <i>se’ara</i>). There is some good within this, like the heated anger of the scholars (see <i>Ta’anit</i> 4a, “if a young scholar gets into a rage it is because the Torah inflames him, as it says [Yirmiya, 23:29], ‘is not My word like fire, says Hashem’”). Therefore it only uses the word “shined,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Shined” or <i>zarach</i>, like the first rays of the sun to be seen over the horizon, and not a more intensive term.</i> because there is only a small measure of good that can be derived from anger. “He appeared from Mount Paran,” this corresponds to lust, which corresponds to Yishmael.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">(“Ten measures of lust descended to the world, and nine were taken by Yishmael” (Kidushin).

This means that they shall all receive together as one. This is as it is written (<i>Shemot</i>, 19:2), “and Israel camped before the mountain,” and the Midrash explains, “as one man and of one heart.” Also, <i>Yissa</i> is a term denoting “raised.” This is because Israel is raised up to (the level of the) Torah.

Both are contained in the blessing over the Torah which we pronounce each day, first, “who gave [<i>natan</i>] us His Torah,” and the second, “[blessed is God] who gives the Torah.” That which the Patriarchs rooted in the heart of all Israel cannot be weakened or removed, and the <i>Kedusha</i> that no sin can blemish, is called <i>natan</i>—“given.” However, the portion that God allotted to each soul in Israel, with which he may innovate original ideals in Torah, may be blemished by man, God forbid. Of this our sages explained (<i>Berachot</i>, 57a), “If one dreams he has intercourse with a betrothed maiden, he may expect to obtain knowledge of Torah, since it says, Moshe commanded us a law [Torah], an inheritance for the community of Yaakov.

                    "<i>“And there was a king in Yeshurun ….”</i> (Devarim, 33:5)<br>A state needs a king in order that its inhabitants do not transgress the decrees and statutes of the state. However, were all the inhabitants of the state to act in the ways of truth and honesty, then there would be no advantage to this position and they would no longer need a king. This only applies to an earthly king, yet with a king such as God there is still an advantage in His position even if all act with truth and righteousness. In this sense have the members of the great assembly enacted that we say (in the prayers of the High Holidays), “and You, Hashem our God, shall soon reign over all Your works… for You shall remove the governance of iniquity from the land.” In other words, in this way shall His throne be magnified, for the kingdom of God is not like an earthly kingdom.

See Eyts Chaiim, Heichal Adam Kadmon, Gate 1, Branch 2.</i> where “<i>Iggulim</i>” hints that each soul in Israel stands directed before God, and no one has an elevated status over another. This is as it is explained in the Gemara (<i>Ta’anit</i>, 31a), “In the future God will make a circle dance of the <i>Tsaddikim</i>.”<br>“A circle dance,” for in a circle each one is equally close. “<i>Yosher</i>” means that there are levels and different exaltation of one over another, where one may be closer than the other. In the future, these two realms of <i>Iggulim</i> and <i>Yosher</i> will be together as one, for the <i>Kedusha</i> (sanctity) that we inherit from the Patriarchs is called “<i>Iggul</i>,” and the <i>Kedusha</i> that one earns by distinguishing himself by means of his actions will gain him exaltation. Then he too will be recognized as the one whom God loves, and even within the equilibrium of a circle it will be apparent that he is closer than the rest.

                    "<i>“Reuven shall live and not die; and let his men be numbered.”</i> (Devarim, 33:6)<br>With this blessing Moshe Rabeynu healed the blessing that Yaakov had withheld from him before his death. Corresponding to what Yaakov said (<i>Bereshit</i>, 49:3), “the excellency [or ‘excess’] of strength,” meaning that he had taken the <i>tekufut</i> (unbridled strength) and <i>simcha</i> (joy) of the heart away from him, Moshe Rabeynu blessed him by saying, “Reuven shall live,” meaning that he should have vivacity, joy, and <i>tekifut</i> in his heart. Corresponding to “the excellency [or ‘excess’] of dignity,” Moshe blessed him by saying, “let his men be numbered.” This is because increase comes from exaltation, for if there was no exaltation of one over another, and each one were similar to his fellow in his understanding, there would be no possibility of increase for they would be equal. Thus it says (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, 89a), “no two prophets prophesize in the same way.” Yet since one’s life is not the same as another’s life, from this power, we find states of increase. Therefore one is exalted over another, and therefore he blessed him by saying, “let his men be numbered,” which teaches of a healing for what Yaakov said, “the excellency [or ‘excess’] of dignity.”",
                    "<i>“Reuven shall live and not die; and let his men be numbered.”</i> (Devarim, 33:6)<br>The blessing of Moshe Rabeynu corresponded to (or even was in response to) the blessings of Yaakov Avinu. Yaakov had said to Reuven (<i>Bereshit</i>, 49:3), “the excellency [or, as Rashi says, excess, meaning more than your brothers] of dignity, the excellency of power. Unstable as water, you shall not excel.” The Midrash (<i>Bereshit</i> Rabba, 99:6) comments, “like water that is spilled from a cup, and nothing remains.” Concerning this, Moshe Rabeynu blessed him by saying, “let Reuven live,” corresponding to “the excellency of strength,” for by saying to him, “live,” meant that he would constantly draw life-force from the source of the waters of life. “And let his men numbered” was said in response to “excellency in dignity,” meaning that each one would himself be an essential member of the community.",
                    "<i>“… Hear, O God, the voice of Yehuda ….”</i> (Devarim, 33:7)<br>A blessing for Shimon is hinted in this statement.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is because the name Shimon means “one who hears.” Shimon did not receive a separate blessing from Moshe, and Rashi notes that Moshe was still angry with him for mass fornication with the Moabite women in Shittim [<i>Bamidbar</i>, 25:1].</i> The twelve tribes represent all of the limbs of the <i>Shechina</i>, the Divine presence, as mentioned in the Zohar (<i>Bereshit</i>, 241a). Reuven (meaning, “you shall <i>see</i> a son”) is the eyes of the <i>Shechina</i>, for he always has a clear view of God. Shimon (meaning “one who <i>hears</i>”) is the ears of the <i>Shechina</i>, and Yehuda is the heart of the <i>Shechina</i>, for he has a clean and refined heart. This is the meaning of the verse, “Hear, O God, the voice of Yehuda,” that the tribe of Shimon should hear the voice of Yehuda. This is because the tribe of Shimon must constantly undergo refinement, as is explained in <i>Parshat Toldot</i> on the verse, “and Yitzchak loved Eisav.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Where it says: Shimon, however, (as opposed to Levi) entered himself into uncertainty, saying, “God forbid I would consider myself licentious,” and marrying Dinah. Thus he entered himself into a situation that needed <i>birrur</i> (clarification), saying he trusts that God will make it clear that it was good, that his intention was not only to take her out from Shchem and all his intentions were for the sake of Heaven. Therefore the tribe of Shimon needed all these kinds of <i>birrurim</i>, such as Zimri who also said that his intention was good, as explained in its place (<i>Parshat Balak</i>). And in the future, when the tribe of Shimon will be clarified, its level will be greater than Levi.</i>",
                    "<i>“… and bring him [Yehuda] unto his people ….”</i> (Devarim, 33:7)<br>“Bring him unto his people,” in order that he may find favor in the eyes of his people, for Yehuda is constantly in a state of dispute with Efriam, as is explained in <i>Parshat Vayeishev</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is as it is said (Yesahya, 11:13), “Efriam shall not be jealous of Yehuda, and Yehuda shall not distress Efriam.” These two tribes were always opposing each other, for the force of life that God gave to Efriam (from Yosef) was of the nature that it always looked to every action regarding its judgment and law, without moving from it. Therefore, when the writings warn Israel against sinning, then the aim of the Torah will be to say (Amos, 5:6), “lest the house of Yosef should prevail like fire,” meaning that they should concern themselves that there should be no opponents to their actions. The root of life for Yehuda, however, is to look to God regarding the course of every action. Even though he sees where the judgment leans, still he looks to God in order to see the depth of the truth of the matter. It could be that even though the judgment is true according to the claims of the plaintiffs, yet still it is not at the deepest level of truth, for fear that one would make a false claim.<br>This is as we find (<i>Nedarim</i>, 25a) in the case of Rava’s cane. (One had not paid another a debt, and the other asserted that he had paid it. They told him to swear on a Torah scroll, and before doing so, he said to his lender, “hold my cane,” inside of which he had hidden the amount owed. He then swore on the Torah that all the money he owed he had paid to his hand. Which, of course, only he could know was true. The lender was furious at the apparent false oath and broke the cane, the money spilling onto the floor.) So it is with all matters, and this is the root of life for Yehuda, to look to God in everything and not to act simply in a way that is accepted or habitual. Even though yesterday he acted in such a way, yet anyhow, today he does not want to rely on his former response, only that God should illuminate His will into him anew. This matter sometimes necessitates even doing something against the law, for “it is a time to do for God, the Torah has been suspended” (<i>Tehilim</i>, 119:126). In this way these two tribes oppose each other. Of the future it is said that, “Efriam will not be jealous of Yehuda, and Yehuda will not distress Efriam.” Then Efriam will not accuse Yehuda for the times when he goes outside of the law. He will not trouble him over this, because God will show Efriam the intentions of Yehuda, that his intentions are for the sake of Heaven and not for his own benefit. Then, of itself, there will be peace between them.</i>",
                    "<i>“… let his hands be sufficient for him, and may You be a help for him against his adversaries.”</i> (Devarim, 33:7)<br>“Let his hands be sufficient for him,” that on his own he should find enough power in his own hands to win the war against his adversaries. “May You be a help for him against his adversaries,” that even in a place where he would not have the power to effect something, that there too he shall receive the salvations of God. This is as our sages said (<i>Chullin</i>, 46a), “[regarding what must be intact in an animal’s liver for it to be kosher] there must be one olive’s size in the region of the gall-bladder and an olive’s size in the most vital place.” The liver is the source of anger that would cause one to take revenge. This is “an olive’s size in the most vital place,” in other words, “let his hands be sufficient for him.” “And an olive’s size in the gall-bladder” is a place where there is absolutely no ablility to act from his own side, and this is “may You be a help for him against his adversaries.” Therefore, the event just preceding this passage from the Gemara reads, “An army once was stationed at Pumbedita. Rabba and Rav Yosef fled the town and were met on the way by Rav Zeira, who said to them, ‘Fugitives! Remember the olive’s bulk of which the Rabbis spoke must be found in the region of the gall-bladder.’” They should have remembered that God will give His salvations only from His side, even if they did not have the power in to act on their own.

There is sowing, and there is reaping. “Sowing” is when one first accepts upon himself the yoke of the sovereignty of heaven. At that time he must constrict himself against running after the object of his lust. This is as it is said (in the third section of the <i>Shema</i>, concerning <i>tsitsit, Bamidbar</i>, 15:36), “so you will not seek out after your eyes and after your hearts.” On this it is said in the <i>Tehilim</i> (126:5), “those who sow in tears [will reap in joy].” “Tears” signifies constriction. This is understood in the laws of <i>truma</i> (tithes). The Gemara comments on the verse (<i>Shemot</i>, 22:28), “do not delay in giving the produce of your winepresses (<i>Dima’acha</i> the same as the word for tears, which Rashi says refers to required tithes).” There it says that even one grain of wheat that must be tithed is mixed into a measure of wheat that is exempt, then the whole measure must be tithed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence the word for tear, <i>Dima’a</i>, signifies constriction and limitation.</i><br>This all concerns the time of sowing. However, in the time of reaping, when man’s heart is sufficiently refined, and he only desires that which is God’s will, then he is permitted to extend as befits his will. On this it says, “let your eyes be on the field where they reap,” meaning that in the time of reaping it is permitted to seek out after your eyes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or, where your desires lead you.</i> “Field” signifies expansion into one’s desires. This is why Eisav was described as (<i>Bereshit</i>, 25:27) “a man of the field,” for he went after his heart with all of his desires. However, before one has purified his heart, it is forbidden to expand outward.

Yet truly, the realm of thought is in the hands of God. Therefore Rav Chasa said, “because you came to take shelter under His wings,” namely, that of your own initiative you came to take refuge with God and to ascribe all your actions to God.

This is the meaning of the name of Rav Chasa, for there is a principle that the sages of the Talmud are called in the name of their teaching. <i>Chasa</i>, is directly related to “<i>Chusa</i>—taking refuge,” as in “taking refuge in the shadow of His wings.” This is as it is written in the Midrash (Shir HaShirim Rabba, 23:25), “what is ‘with the crown with which His mother crowned Him.’ (Shir HaShirim 3)? This is likened to a king who loved his daughter so much, that he was not satisfied with calling her ‘daughter’ or ‘sister,’ and could only thoroughly express his love for her when he called her ‘his mother.’ [For there are various verses where God likens Israel to a daughter or a sister, and here in the present verse He calls Israel ‘His mother.’]”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When a man is worthy, and God considers his thoughts, which are really God’s realm, to be in the hands of man, then that person is, as it were, taking care of God like a mother takes care of her child. [Hagahot Peretz]</i><br>Since David haMelech had said (Divrei haYamim 1, 29:14), “all things have come from You, from Your own hand have we given to You,” meaning that he ascribed all the actions of man to God, for this precisely, “He [God] could thoroughly express his love for her until He called her ‘His mother.’ ” “Mother” means thought (as the mother gives birth to the child, so does thought give birth to action). Thus even the realm of thought will then be called in your name. This is as it is written in the Midrash (<i>Bamidbar</i> Rabba, 12:18), “it was told to Moshe concerning the sacrifices which they brought at the inauguration of the Tabernacle, “take from them.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The princes knew what to offer, each a bull, and every two a wagon, which had not even been told to Moshe. Thus Moshe feared that the <i>Shechina</i> had departed from them and rested on the princes. Thus God reassured Moshe, saying, “take from them.” See the Mei HaShiloach, last selection in <i>Parshat Nasso</i>, for more on this.</i> Moshe Rabeynu was discouraged when he saw what the princes had done (of their own accord). Then God told him that regardless, he was to take what the princes had brought, for this was the work of their hands. Thus the prince Netanel ben Tsoar had raised (presented) this advice, for he knew that, “God had placed wisdom in his mouth” (Mishlei, 2:6). For this, the matter was called in their name, as explained in its place in <i>Parshat Nasso</i> (last selection)."

This is what Shlomo haMelech meant when he said, “take hold of this, and from this do not remove.” In other words, if you are to fulfill God’s will through the active performance of an action, then do so with careful consideration and deliberation. The only way to fulfill God’s will in completeness is if it is done completely for the sake of Heaven, and this requires careful consideration of all actions, even with the performance of a mitzvah. Also, at the time when one fulfills God’s will through refraining from action, such as the observance of the Shabbat and the like, it must also be done with careful consideration. This means not to refrain from action because of laziness, but rather to even be zealous in the cessation of action. This means that a man will want to do forbidden work on the Shabbat but will actively refrain from it.<br>This is as it is written (Yeshayahu, 28:18), “if you turn away your foot on the Shabbat,” meaning that a man wants to go and do something, but he remembers that it is Shabbat and actively restrains his feet from taking him to do it. A man who is constantly involved in serving God will fulfill each mitzvah with both aspects. Thus the active performance of a mitzvah is illuminated from the careful consideration of the prohibitive mitzvot, and this illumination will inspire him to fulfill the prohibitive mitzvot with zeal.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this way positive and negative mitzvot compliment each other like the sun and the moon.

Therefore it is said (Yeshayahu, 63:1), “He is great in saving.” This means that he gave great advice concerning the eventual merit and salvations before Him. Therefore it says, “rejoice, young man, in your youth,” meaning in all your expansions, will arrive at its final rectification and a good end.<br>Eventually we will understand how everything that happened was God’s will. Then all that we did in greater expansion will be the choicest of actions. Therefore it says, “know that for all you do God will bring you to judgment,” for there also is a judgment for everything. This is as it is said by way of example (Kohellet Rabba, 11:13), “If one tells you, swim in the river, do not swim too far, for you will then have to swim back.” Even if you can get where you are going, it will then be difficult for you to return. Similarly Shlomo haMelech warns not to expand too much in the matters of this world, for you will have to then return to a place of judgment, meaning to God’s will. Then a man will have to suffer from this before he achieves refinement. This is why they wanted to conceal Kohellet, because first he gives <i>tekifut</i> (brazen strength, “holy chutzpa”) to Israel (in saying, “rejoice, young man, in your youth”), but when they saw afterwards that he said that all will be according to judgment, they said, “Shlomo has said well.”"

He then asked Ulla, ‘did I do well?’ Ulla told him to slit his throat [both in fearing that he would then slay Ulla, and also to end his pain].

(The ancients and the kabbalists believe that semen, hence desire, travels from the brain to the organ via the spinal column. This may have some biological basis with hormones originating in the brain.) When Moshe Rabeynu had split the Sea of Reeds, he was elevating all of Israel above any desire that could overpower them, and thus they crossed over on dry land (signifying conquering desire).(FNSee Likutei Moharan 6, which mentions how the verse about Splitting the Sea, “He Who makes a path in the Sea…” in the book of Yeshayahu conveys special <i>kavanaot</i> [theurgic intentions] for rectifying the sin of promiscuity (Arizal) and how to use them in the straigtforward service of God.) When Yehoshua split the Jordan, which corresponds to anger, he enabled all of Israel to overcome their anger.

Conquering and dividing the land was the portion of Yehoshua. Corresponding to this, Yehoshua also apprehended some of Moshe Rabeynu’s portion. The book of Yehoshua formulates this verse exactly as God spoke to Moshe in the <i>Chumash</i>, saying, “God spoke unto Yehoshua, saying: Speak to the children of Israel.” The Gemara explains this matter in the chapter, “how do you define the city limits” (<i>Eruvin</i>, 52b). “With several houses in a row, if one house stands outside the line and another on the inside, or in a wall, if one turret protrudes outside of the wall and another recedes.” This is discussing the interconnection of souls. “One house is on the inside of the line and another is on the outside” hints at degrees and levels of good, where one enters it into another, and another to another, and in this way they connect.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is kind of a spiritual representation in terms of good attributes of the geometric form described in the Gemara. Houses represent the domain of the soul.</i> “One turret protrudes and another recedes” teaches of the opposite, for also one’s deficiencies can enter into another somewhat. The subject of why the cities of refuge are in the portion of Moshe is explained in the holy Zohar in <i>Parshat Mishpatim</i> (114b) on the verse, “and I have set aside a place for you.” “This is the commandment to set aside cities of refuge for one who killed was given to you because of the Egyptian that you killed in Egypt. He had the primordial snake and all its brood surrounding him. Then you killed him before his time, and did not fear his brood chasing after you. This was when several women in your youth had chased after you. Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, gave you the cities of refuge to flee to, and they are the gates of repentance.” So too was Yehoshua close to Avizraiu, who killed another inadvertently.<br>Yehoshua had constantly yearned to understand the profundity of the Torah, but he could not arrive at the true depth that he sought during the lifetime of Moshe Rabeynu. By means of struggle, yearning, and prayer, he actually brought about the death of Moshe Rabeynu. When Moshe Rabeynu realized this, then God illuminated into Moshe Rabeynu that he himself should plead for mercy on behalf of Yehoshua, for Moshe also greatly desired the welfare of Yehoshua, and then of itself Yehoshua could not do anything against the life of Moshe. We find this in the Torah when Moshe prayed for Yehoshua. When Moshe understood this, he was greatly bewildered, so the Holy One, blessed be He, shined into Moshe the understanding that he should pray for Yehoshua’s welfare. Thus, Moshe’s entire revelation of the Torah was due to the great bewilderment sent to him by God, and it was all necessary for him. (All as part of the principle mentioned many times: “A person can only stand on Words of Torah if he first stumbles in them” (Talmud). Moshe, who transmitted the Torah to the world, had to go though this in order to open the channel. [Hagahot Peretz])"

So too with Bat Sheva (who King David married under what looked like suspiscious circumstances) and the daughter of Pharaoh (who King Shlomo married even though she was not Jewish). God clarified all of their actions, and made it clear that it was all God’s doing. (Like the statement of the Gemara, when Yehuda said of Tamar, “She is more righteous than I [<i>mimeni</i>],” that this was God saying, “the entire incident came forth from Me [<i>mimeni</i>].” See Rashi ad loc.)

David haMelech thus included 150 chapters in the book of <i>Tehilim</i>.

Also the “Mekor Mayim Chaiim,” the commentary from the teachings of Reb Yitsik Eisik of Komarno <i>zts’l</i> on the “Sefer Baal Shem Tov,” says on the first verse in the book of <i>Vayikra</i> that “sick,” <i>chole</i>, is the numerical equivalent of forty-nine, wheres healing comes from adding the one to reach the fiftieth gate. This is the small <i>aleph</i> in the word <i>Vayikra</i>, which the Baal Shem Tov <i>zts’l</i> says is the source of all healing. Furthermore, the fifty days from Passover to Shevuot are a process of national cleansing of the spirit of Israel, where we must be completely pure for the “wedding” on the fiftieth day, which is the festival of Shevuot.</i> Thus three times <i>nun</i>, fifty, 150, represents the absolute completeness of purity. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Jewish law, doing something 3 times represents a <i>hazaka</i> (presumption), i.e. the ox gored three times so it is presumed to be deadly.

In terms of Kabbala, three times encompasses the expansion, contraction, fusion dynamic that is the basis for the entire universe (<i>Tikuneu Zohar</i> Intr.)

This is why Shlomo answered (Melachim 1, 2:22), “why do you ask him just for Avishag? Ask him also for the kingdom.” Then Shlomo saw that in the depth of Adoniya’s heart he was rebelling against the kingdom, and this swore, “as God lives … just as I am king, so shall Adoniya on this day be put to death.” The desire for Avishag had really come to him from his desire for rulership."

We will no longer call the work of our hands, ‘our god.’ Only through You will mercy be aroused for the orphan.”</i> (Hoshea, 14:4)<br>“Ashur [Assyria],” represents brazen <i>tekifut</i> (brazen strength, action without consideration) and the power of flesh and blood. This is the <i>kelipa</i> (evil force) of Ashur, strong in itself, and we will no longer rely on our own human strength. “We will not ride on horses.” “Horse” represents being overly hasty and acting in a haphazard state without a settled mind. “The rider of the horse” represents a settled consciousness, which itself is not good at times, as is explained below. “We will no longer call the work of our hands, ‘our god’” is saying that we will no longer put our trust in silver and gold. “Through you shall the orphan find mercy” means one who has no support or assistance, for we shall not find any support outside of You—You shall be our sole reliance.<br>A settled mind is called constant, and it is always good to act in this way. Acting quickly is called <i>mequdash</i>, sanctified, for sometimes acting quickly is a very good quality. It is this way when one chooses to run to a matter of Torah even if he does not yet know what he is running to, but still it is very good. On this, Shlomo haMelech said (Mishlei, 21:31), “The horse is ready for the day of battle, and salvation is up to Hashem.” This means that in the end God will save him and show him that when he ran to understand the truth of the Torah it was in good judgment. This was the sin of the prophet Hoshea who said (<i>Pesachim</i>, 87a), “exchange them [Israel] for a different people.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is written in <i>Pesachim</i>, 87a: “The Holy One, blessed be He said to Hoshea, ‘Your children have sinned,’ to which he should have replied, ‘They are Your children, they are the children of Your beloved ones, they are the children of Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov. Show them Your mercy.’ It was not enough that he did not say this, but he said to Him: ‘Master of the Universe! The whole world is yours. Exchange them for a different people. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘What shall I do with this old man [who does not know how to defend his people]? I will order him: ‘Go and marry a whore and raise children of whoredom’; and then I will order him: ‘Send her away from your presence.’ If he will be able to send her away, then I too will send Israel away.’ For it is said, And the Lord said unto Hoshea, ‘Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredom and children of whoredom,’ and it is written, ‘So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Divlaim.’”</i> Hoshea said this out of the power of a settled mind. Then, after he realized that he had sinned, he said (Hoshea, 14:4), “we will not ride upon horses,” meaning that peace of mind (but a kind of peace of mind that gives way to restraint) is not always good. Therefore we must only rely upon You, Hashem, and not on our intellect."

But rather the Torah of Hashem is his desire, and he contemplates His Torah day and night … he shall be as a tree sated by streams of water, his leaf shall not wither, and all he does be made to succeed.”</i> (<i>Tehilim</i>,1)<br>“Advice” means thought. The term “advice” mentioned in this verse teaches of thought, meaning that he does not use his power of thought to entertain thoughts of evil. “In the way of sinners he does not stand”—“sin” refers to inadvertent sins. Thus, if he had erred by sinning without his conscious intent, then he does not “stand” in this state, but immediately acts to correct that which he has perverted. “And in the dwelling place of scoffers he does not sit.” “Scoffer” or <i>letz</i> in Hebrew, is one who is not currently transgressing any law. Rather, he does not care to conduct himself within the boundaries that protect the law; the “fences” of the sages who codified the law, which guard one from later transgressing the body of the law as it was ordained in the Torah. They are scoffing at the words of the sages, considering themselves “sitting comfortably,” without fear that they may come to sin.<br>Their danger is greater than the first example, the “advice of the evil ones,” who, conversely, will surely come to many errors (and expect this). The three levels mentioned here, “the advice of the evil ones,” “the way of the sinners,” and “the dwelling place of the scoffers,” are three levels of advice for man to be “turning from evil” (see <i>Tehilim</i>, 34:15). Corresponding to these three, there are three levels of “do good” (<i>Tehilim</i>, 34:15). “And his desire is in the Torah, for in the His Torah does he contemplate day and night,” is the opposite of “the advice of evil ones.” “He shall be as a tree sated by streams of water, whose leaf will not wither” means that he strives to increase his amount of Torah understanding and good conduct, which is the opposite of the “way of sinners,” whose way is filled with mistakes and forgetfulness. “All that he does shall be made to succeed”—“succeed” is not written, rather “made to succeed,” meaning that God will cause his actions to succeed in a way that is above his intellect or intentions. This corresponds to the “dwelling place of scoffers.” It is the opposite because he deliberately increases borders and fences around his fulfillment of the law in order to protect it, and in this way he makes it possible for him to fulfill all of the Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i>. By means of this God causes his actions to succeed in a way that is above his intellect and intentions."

This is as the verses continue, “Lend an ear to my words, God, understand my thoughts. Listen deeply to the voice of my shouts, my King, E-lohai, my God, for it is to You I pray. In the morning You shall hear my voice.” “Listen deeply to the voice of my shouts, my King and God”—“my King” because God loves me, and “E-lohai, my God” because He is my stronghold.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The particular name of God, <i>E-loha</i> denotes strength.</i> “In the morning God will hear my voice, in the morning I will arrange my plea before You.” “Morning” teaches of the first rays of sunlight at dawn, and the renewed blossoming of the light of day. So, too, the very first emergence of will in the heart of man before it spreads forth is called “morning.”<br>At this moment, while the thought has still just newly emerged, he asks God that the thought or desire not spread to a place against God’s will. “For You are not a God who desires evil, nor shall evil dwell with You” can be understood through the Midrash Ta’azria on the <i>Parsha</i> of <i>nega’im</i> (afflictions) (Tanchuma 7), “why does it not say here, ‘Speak to the children of Israel [in <i>Vayikra</i>, 13:1]’? For it is the nature of God that, ‘no evil—ya<i>GOR</i>cha—shall dwell with You,’ meaning no evil does not lead—<i>GORER</i>et—Him along.” Israel represents intense cleaving to God. Thus it says, “for You are not a God who desires evil,” to give meaning to one’s prayer, for truly the very first emergence of the desire to pray has come from God, and therefore no evil could come of it. However, he fears that from this point on it could spread to a place of evil. Therefore he prays with great intensity for God to be with him to help when the thoughts and desires begin to spread out into the world, helping the effects of the desire to be clean even from an inkling of thought against God’s will. Then it will follow that all his actions will be pure."

This is, “Your inheritance for Your weary people,” means that Israel’s ability to suffer and remain silent comes from the <i>tekifut</i> (holy, brazen strength), which comes from knowing that surely God will not forsake them, and it is all good for them, yet still they are weary. Thus it says, “You have established,” for they may take some consolation from the fact that God had established all they are enduring in order that all the good of the nations may then be brought into Israel in a state of <i>Kedusha</i> (holiness).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exile refines and purifies them so that they can elevate and enjoy the fallen good found among the nations in a holy manner.

At this time one must greatly exert himself in prayer and ask God to permanently illuminate this will into him for all time. This is as David haMelech asked of God the willingness of the heart of Israel to build the <i>Beit Hamikdash</i>, the Holy Temple.

This is the meaning of the phrase in the Gemara (<i>Yevamot</i>, 72a), “a time of God’s will is essential.” (That God grant us realization to implant inspiration to seek Him all the time, and not as a passing matter.

From here he may infer which matters God has prepared for him through which to test him and through which he will be refined.

So it is with every pending case in the world, “who shall live, and who shall die” [it is all hanging in judgment]. And so too with all of the desires and wills in the world, where this one chooses something that appears as life, and the other one something else that looks like life, when really at the root and source of life it is all fixed, “engraved,” and there is no one who will not choose it in this way.

                        "<i>“A psalm, a song for the day of Shabbat. It is good to thank God, to sing to His supernal name… How great are Your works, O God, how greatly profound Your thoughts! … a boor does not know, and a fool cannot understand this….”</i> (<i>Tehilim</i>, 92)<br>This psalm explains how it is impossible for anyone to have any kind of claim against God. This is explained by the holy Rambam (Maimonides) in the fifth chapter of the laws of returning to the way of God (<i>teshuva</i>). These are his pure words: “Perhaps you would say, ‘Does not God know all that will come to be? Before someone comes into being He knows that this one will be either righteous or wicked.’ If you shall say, ‘If God already knows that he will be righteous, then it is impossible that he will not be righteous.’ And if you say that He knows that this one will be righteous, and it could be that he turns out to be wicked, then He does not know the matter clearly.” According to this, it is within the power of a wicked man to acquit himself from judgment, and also the righteous does not have so much merit, or he would not believe, God forbid, that God knows everything. Therefore David haMelech explained this dilemma in this psalm, saying, “how great are Your works, O God, so profound are your thoughts, a boor cannot know.” Seen in our human understanding his words are wondrous, describing God as it were in His greatness and the profundity of His thoughts, which a fool will not apprehend and a boor will not understand. However, it would be proper to say that even the sages and geniuses of the world do not know such matters, because God’s intellect is hidden from any human cognizance. This is as it is written (Yeshayahu, 55:8), “for My thoughts are not your thoughts.” Also it is as Eliyahu the prophet described in his prayer (Tikkunei Zohar 17a, “Patach Eliyahu”), “You are Wise, but not with a known form of wisdom, no thought may apprehend you at all.”<br>Yet this is the intention of David haMelech with these words, where truly, the sages and believers will not in such ways question the intentions of God, heaven forfend. They know that they cannot understand the intensity of His profundity. They know the greatness of His thoughts, and the vastness of His actions. It says, “a boor cannot know,” to show how a boor cannot know the profundity of His thoughts, and therefore will raise objections and claims against the ways of God, as we have explained. This is the explanation of the verse that follows in this psalm, “when the wicked flourish like the grass, and doers of iniquity spring up, it is so they may be destroyed for ever, but You are exalted forever.”<br>That is, that with all the flourishing of the wicked like the grass and the iniquitous bringing forth buds, they only came about to be destroyed forever, and they were only created in order to benefit the righteous. If so, then they have no claim whatsoever, since the whole point of their being alive was only for this, and at their root they have no more life. This is the very claim that the nations will bring against God in the future, saying “All hidden things are revealed before You. You effused into us a good spirit and lowered Your people Israel into exile under our hands. Your action brought about an arousal in our hearts to destroy Your people. Then from this, when we act with iniquity, the strength of Israel is then raised. But why are we guilty of this? This sin is not ours!” This is as it is said, “when the wicked flourish … to destroy them forever.” Corresponding to this it says, “and You are exalted, O God,” for truly You are Supernal, an no element of creation can have any form of claim against You, and all Your judgments against us are just.",
                        "<i>“For behold, Your enemies, O God, behold Your enemies are destroyed, all doers of iniquity will be scattered.”</i> (<i>Tehilim</i>, 92)<br>This is because all the nations of the world are Your enemies, therefore they have no form of life at their root. Truly all that exists is God’s will, and nothing exists outside of Him. Since they oppose His will, they have no life at their source, yet for the present moment their existence is still God’s will in order to elevate Israel through them. However, in their essence, God has no use for them. If so, when they are eventually destroyed, they will be able to claim injustice in that they shall be lost completely and Israel will inherit all their good. For how has He acted with them until then? He has bestowed goodness unto them all their days and they have received all effusions of goodness. That no remnant remains from them is because they never possessed within them any eternal life, for they were only created for Israel’s benefit. In their time they will be destroyed, for they despise Israel and God, and Israel will inherit all their good."

For this, they too must sing joyously. But with us, His people Israel “exult in the Rock of our salvation” with “trumpets and the blast of the <i>Shofar</i>,” with intense joy of heart that flows from the deepest place in the heart. This is likened to a king who makes a wedding feast for his son. He invites all kinds of guests to the feast and honors them with food and drink. The joy of the guests is because of the feast that he made for them, and with which he honored them. But the joy of his son is joy from the deepest essence."

They have only simple life, and the desire for the increase of simple life from God free from any hue, (any externality, just the pure essence). To this the nations of the world will say in the future, “God has done greatness with these,” meaning that God bestowed all Divine influence to Israel. “God has done greatness with us, we will be filled with joy.” This is saying that (in this world) God filled us with all manner of goodness from our youth, filled us with power that is great in all aspects of our lives. So clearly when we see how the Holy One, blessed be He, had done this with us, we are filled with joy.

Do not be clever in your own estimation, and turn away from evil.”</i> (Mishlei, 3:3–7)<br>There is great significance in the juxtaposition of these two verses. “Find grace and good understanding” tells man to see to it that his actions should gain him grace and honor in the eyes of his fellow man. But if he wants to strive with all of his power to be adorned in the eyes of his fellow man, then “trust in God with all your heart and do not rely upon your own understanding.” This means not to trust the understanding of your own heart as if you know what will gain grace in their eyes and what will not. Rather, “know Him in all your ways,” and incline all of your intentions for the sake of Heaven, that all of your ways shall be in God’s will. “He shall lead you on upright paths,” meaning, if you go in the way of goodness, then you need not concern yourself that it gains grace in the eyes of your fellow, for God will anyway lead you on the upright path that will find grace in their eyes. But still, do not rely on this alone by going ahead and doing actions that are contrary to the sensibility of men, trusting in the knowledge that it is correct because he is righteous at his depths. On this it is said, “do not be clever in your own estimation, and turn away from evil.”",

The source will be healed through words of Torah. Then of itself no residue of this deficiency will remain in the places to which it has branched out.

However, there is an advantage to the candle over the great light, for the candle has the ability to reach into holes and crevices that the great light cannot. The Torah refines the whole man in general, yet in a place where he knows that he is deficient, there he needs the specific mitzvah whereby he can be strengthened in this aspect. This is as we find in the Gemara (<i>Shabbat</i>, 118b), “Concerning which mitzvah was your father most careful? He told him that it was the mitzvah of <i>tsitsit</i>.” He needed this particular mitzvah according to the understanding of where he was lacking, and could thereby replenish his lack."

Then wisdom arouses him, for “at the time of the inclination to evil, no one remembers the inclination to good” (<i>Nedarim</i>, 32b). Yet before he overpowers (the lusts of the world, the <i>yetser hara</i>), then “she cries out to it.” This is “among the high places.” “By the way” is after a man is helped to escape from something evil; “she stands in the place of the paths,” which is if a man can refine his heart so as not to desire that which is not God’s will. “She cries by the gates,” since God created man in the world from a sense of honesty and fairness, so just as he gave man the power to desire everything, so too he gave him the power of wisdom to overcome this desire. “At the entrance to the city” means just as a man intends to do God’s will, “at the opening of doorways she cries.”",

This is “the lips of the <i>Tsaddik</i>,” meaning only his speech, since his heart is not yet <i>mevurar</i> (passive voice of <i>birur</i>, i.e. refined). However, this (process of speaking) will help him to undergo the process of <i>birur</i> and to be drawn to (follow God’s) Will with a complete heart. For example, when anger wells up in his heart against his friend, he knows and accepts that this is a deficiency. In this case he is advised to first speak kindly to his friend, and even though this is not with a willing heart, by means of the act of speaking in this way he will gradually change his very heart by inserting love where there was hate. This is “shall know Will,” for (here) the termb “know” means order. By means of his speech he will arrange the Will until he inserts and installs it there with a complete and willing heart. This is as it is written (<i>Tehilim</i>, 104:18), “the sun knows it is going down.” This means that there is an order and constancy in the path of the sun that is not so with the moon, which sometimes follows a long path and sometimes a short path, as is written in the Gemara (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, 25a); see there.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">At times, Torah Court forces one who does not agree to do what the law dictates to do it anyway.

This is like the saying of Hillel (<i>Vayikra</i> Rabba, 34:3), “After Hillel had concluded his studies, he went walking, accompanied by his students. His students asked him, ‘where are you going?’ He said, ‘to do a mitzvah.’ ‘What mitzvah is that?’ they asked. ‘To go wash myself in the bathhouse,’ he answered. They asked how this was a mitzvah. He said, ‘look at the one who is appointed to wash and maintain the statues of kings they display in theaters and stadiums. The one who does this is not only paid, but is exalted in the company of the powerful. How much more so with me, created in the image of God. Furthermore, it is written, ‘the man of kindness is good to his soul.’” All this is after he has refined himself, so as not to taste the bitter (of wordly desire) as sweet. Then if he finds that it is in his power to be good to his body and he prevents it (see Mishlei, 3:27), on this it is said, “the cruel one troubles his own flesh.” However, if he is not yet refined and he finds that he desires to cause his body delight, on this it says, “evil ones do acts of falsehood” (Mishlei, 11:18). In other words, it is not enough that what he is doing is not called bestowing kindness on his body, but the opposite; he turns it around and destroys his body by spoiling it with delights. This is, “acts of falsehood.” This is hinted at in the holy Zohar, which says (<i>Shemot</i>, 200a), “there are three points to the Torah.” This means that with every action, great or small, one must weight it on a kind of spiritual scale to see that it fits three criteria. First of all, it must be good for his body. This is as our sages said (<i>Pesachim</i>, 68b), “at the outset, when someone does something, he does it for himself.” Furthermore it should be good and honest in the ways of God. Also it must not cause harm to anyone else. After he sees that the action fits these three categories, he can do it, and it is called “a man of kindness is good to his soul.”"

That is to say, he doesn’t understand that his fellow is in the right, rather he has convinced himself that he is right about everything, and does not give any merit to his fellow. Therefore he does not realize that it is his intention to cheat him. “Only what has been attained by perseverance is precious to man,” this means something valuable to a precious man is deficient in his eyes. This is because the word for perseverance, or diligent work, <i>charutz</i> in Hebrew, is related to the word <i>chareetz</i> or crack, meaning that the wealth is somehow “cracked” or deficient, even though it has been achieved in an honest way. Then when he emerges from the trial victorious over his fellow, it still does not sit well with him, and he constantly wonders that he is still somehow incomplete and perhaps harbors deceit within him."

This means that the <i>tsaddik</i> (righteous one) is very careful in how he eats, and finds it difficult to eat in a gathering that is not for the purpose of a mitzvah (i.e., Shabbat, a wedding, etc.). This is as it is said in the Gemara (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, 23a), “the pure-minded of Jerusalem would not sit down to a meal unless they knew with whom they were dining.” “The belly of the evil ones is lacking” means that the desire of the evil ones is to eat together in the company of the other such miscreants, but not at a gathering for a mitzvah. Therefore it reads (Mishlei, 12:26), “the righteous seek to cultivate others,” meaning if the gathering is for the purpose of a mitzvah then the <i>tsaddik</i>’s goodness is increased from the company of his friends.

Two salesmen went to the market and sold their merchandise for a certain price. They met each other and asked, “how much did you profit from your sales?” One said a certain amount, and added, “I made a great profit.” The other said, “I charged even more than you, but I lost money!” The other answered him, “you fool! Your mistake was not in your sale here. Your mistake was only in your home. At home you invested much more in your merchandise than I did, and you cheated yourself at your home!” So it is also true with the Torah. For truly, with words of Torah, “a soft tongue is the tree of life,” for it heals (“soft”—<i>marpe</i>, is similar to “healing”—<i>merape</i>) all of man’s deficiencies. However, “one who perverts his speech is like a destructive wind.” Sometimes a man studies a great amount, but takes not profit from it, remaining as defunct as before. This is because of the “destructive wind,” which means literally “a break in the spirit.” That is to say, there are unrepaired deficiencies in the spirit of his life, in his brain, and in his heart. Therefore his words of Torah are of no use to him. He must go back to correct this deficiency of his that he has carried from his birth, and only then can bring Words of Torah close to his heart.",

At first glance it seems that this thought was in vain.

The Gemara asks why this is taught concerning his money and not a valuable object he happened to find. Rashi answers that his money is something that he exerted himself to gain, and therefore would be more likely to want to keep it. Even the smallest of the small is willing to do a good action that does not require a monetary sacrifice.

                        "<i>“Vanity and falsehood, keep them away from me.”</i> (Mishlei, 30:8)<br>“Vanity” is something useless that has no roots. It is of no use to man at all. “Falsehood” could be something that man needs, like a livelihood, yet it comes from a place that is not God’s will. This is the meaning of the term used for falsehood, <i>c’zav</i> in Hebrew, as in the verse (Yeshayahu, 58:11), “like a spring of water which does not fail [<i>lo yic’zavu</i>].”",
                        "<i>“Three [matters] were too wondrous for me, and four I did not know. The way of the eagle in the heavens, the way of the snake by the rock, the way of the ship in the heart of the sea, the way of man with a young woman.”</i> (Mishlei, 30:18–19)<br>“The eagle” teaches of impurity, because the eagle does not even have one sign of pure birds (<i>Chullin</i>, 61a; see Mei HaShiloach, “the outward signs of pure birds”) and it has all four signs of impurity. “Heavens” teaches of purity and clarity. This teaches that in everything that is pure, there is impurity that must be refined. “The way of the snake by the rock,” “rock” means <i>tekifut</i> (brazen strength, not holding back), in that man’s mind is vigorously resolved to go after the good way. “Snake” represents error, in that he could err. “The way of the ship in the heart of the sea” means that in proceeding with haste he shall exercise restraint. “The sea” represents being hasty in one’s desires, and thus in every panic he shall find calmness of mind. “The way of man with a young woman” “woman,” means concealment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is because, among other reasons, the word used for young woman, <i>alma</i>, uses the same letters as the word for concealment, <i>he’lem</i>.</i> “Man” means clear, apparent. This is to show how all concealment contains clarity. When Shlomo haMelech said (Kohollet, 1:13), “E-lohim gave a bad matter [<i>inyan</i>] to man,” he was referring to these four matters. Also the word for matter, <i>Inyan</i>, is an acronym for the names of these four matters in Hebrew. <i>Inyan</i> is spelled <i>ayin, nun, yud, nun</i>. <i>Ayin</i>—Alma [young woman].” “<i>Nun—Nesher</i> [eagle].” “<i>Yud</i>—Yam [sea].” “<i>Nun</i>—Nachash [snake].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">King Shlomo calls them “bad” because they are given from Above to man beneath in a mixed state that requires birur (clarification).

                        "<i>“The spider holds on with its hands, and it is in the chambers of the king.”</i> (Mishlei, 30:28)<br>“Spider” (<i>shmamit</i>) teaches of anger and destruction (<i>shomema</i>). “Holds on with its hands” shows that the emergence of deficiency exists even with great people, for “the sages are the real kings.” And the sages, the leaders of thousands of Israel, have emerged from this to complete themselves, so as not to find this rooted in their hearts. So it was with Uziyah (see Divrei haYamim 2, Ch. 26), who went to burn incense in the innermost chamber of the Temple (but was prevented from this), for he wanted to perfect himself in this. All the while he knew that he was not complete in this aspect, he knew that he was not complete his whole being. This incense brings joy to the heart of man, as it is written (Mishlei, 27:9), “oil and incense gladden the heart.” This is as it is written (Divrei haYamim 2, 26:19), “when he became angry with the <i>Cohanim</i>, leprosy sprouted on his forehead.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He then had to be cast out of the Temple, and remained a leper the rest of his life.</i> He realized that he was not clean in this aspect (joy), and in order to fix the matter, and judging himself to be in mortal danger, permitted himself to offer the incense in order to complete his soul. This was possible, because nothing should prevent the saving of a life. And truly, it succeeded, because after this he achieved completion, as it said, “leprosy sprouted on his forehead,” where the word for sprouted, <i>zarcha</i>, also means “to shine.” In this sense, it was only on the surface that his action was improper, but at the depths he achieved completion from this, as it is said (Melachim 2, 15:5), “[as a leper] he dwelled in the house of liberation.” That is, he was set free because he was then complete. However, since he was among the <i>Cohanim</i>, and the profundity of his intention was hidden from them, it seemed as if he was desecrating God. Thus in their eyes he was a leper. This is as it is said of his son Yotam (Divrei haYamim 2, 27:2), “and he did that which was proper in the eyes of God, just as his father Uziya had done, yet he did not enter the chamber of God.” This is a limitation, just as all the mentions of “yet” and “only” are in the Torah, in that he did not arrive at this level. And if Uziya had only offered the incense, he would have immediately entered the world to come."

                        "“What is Chanuka?” (<i>Shabbat</i> 21b). It is written (<i>Tehilim</i>, 119: 105), “Your word is a candle to my feet, and light for my path.” “A candle to my feet,” meaning that God bestows the words of Torah in a way that “His Sovreignty in all of His dominion” (<i>Tehilim</i>, 103:19) is recognized in each detail of action. “A light for my path” means that God illuminates a special recognition also in a general way, for “the kingdom is His.” (It is written this way) because a candle is something specific, and light something general. God created the world in general, and divided it into three categories—time, place, and person. It is written (<i>Tehilim</i>, 139:16), “He fashioned days, and it is in one of them” (usually understood that when He created each of the six days of creation He knew everything, every detail, that would ever happen in that day for all time to come).<br>This means that in these three categories, He chose in particular the choicest element through which to illuminate in a revealed way a specific light and the recognition of His sovereignty, may it be blessed. In the category of place, He created the world in general, where the land of Israel is sanctified above the whole earth. (See Mishna <i>Kelim</i>, Ch. 1:6.) Jerusalem sanctified above all the land of Israel, the five-hundred-square cubits of the temple mount sanctified above Jerusalem, and the courtyard and chamber sanctified above them all. In this very place He commanded to light the Menorah in order to illuminate this particular recognition in this specific place. In the category of time He created the six days of creation, in particular the day of Shabbat, and then we also find the commandment to kindle the light of Shabbat. In the category of person He chose specifically the nation of Israel out of all the nations. For now, until the final <i>birrur</i> (clarification) in Israel, He chose the tribe of Levi, and among them the Cohanim, and among them the High Priest, and gave him in particular the commandment to light the Menorah.<br>In the days of the Hasmoneans, the Holy One, blessed be He, shone into them from the illumination of the future, for at that time he merited <i>Malchut</i>, sovereignty. And so it is that in the future Moshiach ben David will reveal this illumination when the <i>birur</i> is complete and the chosen tribe is Yehuda. So then, when the Hasmoneans merited this <i>Malchut</i>, the light of the recognition of the chosenness of each individual soul in Israel was greatly increased. As a result from the miracle of the Menorah, an individual candle (illumination) was established for the chosenness of each individual soul in Israel.<br>This is as King David said (<i>Tehilim</i>, 87:6), “God will count, when He writes down the nations, and for Zion He will say each one born to her.” “Count, when He writes down the nations,” for with the nations, God’s Providence is only for the endurance of the species, like other parts of creation. “And for Zion He will say each one born to her” is that for Israel the Providence of the Holy One, blessed be He, is for each individual soul, each one born to her. The verse continues, “and He will establish her at the highest,” means that for every one born to Israel, immediately upon birth, there is a recognition that the choicest soul has been born anew, and this is as it is said, “a candle for every one.” This is the difference of opinion between the house of Shammai and the house of Hillel, meaning just how the final <i>birrur</i>, refinement, will be in Israel, and how to light the Chanuka candles, which hint at this. The house of Shammai asserts that we light all eight on the first night, and remove a candle each night, like the (13) bulls (on the first day) of succot, (each day decreasing by one, until 7 were offered on the last day.) This represents how the <i>birur</i> destroys the waste, decreasing and continuing until the <i>Kedusha</i> (holiness) remains, completely clarified. The house of Hillel asserts that we add and continue, adding a candle each night, for here the principle is to cause the <i>Kedusha</i> to spread forth at all times, and this in and of itself nullifies the waste.<br>This is also the meaning of the Halacha for the time of lighting the candles “from the setting of the sun until the foot [<i>regel</i>] finishes from the market,” meaning that (with lighting) no force of habit [<i>hergel</i>] will be found in any soul in Israel. This is the mitzvah to light it in the doorway of the house from outside, meaning that the candle—this recognition discussed above—should illuminate every step with intent for the sake of Heaven. And of what is said (<i>Shabbat</i>, 21b), “until the wood-sellers will leave the market [who would stay after everyone else had left to gather leftover wood],” which means, when the final <i>birrur</i> in Israel will be completed.<br>Concerning this it is explained in the tractate <i>Yevamot</i> (17b), “they established six thousand archers [who went and raped the daughters of Jerusalem at the time of the destruction],” meaning that their seed was mixed into Israel, and this is the principal reason for the lengthening of the exile. When this becomes undergoes <i>birur</i>, then God’s will will be explicit before us, and this is “from the setting of the sun,” for the sun hints at the principles of the words of Torah, and in the future these principles will not be necessary; rather God will cause an effusion of explicit understanding to each one in Israel for each specific action. This is as it is said, “a Chanuka candle that is placed above twenty cubits is invalid,” which is true for a <i>sukkah</i> and a <i>mavoy</i> (an open street or alley, concerning its width in the laws of Eruvin, symbolic Shabbat boundaries). (So for the three general divisions of existence) the Chanuka candle represents person, <i>sukkah</i> represents place, and the <i>mavoy</i> (in the laws of Shabbat) represents time, for the choicest of times is Shabbat."
