            "A conversation with teachers and parents of the children [who will be taught from this book]",
            "King Solomon said in Proverbs (22, 6): \"Teach the lad according to his way, so that also in his old age he will not turn from it.\" This is the core of education: that not only at the time the child is young and in the domain of his father that he will listen and do according to the commandments, rather also when he grows up and is in his own domain, even when he becomes elderly he will not turn from it. Because education is not only commands, that one should command his son or student \"Do such and such,\" so too is it not just habit, that one accustoms his son or student to good deeds. Education is far, far beyond commands or habit, and these two things, commands and habit, are simply tools used in its implementation which the educator is forced to use, to command or to habituate, in order to educate on the path of the LORD."
