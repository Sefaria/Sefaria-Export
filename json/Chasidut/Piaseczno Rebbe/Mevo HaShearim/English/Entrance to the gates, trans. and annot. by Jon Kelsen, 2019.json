                "Chapter One<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">163</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Chapter One, R. Shapiro advances his understanding of prophecy as a form of divine service, drawing down divinity into the world, and frames the rabbinic enterprise as continuing the prophets’ work.</i><br>Part A",
                "We read in the Talmud (<i>Megillah</i> 14a): The Rabbis taught: Forty-eight prophets and seven prophetesses prophesied to Israel, without adding nor detracting from that which is written in the Torah, except for recitation of the Megillah… as it is taught “Many prophets arose on behalf Israel—double the number which left Egypt; yet, only the prophecies which were necessary<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">164</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, whose message carries import and relevance for future generations.</i> for the generations were recorded in Scripture, while those not necessary for the generations were not...",
                "We must understand this: Since the prophets neither added nor detracted from that which is written in the Torah, of what benefit were their prophecies for Israel?",
                "Now, regarding the phrase “prophecies which were necessary for the generations,” Rashi<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">165</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Solomon Yitzhaki, Troyes, France. 1040-1105</i> glosses “to teach repentance or [other] instruction.” What is the nature of this ‘<i>instruction</i>?’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">166</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Horaah</i>, from the same Hebrew root as ‘Torah.’</i> It cannot refer to adding or detracting from the Torah, since the passage states they did not issue such instructions. Nor can it mean that they innovated specific rulings regarding Torah law, using prophecy rather than standard legal reasoning or hermeneutics. For Maimonides<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">167</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Moses b. Maimon, Spain and Egypt, 1135-1206</i> writes (in the introduction to his <i>Mishnah Torah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">168</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Maimonides’ legal magnum opus, a comprehensive codification of Jewish law.</i>): “Know that prophecy is legally inefficacious in interpreting the Torah or extrapolating legal details via the hermeneutical principles. Rather, just as Joshua and Phineas utilized analysis and reasoning, so too did Ravina and Rav Ashi.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">169</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For more on the role of prophecy in halakhic interpretation in Maimonides’ system, see his Laws of the Foundations of the Torah, Chapter 10.</i> Maimonides continues on to explain that the prophet had only the additional capacity [over the sage] to temporarily suspend a Torah law, as did Elijah on Mount Carmel, but no more.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">170</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See I Kings 18:34-38 and Talmud <i>Yevamot</i> 90b.</i> If so, in what sense is the prophet’s ‘teaching of repentance or other instruction’ superior to that of any other [authority]?",
                "Maimonides himself asks this question: “If so [that is, if a prophet is unable to add to, nor detract from, the Torah],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">171</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The bracketed clarification is added by R. Shapiro.</i> why does the verse state “I will establish a prophet from among them, for them?” [Answer:] It is not to establish religious law, but rather to command the people regarding the Torah, warning them not to violate it.” (Laws of the Foundations of the Torah 9:2)",
                "Further, we must understand: How does the function of the prophet differ from that of any other non-prophetic rebuker<i>?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">172</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e. one who offers chastisement and rebuke to the people; Hebrew, <i>mokhiakh.</i> Interestingly, the term <i>mokhiakh</i> was used in contemporaneous eastern-European Jewish parlance to refer to itinerant preachers who would rebuke communities to better abide by the Torah. Their function was analogous to that of the <i>maggidim</i>, preachers.</i> Why does God say “I will establish a prophet for them” rather than “I will establish a rebuke<i>r</i>?” And, what is the precise distinction between the forty-eight prophets whose words were necessary for future generations, and the other prophets whose holy words were only necessary for their own generations? After all, though it is true that the chastisement [<i>mussar]</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">173</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lit. chastisement. Perhaps R. Shapiro is perhaps making a double entendre here, obliquely referencing contemporaneous <i>mussarists</i>.</i><i></i> they articulated was meant for their generation, nonetheless, would it not be beneficial for us too to be chastised towards fulfillment of the Torah by them? [After all, t]he chastisement of those prophets whose words were not written down would arouse us as well to fulfill the Torah. We cannot claim that Rashi means that it was only the forty eight prophets uttered instruction and chastisement<i>,</i> while the rest of the prophets only included portents relevant to their generations; for a) the prophecies of the forty eight prophets which were recorded in Scripture also included portents (like those of Elijah, Elisha, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, etc.); and b) it is unthinkable that all of those other prophets, twice the number which left Egypt, merely issued portents, without any praise to God or mussar or instruction to Israel! Indeed,",
                "Scripture is explicit that the primary function of the prophet is to instruct Israel regarding God’s word: “I will establish a prophet, and I have placed My words in his mouth, and he will speak to them all that I command him.” (Deut. 18:18) Who may overlook the Targum’s<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">174</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Canonical Aramaic translation of the Bible, on various books, refers to either (primarily) Targum Onkelos or Targum (pseudo-)Jonathan. In this case, see Targum Pseudo-Jonathan to I Samuel 10:5.</i> rendering on the words “And you will meet a band of prophets... and they will be prophesying ... and you will prophesize along with them…”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">175</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 10:5-6.</i> , rendered as ‘and they will be praising...and you will praise with them.” This is written specifically regarding the other prophets, whose words were not recorded, and yet [we see that] they, too, issued praises of God, not just portents.",
                "What, then, is the difference between the praises said by King David and Deborah the prophetess, about whom the Talmud tells us that their prophecies were necessary for all generations and thus recorded, and the prophecies of the other prophets, which were relevant only to their generations, and not recorded?",
                "Now, it is true that, to our sorrow and distress, as the heavenly gates have been locked and we have neither prophet nor seer,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">176</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a critical line, as R. Shapiro references the rabbinic claim that true prophecy ceased during the Second Temple period. See Talmud <i>Sotah</i> 48b.<br>However, R. Shapiro’s agenda here is to demonstrate that this claim is only partially true: while prophecy in the sense of future telling has indeed ceased, attaining prophetic consciousness as a form of divine worship remains the ultimate goal of the religious personality.</i> we know but a little of them, that is, of their holy words ‘necessary for the generations,’ recorded in Scripture. But of the essence of the prophet and his Holy Spirit, and even his other words which were deemed irrelevant to us, we know nothing at all. Regarding the ‘words deemed necessary for the generations’ themselves, each person hears and understands them only in correlation to the limits of his understanding and intelligence. Thus, an erroneous impression regarding the essence of the prophet has been formed in our minds. We perceive him only in accordance with our needs, as a portender informing Israel in accordance with their needs (to locate the asses, or to bestow blessing onto a tin of flour and a flask of oil, or to advise them militarily as to which wars they should or should not engage in).",
                "If we see in the words of our masters that the words of the prophet were ‘to teach repentance and instruction,’ one could erroneously think that the prophet was merely one who rebuked. Even in yesteryear, during the times of the prophets themselves, when people beheld the(se) ‘pillars of fire’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">177</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, the prophets.</i> before them and the flames of God flowing from the mouths of these holy ones—we see that the people nonetheless called the prophets by terms reflective of their utility. As the verse puts it, “for the prophet today used to be called the seer” (I Samuel 9:9). Why would one call him a seer when the Torah preceded him to call him a prophet, as in “I will establish a prophet?” The answer is, simply, that the names and terms we use cannot convey anything beyond the boundaries of human utility or sensory perception. After all, an angel [<i>malakh]</i> is referred to as such due to its function as a messenger, not according to its essential nature. The soul [<i>neshamah]</i> is referred to as such after the breath (see Rashi to Genesis 7:22).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">178</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 7:22 reads: “All in whose nostrils was <i>nishmat ruakh hayim beapaiv</i> (the merest breath of life-JPS), all that was on dry land, died.” In some versions of Rashi’s commentary here, the term ‘<i>nishmat’</i> is rendered ‘<i>neshimah shel’,</i> ‘the breath of,’ rather than ‘the soul of.’ R. Shapiro cites this as evidence that the soul is called the neshamah because of its association with the breath rather than as a true descriptor of its metaphysical essence.</i> For we have no name for the essence of the angel nor the essence of the soul. So too, the term ‘prophet’ does not describe the essence of the prophet but merely that God has spoken with him (despite the biblical reference to a prophet as “man of God,” [see <i>Berakha 1</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">179</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference is to Deuteronomy 33:1, the beginning of <i>Parshat Vzot haBerakhah.</i></i> and several times in Kings<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">180</sup><i class=\"footnote\">E.g. I Kings 13:1.</i>], the Targum always translates “man of God” functionally, as “prophet of God”). Therefore the people named them (the prophets) in correlation to their needs, alternating their titles according to the functions which the prophets performed more frequently: when the prophets were primarily teaching Israel repentance and issuing instruction, they called them <i>neviim</i>, from the language of “<i>niv sefatayim</i>”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">181</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Expressions of the mouth.”</i> (Rashi to Exodus 7:10), and when they more often told the future and provided for other needs, they were called seers. “For the prophet today used to be called the seer”-i.e. the people called them as such.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">182</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, these were colloquial nomenclature, not proper names.</i>",
                "But just as we call an angel ‘a messenger’ and a ‘soul’ is named after the breath, though we know that an angel is not merely a messenger and the soul is no mere breath but rather has an ungraspable spiritual essence of which we perceive only its actions—so too, though they were called prophets or seers, the people knew that these things which the prophet did were not his entire essence. He was not there just to serve them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">183</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The prophetic activity does not exhaust, nor even precisely correlate with the essence of the prophetic personality. As stated in Chapter II, what the prophet <i>does</i> is distinct from who the prophet <i>is.</i></i>",
                "This was true while the prophets existed before their very eyes, and bands of prophets and their disciples blinded the people by their light. Now, however, that is no longer the case, and we are left with only their names and activities as recorded in Scripture. And so the matter has degenerated from a time when ‘an erroneous impression regarding the essence of the prophet was formed in some peoples’ minds,’ to now when some fail to even consider the essence of the prophet, presuming instead that they were merely portenders or chastizers in the name of God; and, furthermore, that these figures were the only prophets.",
                "However, when we examine the holy texts—Zohar, Kabbalah, and hasidism—we see that ‘prophet’ and ‘prophecy’ are in fact levels of <i>avodah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">184</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In hasidic parlance, ‘<i>avodah</i>’ refers to spiritual practice/praxis, forms of divine service.</i> As it says in the <i>Zohar</i> “In ancient times prophecy rested upon people, so they knew and contemplates supernal glory.” <i>[</i>Zohar, <i>Vayekhi</i>,238a] indicating that prophecy entails gazing at the supernal glory.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">185</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, besides issuing portends and rebuke, prophecy is a theosophical experience of encountering and <i>seeing</i> the divine, in and of itself.</i>",
                "And, as it says in the introduction to <i>Tikkunei Zohar</i> (2a) “...and from then Israel were called kings, righteous, seers, prophets, masters of Torah, mighty, pious (hasidim), mavens, wise.” Just as the righteous, masters of Torah, hasidim etc. so too ‘prophets’ denotes a level of divine service. It is impossible to claim that since we have seen him teach in public, that constitutes the essence of a master of Torah. This is merely one thing he does—but at his <i>essence</i> he is one soaked in Torah. Nor can we claim that the essence of a <i>tzaddik</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">186</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here and in the term hasidic, R. Shapiro is perhaps reading these terms primarily in light of their hasidic usage, rather than their literal meanings of ‘righteous one’ and ‘pious ones.’ Whether or not these are in the intended <i>denotations</i> of these terms, they would certainly by understood by R. Shapiro’s readers with their contemporary <i>connotations.</i></i> is encapsulated in his good and righteous deeds. Even were we to say that he is a <i>tzaddik</i> because he has imbibed a certain degree of Torah and demonstrates a certain degree of righteousness, we would have still not described his true essence as such.",
                "Adjectives describing an essence are not the same things as the essence itself. As an analogy, if we call something white or cold, the whiteness and coldness are not the thing itself, but merely descriptions thereof. Only when we call this thing ‘snow’ have we articulated its essence. All the more so when we try to describe <i>tzaddikim</i> and sacred things, which are above our grasp. The adjectives are not the essence, but merely <i>describe</i> the essence.",
                "Regarding my grandfather, the <i>Maggid</i> of Kozhenitz,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">187</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a significant rhetorical moment, as R. Shapiro moves explicitly from discussing the essence of the prophet to the essence of the hasidic <i>tzaddik.</i></i> may the memory of the righteous be for a blessing, we know that his greatness was constituted by his essence, that of being ‘the <i>Maggid</i> of Kozhenitz,’ [an essence] impossible to describe with words. On the contrary, everyone knows that in order to rise to this level of essential greatness, in order to become ‘the <i>Maggid</i>,’ one would [first] need to acquire much revealed and hidden Torah, and a great wealth of righteousness, etc. As such, the essential greatness of the <i>tzaddik</i> is distinct from (his) Torah and righteousness, which are prerequisites for its attainment. The essence itself is impossible to describe, but must rather be seen or felt.",
                "And who is able to do so? Only one who is himself a righteous and great individual, who is thus able to sense within himself this type of greatness and to gain some measure of understanding as to what a <i>tzaddik</i> is and what the essence of the <i>Maggid</i> was. In this vein, when we speak of the prophet and prophecy, we speak of a type of greatness inhering in the essence of this worshipper,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">188</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Oved,</i> from the same root as <i>avodah</i>.</i> yet indescribable, attainable only upon performing the <i>avodah</i> of prophecy.",
                "As it says in the Midrash on Song of Songs (chapter 1): “R. Isaac says, it is written “And God commanded me:” There are things which He said to me privately, and things which He instructed me to convey to His children…”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">189</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, not all prophecies were meant to be delivered to the people. As such, these prophecies must have had a different purpose.</i>",
                "Not only do we not grasp the prophet, we do not even grasp all that which God said to him. We only have those things which He said to him which are relevant to us. In the introduction to R. Hayyim Vital’s <i>Shaarei Kedushah</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">190</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This work was a primary source for R. Shapiro’s thinking, commonly learned in hasidic circles. It, too, is a text about how to be a prophet.</i> he elaborates in greater detail in what sense prophecy is in fact a type of <i>avodah,</i> and indeed what type of <i>avodah</i> and cleaving [<i>deveykut]</i> prophecy is. Here are his holy words:",
                "“Thus says the young one, Hayyim son of Joseph Vital: I have seen people of ascent [bnai aliyah], few in number, desiring to rise; yet the ladder is hidden from their eyes. They examine the ancient works, searching for the paths of life, ‘the way they should go and the actions they should do’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">191</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 18:20.</i> to rise up to their supernal roots and cleave to Him, may He be blessed. For that is the ultimate perfection, as did the prophets, who cleaved unto their Creator their entire lives, and the Holy Spirit rested upon them via that cleaving to instruct them as to the path wherein the light resides, to illuminate their eyes in the secrets of the Torah. As King David said, ‘uncover my eyes and I will see wonders from your Torah,’ to direct them in the proper path towards the place prepared for them with the bnai aliyah…”",
                "We see here that their primary focus was constant <i>dveykut</i> with God; the Holy Spirit rested upon them as a derivative of that <i>dveykut</i>. This <i>dveykut</i> was not focused on merely in order to portend future occurrences, but rather also in order to instruct and guide them [that is, themselves<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">192</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Shapiro clarifies here that guidance was not only issued by the prophets to be conveyed to the people, but also to provide religious guidance to the prophets themselves.</i>] in the way of God.",
                "Maimonides as well [in his Commentary on the Mishnah, Introduction to the Order of <i>Zeraim</i>] says that Elijah, Elisha and other prophets did not perform miracles in order to establish their prophetic <i>bona fides</i> (for by that time in their careers that they performed them their bona fides had already been established), but rather for their own needs and because of their closeness to God He fulfilled their desires, etc…Note: It is necessary to examine that citation and include fuller explication of the sage’s words.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">193</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Based on the handwriting in the manuscript, this is either a note of R. Shapiro, or of the copyist. Either the scribe was unsure what precisely R. Shapiro wished to indicate by citing Maimonides here, or R. Shapiro himself writes that he needs to return to that source and understand it more fully.</i>",
                "This indicates that it is not the performance of wonders, nor portents, which constitute the primary, essential nature of the prophet. Rather, it is his closeness to God. This is the little extent to which we, with our limited understanding, are able to surmise regarding the nature of the prophet: he purifies his body until it becomes as a soul,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">194</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>LeNefesh</i>; that is, spiritualized. <i>Vide</i> Maimonides, Laws of the Foundation of the Torah 7:1.</i> and through this purification he merits to complete <i>deveykut</i> with God, the ‘iron wall’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">195</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For an early usage of this idiom, signifying separation between Israel and God, see Talmud <i>Berakhot</i> 32b.</i> of materiality separating him from the holy has been nullified. When his entire essence becomes attached to the holy, his supernal <i>avodah</i> is as the doings of the <i>sefirot</i> and the service of the angels. Actually, his <i>avodah</i> is even higher, as his body is incorporated in this holiness and <i>dveykut</i>. This is not a soul which soars and clings to God when only when separated from the body, nor a soul which though within a body grasps what it grasps on its own. This is a body which has become soul; and two together—body and soul—perform heavenly <i>avodah.</i> The prophet also eats, and also has children (Isaiah 5:3).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">196</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is unclear what relevance the cited work—Isaiah 5:3—bears for the notion that prophets engaged in eating and procreation.</i> These were all <i>sefirotic</i> actions—his eating is that of ‘<i>eat, lovers, and drink</i>,’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">197</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Songs of Songs 5:1.</i> as it known from the Zohar: unifications of <i>Hokhmah</i> and <i>Binah, Tiferet</i> and <i>Malkhut,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">198</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Respective <i>sefirotic</i> elements, with male and female characters. See Glossary, ‘<i>Sefirah/ot.</i>’</i> and the birthing of souls—for the unifications of the prophet were his legacy. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">199</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See, for example, <i>Zohar</i> 3, <i>Vayikra</i>, 4:1.</i>",
                "Because of all this, he did not sense the mind and will of God only with his mind or emotions but also with his physical senses, as his body had become sanctified, becoming a soul. He would see visions of God and hear the voice of God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">200</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, with his physical senses.</i> What is more, from within himself the Master of masters, the Almighty, would speak; as the Sages said about Moses, regarding the verse “ God would reply with a voice,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">201</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 19:19. JPS translates the Hebrew <i>kol</i> as “thunder.”</i> that is, the voice of Moses.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">202</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Vide Jacob Joseph of Polnoye, <i>Toledot Yaakov Yosef</i>, ad locum.</i>",
                "This, then, is that which R Hayyim Vital writes (ibid and 3:7), that the <i>avodah</i> of prophecy continues into the present.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">203</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Heschel, Abraham Joshua. <i>Prophetic inspiration after the prophets: Maimonides and other medieval authorities.</i> (KTAV Publishing House, Inc.), 1996.</i> Despite the cessation of prophecy itself, the <i>avodah</i> of prophecy continues, the <i>avodah</i> to remove the boundary between holy and profane. Whatever spiritual situation one is in—close to the heavens and the prophets, or much lower—regardless, his <i>avodah</i> is not to save only the soul and abandon the body, but rather to sanctify the body and make it a soul. Thus, the light of holiness to which he holds fast will not be hidden from his body. This is the <i>avodah</i> of the prophets, and it is the aspect of <i>dveykut-</i>- for he is connected—all of him—without separation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">204</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The prophet’s ability to receive divine communication is derivative of his sanctification of the material self, connecting his entire being with the divine.</i>",
                "God wants and desires to be connected in complete <i>dveykut</i> with all of Israel, “the people close to Him”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">205</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 148.</i>—that is, not just with the prophets, but with all of them. God’s ultimate desire is that all of Israel be prophets, as it says “The Holy One says, in this world there are individual prophets, but in the world to come all of Israel will be prophets, as it says ‘And it will be that I will pour My spirit on all flesh and your sons and daughters will prophesy.” <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">206</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joel 3:1<i>.</i> Interestingly, this verse speaks of all flesh, not just Israel, prophesying.</i> [<i>Bamidbar Rabbah</i> 15]",
                "Even in these days, everyone, even one who does not merit God speaking with him prophetically, should still perform the <i>avodah</i> of prophecy. Then God’s light and holiness will merge in everyone’s hearts and bodies alike. This is why, when it came to the receiving of the Torah, God did not merely command them with signs that the commandments issued from God (as He did in Egypt, where He gave them the first sign and then the second sign so that the people should believe that God appeared to Moses). Rather He spread forth His light until “and God descended unto Mount Sinai before the eyes of the entire nation...and they saw the God of Israel...and they envisioned God...and the glory of God (appeared) before all of Israel...”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">207</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Exodus 24: 9-11, 16-17.</i>and afterwards till “and they shall make for Me a sanctuary and I will dwell in their midst,” as the Sages expounded “it does not say in it but rather in them <i>(b’tokhom),”</i> that the Holy One resides in the heart of each Israelite.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">208</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Exodus 25:8. The interpretation, that God promises here to dwell <i>within</i> the people Israel themselves (rather than merely <i>among</i> them), is common in hasidic exegesis.</i>",
                "Behold, regarding the revelation which inheres in all of creation, God made a line via which His light could spread throughout the worlds and <i>sefirot</i>. From the beginning of the highest level through the bottom of the rest; and regarding the <i>sefirot</i>, there is the backbone which stretches from <i>Keter, Daat</i>, and <i>Tiferet</i> through <i>Yesod</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">209</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Figure F. These <i>sefirot</i> form the middle column of the <i>sefirotic</i> tree, and is thus referred to as its backbone.</i> via which the light spreads from high to low, lengthwise and widthwise. So too with His unification with Israel, “the people close to Him,” we see that He always makes a place through which His holiness and light can extend and spread from the heavens, at the place at which earth and sky kiss and where the boundary between the physical and spiritual ceases, and from which the light shines forth and spreads. From His perspective, materiality does not conceal, nor is ‘darkness darkened from you and dark is as light before Him.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">210</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalm 139:12.</i> It is only from our perspective that material is actually material, concealing the holy lights from descending and becoming truly revealed rather than apparent only via masks and contractions, still deeply concealed (much is said about this in the holy books). For us as well God made such a place without separation between the material and the spiritual, a place in which the physical <i>is</i> spiritual. From this place His holiness spreads unto us, to sanctify our materiality.",
                "On Mount Sinai, before Israel had Torah and <i>avodah</i>, He Himself prepared this holy site and bent the heavens onto the mountain. After they received the Torah, He commanded Israel that they should make the holy place—“and they shall make for Me a sanctuary and I will dwell in their midst” <i>—</i> in the midst of each and every individual. And this “and I will dwell in the midst” of each and every individual was accomplished through the Tabernacle, the holy space at which earth and heaven kiss, and the division of materiality becomes null. In fact, in the Temple the windows were made to be narrow from the outside and wide from the inside, so that the light should shine from inside the Temple outwards.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">211</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 31:17.</i> Now, how would the physical form of the window be relevant to spiritual light? How would the manner of the former’s construction affect the latter? If the windows were narrow on the inside and wide on the outside, it would also shine! But this is the crux of the matter: In the Temple, the boundary between the physical and the spiritual was nullified, with no divide between them. Holiness was revealed even in forms which we call physical, and the material was made spiritual. Just as in this place the wall fell and there was no difference between the material and spiritual, from this place His holiness goes out to all of Israel. “I shall dwell in their midst,” in the midst of each individual in Israel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">212</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The source of holiness, therefore, is the place with no distinction between the physical and spiritual realms. The prophet embodies this characteristic, as does (we shall see, below) the <i>hasid.</i></i>",
                "This was the function of the prophet for Israel. Since his ' path of <i>avodah</i> was to purify his body till it became a soul, and to continuously cleave to God, without any separation between the material and the holy, he became the ‘place’ whereupon earth and sky kissed. The prophet was a heavenly window, through which the light of God spread to Israel, filling their hearts and even their bodies. Just as when God spoke, the prophet not only accrued knowledge—that God did or did not desire something —but also light and understanding of God which filled him to the extent that the verse says (Jeremiah 20:9) “and it was in my heart as a burning fire….”—so too with Israel: when the prophet spoke to them, it was not merely to impart instructions and chastisement. After all, they could determine how they had sinned till that point through their own minds, and many know the laws of the Torah. Nonetheless, they do not want [to fulfill them], or they want to but are unable to compel themselves to do so. [How many there are who recognized their lowly state and are concerned about it, but still find it difficult to rule their spirit and raise themselves from their lowliness!] It was only when the light of God was spread to Israel by the prophets and filled them, that they were able to observe their own lowliness, and via the spirit of God which filled them they were strengthened and sanctified. This is the ‘repentance and instructions’ to which Rashi referred, and the ‘to instruct regarding the Torah’ to which Maimonides referred.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">213</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The recruitment of Rashi and Maimonides’ words as support of this interpretation is striking, though it feels like eisegesis (reading into the text) rather than exegesis. Rather than specific pieces of information or guidance, R. Shapiro understands that these prophets channeled the ‘light of God,’ benefiting their contemporaries through non-verbal revelation.</i>",
                "The prophets, mouthpieces of God on the earth, were not satisfied with correcting the peoples’ ways, that the people [merely] desist from robbing and stealing and committing abominations.

                "Not only the messiah’s, but rather every prophet’s speech was an active stream of divine fire [penetrating] the hearts of Israel. Those who repented, repented, while those who were steadfast in their wickedness were destroyed, may the Merciful One save us. God said to Jeremiah (1:10) “See, I appoint you this day over nations and kingdoms: to uproot and to pull down...to build and to plant.”",
                "How was Jeremiah to do all this? God did not grant him might nor power, but merely his mouth and the capacity for the divine to flow through him. He even caused His holiness to flow, via the prophet, onto the non-sentient world, which does not have ears with which to hear the words of the prophet and the rebuke which he issued to human beings. What does the world itself have to do with observing shabbat or the ordinances, which humans violate and the prophets chastise about? And yet, in the Shaarei Kedushah (ibid.) it says that the prophets draw forth holiness to the [non-sentient] world as well. Thus he says (Part III, end of Chapter Two and beginning of Chapter Three): “And this is the secret of ‘and I will place my words in your mouth...to build the heavens (Isaiah 51:16),’ for the human...draws life to heaven and earth...he is My partner, I create and he fulfills; and therefore do not find it difficult, the issue of prophecy and its impact on the lower spheres...on the contrary, prophecy is necessary in the world in order to straighten man and fix his deed and draw bounty to all the worlds.”",
                "And yet: even this act of filling of the world with holiness was done for the sake of Israel.

This is only possible when both the world in which they exist and their very bodies are sanctified by the influence of prophecy.

All the other prophets prophesized on the lower, filtered levels of <i>Beriyah</i> and <i>Yetzirah.</i> that the holy prophets received their prophecy from the worlds of <i>Beriyah</i> and <i>Yetzirah</i>.] and to the people in it, without the world and the very bodies of the people in it rising in turn?</i>",
                "This is the inner purpose of our Torah and its holy path: To sanctify this world, including the body [<i>guf</i>], with the holiness of the supernal worlds. It is like parchment and phylactery straps which are made on animal skin, and which become sanctified, holy objects, with holy names [inscribed] on it; and like the <i>shofar</i> made from an animal’s horn, and wool made into fringes—through the commandments, these become holy objects.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">222</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note that the term in Hebrew is <i>kedushat haguf</i>, holiness of the object, or more literally, the <i>body</i>. See Talmud <i>Megillah</i> 26b. R. Shapiro cites this concept as legal precedent for the notion that the material of ritual objects—their bodies—can become hallowed. So too, he argues, can the very material world be sanctified.</i> So too, the world itself is sanctified through the prophets, thus allowing all of Israel existing in this world to spark into prophecy.",

                "Like this-worldly items which become holy objects through the commandments, though not everyone sees them at the same level—that they are in fact sacred names, angels, <i>sefirot</i> and souls—so too with regards to the prophecy drawn down to the world and Israel by the prophets.

                "Here is the difference [between holy objects and the spirit of prophecy]: Regarding the commandments, even one who does not perceive, but merely believes in, their holiness, and performs the commandments because God has so commanded, has fulfilled the commandment (for the essential thing is in the performance, and indeed he has performed them). This is not the case when it comes to prophecy. For God’s intent when it comes to prophecy was that the person should perceive, and that there should be no separation between him and God. ‘And they beheld God.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">226</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 24:11. As a function of consciousness, prophecy must be actively and consciously experienced. If the prophet is unaware of what he is experiencing, the separation between the holy and material remains.</i> Thus, it is only when one sees his Father opposite him and He is not again hidden from him thereafter, that the Father’s will is satisfied. This is why the prophets other than the forty-eight were required for each generation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">227</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The function of the forty-eight prophets was to act as conduits of divinity, illuminating the material world with divine light. It is this function which R. Shapiro will claim is still necessary and to be performed by those who reach the <i>avodah</i> of the prophetic level—the kabbalists and the true hasidim.</i>",
                "It says in the Midrash on Song of Songs (4), that in the days of Elijah there were many prophets, whose purpose was for just that generation. Why did Elijah not suffice for them? Regarding concepts [<i>muskalim</i>] external to a person, every generation—as long as it possesses true intellect—has equal access to them; they differ, however, in their levels of comprehension, as one generation is wise and understands more, and another less. And so, each person and generation needed to prepare itself, each according to its essence and nature, in order to receive the light of prophecy. Imagine a prophet prophesying and directing observance of the Torah and commandments to his students. Among the students is someone from our generation. He will be able to understand the ideas conveyed by the prophet’s words, but he will be distinct from the others in that he will not thereby be able to prophesied, and he may well not receive as much of the prophetic light and spirit.",
                "The forty-eight prophets and seven prophetesses were like windows of the heavens, and God appeared through them and their holy words, His Holy Spirit shining from then on to all the generations, so that even now one can receive this spirit according to his level. The other prophets prepared their generation to receive and absorb God’s spirit through their efforts (and those of the forty-eight). Through them, they could see God and hear His voice, even in the world itself.",
                "In his introduction to <i>Pirkei Avot</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">228</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A mishnaic tractate, often translated as Ethics of the Fathers, containing rabbinic aphorisms. Maimonides authored an introduction to the tractate, in which he took the opportunity to elaborate on some core theological concepts, including, prophecy.</i> Maimonides articulates some criteria of the prophet, including that he have cultivated character virtues and intellectual virtues (that is, of the soul (for Maimonides terms the holy soul the ‘intellectual soul’). The level of prophecy is thus in proportion to his capacities. Further, R. Hayyim Vital (<i>Shaarei Kedushah</i>, especially chapter three) articulates the <i>tikkunim</i> which the prophet would have to enact, and after fixing each and every trace of problematic elements in his body and traits, he tells how the prophet needed to cultivate joy, even during trying times; and how extreme his joy was to be when learning Torah and fulfilling the commandments; and how he should strengthen his thoughts and cleave to God; and how after all this he should know how to strip himself of his soul (not as in a dream-state but when he is awake), and how he should remove his thoughts entirely, and utilize his imaginative faculty to visualize himself as if rising to the supernal worlds, to the root of his soul, until he truly visualizes his supernal source, with the images of all the lights engraved in his thoughts, knowing the Names and <i>kavannot.</i> And after doing a comprehensive <i>tikkun</i> on himself and revealing his soul and raising it up, he would have to know how to prepare himself for a specific time, to sit and contemplate at a time during which he desired to draw down the Holy Spirit (cf. there).",
                "These <i>tikkunim</i> vary according to each generation, and indeed according to each person and his nature, his character traits, and the strength of his thoughts and imaginative faculty etc…, to the point that a <i>tikkun</i> which is good for one person is damaging to another. The whole nation, even those who did not have the goal of becoming great prophets but merely to become the nation of God, a nation of prophets, needed to do such <i>tikkunim</i>.",
                "Since these <i>tikkunim</i> were not merely for the sake of general <i>avodah</i> but rather for prophecy and drawing forth [<i>hamshakhah</i>] the Holy Spirit, only prophets were able to rectify their generation in this respect. Prophets just for their own generation were closer to the people and effected <i>tikkun</i>(<i>im</i>) for them, so that they could receive the light of the forty-eight and seven. These were enough for all the generations, while each generation had many more prophets (as stated in the aforementioned sources), because they all needed their own <i>tikkunim</i>. Truly we can say, therefore, that our generation does not receive the effect of the light of prophecy and certainly the Holy Spirit from Moses, chief prophet before and after, nor from the forty eight and seven who words were for their generations and ours, and who function as eternal heavenly windows and pipelines of prophecy for all of Israel- because those prophets who existed for their own generations do not exist for ours.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">229</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here we see the conflation of the mystical and ethical roles of the prophet. By virtue of her/his mystical connections to divinity, the prophet raised up the spiritual level of the entire surrounding community—down to the present generation.</i>",
                "Thus, it is incontrovertible that Rashi’s words above regarding prophecy ‘necessary to all generations’- “to teach repentance and instruction”- was not meant to exclude prophecy relevant to its own generation (that these did not include instructions regarding repentance) but rather that only the teaching of these things relevant to the generations was written. Even the songs and portents therein are really instructions about repentance, because in addition to their literal meanings they also contain holiness and divine inspiration relevant to all generations, filling the ears of the one who heeds them as he prepares himself.",
                "As a brief addendum regarding the two types of prophets: when the prophets drew down lights from <i>Beriyah</i> and <i>Yetzirah</i> to this world, they had to also raise up the world of <i>Asiyah</i> so that it could receive these lights. “And God came down on to Mt. Sinai.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">230</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 19:20.</i> The Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 5a) teaches that in fact that divine presence only came within ten handbreadths of the mountain (the Throne descended down further).

As it is explained in the Talmud (Talmud <i>Bava Batra</i> 12a): “R.

For only one who was able to strip himself from himself and from this world was able to go up and reach the heavens. It was only the man of God, R. Shimon b. Yokhai in the holy Zohar, who drew downwards, as it says in the beginning of the introduction to the holy <i>Tikkun</i>ei Zohar, “permission is granted you...to go down among them...and to reveal all the angels and holy names to them;” that is, that the lights and <i>sefirot</i> would be drawn downwards so that even one who was unable to go up, if he would but sanctify himself in accordance with the instructions written in the holy books, would be able to learn; and thus the light of God would shine upon him as well.",

Torah, originally sealed, was revealed; he opened doors. Yet even though he opened, they are close, except for the wise who are worthy—and stammer in them...As for this generation, in which Rabbi Shimon dwells, it is the wish of the blessed Holy One, for the sake of R.

                "All is fully explained here. Grasping the secrets of the Torah is not of an intellectual nature; rather, <i>“God gave Solomon wisdom,”</i> as one who gives a tangible gift to his beloved, for God gave him light and holiness. The salient distinction between the generation of Rash”bi (R. Shimon b. Yokhai) and the preceding generations is also fully explained here. Even in the generation of Solomon, itself the most perfect generation, the Almighty King did not desire to reveal that much wisdom. Though Solomon opened doors, they were still closed to all but the wise, and even they understood in only a halting and unclear revelation. This was not so for the generation of R. Shimon b. Yokhai; it was God’s will that for his sake even ‘closed’ matters were to be revealed, fully and unhaltingly, to the entire generation, and not just to the wise.",

                "This is not to say that the written Torah, which is the primary portion of the whole corpus, is, God forbid, lower than the others. Rather, it means that it is garbed in more ‘clothing,’ including the clothing of <i>Asiyah.</i> Thus, if a person has the lowly inclination to steal and cheat, the Torah has descended even to these inclinations and has become garbed in them, and has been revealed in “You shall not steal, you shall rob, you shall have honest measures and weights, etc…”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">254</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 25:15.</i> Actions, not concept concepts, were revealed in these commandments—be they actions of the hands of actions of the heart, like loving God and Israel, reverence etc… These went down to the actions of the person and are perceived in them. After this, the sages of the Talmud came to reveal more to us, for the supernal light is enclothed in many layers in the written Torah and covered even in stories and narratives. They revealed the light, refracted as <i>Yetzirah</i> and <i>Beriyah</i>, stripped down and bare from more of these clothes. They somehow managed to allow the light of <i>Yetzirah</i> and <i>Beriyah</i> to be revealed even in this world, in even the human intellect. For already in the Talmud there are already intellectual explanations, accounting for every commandment through casuistry and reasoning. They already knew, therefore, the meaning of the commandments and had no need to record the oral Torah. But [they did so in order to] innovate and reveal the intellect of the Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">255</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, the words of the Torah are in fact expressions of divine existence, simultaneously refracted and ‘garbed’ in the symbols and realities of all respective levels of existence.</i>",
                "Here is what Maimonides writes, in his Introduction to the [mishnaic] Order of Zeraim: “Know that each commandment which God gave to Moses was given to him with its explanation. He would articulate first the commandment itself followed by its explanations and commentary and all else. They would write down the commandments and study its explanations orally [literally, Kabbalah, that is, the received explanations]. So too did our rabbis teach: “And God spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai, saying…so too the principles and details of all the commandments are from Sinai.” <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">256</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the <i>Midrash Sifra</i> to Leviticus 25:1.</i> For example, God told Moses “and you shall dwell in booths for seven days.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">257</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 23: 42-43.</i> Afterwards He informed him that this obligation is incumbent upon males but not females, that the ill are exempt as are travelers, and that the roofing must be made from plants, and He informed him that eating and drinking and sleeping must be done within it, and that its height must be at least ten handbreadths from the ground, etc.. So too with regards to all six hundred and thirteen commandments, with the commandments themselves written and their explanations transmitted orally. Nonetheless, though these explanations are all received and there is no disagreement about them, we are able to use the wisdom of the Torah granted us to derive these explanations through reasoning and exegesis and proofs and hints contained in the Bible. When we see sages in the Talmud disagreeing in their analyses and bringing a proof for one of these explanations, such as when the verse refers to a ‘fruit of the beautiful tree,’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">258</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibid verse 40.</i> that perhaps it refers to a pomegranate etc. Until they proffer the proof of “a tree whose wood and fruit taste the same,” and “a tree whose fruit remain on it from year to year”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">259</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Talmud <i>Sukkah</i> 35a.</i>—these proofs were not brought because they were actually confused, for we have seen without doubt from Joshua onwards that they always used the etrog in the lulav bundle. These sages were merely establishing a hint in the verse for the accepted explanation.”",
                "Why, then, were all the search for hints, and all the debates filling the Oral Torah necessary?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">260</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the law was settled, why the need for intellectual engagement with its prooftexts and rationales?</i> Because the sages were doing something new in the realm of the human intellect, so that people might understand with their own intellect that indeed the received tradition was correct. As Maimonides wrote (above), that we are able to use the wisdom of the Torah granted us to derive these explanations—specifically, the wisdom of the Torah. So too, the Sages endeavored to reveal the light of the oral Torah to the human intellect so that, in addition to arriving at the received explanation on their own, there were some commandments that they were able to explain using their human intellects. For example (Talmud <i>Bava Metziah</i> 3a), “Why did the Torah so that one who admits to a partial claim must swear an oath (while one who denies an entire claim is exempt from swearing?) Because of the presupposition that one will not be so brazen as to deny an entire claim [falsely; and so therefore one who denies the entire claim is exempt, while one who merely denies part of the claim might be lying and thus must swear that he is being forthright].” And another example, regarding the lesser fine for stealing sheep than oxen, either because God has pity on human dignity, or because of the loss of the ox’s labor, referring to the well-known debate between R. Yokhanan b. Zakai and R. Meir.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">261</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Talmud <i>Bava Kamma</i> 79b.</i> Even though everyone knows that the Torah did not issue the commandments on account of the human intellect, God forbid, and were a very wise sage come and reason to the contrary, not even a jot of the Torah’s laws nor its accepted explanations would shift. And, Heaven forbid for us to say that one who violates these laws has merely violated a product of human reasoning, for violation of both rational and [apparently] irrational laws constitute the same transgression of God’s commandment. Nonetheless, the Sages endeavored to draw down and reveal [the Torah] even to the human intellect, because they thereby removed its enclothment in <i>Asiyah</i>, and the light of <i>Yetzirah</i> and <i>Beriyah</i> were thus revealed. Thus, they insisted that a person, using his <i>Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i> (and <i>Beriyah</i>) —that is, his thoughts and intellect—grasp it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">262</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Shapiro argues that the talmudic project of attempting to understand the Law is not a legal-philosophical one designed to uncover the Law’s generative rationales. Rather, the project is a kabbalistic-spiritual exercise, designed to thereby connect the learner’s intellectual faculties (his <i>‘Yetzirah</i> and <i>Beriyah</i>’) to the Law which would otherwise only be connected to his material faculties (his <i>Asiyah</i>’).</i>",
                "This is to say that the prophets revealed the light of prophecy to Israel even in the world of <i>Asiyah</i>. Indeed, most of their words, with which they instructed and chastised Israel, regarded the world of <i>Asiyah</i>, such as observing the sabbath, doing justice etc. For they extended their prophetic spirit into even the depths of <i>Asiyah</i>. Thus, in their times—for the prophets were for their generations—these ‘servants of the Matroness’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">263</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A kabbalistic idiom for the kabbalistic masters; the Matroness refers here to the <i>Shekhinah</i>, the femininized divine presence.</i> prepared their generation and the world itself.

                "Due to our sins, we no longer have prophets to prepare our generations and we, alongside the world of <i>Asiyah</i>, have descended, and have become further despised within enclothment and concealments, especially after the Destruction, as we cited above the end of the first chapter from Etz <i>Hayyim</i>, on the verse ‘He threw from heaven to earth…”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">264</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, end of <i>Chapter</i> 1: A.</i> We thus find that the words of the prophets are closed up in in the world of <i>Asiyah</i>. They themselves struggled mightily to draw the illumination of holiness to <i>Asiyah</i> so there too the naked, supernal light should be visible, till their entire generation was prepared by their efforts to see it. Just as Moses, the greatest of the prophets, went up to heaven and brought down the written Torah, the greatest source of light and holiness, to <i>Asiyah</i>. His generation and those after saw supernal lights in Torah and in the world, in the sense of <i>“and they beheld God.</i>”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">265</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 24:11.</i> But now that we do not have those to prepare us as such, we find the light of their prophecy where they left it, in <i>Asiyah</i>, but enclothed and closed, without the light being seen as it is.

Thus, these holy ones worked mightily and held fast unto God, and drew the light of prophecy inhering in the Torah to the world and the nation which had descended. Though they were unable to reveal the divine light in the depths of <i>Asiyah</i>, so that this light would be apparent in even a bush and other physical entities, and so that one might even with his depths, his senses and eyes see an angel of God—‘behold the God of Israel sitting, sapphire beneath His feet’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">268</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Exodus 24:9-11.</i>—hearing the voice of God with his [very] ears—nonetheless, he would now be able to receive and grasp the light of God with the <i>Yetzirah</i> and <i>Beriyah</i> within him.",

It is due to our inability to grasp it as it is in its true place, as the prophets were able; nor can it be revealed in our <i>Asiyah</i>. Therefore, they revealed it in our intellects of <i>Beriyah</i> and <i>Yetzirah</i>. Since these are our intellects, only human intelligence could grasp it.

To state all this simply: Talmud is constituted within the element of <i>Beriyah</i> and <i>Yetzirah</i>, as is the level of prophetic sight.",
                "Yet truly supernal <i>Beriyah</i> and <i>Yetzirah</i>, allowing one who has been influenced by them to prophesize, has ceased to exist. See I Samuel [3:6] and Rashi there.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">271</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Shapiro continues on to explain this reference in the following lines. The divine voice was apprehended on such a physical level that Samuel mistook it for Eli’s voice. Rashi <i>ad locum</i> explains that, at that point in the narrative, Samuel does not yet understand the workings of prophecy, and still does not understand that he is not hearing the voice of Eli.</i> The entire nation received their light, enclothed in <i>Asiyah</i>, elevated by the prophets of each generation, accompaniers of the Matroness [<i>Shekhinah</i>]. Yet the sages of the Talmud wondrously managed to draw down the Torah to our lowly, simple world of <i>Asiyah</i>—though not to the <i>Asiyah</i> within it itself, within the bush, which would have allowed them to see the revelation of divinity and angels within it, and with their ears to hear a simple voice from God—so similar that Samuel erred as he said ‘<i>it is the voice of Eli’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">272</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel, ibid.</i>—but rather to the <i>Yetzirah</i> and <i>Beriyah</i> in it, that is, to the human intellect in each person, even a child beginning to learn Talmud. How much <i>Yetzirah</i> and <i>Beriyah</i> each person can grasp in Torah is dependent on his particular level of holiness and his own <i>Yetzirah</i> and <i>Beriyah.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">273</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this and the following passages, through the end of section B, R. Shapiro makes the critical point that, according to kabbalistic-hasidic philosophy—the study of Torah (including, especially, Talmud) is an act of encounter with the very stuff of divinity. It is a quasi-prophetic experience, an intellectual communion with God, accomplished in and via the more supernal and ethereal levels of the learner’s soul. One can surmise that R. Shapiro is here critiquing two camps: one, the world of the <i>yeshivot</i>, who study Talmud but do not recognize its spiritual character; and two, the ‘enlightened’ camps who abandon traditional Talmud study for other intellectual pursuits which they deem comparable to it.</i>",
                "Regarding the Talmudic sages, the Talmud (Talmud <i>Bava Batra</i> 12a-b) says that though prophecy was taken from the prophets, it was not taken from the sages. In their learning, they experienced a sort of prophetic sight, since they were lofty and their <i>Beriyah</i> and <i>Yetzirah</i> were great they were able to receive light from above, to the extent that Rashi (<i>ibid</i>) says that one’s reasoning comes to him prophetically. So too, every person who elevates himself from his own mere ‘humanity,’ and in whom <i>Beriyah</i> and <i>Yetzirah</i> are lofty, will sense in the Torah not only human intellect, but also supernal light, in accordance with his condition. This will not be the case for one whose <i>Yetzirah</i> and <i>Beriyah</i> is limited to human intellect, for he will only perceive human intellect in the Torah. With him, the supernal light, illumination of His divinity, is hidden in his intellect, for reasoning comes to him through prophecy as well but is yet hidden from sight. He understands only intellectual explanations, not the prophecy which flows in the intellect. Indeed, he has fulfilled the commandment of learning Torah and cleaves to God’s holiness, in accordance with his level. But as for prophecy—which is open cleaving, seeing the Father, as is fit for the nation of God, as Moses said, “If only the entire nation of God were prophets,” for since they are nation of God they must have prophecy within them- this is not found within him.",
                "A person may be used to engaging various intellectual matters whose very existence is lacking. Its existence is akin to a thing’s shadow—the shadow does exist, and makes something of the original object itself discernable, yet has an existence of void and nothingness. In truth, it does not truly exist at all. What sort of existence accrues to a person when he contemplates how two plus two is four? He does know something, but that knowledge is shadow-like, without force or existence. If he contemplates some innovative formula which a given mathematician has developed to ease a calculation, e.g. the sum of fifteen times four or twenty-five and three thirds,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">274</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The precise mathematical formula intended is unclear.</i> does his mind thereby draw close to that of the mathematician? If the latter is an evil person, will all who contemplate his formula became evil in turn, or vice-versa if he is a good person?! Nothing will happen to he who contemplates the mathematician’s formula, for though he has the formula in mind, its existence is shadow-like, an empty existence. Thus, as the result of such regular experience, people assume that intellectual comprehension creates only [an existence of] shadowy nothingness.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">275</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These concepts lack substance in that, though they are helpful ideational constructions and may symbolize truths, they themselves have no real ontic reality. A shadow, R Shapiro opines, cannot be said to truly exist, though the thing casting the shadow surely does. And, since the shadow does not truly exist, one who interacts it with it does not thereby interact with its source. So too, one who learns a mathematical formula—which itself is just numbers, words, shadowy ideas—does not connect with the mathematician. R. Shapiro is setting up a contrast, of course, with what he deems to be the ‘true existence’ of Torah concepts. For R. Shapiro, following Maimonides and the Kabbalists both, one who interacts with Torah concepts interacts with their Author, who is One with His Torah.</i>",
                "There are those who, though they realize that the intelligence of the Torah is not like that of secular matters, God forbid—for the Torah and its ideas are the holy of holies, while other intellectual matters are pedestrian and secular—nonetheless, they believe that the effect of a Torah idea upon one who contemplates it is the same as the effect of any other idea. Even if they are not so brazen as to sinfully equate the intelligence of the Torah to that of other intelligences. Nonetheless, since they think that there is no real effect on one who contemplates Torah ideas, as it has only a shadow-like existence, they unwilfully sin, underestimating the effect that the Torah’s ideas have on one who contemplates them. That is, they think it affects them the way they are used to, which is actually no real effect at all. It is akin to the concept of an angel. No matter how much we tell the average person that an angel is not human and does not have a human appearance, nonetheless when he thinks of an angel, it is impossible that he would not imagine something human-like with wings. Because of the imagery of a messenger who speaks and acts which has been fixed in him his whole life, despite the fact that this imagery is merely deployed heuristically. Even were we to explain the matter further—how there is in fact a drawing the light of the intellect into the mind of one who contemplate—he would not thereby be made wiser. He will misconstrue the light as well. It would be like when a more sophisticated mind has to constrict itself when explaining something to a less sophisticated mind, resulting in a [relatively vacuous drawing forth.",
                "There have been many casualties felled by the erroneous assumption that all things termed ‘spiritual’ are identical. If the science of mathematics is termed ‘spiritual,’ then people think that all spiritual matters are like it. They do not heed the distinction that mathematics has no existence outside of the human mind. It is the human who contemplates it, and even in his mind its existence is merely shadow-like, without substance. This is not the case with Holy Spiritual matters which are in fact like a soul: truly existent and substantial, even able to vivify and move the body. We must proclaim that one who errs as such, God forbid, does not believe in the holy existence of the Torah and how it is drawn forth. The spirituality of all holy matters of the Torah are <i>sui generis</i>, unlike other matters termed spiritual which in actuality lack true existence. The spirituality and holiness of the Torah, on the other hand, does exist and has substance; nay, it is the very source of existence. Its intellect is incomparable to human intellects, God forbid. It is above the grasp of the human intellect, yet the existence of its light is like that of a soul: though ungraspable and spiritual, it is nonetheless not ‘spiritual’ like the non-existence mathematics, God forbid. On the contrary, it is the source of human existence, the source of his strength and existence.",

It is prohibited to even compare the letters of the Torah to those of other languages, which are mere signs without existence and substance, interchangeable with any other mutually agreed upon signs. The forms of letters of the Torah, on the other hand, are constituted of a chain from the heavens, of the holy <i>sefirot.</i> This too seems incomprehensible, that they are both heavenly yet exist spiritually, taking physical form upon physical parchment. Yet—do not all forms in this world, from the human to the animal to plants, change according to their spiritual vitality? Even the human face changes and shines differently if he is wiser and his physical form is higher. Why should one be astounded, then, upon hearing that the forms of the letters of our holy Torah are constituted of light, <i>sefirot</i>, holy supernal worlds, beyond human comprehension, and that the physical form we see is an extension of their spiritual nature? Only a fool is so self-aggrandizing as to believe that the human mind is the measure of the possible. This is not so.

                "And so: What is the intelligence of the Torah? The parameters and details of the commandments, their effect on one another, and their rationales and hints in the Torah. Since everyone knows and believes that the essences of the commandments are holy—for it is only regarding (the Torah’s) ideas that one might God forbid err in comparing them to other ideas—but regarding the commandments themselves everyone recites “sanctify us with your commandments,” “who has sanctified us with His commandments,” etc…; and even adornments to ritual objects, such as the decorations of the <i>sukkah</i>, are holy.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">280</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Talmud <i>Sukkah</i> 9a.</i>",
                "Thus, one who fulfills the commandments and is occupied with Torah, which is after all an intelligence which extends from their holiness—not only the idea but the force and intellectual faculty of the soul residing in the intelligence of the Torah, and those who contemplate it, resides in his mind. A real, substantial, living, holy, soulful ‘drawing down’ flows inside him. One who merely fulfills the commandment also has this force flowing inside, but when he does not also study and analyze them, he is akin to a child born with mental capacity but who never uses it. Thus, those capacities remain latent and hidden, even from himself. But when he uses those capacities, he reveals the treasure within him, and his wisdom—even he himself—grows and rises. Even regarding the commandments which are inoperable today, such as sacrifices, we say “instead of bulls we will pay our lips,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">281</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hosea 14:3.</i> i.e. that speech and learning are equated to having performed them. This is only so, however, because we perform other commandments and have incorporated their holiness; we can therefore dress the commandments which to our sorrow we are unable to perform, with the force of the intellect we have accrued by performing the other commandments, as an intellectual faculty can be dressed with various ideas. This would not be the case for one who does not fulfill the operable commandments, God forbid. Even would he spend the entire day learning Torah he would be unable to say “instead of bulls we will pay our lips,” for he will be merely contemplating ideas, shadowy and empty things without the force of a substantial, intelligizing soul.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">282</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Only a religiously observant hasid is therefore able to draw down and reveal the ontic essence of those contextually unfulfillable commandments.

So too, originally the lights were enclothed in <i>Asiyah</i>, then in the oral Law the lights of <i>Yetzirah</i> and <i>Beriyah</i> were revealed. Then R. Shimon b.

Encounter with kabbalistic texts and learning is therefore encounter with divinity, accessing latent capacities for such connection within the learner and ultimately transforming him.</i><br>In the holy books, “Kabbalah” is called “the learning of Kabbalah” or “wisdom of Kabbalah.” In fact, when referring to the kabbalistic masters, the <i>Zohar</i> applies the idiom “<i>a sage is superior to a prophet</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">288</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud <i>Bava Batra</i> 12a.</i> All this could cause us to erroneously imagine that (kabbalistic learning) is merely an intellectual, analytic activity; and certainly an individual person could imagine this, as he perceives intellectual material before him when studying Kabbalah. In the beginning of the aforementioned introduction to <i>Tikkun</i>ei <i>Zohar</i>, the author explains the verse “And the knowledgeable <i>(maskilim)</i> will be radiant like the bright expanse of sky:”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">289</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Daniel 12:3.</i> “And the <i>maskilim</i>: These are R.

Permission was granted to the ten <i>sefirot</i> to reveal to them their hidden secrets, not to be revealed further till the generation of the Messiah.”",

Since <i>Asiyah</i> was thereby sanctified, their sacred imaginative faculty—which is lower than a person’s faculty of <i>hokhmah [</i>as we have noted in the note to Hovat <i>haTalmidim</i>, Three Letter, 2:1, and in <i>Hakhsharat haAvreikhim</i>], was able to serve as a chariot for prophecy to dwell upon. Even the this-worldly things which they envisioned, e.g. Jeremiah’s almond branch, Zachariah’s candelabrum, etc. also became sanctified, clothing the prophecy therein.

This is what the <i>Tikkunei Zohar</i> means when it says that prophecy is revealed via the soulforce of figurement and imaginative visioning, which functioned as the chariot for revelation of prophecy. The prophet would see this-worldly figures such as the staff or candelabrum, because the prophets so sanctified themselves until they drew the light low enough that prophecy was revealed even in the soul’s capacity of figuration, which is lower than that of thought. Everything in this world was sanctified until things in it could be envisioned in prophecy. That is, they did not merely behold prophetic visions in their imaginations, but rather their figuration became a chariot for prophecies to literally rest upon, so that they could <i>literally</i> see prophecies with their eyes and hear them with their ears. For they, their imaginations, their senses, these worldly objects, had all become holy and worthy of prophecy resting and being enclothed in them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">295</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the result of sanctification of the body, and an expression again of the notion that the prophet in whom there is no divide between the physical and spiritual.</i>",

With this faculty, they did not receive prophecy through imaginations of this-worldly things, but rather with the intellect of the Torah [as expressed] in Talmud, Kabbalah, and the <i>sefirot</i>. Indeed, it is difficult for us to understand how the intellectual faculty and prophetic revelation work together; yet then again, and in truth, it is difficult for us to understand how prophecy was revealed in the imagination of the prophet in the sense of “through the prophets I will be imagined [<i>adameh</i>].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">297</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hosea 12:11.</i> We have become accustomed to this notion since our childhood.

And yet—why are we astounded? Are not all matters of the intellect and its revelations beyond human comprehension? Just as we do not comprehend how the prophets envisioned prophecy through their imaginations, we cannot intellectually comprehend how revelation was revealed in their words. Yet, we can surmise just a tiny bit of how every student of the Torah experiences something of prophecy, though it is really different from the grasping of the prophets.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">298</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R.

My heart tells me such…!”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">299</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A rabbinic idiom; see, for example, Rashi to Exodus 28:4.</i> What is this utterance of the heart?

More than this, it is brought in the holy books [ I believe in the <i>Meor Enayim</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">300</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Meor Enayim</i> of Rabbi Menahem Nohum Twersky of Chernobyl.</i>] that when a person is learning and a feeling comes to him that he has something new to say regarding a given verse or a piece of Talmud, yet he intellectually has nothing yet to say, and it is only when he thereafter analyzes it that the new ideas comes to his mind—the previous feeling was a spark of the Holy Spirit. That is, a spark of the Holy Spirit was revealed to his intellect, and had he not thereafter employed his intellect in thought, the Holy Spirit would not be revealed through his intellect.",
                "I place my hope in God that I merit to write about all this in the book <i>Hovat haAvreikhim</i>, in which I will explain more about this, God willing. In any event, why should we perseverate over whether or not we understand the notion of prophecy without images- it is mentioned several times in the <i>Zohar</i> and the <i>Tikkunei Zohar</i>.",
                "And see <i>Tikkunei Zohar</i> (30: 74b):<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">301</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Shapiro cites a passage from <i>Tikkun</i>ei <i>Zohar</i> 30 which describes how the varying levels of the <i>sefirot</i> reveal prophecies in different forms, as explained below.</i> …Regarding prophecy, the Upper Mother [i.e. <i>Binah</i>] is closed vision without imagery; the Lower Mother [i.e<i>. Malkhut</i>] is revealed vision with imagery; about it is said, ‘I will be imagined by the prophets…’ The master of <i>Hokhmah</i> is comprehended by the mind, and thus a ‘sage is superior to a prophet…” This means that prophecy in the vein of <i>Malkhut</i> comes in visions, that of <i>Binah</i> of vision without imagery, that of <i>Hokhmah</i> even more internally, in a mode superior to the prophet. From <i>Hokhmah</i> it is drawn to <i>Binah</i>, as it says [in the passage cited above] ‘a discerning heart;’ and see in <i>Kisei Melekh</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">302</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A commentary on <i>Tikkunei Zohar</i> by Shalom Ben Moses Buzaglo, 18th century Morocco.</i> which explains that <i>Binah</i> is the discerning heart.

                "The intellectual statements of our sages were in truth prophecies revealed in the intellect, as we have cited Rashi (Talmud <i>Bava</i> Batra 12b <i>s.v. v’lav</i> <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">303</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Talmud there attempts to provide evidence that prophecy was never taken away from the sages, and notes that at times a great sage will issue a ruling and then discover this same ruling is already known as an ancient one, a ‘law given to Moses at Sinai.’ This serendipity indicates that the great sage’s intellect is informed by prophecy. The Talmud challenges this claim: ‘Perhaps he is like a blind person in a window?’—that is, perhaps he merely chanced upon this ruling, without the influence of prophecy. The Talmud retorts: “But does he not proffer an explanation?” Rashi explains the retort: “Does he not proffer an explanation to this ruling, and is thus not merely like a blind person chancing upon the right access into a window. Rather, it [the ruling] derives from his heart’s reasoning, come to him via prophecy. This is why his ruling accords with a law given to Moses at Sinai.”</i>). These statements also functioned as ‘chariots’ onto which other prophetic matters above the intellect, including literal prophetic portents, rested.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">304</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Once the mind is primed for prophecy by interaction with kabbalistic teachings, other, ‘literal’ prophecies are more easily apprehended.</i> So too in <i>Tikkunei Zohar</i> (<i>Zohar Hadash</i> 123a) [it indicates that in the end days, Elijah] will reveal himself in different modes: to some, ‘face to face,’ while to others ‘hidden in their intellect.’]",
                "What is this revelation of Elijah in one’s intellect? Merely comprehension, God forbid? No—rather, that his intellect became a chariot for prophecy (not only that that which they grasped in the <i>sefirot</i> and upper worlds was intellectual prophecy, but that actual prophecy was revealed to them via their intellects). See <i>Zohar Shemot</i> (6b) that after the prophecy about what God would do in the future was revealed to them, “Rabbi Elazar said, ‘[That of the bird, of the children,] is all supernal prophecy…’Surely God does nothing without revealing His secret to His servants the prophets,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">305</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Amos 3:7</i> and ‘sages are superior to prophets,’” –then, actual prophecy was revealed to them. And R. Yehudah concluded, “the wisdom of R. Elazar surpasses them all.”",
                "“Great is the capacity of the prophets, who liken the form its Creator.” <i>(Kohelet Rabbah</i> 2) It is indeed greatness to be able to enable so much revelation in this world until the form, that is, the things of this world, are sanctified and through them, and prophetic visions revealed. As said above, in the later generations, due to the lack of their prophets, they were unable to enable such revelation, and the light of the prophets was closed in <i>Asiyah</i>, unable to reveal liken the form to its Creator, in the forms of this world. They had to reveal their lights in <i>Yetzirah, Beriyah,</i> and <i>Atzilut</i> within Kabbalah, in the intellect of the Torah, rather than in the actions of <i>Asiyah</i>, that is, the forms and actions of this world. It was thus revealed in <i>Yetzirah, Beriyah,</i> and <i>Atzilut</i>—though not in the higher senses alone, but as those levels exist within <i>Asiyah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">306</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Each of the four worlds contains sub-elements of all of the other three worlds. Thus, the world of action—<i>Asiyah</i>—contains within it elements of the higher three worlds.</i>",
                "One who is not a prophet cannot comprehend how it is possible for prophetic vision to be revealed in the imagination and to be enclothed in the forms of this world. It is likewise impossible for him to grasp how prophecy might be revealed in the intellect and the comprehension of the kabbalists, for both of these are beyond us. Yet, both are true. To utilize a physical analogy, one person might describe a field and the beauty of its plants, while another might describe its nature, intellectually. Since they address different foci, they utilize different terms and language. Yet, both describe the same field. So too, a prophet who speaks of the chariot and animals with wings, and noises emitting from their flapping; the throne of glory and on it a human image; and the kabbalists who describes Primordial Man [<i>Adam Kadmon</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">307</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A kabbalistic term for the first and thus most supernal of God’s emanations which emerged upon the creation of the world.</i> worlds of <i>Atzilut</i> and <i>Beriyah,</i> etc… Both the prophet and the kabbalist are conveying the same prophecy. It is just that since the prophet has raised up the things of this world and sees images from this world, the terms and ‘materials’ of his revelations are of this world. He sees <i>things</i>—animals, wings with their noise—as these things simply exist in this world, unmediated by the intellect. The kabbalist, however, conveying prophecy comprehended via the intellect, speaks in conceptual language—of the worlds of <i>Atzilut</i>, <i>Beriyah</i> [ the throne of glory], <i>Yetzirah</i>, and above all these, <i>Adam Kadmon</i> [“an image like a person on it’]. Even when he conveys that which the prophets saw, the kabbalist renders them in conceptual terms. Yet, all of these renderings are prophetic. Just as the prophets did not see a truly physical person and animals, God forbid, but rather beheld divinity, so too the kabbalists did not merely comprehend the notions of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Malkhut</i> intellectually. Rather, they also grasped [these entities themselves via] prophetic vision.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">308</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Shapiro is trying to express a type of knowing which is beyond mere cognitive understanding. The kabbalists were connecting experientially and literally to the supernal realms, and were not engaged in an academic enterprise, though they conveyed their experiences in terms digestible by the intellect.</i>",
                "A corollary of not having drawn down the light as far down as did the prophets is that they were, however, able to drawn down the light from a higher source, from <i>Hokhmah</i>, while the prophets drew down from [the lower <i>sefirot</i> of] <i>Netzakh</i> and <i>Hod</i>. This is part of their greatness—“a sage is greater than a prophet” —in that they grasped from a higher root. As the Talmud says that Isaiah said “and I saw God,” though even regarding Moses it is said “No one can see Me and live,” —for Moses’ vision was far greater, through a clear glass, while the other prophets saw through an unclear one.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">309</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Talmud <i>Yevamot</i> 49b.</i> Understand this.",
                "Now, there is a difference between the revelation of the light of Torah in <i>Yetzirah</i> and <i>Beriyah</i>, that is, Talmud, and in <i>Atzilut</i>, that is, Kabbalah. Both begin in the intellect. Yet the Talmud deploys the intellect to discuss human matters—opinions, desires, business, manners of living, such as lenders and borrowers, partial and complete admissions, disputed ownership, presumptions of real estate ownership, damages etc… The light of Torah is drawn forth and enclothed in these matters, and they are like its body and clothing. Worldly things are involved in the performance of the commandments, both interpersonal and ritual. So too in Torah learning: they are enclothed in <i>Asiyah</i> and human ways, e.g. that people sometimes totally deny monetary claims because they desire money; and the laws regarding measurements of the <i>sukkah</i>. Indeed, human ways and understandings are its clothing.",
                "This is not the case with Kabbalah. The intellect here is focused on spiritual and abstracted entities, like the soul, heaven, <i>sefirot</i> and Names, etc. Even the laws of lenders and borrowers et al in Kabbalah are stripped of their ‘human-ness’ and remain bare, as the highest spiritual entities. So it says in Etz <i>Hayyim</i> Book 7, 47:2, as cited in my grandfather’s<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">310</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Elimelekh of Grodzhisk.</i> <i>Imrei Elimelekh</i> on <i>Parshat Hayei Sarah</i>: When <i>Ein Sof</i> emanated forth [<i>k’she-nitpashet]</i> ], the ten sefirot of <i>Atzilu</i>t came into being, like the locust called <i>kamtzah</i> whose ‘clothing’ is organic to and grows with it...and from the breaking of the vessels of <i>Atzilut</i> came the ten <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Beriyah,</i> and so too from <i>Beriyah</i> to Asiyah. You already known that the ten <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> are animated by one thought, as the limbs of a body are animated by one’s thought, without need for direct and explicit command…This is why the world of <i>Atzilut</i> is called ‘<i>mahashavah</i>,’ [thought], for <i>Ein Sof</i>—It and Its lifeforce—are unified in it. But <i>Beriyah</i> is not akin to one person with his thoughts, but rather as two people or a king with his servants...wherein one cannot telepathically convey his thoughts to his servants but must speak with him directly…”",
                "And so, we may understand the distinction between the literal meaning of the Torah in Talmud, which function in the sense of <i>Beriyah</i> and <i>Yetzirah,</i> and in Kabbalah, which functions in the sense of <i>Atzilut.</i> Though this revelation is not of the highest levels of <i>Atzilut</i> but rather of <i>Atzilut</i> within <i>Asiyah</i>, according to each person’s level within <i>Asiyah</i>, nonetheless it is of the quality of <i>Atzilut</i>. Thus, its light can only be enclothed in something of its own nature, like the reptile [<i>kamtzah]</i>, and its intellect and intellectual matters must be similarly spiritual and abstracted.",
                "This is true not only of the kabbalistic subject matter; the intellectual faculty as well must be abstracted—that is, only with the abstracted, <i>Atzilut</i> of the intellect, which is itself unknown to a person, may one grasp Kabbalah.",
                "When it comes to intellectual matters of this world, even though it may be spiritual and abstracted at times, nonetheless a person seizes upon its material aspects. For example, the intellectual aspect of mathematics is spiritual, but a person tends to speak and seize upon its material expression. So, when considering that 3 times 3 is nine, one imagines things like (3 x 3) coins, though he may speak of ‘three’ and ‘nine’ and not explicitly note that he is referring to coins or other physical objects which he has seen and touched. So it is with all sciences: one analyzes them with the material form in which the abstracted intellectual matters have become enclothed. And so too, the intellect, one’s pure intellectual capacity, can become enclothed in the things of this world which are more readily grasped by thought, that is, enclothed in one’s thoughts and understanding. This is why one’s intellectual capacity becomes enclothed in one’s <i>Binah</i> and understanding, seizing onto the things of this world and becoming wise through them.",
                "This is not so with Kabbalah. Regarding it, the very first step is to strip, to the extent possible, one’s intellectual faculty from its materiality, to delve into spiritual intellectual matters without any materiality. Even when one utilizes, in the course of one’s learning, terms with these worldly referents, e.g. land, throne (as in ‘throne of glory’), measurements, etc…, one must mentally strip them of their physicality and analyze their abstracted, spiritual sense.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">311</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is akin to the Platonic distinction between a chair in the world of matter, and ‘chairness’ in the world of forms. R. Shapiro calls for an understanding of ‘throne-ness’ rather than of a ‘throne’ when encountering the mystical concept of God’s seat.</i> Our intellectual faculty, when it has no material things to seize upon, will be automatically forced to reveal its abstracted intellectual force, which is the aspect of <i>Atzilut</i> within it, in order to grasp the <i>Atzilut</i> and abstracted <i>Hokhmah</i> within Kabbalah, ungraspable [otherwise] to himself and to this world. With this faculty he will be able to grasp Kabbalah, using his <i>Atzilut</i> to connect with the <i>Atzilut</i> which flows [down]. One who wishes to grasp Kabbalah in the same way in which he grasps the Talmud—through his filtered reasoning, built upon proofs and demonstrations from this worldly opinions—such a person does not even know that he does not know what Kabbalah is. He merely knows the order of the <i>sefirot</i> and parables about them. He will thus err, saying “It is Kabbalah which I study, and <i>Atzilut</i> which I grasp.”",
                "There is much to say on this matter, and on the latent mental capacity which resides within a person which one must extract, at least a bit, in the study of Kabbalah. In this book we pray to God that He grant us the merit to grasp and teach about this much more expansively, God willing. But for now, let us mention an example. We know that the <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Hessed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i> exist Above, as spiritual entities beyond our grasp. Yet one must have some sense of [this-worldly] <i>hessed</i> (kindness) and <i>gevurah</i> (discipline) in order to distinguish between these qualities. Thus, he imagines an act of kindness that one might do for his fellow in this world, giving him money. Yet money is a material object, without possible analogue above. So, he abstracts the kindness from the monies, and thinks of the [abstract] benefit which one desires to demonstrate to his friend by giving over something of himself. This is the aspect of kindness. But he must clearly know that he cannot think of this beneficence without a person giving and a person receiving, nor without giving monies or some other object. And yet, if he uses his understanding and thinks with clarity of people—a giver, a receiver, and an object given—his latent capacity for knowledge [now] knows of abstracted kindness.",
                "When one accustoms oneself to this sort of abstraction, he will discover within himself [the capacity for] a type of apprehension which is, itself, distinct from [normal] material, human modes of apprehension. His ‘apprehensions’ will be somewhat inchoate, of a different quality than his other standard moments of knowing; but they are apprehensions nonetheless rather than mere surmises. They are not lower forms of knowing but on the contrary, higher ones, on his level of <i>Atzilut [</i>not true <i>Atzilut,</i> which is ungraspable, but the light of <i>Atzilut</i> as refracted through his <i>Beriyah</i> and <i>Yetzirah</i>, foundations of <i>Hokhmah</i> and <i>Binah].</i> This is why this faculty can apprehend some abstract concepts. When one wishes to understand such concepts, such as the essence of ‘doing good,' with his normal human faculties, he will not understand anything, because he wishes to grasp an utterly abstract concept with modes of knowing which depend on instantiation of that concept in material and sensory contexts.",
                "What will emerge then is not just this type of apprehension, with which he can apprehend selected abstract concepts such as love or awe. Rather, with this new[found] intelligence, the light of his abstracted [non-material] soul will emerge, changing his comprehension of all matters.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">312</sup><i class=\"footnote\">By engaging in the practice of abstraction, one reveals one’s faculty of abstraction, a deep, latent intelligence. This newly revealed intelligence will in turn allow him to comprehend otherwise inaccessible concepts (e.g. the essence of ‘doing good;’ see below), as well as a comprehension of all things, material and spiritual alike, in a new way.</i> One who does not do this will, when learning Kabbalah as well as hasidism, encounter only stale content. Even though he clearly knows that everything Above is spiritual, nonetheless the learning will be difficult for him. He will study without understanding anything at all, or be full of questions and difficulties if he tries to understand a bit. Even were we to utilize parables/analogies to try to help him understand, he would [reductively] understand the referent in material terms as well. I have indeed seen such a learner.",
                "One who approaches a kabbalistic text as an academic work, as an object to research and analyze; and further sees that, in the commentaries to these texts, the authors explain matters utilizing explanations and questions familiar from academic scholarship, and thus erroneously suspects that Kabbalah is an academic discipline, God forbid, just more esoteric—to him we cry out bitterly “Have mercy and get up, do not be so brazen as to enter and sully God’s Temple, the sanctuary of <i>Atzilut</i>! Tread not upon the holy of holies with your dirty feet, and touch not its door-knobs with your filthy hands!” Even one who knows and believes that the Torah in general <i>is</i> constituted of revelation and a drawing down of the light of actual soul, with Kabbalah constituting a higher revelation from <i>Atzilut</i>, might believe that though our predecessors revealed in Kabbalah souls and supernal lights, people of <i>our</i> stature can only engage intellectually with these texts. He might seek to evidence this by pointing to the Talmud, which though sacred, we—and certainly beginner students—can only engage with intellectually. He does not recall that the Talmud is constituted of a drawing down of <i>Yetzirah</i> and <i>Beriyah</i> to human matters, and the Kabbalah is constituted of <i>Atzilut</i> and speaks of supernal souls, names, <i>sefirot</i> etc… Such a person will understand nothing of what he learns.",
                "R. Hayyim Vital in his introduction to <i>Etz Hayyim</i> warns strongly against this and mentions there, <i>inter alia</i>: “There is no doubt that these matters will not be understood through human, material analysis.” He further cites the warning of Nahmanides in his introduction to the Torah about this;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">313</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nahmanides warns the uninitiated reader against attempting to understand kabbalistic explanations using his own intellect without the aid of a teacher. Such a reader will understand nothing, and in fact will arrive at erroneous understandings, Nahmanides chides.</i> and in Book I, end of chapter 1, he says: “Behold, when you delve and truly seek to understand these matters, you might come to comprehend them if you God be with you as you will be whole-heartedly [<i>tamim</i>] with Him.” I think that those of whom they tell [stories], people who studied Kabbalah and went off into heresy, were these types of learners.",
                "For our holy predecessors, Kabbalah constituted a prophetic vision. But even for our lowly generation, when one extracts his <i>Atzilut</i>-level illumination, his whole grasp changes. Even human matters which he had difficulty comprehending beforehand will be understandable using this abstract intellectual faculty. He will derive spiritual pleasure from them. He will utilize this worldly parables and analogies to understand Kabbalah, but as keys to unlock abstracted comprehension of matters beyond sensory perception. When he studies lofty matters such as the <i>sefirot,</i> his human intellect will understand their ordering and emanation in this world, but his abstracted faculty will understand the abstracted, spiritual sense of these things, clearly and certainly and not merely surmising. For he will have revealed within himself the illumination of a type of knowing distinct from human knowing, deriving not from proofs and demonstrations but from knowledge itself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">314</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Shapiro here evokes a modality of study [of Talmud and Kabbalah alike] which surpasses ‘this-worldly’ modes of analysis and intellection, and involves a higher level of ‘knowing’ and, in fact, an experience of prophecy (see continuation of text below). He indicates that he intended to elaborate further on this modality, including, perhaps, techniques for engaging it, in <i>Hovat haAvreikhim</i>.</i> This matter requires greater elaboration, but this is not the place for it. May God help us to elaborate further within the book.",
                "And yet: all this does not exhaust what it means to grasp Kabbalah. The main point is to merit the spark of prophecy inhering in Kabbalah, each according to his level. The abstracted faculty which he has extracted from within is merely a tool with which to receive the light of <i>Atzilut</i>. With one’s <i>Asiyah</i> he receives the Torah which has emanated to him in <i>Asiyah</i>, and with his intellect, which is his <i>Yetzirah</i> and <i>Beriyah,</i> he receives the Torah emanated on those levels. His <i>Atzilut</i> then becomes a vessel through which the light of <i>Atzilut</i>—which is Kabbalah—is revealed. By studying for some time with this faculty of <i>Atzilut</i>, a faculty unlimited by the bounds of physicality and sensory perception, he will merit that the prophetic spark in Kabbalah, itself functioning in the aspect of <i>Atzilut</i>, will be revealed.",
                "Each person, in accordance with the level of purity of his body, senses, and consciousness, will occasionally merit to behold a heretofore unseen spark of God’s greatness—a greatness which is above the ten levels of <i>Asiyah</i>, the ten angelic cohorts of <i>Yetzirah</i>, the ten thrones of <i>Beriyah</i>, the ten <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> and the infinite worlds- all of which he has studied and knows from kabbalistic texts. Through them all, he will gaze at divine illumination via non-sensory or imagery-laden sight. His soul will tremble and become nullified, until he becomes too ashamed and awestruck to even pray, and all the more so to make requests for his personal needs. It is only since, on the contrary, God wants him to connect to Him through prayer and <i>avodah</i> that he therefore strengthens himself and does so with love, reverence, and desire for God. Sometimes the evil inclination seduces him into thinking that it is all just his imagination. Yet, we could also deny that daytime is daytime, since it is merely perceived to be as such by our senses.",
                "Why would a person not prepare himself to experience this sight all the time, if it is merely the effect of his own imagination? Why is it that it is almost beyond his ability to conjure this vision up, with it rather coming to him automatically, with him merely preparing himself to merit seeing it?",
                "The study of Kabbalah in this manner—removing the garb, each according to his level, from both the thing cognized and the intellectual faculty, along with prior preparation in the <i>avodah</i> of fulfilling the commandments and Torah study etc… illumines and sanctifies Israel and increases its unity with God. For the whole Torah is a garbing and drawing forth and revelation of God. And what is the essence of this revelation? That it enters inside a person during his learning and <i>avodah</i>. For when are Torah and the commandments complete? When a person learns and fulfills them. The Blessed One is ‘<i>Ein Sof</i>,’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">315</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A kabbalistic name for the utterly unbound, infinite aspect of God.</i> and His love and desire for the Israelite, even as a this-worldly physical being, is unlimited. His desire is not cooled until he enters them, actually dwelling and unifying with them. This is prophecy, and this is Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">316</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The praxis R. Shapiro seeks to promote must, of necessity, incorporate both mental/intellectual, as well as material/physical components.</i> Even God’s garb above in <i>sefirot</i>, thrones, angels etc. is rooted in its being garbed in Israel. For the wise, a hint suffices: The Israelite’s head is in the highest levels of <i>Atzilut</i>, and his bottom in their lower levels.",
                "We will speak further about this, God willing. For now, be silent and understood that which is said in the <i>Zohar</i>: Israel, even the average Israelite in this world, holds fast onto the body of the King. Both Above and below, they are the body in which the divine light is enclothed. In every body there are different limbs—<i>sefirot</i>, thrones, angels, prophets, seers, Talmudic sages, kabbalists, and hasidim.

                "Chapter 3<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">318</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Chapter Three, R. Shapiro explicates theoretical and practical distinctions between the kabbalistic and hasidic paths, the latter building on the foundations of the former yet involving salient distinctions from it.</i><br>As is known from the “Holy Epistle,” (in the work <i>Porat Yosef</i>), when the Besht’s soul ascended in the year 5507 [1746], he was in the palace of the Messiah. The Besht asked the Messiah, “When will Master come?” The Messiah replied, “When your springs spread forth around.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">319</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Biale <i>et al</i>, 49-50. This foundational tale of hasidism tells of an ‘ascent of the soul’ of the Besht, in which his soul went up (without his body) to the heavenly spheres. Among his experiences there was this conversation with the Messiah; one could scarcely imagine or construct a more potent imprimatur for the Besht’s teachings through his disciples and their writings!</i>",
                "Hasidism is, then, the final revelation before the coming of the Messiah, may it be speedily in our days. The first rays shining from his light, the essence of the messianic revelation, are included in the verse “and the whole world will be knowledge of God, as waters cover the sea,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">320</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Habakkuk 2:14.</i> and the foundational teaching of the Besht is included in his interpretation of “the whole world is full of His glory.”",
                "Many, even from the Torah world, persecuted our master [the Besht] on account of this teaching, claiming that he held a materialist conception of God’s glory, God forbid. Yet, our master the Besht was not only not rendering the divine as material, but on the contrary revealed how expansive God’s glory is. He not only conveyed this intellectually, but actually sparked the rise of dawn before the Messiah’s coming—for if people are not able to greet the dawn and accustom themselves to its light, they might, God forbid, prevent the morning from arising. Therefore, the Besht proclaimed that not only does divine lifeforce reside in everything in this world, with materiality surrounding and hiding this force, but even more [strongly, he proclaimed that] this materiality and earthiness is only such to our eyes. For in reality, all is divinity. You need but eyes to see and a body sanctified, and then when you look upon the world, you gaze at God before you. “The whole world is full of His glory,” even the earthy clothing and vessels. This is the beginning of “and the whole world will be filled with knowledge…” which will be fulfilled with the coming of the Messiah speedily in our says, when the earth too will be fill with knowledge of God.",
                "Previously, the drawing forth and concatenations, whether of greater or lesser quality, were directed into the vessels. But those of the Besht and his disciples were new: they entered into the walls of the vessels themselves, not by changing them but by revealing their light. For what are these things, really? If God created them <i>from</i> light, then that is what they are—the light of God.",
                "As is known, the root of the letters and vessels is higher than that which they contain, and the former emanated first, as explained in <i>Etz Hayyim</i> Book I: 4, especially in R. Gedaliah haLevi’s<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">321</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Hayyim Vital’s brother in law, and a student of R. Isaac Luria.</i> homily there. In 1:2, gloss A, he presents the following distinction: God created the vessels of <i>Malkhut</i> of <i>Asiyah</i> first, before even Adam Kadmon and <i>Atzilut</i>, while their lights were made last. That is, the vessels of <i>Asiyah</i> were created before their lights and before even the lights of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> and <i>Atzilut</i>. The root of vessels, even those of <i>Asiyah</i>, are very lofty. It was only later that they ‘thickened’ and the vessels became concealments. It is possible to understand this a bit using common sense. For what, in truth, was the purpose of the creation of the vessels? To reveal His light in them, which without creation would not have been possible. His light is only revealed through the vessels. Now, regarding human, material matters, the maker and the object made, along with its vessels, are distinct entities. In such a scenario, it is possible for the intent of the maker to be good, but this good might be expressed via painful, negative means. For example, a surgical knife, bad in itself, is used for the good purpose of surgery. This is not true with God and divine matters, where everything is spiritual and His actions are not truly external to him, as He is one with His knowledge (see Maimonides Laws of the Foundations of the Torah, chapter 2).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">322</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See there, 2:10: “The Creator’s self, knowledge, and life are all one, utterly united…”</i> If so, the vessels themselves which He has made derive from the light of His will and plan.",
                "Now, what is His will? That they [paradoxically] effect a contraction [<i>tzimtzum</i>] and concealment, in order to reveal the light of His holiness. That is, the inner essence of His will and of the vessels is revelation of the divine, and only their outward expression constitutes a concealment. Before the inner essence of His will could be revealed in this world, that is, before the beginning of the revelation of the messianic <i>tikkun</i>, only the outer, concealing nature was apparent. This continued on till, through the many concatenations, this world became physical, even [full of] the ‘other side’ [<i>sitra akhra</i>] and sins.",
                "This will not be the case in the messianic times, when the light of His inner will is to be revealed. Then, their inner essence, the revelatory rather than concealing aspect, will be revealed. Even S’M<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">323</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A euphemism for the evil archangel Samael.</i> will be elevated into a holy ministering angel, with only his evil descending. The letter MEM (signifying death; Hebrew, <i>mavet</i>) will be removed from his name, leaving only the letters <i>samekh-aleph-lamed</i>, whose numerical value is equivalent to that of <i>Havaya, Adonai</i>, holy names, as the Besht taught us. Thus, the holiness of the vessels themselves, even of this world, will be revealed, and ‘the world will be filled...’ Indeed, even its ‘earthiness’ will become holy.",
                "The opponents [<i>Mitnagdim]</i> of the Besht noisily protested: Why did his predecessors not interpret the verse “the world is full of His glory” the way he did, and why did he have to abandon its simple meaning as previously explained, to wit, that God’s glory and life-force may be found only within the vessels and the physical world?! But we have already explained multiple times, that our holy masters, flaming fires illuminating the world, were not sharing mere interpretations when they ‘spoke Torah.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">324</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A hasidic idiom (Yiddish<i>: zoygt Toireh</i>) for a rebbe’s particular mode of sharing Torah thoughts.</i> They were, rather, literally drawing down souls. Before them, the drawing-down was designed to draw down the inner light <i>filling</i> the vessel, with the vessels <i>themselves</i> only needing to be sanctified in order to receive and contain the light within them. Thus, knowledge and apprehension on the level of the simple meaning of this verse sufficed, that is, that the light and life-force existed within. Yet the Besht revealed that the vessels <i>themselves</i> were light as well, illumining rather than concealing. Thus, the knowledge and apprehension of his interpretation of the verse was also revealed, to wit, that even materiality is the light of God.",
                "In <i>Hakhsharat haAvreikhim</i> we set out to inquire: what is hasidism<i>,</i> and what is hasidic <i>avodah</i>? We were unsatisfied with the answer that hasidism is defined by enthusiasm in Torah, prayer, and <i>avodah</i>; for even though there is some truth to this, the kabbalists before the hasidim also certainly were enthused in measures beyond our grasp. And, were one to next claim that in the generation before the Besht, this enthusiasm and ardor had cooled and he renewed it in hasidism, why then did they adopt a new nomenclature of ‘hasidim’ rather than ‘kabbalists?’ And why did the opponents protest so noisily if the hasidim weren’t innovating anything? With what he has said thus far and will additionally say with God’s help, I hope to God that we will apprehend according to our limited apprehension what hasidism really is.",
                "According to the aforementioned development, from the Oral Torah and on, the lights were revealed within the vessels and, through the Talmud, within man’s apprehension, albeit an apprehension which seems ‘human.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">325</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, according to the standards and content of human thinking.</i> They were further revealed in Kabbalah through an apprehension which seems supernal. Thus, these revelations were all founded on intellectual apprehension. This is not the case with hasidism. Its drawing is not limited by the intellect, and extends to all things, even to the vessels themselves. If this be the case, with hasidism predicated on the revelation of even the lights within the lowly things, why should the body be ‘left out’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">326</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A reference to Numbers 9:7 and 27:4.</i> of that of the intellect? True, the body is lower than the intellect, but this after all is the essence of hasidism, to reveal even the light in the lowly place, and that it too is holy. This why even the body and emotive faculty (<i>middot</i>) of a person can affect [the higher levels of reality] Above.",
                "Until the hasidic period, the sequence of <i>avodah</i> was to first subjugate one’s body along with one’s feelings, and to quiet one’s emotions—indeed, to afflict oneself, in order to control them all so that they would not act at all, for they are all evil. Only then could one draw light to oneself, be it the light of his soul which he awakens and releases from his soul, or a light higher than his soul. All this was accomplished through apprehension, wisdom, thought, <i>kavannot</i> and <i>yihudim.</i> Wisdom is the essential site of holiness in a person, and the <i>kavannot</i> are the essential force for drawing supernal light. Fulfillment of the commandments fixes only the world of <i>Asiyah</i> and the externalities of the world, while apprehension of wisdom and <i>kavannot</i> fixes the worlds of <i>Atzilut, Beriyah</i> and <i>Yetzirah</i> as well as the interiority of the worlds, as is known from <i>Pri Etz Hayyim</i>, beginning of the chapter on prayer. In <i>Mikdash Melekh,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">327</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Commentary on the <i>Zohar</i> by Shalom Ben Moses Buzaglo, c. 1700 – 1780.</i><i> Parshat Vayakhel</i> it says “...and from here is a dispositive proof that one retains a piece of the commandment which he fulfills, according to his understanding.” This is to say that one’s portion in the commandments is according to one’s understanding: If he has proper intention, he is able to draw down supernal lights in correspondence to the level of his intention. Arousal and enthusiasm are good only if they come from above; that is, only in a <i>tzaddik</i> who has already subjugated his body and emotions. In that case, his awakening derives from only his holy soul or somewhere higher. However, the desires and awakening of the body are not good; they must be quieted and muted and destroyed so that they do not harm him nor impinge upon the lofty <i>avodah</i> in one’s mind and apprehension and <i>kavannot.</i>",
                "This is not the case with hasidism, which shines into the vessels themselves and whose primary point is to reveal that the essence of even the lowly is holy. Therefore, one’s <i>avodah</i> is not to subjugate nor to quiet the body lest it harm and interfere, but rather to reveal its holiness and elevate its inclinations to lofty <i>avodah</i>. Even one’s bad traits are founded upon the light of holiness. The great <i>Maggid</i> <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">328</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, R. Dov Ber, Maggid of Mezeritch.</i> says about the verse “and a man who takes his sister, it is <i>hessed</i>,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">329</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lev. 20:17.</i> that even the awakening of an evil love to sin and take his sister, may Heaven help us, is founded upon the supernal <i>sefirah</i> of <i>Hessed</i>, which has descended and become corrupted in him.",
                "Thus, it is not enough for one to subjugate his traits, for is an Israelite merely some wild animal for whom it is enough that it not gore nor bite nor damage? Is it possible for his soul to unify with God if his body and emotions are the snake’s curse, a swamp and pile of rotting garbage, which must be banished? Even his lowliness is holy, and with it as well he must serve and cling to his Father, his King, his Holy One. If one contemplates a negative lust aroused within himself and remarks, ‘is this love not from the supernal <i>sefirah</i> of <i>Hessed?</i> How can I sully it with this negative lust?’—then from this love he will arouse a love of God, a love which, though derived from a deficient love, has become transformed to a great thing, love of God and Torah.",
                "More: even one who merely envisions being aroused in love and reverence, this too is good. As it says in the introduction to the <i>Shaarei Yihud vehaEmunah</i> of R. Aharon of blessed memory,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">330</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Commentary on <i>Tanya</i> by R. Aharon Hurwitz of Starosselje (1766-1829).</i> in the name of the great <i>Maggid</i>, on the verse “to whom will you compare Me,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">331</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 40:25.</i> that even though it be merely imagination, it is still holy. For in truth, the Israelite, in his holy foundation, is truly aroused towards God. It is merely the externalities of physicality in which he is ensconced, through his actions and thoughts which are not directed towards God, which stop him. Now that he has overcome them and wishes to be aroused even through them, then it is only from their perspective that this awakening is limited to the imagination. But as to the ‘Israelite essence’ within him, it is a true arousal. When an Israelite is occupied with even his physical needs, such as business and labor—if he does them via the path of Torah, they are considered by hasidism to be forms of <i>avodah</i>.",
                "The holy Besht remarked: If one who learns the talmudic laws of bartering animals is considered to be great before God, how much more so one who actually barters and engages in other business activities according to the regulations of the Torah must be great before Him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">332</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This line is intriguing in light of R. Shapiro’s discussion below, in Chapters 9 and 10, of the challenges of the working-class hasid, and the need to reinstitute the <i>kest</i> system.</i> Long ago our holy masters informed us that such would be the messianic revelation and form of <i>avodah</i>: “For in this world, My spirit spread in only one limb (that is, the intellect, according to the commentators), but in the future it will do so in the whole body; as it says ‘and I will place My spirit in your midst.’(Ezek. 36) [Genesis Rabbah 26:6]. Since the Besht’s revelation is the beginning of the shining rays of the Messiah, its sanctification inheres in the entire body and all physicality, and not just in the intellect and <i>kavannot.</i>",
                "Thus, there is no debate between these lofty masters. For, until the Besht, when the drawing forth was only into the contents of the vessels while the vessels themselves remained concealments and mere containers, it was necessary to be as distant as possible from this-worldly matters. This was not so once the drawing forth and revelation began through the Besht, in the sense of rectification and preparation for the future world, when the vessels and all else will be fixed and their holiness revealed. At that point it became necessary to elevate these matters, not distance them, so that they too might illumine and become means for serving God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">333</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, there is no debate between pre-Beshtian Kabbalah and Hasidism, but rather a distinction due to different realities. Kabbalah addresses a reality in which, in truth, the ‘vessels’ of materiality had not yet been imbued with divine light, and thus were to be avoided. Hasidic teaching aligns with a later evolutionary phase, during which the divine light extended/was revealed in even the vessels of materiality. Therefore, Hasidism teaches one how to access and utilize that light and holiness inhering within the material world.</i>",
                "Now, it is true that the interior light of <i>avodah</i> in holy matters—in Torah, in prayer, etc. —is much greater and direct than the holiness of the vessels and secular matters. Yet, is this not the case Above as well, with varying levels of lights and <i>sefirot</i>, some higher and some lower? It is the same in this world, which is indeed a rung and refraction of God’s light, the lowest of the four worlds.",
                "The entirety of all worlds, their vessels and physicality, are constituted of divine light, each according to its respective level: the upper worlds are much higher than ourselves and our grasp, and this world at its own level. And yet, the root of Israel is higher than them all.

                "* [Note: This illumination is not <i>of</i> the light itself, by rather <i>from</i> it. The light of a candle is the light itself, and the light in the house is merely illumination from it.

This last light is weaker than the second, which is derived from the candle.]",
                "This is why Israel has free will—that is, a will which truly originates internally to a person—but the angels and things in this world do not. Flowering from the ground begins not on its own but from the rain, which derives from the clouds, [that is,] from an external cause. Even an animal, which experiences desire and therefore moves from place to place, is not the true source of its own will. It sees grass and it is the grass which causes its desire. It is forced by the grass to move. The Blessed One is the Cause of all causes, compelling the world and everything in it—for the sun to shine, in turning causing the rain to fall and grow things, each in its time; and that this person profits through some causes or God forbid one is punished or falls ill, whether it be for internal reasons or because he went to some place beset by the disease which he caught, and when he heals—it is all through causes which He caused.

Since the whole world, then, is ‘caused,’ there is no original will in it, as there is no original will in an animal. It wants because it wants, and for reasons external to it, as when it sees grass. Only a person has free will, whether or not to act or to think or to speak. If so, in the Israelite there is illumination from His light and essence, including of His originating will, while in the rest of the world only has a derivative illumination, without an internally originating will.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">336</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a connection, then, between will and illumination. As the Israelite directly receives and instantiates something of the divine essence and ‘light,’ he also receives the capacity for self-guidance and free will.</i>",
                "Therefore, the revelation in all things is completed through the Israelite, for it is through him that the essence of God is revealed. Through all else, the illumination of the clothing is revealed, but the Israelite reveals the enclothed One as well.

Only the externality, the vessel, of these traits is revealed here, while the internality of these vessels and wisdom is lacking. Indeed, the vessels contain light, but it is derivative light from yet another derivative, and is not the original source of light. But the Israelite has true will, and wisdom and traits originate in him. Thus, the interiority of these traits and wisdom begin with him, and through him the whole world is completed and fixed. Without him they are all lacking, as vessels without a soul.",
                "This is why love of Israel is so great a thing. According to the Besht’s path, and the result of his holy path, all is divine light, and the Israelite illumines from God’s essence, and all worlds are completed through him. How, then, would it be possible to love God if one does not love, with a complete love, Israel, in whom is the light of God’s essence? One must love all of the Israelite, to endeavor to see to his bodily needs, since he is, from head to toe, inside and outside, a piece of the holy of holies. In the writings of my revered and holy father, it says that one must even give over one’s life for the sake of Israel, and that such a gesture reveals one’s love and connection to God. It is like when the servant of a king gives over his life for the sake of the prince, the king sees just how connected the servant feels, that he is willing to do so not only for the king himself but even for his son.

                "Though I intend to elaborate on those in greater depth in the book, should God help and merit me to compose it, I will nonetheless briefly remark here, that as is written in the final chapter of Maimonides’ Eight Chapters—and as is cited in chapter 7 of this introduction—there are some Gentiles who say that humans are compelled and do not have freewill. This is because they sense in themselves that they are under compulsion, for “the kindness of the nations is sinful” [Proverbs 14:34]. The sages explain (Talmud Bava Batra 10b) that all good that they do is for their own benefit, like giving charity only for their own prestige. That is, since they have only an animalistic soul and nature, they are totally compelled so that even the good they do is for their own sake. If so, they have no originating freewill. Only Israel which has a holy soul above the animalistic soul and is not compelled by the latter—only Israel can compel the animalistic soul and has true freewill.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">340</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Such essentialist distinctions between Jew and Gentile are not rare in hasidic literature, including, prominently, in Tanya. See Biale et al, 30-32.</i>",
                "Now let us return to where we began this chapter. Before the hasidic revelation, the primary <i>avodah</i> was only in thought, in <i>kavannot</i> and unifications (<i>yihudim</i>). Therefore, only the great <i>tzadikkim</i> were able to draw down supernal light through their <i>avodah</i>. After the hasidic revelation, it extended into even sensory and physical <i>avodah</i>. For even the physical traits of the Israelite are supernal, then just as apprehension of the Talmud is made real only when one implements its commandments, and if one does not then the comprehension and thought and intellectual apprehension will be of no benefit in drawing one close to the holiness of the Torah—as we said above in chapter 1—for one encounters ideas but not the Intellect. So too, then, apprehensions and <i>kavannot</i> regarding the <i>sefirot</i> and holy names dependent on them which one may apprehend and intend mentally will be activated only when one implements them. Now, what does implementation in this context mean? It means expressing them in one’s internal traits (<i>middot</i>), which are, in truth, supernal <i>sefirot</i>. He shall worship God in love and reverence, and glory...Then, when he is aroused through them in prayer and <i>avodah</i> and <i>kavannot,</i> the <i>kavannah</i> is literally a soul, containing supernal elements alongside supernal thoughts deriving from the <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Hokhmah</i> and <i>Binah</i>. In addition to the holiness within himself, he draws down additional supernal holiness as well. This is not the case when he does not arouse his traits and merely intends <i>kavannot</i> in his mind. For of what benefit are these mere thoughts? How does it help someone if he imagines he is in Jerusalem when he is outside the Land?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">341</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the Israelite is entirely sacred, his traits and actions—and not just his intellect and imagination—must be sanctified as well.</i>",
                "Now in the <i>Zohar</i> and other kabbalistic works, they also issue many directions regarding the <i>avodah</i> of these traits such as love and reverence. Indeed, the Torah itself commands “and you shall love,” “and you shall revere.” Yet in these kabbalistic works, these forms of <i>avodah</i> are treated as any other type, like the physical commandments to eat unleavened bread on Passover (<i>matzah),</i> etc... We do not find explicitly mentioned therein that these forms of <i>avodah</i> [e.g. love, reverence] are themselves higher-order. Rather, just as with physical commands of <i>Asiyah</i>, they are raised up through mental <i>kavannot</i> and <i>yihudim</i> as described in the kabbalistic works such as <i>Pri Etz Hayyim</i>, <i>Sefer haKavannot, Sidurei Ari</i> etc..<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">342</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kabbalistic prayer-books.</i> This is not so in hasidic works and their <i>avodah</i>, which are filled with directions as to how to rectify traits and perform physical <i>avodah</i> with love and reverence etc…, with the claim that these themselves are the higher-order and primary <i>avodah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">343</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Shapiro therefore argues that the hasidic path represents a fuller development of spiritual practice than the anteceding kabbalistic path. The hasidic path has a special focus on the perfection of inner emotive traits, which receives lesser focus and evaluation within kabbalistic works.</i> Further, since our sages found that not everyone could do both—that is, to both engage in <i>kavannot</i> as well as develop their traits—they recommended forgoing the former rather than the [latter] avodah.",
                "As we cited in <i>Hovat haTalmidim</i>, in the second of the Three Essays, from the prayerbook of the ‘old rebbe’ [R. Shneur Zalman of Liadi]: When it comes to the detailed <i>kavannot</i>, even one who knows them should not employ them in prayer. Rather, when praying, one should intend only a distilled version of the <i>kavannah</i>, and focus on the detailed <i>kavannot</i> when learning, except for recitation of the <i>Shema</i> which does require such <i>kavannah</i>.",
                "So too in part II of <i>Sur Mera</i>, termed <i>va</i>-<i>Aseh Tov</i>, of the genius, righteous kabbalist R. Zvi of Zhitchov,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">344</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sur Me’ra va-Aseh Tov</i> [“Turn from evil and do good”], a work by R. Zevi Hirsch of Zhitchov (18th-19th century), a student of R Elimelekh of Lizensk and the ‘Seer’ of Lublin.</i> he clarifies that it was not the intent of the [hasidic] sages that we have no need of Kabbalah, God forbid, for in the aforementioned prayerbook itself it says that one should learn and be knowledgeable in all these matters. So too in <i>Noam Elimelekh, Lekh Lekha s.v. va’Yaavor</i>, it says “and this is what it means ‘One who has acquired knowledge has acquired all,’ that is, first one must acquire knowledge of all the world, and then he ‘has acquired all’ in that is will be able to ascend and arrive at the level of ‘intention of all the worlds,’ and that this should be the primary focus of his prayer, that he pray with the root of each respective prayer.” And in <i>ibid, Parshat Kedoshim</i>, it says that one who only believes that there is one sole Creator, without investigating into all His wondrous creations in the upper worlds and the <i>sefirot</i> and how they may be grasped using the holy name, is not on the true path, and is in fact on a deficient one. And, in the additions to <i>Sur Mera</i> from <i>R. Zvi Elimelekh</i>, author of the <i>Bnai Ysoskher</i>, it says “Know that only one who has engaged with the sacred wisdom [i.e. Kabbalah] will comprehend the words of the Besht.” <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">345</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In all this, the hasidic masters, including R Shapiro, hasten to claim that <i>hasidut</i> does not supersede or replace Kabbalah, but rather builds off of it. From the apologetic tone of the citations, the reader can infer the nature of the charges of supersessionism leveled against these masters.</i>",
                "According to the kabbalistic path, since the supernal lights are drawn to only one’s mind and intellect, one is only able to draw them to <i>Asiyah</i> using his mind and <i>kavannot</i>. When he intends these <i>kavannot</i>, he is focused on supernal matters, and then, using his intellect, he draws them down to his <i>Asiyah</i>. This is why not everyone could study Kabbalah; only the righteous, who had nullified their bodies, the light of <i>Atzilut</i> from above clinging to them and with their <i>kavannot</i> drawing the lights into <i>Asiyah</i>, could do so. For the supernal light is drawn down to one’s <i>Atzilut</i>, that is, his mind, and not everyone merits this. One who has not become greatly purified, with <i>Atzilut</i> remaining far above him, will be unable to draw it down even where he to employ <i>kavannot</i> in his <i>Atzilut</i>, that is his thoughts. However, this is not the case with hasidism. Since the lights are drawn down into the entirety of the Israelite, and the supernal <i>sefirot</i> are revealed even in their senses and bodies, their <i>kavannot</i> are focused on not only supernal matters but rather also focused on the interior of the Israelite—because inside him are to be found supernal lights and souls.",
                "There are thus two distinctions [between Kabbalah and hasidism] which emerge: One, that we are more lenient with the study of Kabbalah, allowing even one who has not been fully rectified to engage in this study. As it says in <i>Sur Mera</i>, in these generations even the average lay people must study Kabbalah and will not understand the words of the Besht without so doing. For since he is studying not just supernal matters but the lights inside him, he activates the former by focusing his <i>avodah</i> and intentions on the latter. From them, he draws lights throughout the all concatenations, one giving and one receiving, as stated above.",
                "Secondly, and following the first distinction, is the idea that one who cannot both engage in <i>kavannot</i> and become aroused should forgo the <i>kavannot</i> during prayer. For it is true that the one’s life force and soul are perfectly fulfilled when one also reveals them in his mind and intellect, and the fulfillment of the <i>sefirot</i> inside him are when they are revealed with the first three [<i>sefirot</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">346</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, in the <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Hokhmah, Bina,</i> and <i>Daat</i>, corresponding to the cognitive faculties.</i> But is it possible for one to have intellect and knowledge without life force? When one is aroused in holiness, then the very stuff of the <i>sefirot</i>ic lights is inside him, and he needs <i>kavannot</i> in order to reveal the <i>sefirot</i>, in their completion, the first three of <i>Hokhmah, Binah,</i> and <i>Daat</i>. Yet when this is impossible for him and he arouses himself without intentions, at least his life-force and the light of the supernal <i>sefirot</i> will be within him. He has just not yet revealed their ‘minds’ [<i>mohin</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">347</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These elements have not come to the consciousness of the one engaged in prayer, and thus the higher levels of these <i>sefirot</i> are not perfected.</i> during prayer and only engages in a truncated <i>kavannah.</i> On the other hand, one who engages in <i>kavannot</i> without awakening is like one who intends that he is in Jerusalem when he is actually outside the Land.",
                "In the holy work <i>Meor vaShemesh</i> of my holy grandfather,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">348</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Epstein, the author’s namesake.</i> <i>Parshat Ekev</i>, it is explained that in these generations we need not engage in <i>kavannot</i> of the names during prayer, because, essentially, those <i>kavannot</i> correlate to the vowels and cantillation and scribal marks, which as is known are the <i>nefesh</i>, <i>ruakh</i>, and <i>neshamah</i> [of the text]. Therefore, when one put his own <i>nefesh, ruakh,</i> and <i>neshamah</i> into the letters and words of prayer, he has already thus unified the Names, and this <i>kavannah</i> is higher than all others. It is therefore explicit here that when it comes to <i>kavannot</i>, our generation is different from prior ones, and the <i>nefesh, ruakh,</i> and <i>neshamah</i> of a person are the essential focus of our <i>kavannot</i>, not only that which is above. In the holy work <i>Avodat Ysoskher</i> on the holy R. Berish of Wolbףrz,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">349</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Yisakhar Dov Ber of Wolbףrz, Poland. 18th-19th century.</i> in the anthology, it says “Our Master the Rebbe of Mogielnica <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">350</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Assumedly, R' Hayyim Meyer Yechiel Shapiro, the third Kozhnitzer Rebbe, known as the \"Seraph of Mogielnica.\"</i> would say about <i>kavannot</i>, that whatever <i>kavannah</i> an Israelite chooses for himself is received in Heaven.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">351</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These hasidic masters promote the replacement of formal, technical kabbalistic intentions and <i>kavannot</i> with more individuated—and therefore accessible—versions.</i>",
                "This accounts for the phenomenon that over the years, the matter has deteriorated to the point that other than the hasidim, even those who know a bit of Kabbalah, engage in frigid <i>avodah</i>, while the <i>avodah</i> of the hasidim—that is, those who are truly hasidim- is warm and passionate. Because other than the hasidim, people only want and are capable of drawing down supernal lights, which in truth only the spiritual elite [<i>bnai aliyah</i>], such as the kabbalists of old, are capable of. Everyone else, especially in the generations of lower status, remained stuck on the level of thought alone, without achieving anything. This is not the case with hasidim: from their very physicality as well as their sensory activation, they are moved into holy enthusiasm.",
                "For example, an old question has occupied many great righteous ones and kabbalists: How could the Torah command matters of the hearts? It is sensical to have commandments to perform actions, even if one does not want to do them, such as laying phylacteries or eating matzah, because one can overcome one’s resistance and fulfill a positive commandment anyway or, conversely, overcome his desire to eat forbidden foods—for one has the capacity to overcome when it comes to actions. But this is not the case with matters of the heart. How then can the Torah command “and you shall love,” if he does not, God forbid, love God from his own volition (and the same regarding reverence of God)? Various answers have been offered to this question. But in hasidic works, we reject the very premise of the question: if indeed one had no elements of love or reverence at all, it would be impossible to command these emotions. But when does indeed experience love or reverence, though they are experienced for foolishness—like loving lowly things, or his reverence leading him to anger—then it is indeedreasonable to command that he elevate these negative traits to holiness, to love and revere God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">352</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Would one not be emotional at all, it would be impossible for the Torah to command one to cultivate specific emotions. However, since people are in fact emotional—whether they are aware of those emotions or not—the Torah merely commands one to direct those existent emotions towards God.</i>",
                "In the work <i>Zot Zikaron</i> of my sainted grandfather the Seer of Lublin<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">353</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yaakov Yitzhak Halevi Horowitz of Lublin, the author’s direct ancestor.</i>, s.v. <i>beit Yaakov esh</i>, he cites the Great <i>Maggid</i> [R. Dov Ber] that when one wishes to be aroused in love of God for prayer, he should recall things which he loves, like his children or even his money, and from this love he will come to a love of God when he recalls His wonders and kindnesses. He offers a parable there: When one wishes to ignite a flame but is having difficulty lighting the match and coals, he first lights some straw and uses them to light the wood and coals.",
                "In the parable, all these materials are physical and the fire is the same substance just in lesser quantity; this is what allows him to transfer the fire from one to another. But, in the analogue, how can his lowly, physical love for money arouse a holy love for God in prayer?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">354</sup><i class=\"footnote\">After all, are not money and the divine utterly distinct and incomparable entities?</i>",
                "However, given what we have written, that all of the Israelite’s emotions and traits [<i>middot]</i> and even his physicality are expressions of the supernal <i>sefirot</i> which he utilizes for lowly things which thus enclothes them—when he desires to redirect them, a burning holy flame blazes forth.",
                "Again, none of this involves new ideas which eluded the earlier Kabbalists. Rather, the revelation and <i>avodah</i> of hasidism is to reveal that the light inheres even in the lowly, and that one can engage in a lofty <i>avodah</i> using the emotions and sensory inclinations, for they are holy as well and can used for self-inspiration [<i>hitpaalut].</i> Therefore, every hasid is capable of self-work and becoming impassioned, and if it is difficult for him to do so with them he should utilize spiritual advice <i>[etzot</i>] in order to do so. As it is asked in the holy work <i>Noam Elimelekh, Lekh Lekha</i>: “Look upon the heavens,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">355</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 15:5.</i> ‘How a person can gaze upon the majesty of the heavens and the stars in their paths and come to a reverence, allowing him to comprehend the majesty of God?!’ And see there, how he instructs that one should envision himself as if he literally sees the Temple, built, before his eyes, and him standing in the Holy of Holies. Or as is said in <i>Beit Aharon</i>, that before prayer one should envision himself lying in the grave, suffering greatly, with people telling him ‘Arise and pray!,’ as we have cited in <i>Hovat haTalmidim</i>, chapter 9.",
                "<i>Hasidism</i> even regularized the practice of drinking whiskey with fellow hasidim. In general, the Besht instructed people in various techniques, as we cited in <i>Hakhsharat haAvreikhim</i>, including utilizing physical techniques designed to arouse his physical senses and inclinations for holy purposes—for one may serve God with these as well."

                "Chapter 4<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">356</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Chapter 4, R. Shapiro continues to clarify the relationship between kabbalistic and hasidic teachings. The latter represent not a change from the former, but rather a refraction of it, revealing the inherent relationship between physical and metaphysical reality.</i><br>In general, study and intellectual inquiry play a different role in hasidism than they do in Kabbalah, where the focus is on study. Nevertheless, all kabbalistic analysis and traditions, even <i>kavannot</i>, gain a new appearance in hasidism. [These kabbalistic traditions are] tightly connected and integrated with Kabbalah, to the extent that one cannot understand the words of the Besht without them, as stated above. Nothing in Kabbalah is changed per se in hasidism, but its content does become garbed in a new form. Now, it is impossible to fully detail and explain this point, and only one who diligently studies both kabbalistic and hasidic works dealing with kabbalistic matters, will understand this, each according to his grasp. Nonetheless, in the following we summarize and explain the matter as we are able:",
                "The Written Torah utilizes human idiom to articulate the divine word, in that it speaks of, for examples, God’s of the eyes, hands, and feet. The prophet Ezekiel went further and described a human form sitting on the form of the Throne.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">357</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ezekiel 1.</i> Our holy commentators explained that, God forbid, this does not mean to impute corporeality and human limbs to God; after all, the Torah says “For you have seen no image.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">358</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 4:15.</i> Rather, the Torah and the prophets merely utilized such images as figures of speech to ease comprehension, though these things surely do not exist above [as described in material terms]. Indeed, Kabbalah is full of depictions of limbs and human forms: of the Primordial Man [<i>Adam Kadmon</i>], skulls, hairs, the ‘three heads,’ (that is, the three aspects of the head), throat, neck, heart, body, left and right arms, thighs, etc...The kabbalists clarified that these we are all spoken of metaphorically.",
                "In the beginning of <i>Kanfei Yonah</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">359</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Moses Yonah, a student of R. Isaac Luria, both in 16th century Safed.</i> the Ari [R. Isaac Luria] is cited as saying the following: “Know that we are granted permission to speak in corporeal metaphors only in order to facilitate our understanding, as the verse says ‘and from my flesh I shall see my God.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">360</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 19:26.</i> But you, wise one, purify your thoughts and know that there is no corporeality above, God forbid, and that we have no permission to engage in matters prior to <i>Atzilut</i>...but regarding the ten sefirot and below, we do have permission to utilize metaphors and imagery.” And in his commentary to <i>Sifra diTzniutah</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">361</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A section of the Zohar; literally translated as “Book of the Modest (or Humble).”</i> he says “Let not your thoughts entice you into saying that in the supernal emanations there are apparitions and colors, for those who believe as such are doomed to hell...for there are no colors nor apparitions...indeed, though, their roots are above…” That is, regarding the realm above <i>Atzilut</i> we do not even have permission to contemplate, even metaphorically; it is only from the ten <i>sefirot</i> and below that we have permission to utilize metaphors and imagery.",
                "And yet, these are not the type of metaphors in which the there is no correlation between the metaphor and its referent, like the ‘parables of foxes and washers,’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">362</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, common forms of parable; see Talmud Bava Batra 134a.</i> in which there is no correlation between the fox and the human referent. This is what is hinted at in the citation above, that ‘their roots are above,’ i.e. the roots of the metaphor’s referents are above. In the holy <i>Pardes</i> 10:2 (cited in <i>Hovat haTalmidim</i>, Second Letter), it says that a person, with all his limbs, is the image and form of the Supernal, a shadow of the Supernal which has become corporeal, like the reflection of the form, pushed down to this world.",
                "We can understand this via the metaphor of a person and his soul, for even the terms ‘head’ and ‘hand’ by which we refer to these limbs refer not to the flesh and bones but rather to their capacities, that is, the wisdom in the head and force of the soul which animates the hand so that it does work. This is why we can speak of the soul’s head or hands, though the soul is not constituted of the physical forms of these things, since we are [really] referring to the force and root of these things, which are indeed found in the soul. So too, since the roots of a person and his limbs are Above, and he is but a shadow of the supernal which has become corporeal, we may utilize these terms to refer to that which is above. We do so not merely to please the ear. For, though it be true that the physicality of these limbs are spoken of only metaphorically, nonetheless there is some real correlation between the metaphor and referent. For they do really exist, though only spiritually and not, God forbid, physically.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">363</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The metaphors of the soul’s head and hand, etc… while not meant to be taken literally, are not arbitrary. Rather, there is a correlation between the physical metaphors and the metaphysical realities toward which they gesture.</i>",
                "Nonetheless, we may ask, what relevance does the physical world have to the spiritual? We must answer that its relationship is like that of the shadow to that which casts it, and like the reflection of the object. That is, the world of <i>Yetzirah</i> is related to that of <i>Beriyah</i> as is a derivation from a root category, the former partaking of the essence of the latter; or of a cause to an effect, in this case the latter being the continuation of the former, since both <i>Yetzirah</i> and <i>Beriyah</i> are spiritual. But this is not true of the world of <i>Asiyah</i> and of the human vis a vis the upper worlds, since the former are physical, all of which’s inclinations are natural, while the upper worlds are spiritual. Thus, they are not of the same sort, and their relationship is merely like the shadow of “nothing” to “something,” which are quintessentially different from each other.",
                "Since this world, including the human [who is of it], is like merely the shadow of the upper worlds, with real existence only above, the effects of one’s <i>tikkunim</i> and <i>yihudim</i> thus take place only Above. This [then] casts shadows and reflections here in this world. A person can only have an effect on the world Above using his thoughts and wisdom derived from his soul, which partakes of the world Above. From there, he draws forth illumination to this world, to the commandments he performs in <i>Asiyah</i>. This drawing down to this world corresponds to the source of his action above, and again is merely like a shadow. This is dependent on the level of each <i>tzaddik</i> and kabbalist; our predecessors about whose greatness we cannot imagine, the effect of their <i>yihudim</i>, <i>kavannot</i>, <i>tikkunim</i> of the luminaries and names and <i>sefirot</i> etc… was so great that even that which they drew down into this world was a great revelation. For those smaller than they, whose effect above was smaller, so too was their drawing down. Most of the effect of this drawing down was in the grasping and intentions of his soul’s intellect which derives from above. From there, it was drawn down to this world and our actions, like as a shadow [cast by a form]. If he does not engage in <i>kavannot</i>, he will only rectify the externalities of the world by his performance of the commandments, as cited above in the name of Etz <i>Hayyim</i> and <i>Mikdash Melekh.</i>",
                "This is the case regarding the physical <i>avodah</i> of observing the commandments mandated by the Torah. Indeed, the world of <i>Asiyah</i> was sanctified through the written Torah which was drawn down to <i>Asiyah</i>, and even though <i>Asiyah</i> was elevated through the prophets and ‘children of prophets.’ Nonetheless, now, with the decline of the generations and after the destruction [of the Temple], the primary effect of one’s performance of the commandments is Above, in one’s thoughts, and drawn from there to <i>Asiyah</i>. This is all the more true when one wishes to perform bodily <i>avodah</i> in optional performances not mandated in the Torah, in order that all his thoughts, speech, and actions become <i>avodah</i> to God, through them effecting <i>tikkunim</i> and <i>yihudim</i> Above. This cannot be accomplished with his body and inclination but only with his thoughts, leaving him to merely subjugate and afflict his body.",
                "Any use he makes of his body and senses is only in order to thereby arouse his soul, as we cited in <i>Hovat haTalmidim</i> in the [introductory] ‘Speech with Educators and Parents,’ citing <i>Pardes</i> 10:1, that one who wishes to affect <i>Hessed</i> he should wear white, on <i>Gevurah</i>, red, etc… Since the soul is affected by colors, it becomes aroused and in turns arouses the spirit, etc.",

He then cites the words of <i>Pardes</i> above, implying that one’s actions done with one’s body are merely performed in order to arouse the soul via the physical sensations. But to directly have effect Above, the body can only accomplish but a little.",
                "This is the path of all learning and apprehension in kabbalistic matters, in which one comprehends only things found Above, like variations of Names<i>, sefirot</i>, hands, feet etc…—that is, these worldly things. These are all employed metaphorically, not in the erroneous sense we articulated above, of metaphors without correlation to the referent, employed only to please the ear. Rather [there is a correlation], like that of a shadow to that which casts it.",
                "All this is an abbreviated presentation of the path of Kabbalah (as much as we have permission to contemplate), until the [period of the] revelation of hasidism. Yet after the Besht revealed the beginning of the illumination of the light of the Messiah and the future rectification, and revealed the holiness of the vessels of the world of <i>Asiyah</i> and the lower levels, it emerged that there is no greater difference nor distance between <i>Asiyah</i> and the upper worlds than between one upper world and another. Just as the world of <i>Yetzirah</i> derives from that of <i>Beriyah</i>, the top of the former constituting the bottom of the latter, so too <i>Asiyah</i> derives from <i>Yetzirah</i>, its head constituting the latter’s bottom.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">365</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hasidism reveals the connection between the higher and lower worlds, from the most ethereal to the most grossly material. The hasid is thus ultimately capable of effecting all worlds using modalities of praxis ranging from the intellectual, to the emotional, and even to the physical.</i> This is not merely in the sense of the distinction between the shadow of a thing and its reflection; rather, God created four worlds, all holy and distinguished only by their levels, one above, one below, one distant. Therefore, though we may not speak about that which is above the <i>sefirot</i>, why shouldn’t we do so about the <i>sefirot</i> forward [i.e. below], speaking of them regarding the world of <i>Asiyah</i> as we do about <i>Yetzirah</i> and <i>Beriyah</i>, and vice-versa?",
                "And why should we force ourselves to claim regarding descriptions of the Divine holiness, in the Torah and prophets, Talmud and Zohar, that they are mere metaphors employed to facilitate our understanding, as they are called by the names of limbs of the body and other parts of this world? Why should we not say that there is truth conveyed in this terminology, and that these are what they are called both Above and below? Are not the things of this world holy as well, divinity and levels of ‘His whole glory fills the earth?’ For, in each of the four holy worlds, there are levels and distinctions in holiness, and they are called by the same terms.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">366</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note here the dramatic shift in use of language between kabbalistic and hasidic nomenclature. R. Shapiro seems to insist on this point because it stresses the immanence of divinity within physicality, and the relevance of descriptions of the <i>sefirot</i> to the phenomenal world of <i>Asiyah</i> in which he and his readers live.</i>",
                "Shall it be that since, to the eyes of the corporeal human the world and human appear to be corporeal as well, these things are actually [entirely] corporeal, to the extent that we cannot use these terms to describe the upper worlds? If one has poor eyesight or is mentally unstable and a human appears to him to be an ape, but out of habit still calls this being ‘human’—would we say that this term is an inaccurate one for this being, and say that every person to whom this term is employed is thus derogatorily referred to as an ape? The dignified valence of the term remains in place, and the onus is on the ill person to be healed until he can accurately behold the human in his ‘form and image.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">367</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 1:26.</i> Since the Besht taught that when we gaze at the world we see God, each seeing divinity in the world according to his sanctification, why should we not call the upper worlds according to their true names, as in this world as well these distinctions and levels pertain? Is it because of dulled eyes or unstable mind which do not perceive the world as it truly is? But we know that in truth all is divinity, and these simply do not see accurately, and the onus is on them to raise their sight to truly see God’s world.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">368</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In truth, according to hasidism, the material world itself is constituted of divinity, as are the ‘upper worlds.’ As such, it is appropriate to utilize the same terminology to describe both worlds, as long as one recognizes that the significations are related yet distinct. The material ‘head’ is related to the supernal ‘head,’ <i>mutatis mutandis</i>.</i>",
                "The world of <i>Asiyah</i> and its contents are holy as well, constituted of rungs of holiness, though this world the last [i.e. lowest] of the four worlds. Now, it is true that <i>Yetzirah</i> is ‘less’ than <i>Beriyah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i> less than <i>Yetzirah</i>; but just as we do not claim that the <i>sefirot</i> of <i>Yetzirah</i> and its levels of holiness—such as its angels—are merely metaphoric, but rather understand that they actually exist, so too the supernal <i>sefirot</i> and rungs and names in the world of <i>Asiyah</i> exist actually exist. All we can say is that it is the last of the four worlds, but we cannot say that everything <i>in</i> this world is last. For, on the contrary, all of the four worlds were created only for the sake of the Israelite, who exists in this world.",

When we learn Kabbalah as presented by the hasidic <i>tzaddik</i>im, especially in the works of the <i>Maggid</i> and his student, my grandfather the Kozhnitzer <i>Maggid</i>, we often see that they simultaneously speak of the lofty kabbalistic matters as expressed both Above and within a person—not metaphorically, nor in the sense of ‘this sort of thing occurs within a person as well;’ rather they speak of it all in one utterance, as if the human is Above and the upper worlds are in the human.

                "Chapter 5<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">377</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Chapter 5, R. Shapiro distinguishes between two primary hasidic paths, those of Habad intellectualism and Karliner simplicity and passion. He continues in part B to paint a portrait of the metaphysical connection between a rebbe and his hasidim, of their mutual effect on one another’s spiritual capacities and of their responsibilities one to the other.</i><br>With this, and even granted our limited understanding, we can understand a bit regarding the divergence of paths within hasidism which were manifest already at the beginning of the movement. [This occurred even] though all these paths originated from the same source: the revelation of the Besht. They established their entire holy path on intellectual apprehension, rather than on <i>kavannot</i> and <i>yihudim</i> of letters and Names and the [notion of the various worlds] alone. From there, their path then affected not only their thoughts, but on the contrary put its stamp on all the <i>kavannot</i> and <i>yihudim</i> of the Ari which they engaged in. All took the form of hasidism.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">378</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hasidism differs from Kabbalah in its primary emphasis on the ‘<i>avodah</i>’ of thought and intellection. However, its <i>avodah</i> extends to the mיtier of the kabbalist—of <i>yihudim</i> and <i>kavannot</i>, et al—though these practices take on new form and nuance within the hasidic context.</i>",
                "For example, as is known regarding the higher and lower unification which are explained and revealed in the <i>Tanya</i> (II, Chapters 1-7)—[which describes] not merely the <i>kavannot</i> of the letters and forms of the upper worlds but also the concatenation of God’s light in this world, and not just thoughts but also service with the whole body. This is the case with the many <i>yihudim</i> and combinations in the <i>Zohar</i> and Ari.",
                "In hasidism, the path of <i>avodah</i> via imaginative thought [<i>mahshavah</i>] focuses on comprehension of supernal matters. This entails not merely performing mental combinations and <i>yihudim</i> of Names and letters, but also engaging in manifold thoughts of God’s greatnesses, which precedes His Names and their letters. [Further, i]t entails not merely thoughts of His greatness in the supernal worlds, but also of His greatness in <i>this</i> world, since an influx of holiness and revelation of His greatness is drawn into this world as well through the revelation of the Besht. Furthermore, ever since our sages drew forth and revealed the light in the vessels, the <i>avodah</i> of thought and apprehension focuses not only on kabbalistic matters, but also on the simple meaning of the Torah, of bartering animals and the like. It is true that the <i>Zohar</i> refers to the simple meaning of the Torah as sackcloth and its kabbalistic meanings as more minimal, purer garbing, in the sense of “You have removed my sackcloth…”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">379</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalm 30:11. Compare <i>Zohar</i> 3:152 for its privying of inner layers of meaning over the outer layers, akin to outer layers of clothing.</i> Yet, now the vessels and sackcloth have become sanctified and are garbs of holiness, and great is the level of one who embraces the King even through his garb.",
                "It says in <i>Tanya</i> 1:4 that even when one learns and thinks about the simple meaning of the Torah, there is no difference in his level of closeness and cleaving to the King if he embraces Him through one garb or many, since regardless the King’s body is within. The <i>avodah</i> of his thought and unification in this is so great that it says there (ibid. chapter 5) that the level of the commandment of knowing and grasping Torah is wondrous and great beyond measure, more than commandments of action and even ‘speech,’ and even of the commandment of ‘learning’ Torah oral [rather than mentally] etc…",
                "The specific form of the hasidic path is apparent even in the study of Kabbalah in the <i>Zohar</i> and Ari. In the hasidic path, [we see the attempt] to make these matters accessible to even the simple, ‘human’ intellect, which is capable of grasping only this-worldly, quotidian matters, will also be able to grasp kabbalistic matters (as we have elaborated on elsewhere].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">380</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even when studying classic kabbalistic texts, the hasid engages in a uniquely hasidic hermeneutic, correlated with general hasidic theology.</i>",
                "Such is the <i>avodah</i> of thought. There is a similar focus in the <i>avodah</i> of the heart, of generating feelings of love and reverence and self-nullification, of arousing the soul of holiness in general to serve God with a burning spirit and to cleave to Him. In the hasidic path, the manner of awakening is through thought and contemplation, for: a) the <i>avodah</i> of thought and knowledge, of delving into God, is very great, and through it one effects connection and cleaving to God. For knowledge (<i>daa</i>t) connotes connection, as in <i>“and Adam knew his wife…”</i> <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">381</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 4:1.</i> This is the ‘Eden’ of knowing and understanding and grasping with one’s intellect and understanding that which one can of the light of <i>Ein Sof</i>, through the <i>Hokhmah</i> and <i>Binah</i> of God which illuminate creation (ibid. 39, 42). Further, b) since the mind is the source and site of the soul of holiness, drawn from there to the heart, one’s soul is aroused through the mind’s thought. Each person’s [measure of] love and reverence correlate with one’s knowledge of God (ibid. Chapter 44). Furthermore, even if one’s heart is not aroused into a revealed, visceral love and reverence of God, if one’s decides nonetheless to fulfill the Torah by mentally understanding that he <i>needs</i> to love and revere Him, these mental understandings will be rendered as revealed, visceral love and reverence, and his soul considered as one which thirsts for God because of the burning coals of love in his heart (ibid. Chapter 16). [In short, t]he foundation of all divine service is in the mind, even the <i>avodah</i> of ‘turning from evil,’ since the soul is aroused and the evil inclination distanced through the mind, and a little light pushes aside much darkness. For it is man’s nature for his mind to rule over his heart (ibid chapter 12).",
                "The second path of hasidism is that of <i>avodah</i> through simple force (<i>koakh</i>) and belief.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">382</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here R. Shapiro introduces his reader to the second favored path of hasidism, that of Karlin, with its focus on simple belief and mighty effort.</i> The holiness of an Israelite’s soul, which each must reveal from within himself and the holiness which he must draw down from Above, is much higher than a person’s knowledge and grasp or even his native capacities. Just believe that God created the worlds so that the Israelite should serve (H)im and with His unlimited power wondrously placed this supernal loftiness within the <i>avodah</i> of an Israelite. Therefore, one is able to reveal all this holiness through his <i>avodah</i> performed with force and effort and ‘<i>harvanya</i>’ (to use the phrase of the Karlin <i>tzaddik</i>im),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">383</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A Yiddish term for effort and growth.</i> for only <i>avodah</i> performed with dedication and sacrifice is complete.",
                "The more a simple <i>avodah</i> is performed earnestly, the greater it is in this path. As the author of <i>Beit Aharon</i> said, he is jealous of the horses upon which people ride to get to a circumcision. As far as our limited understanding allows, we can understand that this is because their <i>avodah</i>- to travel for this great mitzvah—is simple, performed with force and earnestness.",
                "Even the Kabbalistic matters which these sages discuss is in fact entirely focused on <i>avodah</i>, primarily the simple form of <i>avodah</i>. Through such holy <i>avodah</i>, the holy soul within an Israelite becomes aflame. This is the vitality and passion he experiences in <i>avodah</i>, as well as the pleasure of Eden which is borne out of <i>avodah</i> performed in this world (<i>Beit Aharon</i>, in the anthology of sayings from R. Shlomo of Karlin). Yet, an Israelite should not pray for such passion, for his focus should be on the <i>avodah</i> itself. Let one enter into such states through prayer and <i>avodah</i>, and the passion will emerge on its own (see ibid, comments on Pentecost). As it says, “For the matter is very close to you, in your mouth and heart, to do it<i>-</i>”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">384</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 30:14.</i> first it is in your mouth, and then your heart; one should not wait for the heart’s arousal. Rather, if one finds that he can only pray with his mouth, then he should begin with that, and through such prayer his heart will awaken and become aroused. Even if he feels no vitality, but rather feels like an ox with a yoke or a donkey with a saddle, let him experience pleasure from this as well, and through this he will come to feel the ‘taste’ of <i>avodah</i> (ibid, <i>Shabbat Shuvah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">385</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The ‘Sabbath of Repentance,’ i.e. the Sabbath preceding the Day of Atonement.</i>). This path’s instruction to come to awakening through simple <i>avodah</i> extends to the beginning of one’s <i>avodah</i>, that is, turning away from negative traits, which also must be done through proactive <i>avodah</i>.",
                "The notion of differentiated paths within hasidism can be understood a bit by considering the well-known adage of the sages that Abraham’s <i>avodah</i> was in the aspect of <i>Hessed</i> and love, Isaac’s in <i>Gevurah</i> (might) and reverence, and Jacob’s in <i>Tiferet</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">386</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Zohar</i> III: 179b.</i> Though Abraham also had reverence and Isaac had love, the <i>principle</i> form of Abraham’s <i>avodah</i> was that of love, and even Isaac’s love took the form of reverence, and Jacob’s <i>Tiferet</i> was a combination of love and reverence. So too with regard to the <i>sefirot</i>, as is known: though they are one entity, a distinct form is revealed in each one. And so, though all hasidic paths incorporate <i>avodah</i> with the body and especially of the heart—that is, prayer—along with study of revealed and hidden aspects of Torah, accompanied by revelation of the soul—nonetheless, in one path the mental aspect informs all else, while in another a simple, wholesome <i>avodah</i> informs study of the simple meaning of Torah and Kabbalah.",
                "To sum up the matter acording to our limited understanding: In one hasidic path, the type of revelation privileged in Kabbalah centered in <i>Hokhmah</i>, <i>Binah</i>, and <i>Daat</i> was dominant, and also in hasidism concerning revelation in the vessels [the dominance of the intellect] was evident. In another path, the manner of revelation in hasidism emerging from <i>Hokhmah</i> and Kabbalah was also prevalent, while extending this revelation to the vessels themselves. In yet a third path, these two orientations are combined. In truth, when we examine the works of our sages, we see these distinctions expressed there as well. For when those who champion the holy path in which the mind is strengthened speak of the world, they tend to focus on the question of its [ontic] existence [<i>yeshut</i>], which appears to exist on its own. That is, they often speak of how ‘existence’ does not, in fact, exist. They found totally convincing the Besht’s contention that divine self-limitation (<i>tzimtzum</i>) is illusory, as in the parable of the king who created the optical illusion of walls separating him, yet when one girded himself to approach the king he discovered that in truth there were no concealing walls at all.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">387</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See R. Moses Hayyim Ephraim of Sudilkov’s <i>Degel Makhaneh Ephraim</i> to Deut. 31:18.</i> They also understood well the words of the <i>Maggid</i>, that the shells (<i>kelipot</i>) are not real, and are merely ‘garbing.’ The notions of the ‘other side’ and of the world and even of a human being are all but apparitions. All existence in this world is but a shell, including that of a person with even his good traits are but the shining shell (<i>kelipat nogah</i>; see <i>Tanya</i> I: 1, 29). Only the soul residing in the mind of the average person, (excepting the truly righteous) is holy, and is revealed only occasionally during prayer. All this is different from the other hasidic path of simple <i>avodah</i>.",
                "Though the sages of this path speak of fighting one’s evil inclination and destroying the ‘other side,’ the general spirit of this path is one which affirms the veritable existence of this world. This world truly exists, constituted of and suffused with divinity and holiness, as we cite below in chapter 7 from the great and holy R. Asher of blessed memory, that God exists down below, on the lowly earth, etc… This is all the more so regarding the Israelite, who is entirely holy—even his negative traits—and all emerge from supernal <i>sefirot</i>. It is only because he does not utilize them correctly that they become obstacles and he falls through them, as we said above regarding “and a person who takes his sister...it is <i>hessed</i>.”",
                "We behold in these two holy paths the following wonder: In the path of the mind, though they do not demand fasts, especially nowadays as the generations have weakened and it is difficult to observe all the fasts written about in the works of Ari regarding all the manners of atonement—nonetheless, an especially religious individual (<i>baal nefesh</i>) who wishes to rectify himself is commanded to fast (Letter on Repentance, Chapter 3, end of <i>Tanya</i>). On the other hand, those who walk the path of simple <i>avodah</i> in our generations are totally distant from fasts, as it says in the anthology of Beit Aharon:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">388</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a collection of material from three early rebbes of the Karlin dynasty, including sermons published in Yiddish.</i> “Fasts and penitential practices only help us with three conditions: [they work for] a healthy person, an [especially] coarse sin, G-d forbid, and [during the winter,] when the days are short.

And we only hold this if [the faster] will not fall into a depressive or melancholic state, G-d forbid... [O]ne can be pushed away from holiness, G-d forbid, when one is pressed (<i>meytsr</i>) with fasts and asceticism. “Whatever side you take”- one cannot go along an upright path if one’s fasting and mortifications are not also straight.

And when they do so, not only when they hear words of Torah but rather the entire time they are there becomes an <i>avodah</i> and act of unification.",

Even the consciousness of Father and Mother, which are <i>Hokhmah</i> and <i>Binah</i>, which extend to the six lower sefirot—<i>Tiferet</i> and her traits—will not be pulled downwards unless they are joined via the central bar, because <i>Hokhmah</i> and <i>Binah</i> and their lights are not units of intellectual matter but rather the very soul and light of the intellect. When the rebbe is unified with his hasidim, lights thereby become unified. He illuminates them and they increase his light; and if they are unable to do this, nonetheless their hearts’ desire for him arises to him and becomes feminine waters <i>[mayim nukvin</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">394</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A kabbalistic term for divine illumination received passively, as opposed to ‘masculine waters’ generated actively by the practitioner.</i> to arouse in him an abundance of light, both for himself and for them. They become unified, and they experience increased joy and yearning, thought they know not what it is nor from whence it comes. But the unification is that which increases their light.",
                "All the rebbe’s thought, will, nobility and inner work effects his hasidim, while all their yearning, even one’s bitterness over his lack of desire [to improve and ascend from his] lowliness, affects the rebbe.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">395</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this rather dense passage, R. Shapiro draws an analogy between the inner dynamics of the <i>sefirot</i> and the dynamic between rebbe and hasid. To summarize simply and succinctly: In the former case, the lower six <i>sefirot</i> cannot receive overflow of light from the higher ‘intellectual’ <i>sefirot</i>, nor can <i>Tiferet</i> bestow light onto the five <i>sefirot</i> dependent on her, unless they are near and united to one another. So too the <i>rebbe</i> cannot bestow nor receive light to and from his hasidim unless they are all united and near to one another. Hence the necessity of the rebbe and hasidim gathering together, for their mutual benefit. I thank James Jacobson-Maisels for his assistance in decoding this passage.</i> All this occurs ‘without speech or words.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">396</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Psalm 19:3.</i>",
                "It is written in the book <i>Maor vaShemesh</i> on Parshat <i>Titzaveh</i> that when hasidim come to visit their rebbe, seeking the path of God, benefit accrues both to them and to the rebbe. This benefit is not only in the additional holiness added but also in new ideas in Torah and advice [<i>etzot</i>] and practices as to how to serve God. Their connection has an effect even after they have ‘returned to their tents,’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">397</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deut. 5:27.</i> and they are no longer physically proximate to each other. Their thoughts and will are elevated through the effect of their rebbe on them, and those of the rebbe through their effect. This is why sometimes when a rebbe says Torah, one hasid says ‘he directed these words to me’ and another hasid says the same, though sometimes the rebbe does not intend them for any particular person at all. But because their thoughts had an effect on their rebbe’s soul, the ‘shadow’ of their thoughts may be seen in his thoughts and Torah, to the point that each sees himself in them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">398</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Avodat Yisrael</i> is a work of homilies on the Torah and on <i>Pirkei Avot</i>, by the Maggid, R. Israel of Kozhnitz.</i> * [Note: Avodat Yisrael on Avot 2:7 s.v. <i>marbeh etzah]</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">399</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this passage, R. Israel explains how a rebbe is able to speak to the heart of his hasidim and offer guidance (<i>etzot</i>) on an individual basis, even if the hasid has not disclosed his particular situation to the rebbe.</i>",
                "This is why the rebbe owes it to them to say words of Torah, since those words partly belong to them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">400</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is not only the ‘student’ who has obligations, then. The teacher (rebbe) too is obligated by his relationship with his disciples to expose them to the Torah which is, in reality, already theirs.</i> It is written in the holy books that saying Torah and offering spiritual direction involves a spark of prophecy. Just as God would issue prophecy in accordance with specific individual and their needs, so too even when a rebbe sits alone in his room, contemplating and writings words of Torah, sometimes his lines of thought are affected by the people he is connected to. At times, when he wishes to issue directions or advice to people in their respective circumstances, specific hasidim will arise in his mind, each with their respective circumstances, and arouse his mind to discover a remedy for them. Then <i>etzot</i> and direction arise within him, and he records them in a book. Even when the rebbe examines himself—the vagaries of his own rising and falling, how he arose easily and then only with difficulty, then falling or another time remaining upright; or when he goes deep inside to rectify himself—observing how things requires continuous rectifications, each grain of sand revealed within himself, identifying each page on its own, isolating each thought and each splinter of his traits, identifying the root of each deficiency and how to rectify it, how to reveal his light and elevate it—through these efforts as well, the sparks of his hasidim are lit, their situations improve, and light and direction comes to them as well. Even the lowest among them can utilize these directions. Why? Because they are woven into his soul, and are present in his soul and its processes.",
                "After the hasidim come to the rebbe to receive hasidism, they feel changed, each in his own way. They have awakened somewhat from the non-sacred which had become strengthened in them and their souls, and even their bodies arise from their fallings and sleep and they become as living souls. Now, there are some visits in which the hasid does not feel the benefit. He might feel that he had not spoken of all his spiritual and physical needs to his rebbe. He might even have a smidge of doubt that his rebbe has paid him no heed and has not empathized with his sorrows, and therefore he did not fully express his complaints or needs. He is thus even more worried about himself. Yet these two thoughts are false. For the opposite is the case: since now a more inner yearning has been aroused, and after his elevation during his travels he sees his lowliness more clearly, his worry from before his travels have remained and even become heavier. Since he now feels a heavier worry, as it appears to him as if his travel had no effect, since he did not express all his needs or his rebbe did not empathize with his sorrows.",
                "God forbid for one to sinfully hold such a suspicion! Broken-heartedness and lowliness of spirit due to travails have an effect on their rebbe. When God forbid one suffers even physically, a rebbe’s spirit falls, and it says ‘Am I not responsible for this?’ Indeed, he might be ashamed to look others in the face because one of his hasidim suffers.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">401</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Perhaps R. Shapiro writes autobiographically here and in the following lines, of his own perceived failing as spiritual director and teacher of his hasidism<i>.</i></i> His understanding of his responsibilities is no mere intellectual one, but rather [deeply emotional], as his spirit breaks on its own accord, and he says ‘How much good and joy might reach a hasid connected to a rebbe such as I?!’ And when the rebbe then prays for him, he does so as one responsible for some harm, and he pleads that he merit to repair that which he had rendered crooked and that God should redeem him from his sorrow. When God helps one his hasidim for whom he has prayed, he experiences no thoughts of inflated ego, [not] thinking that he caused the hasid’s salvation due to the merit of his own Torah and prayer.",
                "It says in <i>Meor vaShemesh</i> on thebeginning of <i>Parshat Miketz</i>, that even when a <i>tzaddik</i> sees clearly that God has saved one for whom he prayed, he should wonder, why would God listen to the prayers of an exceptionally despicable and deficient person such as himself?",
                "Even when God assists a rebbe, and he sees an elevation of his Torah, his prayer, his <i>avodah</i> and connection to God, and the light of the heavens shine in his soul, he still sees himself as the lowest of the low. He might even cry ‘A rebbe who is not on the level of his predecessors like the Rebbe of Lublin and the <i>Maggid</i> of Kozhnitz—does he need deceive both himself and the world? True, he could justify himself, ‘Jeftah in his generation is like Samuel in his,’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">402</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A Talmudic idiom (see Talmud <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 25b), indicating that each generation’s sage is equivalent to that of a prior generation’s sage.</i> but then again, every sinner has his justification so that he might continue to sin unconcerned. Woe, all my life is full of deceit! How happy must the laborer or seamster: a simple, uneducated layperson who serves God with simple faith, with prayer and psalms, without carrying great responsibility.’",
                "The feeling of bitterness can become so strong that he might think, ‘since I am unsatisfied with myself, and the more I add to my <i>avodah</i> the more I see its lackings. They are so severe that they endanger my very existence and eternality—it would have been better had I come to actual trial and cast myself onto the pyre for the sake of God! At least then I would be connected to God, albeit not at the level of R. Akiva. R. Akiva wished for that opportunity his whole life,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">403</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud <i>Berakhot</i> 61b.</i>",
                "because he desired this only because of his <i>avodah</i> and desire to be connected to God, which he desired for his entire life to the extent that he was pained at not have this opportunity. While he desires it out of bitterness and fear lest he be sent down from the level of holiness to hell below.’ The rebbe might have these thoughts occasionally, not consistently.",
                "[Still], this worry will vex him to the point that when he comes to his father or grandfather’s graves, he finds it difficult to pray for his physical needs. His prayer there, and sometimes also at home, is mostly comprised of ‘Ho, my holy ancestors! How can you abandon me to be sent away and distant from God, God forbid? Did not you experience this flaw, God forbid? For the mind of the son comes from that of the father?’",
                "When he arrives at moments of Torah and <i>avodah</i> and his heart is strengthened in God, in joy and spiritual greatness, and lofty spiritual understandings come to his mind, he does not know from whence these came to him. When he directs his hasidim in service of God and hasidism, and he finds great words coming from his mouth and does not know from whence this greatness comes, he experiences regret thereafter—‘is this not once again deceit,’ [he wonders]? Cf. in <i>Noam Elimelekh, Parshat Tazriah</i>, that the <i>tzaddik</i> never experiences levels of virtue in himself, but rather experiences himself as impurified by sin, thinking that he has certainly not become pure in his <i>avodah</i> etc… Yet when he must pray for something...on the contrary, he must strengthen his sense of his level/stature, and be not at all derelict in praying for anything.",
                "His fallings of spirit may also be due to his connection to his hasidim, for his soul spreads forth and inheres in their souls, and theirs in his. Thus, his selfhood [<i>enokhiut</i>] is not self-contained, for his hasidim are implicated in it as well, and parts of his soul are divided amongst them. He has no independent identity. All he has is therefore is lowliness of spirit.",
                "In <i>Maor vaShemesh, Parshat Vayeshev</i>, he gives two signs to identify a <i>tzaddik</i>: a) if he does not experience any trait of his own, functioning like the <i>sefirah Yesod</i> which is merely a channel for influx to travel through from above to below, as he passes on everything to Israel. b) If he inflames the hearts of those connected to him, that they continuously desire to connect to the Creator.",
                "Now, why does he not experience any emotions? Because he leaves nothing for himself. Rather, his entire self is dedicated to Israel.",
                "Furthermore, since he is connected to them, though he cannot see the metaphysical cause [<i>mazal</i>] he sees the burden cast upon him: the physical and spiritual needs of his hasidim which he must try to cast light upon, and their requests to him to pray for their physical needs or show them the path of God and elevate them. From their inner souls they turn to his soul, and his soul yearns for their souls and has mercy on them, and all the boundaries of self melt away. He feels such an obligation for all of Israel, to worry for them. ‘Israel is in such straits, feeling fear and darkness vis a vis their physical and spiritual needs. ‘Who will worry for them, if not those who are called the heads of Israel, the shepherds of Israel whom God has brought up to heaven? Upon whom has God abandoned his despondent sheep in such vicissitude?’ His soul collapses under the burden of these worries, till he can no longer find any merit in his own deeds."

                "Chapter 6<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">404</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Chapter 6, R. Shapiro distinguishes between the <i>Zohar</i> and the sacred works of Kabbalah which came after it. The nature and level of the Zohar’s revelation and text is <i>sui generis,</i> as explained below.</i><br>As we said above, pre-Beshtian Kabbalah ‘bent’ the world of <i>Atzilut</i> down to the <i>Atzilut</i> within a person, that is to his <i>Hokhmah</i>, while the revelation of the Besht had an effect on the vessels and the bodies, [in the sense of] “<i>and all of the community are holy</i>.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">405</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 16:3. The citation is from Korah and his associates, in their rebellious charge against Moses. Some hasidic masters were sympathetic to this position of Korah, and perhaps R. Shapiro here alludes to this position.</i> Through this, the Kabbalah and all its sacred systems inhered not only Above but also <i>within</i> the Israelite. [In all this,] we have not spoken of the essence of Kabbalah, which is above our grasp—for what am I and my lowly life to speak about and explain such sacred matters? We have merely spoken of our understanding in explicating these matters, as it says in the <i>Zohar</i> on the verse ‘and her husband is known in the gates <i>[shearim],</i>”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">406</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 31:23.</i> “each according to how his heart surmises [<i>mishaer</i>]…”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">407</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Zohar</i> I: 103b.</i> Now we wish to clarify why we have primarily spoken of those kabbalistic works authored by the holy angels of God besides the <i>Zohar</i>. [In what follows, we delineate] the difference, as we understand it, between the <i>Zohar</i> and the sacred works of Kabbalah which came after it.",
                "As we said above, the godly tanna R. Shimon b. Yokhai said, <i>“I have seen the bnai aliyah, yet they are few,”</i> and he began to draw the light of <i>Atzilut</i> downward. Since he was the first of those who ‘drew down,’ his holy words and the way he garbed <i>Atzilut</i> in the vessels still had the appearance of being above them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">408</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As such, the <i>Zohar</i>’s level of emanation is still very ethereal, in the realm of the imaginative faculties, as opposed to later kabbalistic works, which drew down the teachings to more concrete levels.</i>",
                "This is like that which is written a few times in the holy books, that the <i>sefirah</i> of <i>Keter</i> in each world is the <i>Malkhut</i> of the world above it. This is why <i>Keter</i> is not counted in the enumerations of the <i>sefirot</i>, like a soul before being garbed in the body, limbs, and vessels. * [Note: In the <i>Pardes</i> and other works it is explained why it was not counted.]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">409</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I am unsure of the precise passage in <i>Pardes</i> being referred to here.</i>",
                "This is not to say that it is totally of <i>Malkhut</i>, for it is also the <i>Keter</i> of the world below it; yet it is in refracted form. The garb and vessels of the <i>sefirot</i> of the world below it appear on it, as well as like the light of the world above it, appearing as a bare soul.",
                "The light of <i>Atzilut</i> and prophetic revelation found in the works of the kabbalists, especially those from R. Moses Cordevero and on, was drawn further into the vessels, and was further defined via the <i>sefirot</i>i<i>c</i> names, in full detail: which s<i>efirah</i>, which <i>sefirah</i> within each <i>sefirah,</i> e.g. <i>Hessed</i> in <i>Hessed</i> or <i>Gevurah</i> in <i>Hessed</i>; and in which world, and whether in the aspect of rectification or nullity [<i>tikkun, tohu</i>]; and which letter from the holy Names, etc… Through these definitions, our faculty of speech can be expressed, and our faculties of thought and knowledge, which are designed to grasp onto distinct and separate entities, conceptually and terminologically circumscribed, have what to grasp, each person according to his stature and understanding. Even a boorish man, who sees only the outside of the vessels and does not apprehend the prophetic light shining through all the combinations and unifications of these definitions, can yet apprehend something, that this thing is not of this world but rather of the upper worlds and divine <i>sefirot</i>. Yet his knowledge will be merely intellectual, and no more.",
                "This is not true of the Zohar, including the <i>Zohar Hadash</i> and <i>Tikkunei Zohar</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">410</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sections of the Zoharic corpus of an apparently later provenance than the core of the <i>Zohar</i>.</i> in which prophecy is apparent. This is due, first and foremost, on account of the actual prophetic visions which our sages saw and the utterances they heard. Secondly, the tales in these texts—as much as those of the Sages are wondrous and obviously prophetic, above human intelligence—those of the <i>Zohar</i>, along with its tales, are much more wondrous. Almost none of them have any relation to this world and human intellect. Almost all of them speak of the upper worlds, and not only of Eden and Gehenna but of the other worlds as well: of the desire of <i>Knesset Yisrael</i> [i.e. <i>Shekhinah</i>] for her beloved the Holy Blessed One, and how it is wearied in exile from its great desire, and His desire for her; and how in the future He will raised her up; and of the songs of the angels above; and the descent of the soul to this world at the time of birth; and of its ascent at the time of death. This is why the talmudic sage [<i>tanna</i>, i.e. R. Shimon b. Yokhai] began the <i>Zohar</i> and <i>Tikkunei Zohar</i> with the verse, <i>“</i>“<i>And the knowledgebale (</i>maskilim<i>) will be radiant like the bright expanse of sky”</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">411</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Daniel 12:3.</i><i></i> For this is a heavenly work, telling of all that happens above, as well as all the effects of all that happens below on the world Above. It contains not just snippets of what happens above but rather describes things in such detail that the reader becomes like a resident of the world above, able to describe everything in full detail. When one learns <i>Zohar</i>, he feels as if he has been removed to that holy world.",
                "We further see this unique quality in the <i>Zohar’s</i> kabbalistic matters. In other kabbalistic works, the insights are garbed in <i>Hokhmah</i>, <i>Binah</i>, and <i>Daat,</i> and one who learns these texts through his own <i>Hokhmah</i>, <i>Binah</i>, and <i>Daat</i> contacts them. Even one who perceives more deeply and gazes upon the light from Above shining on the vessels must first grasp that which is written there, using his wisdom and understanding. This is not so with the Zohar, in which the sages told of that which they actually saw, as they saw it, describing it as they apprehended it.",
                "A parable: Two aristocrats were summoned to the king’s palace. Upon their return home, both spoke of the wondrous beauty of the palace, and of the king’s wisdom and good taste, of the breadth of his understanding, and even of his wealth, recognizable from the palace’s structure and sophistication.",
                "Yet, one focused on the details of the measurements of the palace’s architecture: those of the doors and windows, the length height and width of the rooms and the gates, each precisely measured according to its utility in serving the needs of the king and his ministers. The number and size of the trees in the garden, the weight of the fruits, the number of flowerbeds and that of the flowers within each, etc… The second, desiring to restrict himself, also detailed the beauty and wisdom apparent in the palace, including its measurements.",
                "Nonetheless, due to his tremendous astonishment from seeing the palace, and his mighty enthusiasm regarding the apparent wisdom of the king, he was unable to restrict himself to only speaking of measurements, in a scientific manner, but spoke as well of the essence of that which he saw, and expressed how moved and enthused he was. ‘Such a beautiful palace, with so much light in its rooms that it appeared to me that the sun itself has descended into the room, for the windows were so large, with such and such measurements.’ He did not merely speak of the measurements of the rooms and windows, ascribing their beauty to their size, but rather spoke directly of the essence of their beauty. ‘How beautiful is the garden, its fragrance literally revives the dead, etc.’ Because of how moved he was, he was unable to articulate each measurement of the rooms and windows, <i>et al</i>, like the first aristocrat, and even when he did speak of measurements, it was with less precision than the first.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">412</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The point of this parable is to frame the aristocrat—that is, the kabbalist—who speaks in more general, impressionistic terms—as the visitor who sees/understands even more clearly than the one who conveys precisely detailed reports. The lesson is, of course, counter-intuitive, which is why it requires a parable to teach it.</i>",
                "Now, there is no distinction between their essential descriptions of the palace. If one has a ‘warm heart,’ then after hearing the description of the first aristocrat, he will envision the beauty of the palace before him, and his warm heart will become enthused from its beauty. He will thereby become enthused from the greatness of the king hovering upon it. Conversely, one who hears the second’s description, if he has understanding, then in addition to his heart’s enthusiasm from hearing the presentation of the palace’s description, his mind will understand its measurements as well. The two presentations are, therefore, distinguished only by their style.",
                "This, according to our limited understanding, is the distinction between the revelation of Kabbalah in the <i>Zohar</i> as opposed to in succeeding kabbalistic works. The latter as well did not only speak intellectually, as we have already stated above here in <i>Mevo haShearim</i>;",
                "yet, they did restrict their sight to measurements and quantities, detailing them according to the grasp of the human intellect. When we open the <i>Pardes</i> or Etz <i>Hayyim</i>, we must first incline our heads and minds towards them.",
                "This is not so with the Zohar, in which is conveyed the essence of their visions Above: this world and that world, this <i>sefirah</i> and that one, describing them and what occurs in them, etc… True, the <i>Zohar</i> does often speak of details of measurements, calling them by their names which define them. Yet in the vast majority of the time it speaks of the <i>essence</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">413</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Recall (from Chapter One) R. Shapiro’s focus on the essence of the prophet as opposed to his accidental characteristics.</i><i></i> of the worlds and <i>sefirot</i> and that which occurs in them. In fact, sometimes it does not utilize their proper names, and it is left to the commentators to show us that it is referring to this or that trait or <i>sefirah</i>. It is like in the parable above, regarding the second aristocrat—if the one who hears him has understanding, he will infer the measurements from what he is told of the essence. The commentators on the <i>Zohar</i> understood, and explained to us the measurements and names and aspects intended even when our understanding did not grasp these.",
                "For example, as it says in the beginning of the introduction to the <i>Zohar</i> (2a): <i>“The word was concealed with the blessed Holy One, and He revealed it in the Academy on High. Here it is: When Concealed of all Concealed verged on being revealed, it produced at first a single point…”</i> The names of each entity, <i>sefirah</i>, and world are not articulated here, but rather just the sight as it was [beheld]. Yet, when we read how this passage is analyzed in <i>Mikdash Melekh</i>, we see details of names and <i>sefirot</i> etc… This is the case regarding almost the entire <i>Zohar</i>. Furthermore, even when the <i>Zohar</i> does speak of details of the <i>sefirot</i>, it generally does not call them by their names, but rather refers to them as the ‘upper world’ or the ‘lower world,’ ‘upper king’ or ‘lower king,’ ‘place of knowledge.’ Or, as it says in that same passage in the Zohar, <i>“R. Shimon says, From here on, the completion of the verse... These are two rungs, each of which should be inscribed. One is What; the other, Who.</i>",
                "This is above, that is below.” He is referring to <i>Binah</i> and <i>Malkhut</i>, calling them two levels, one higher and one lower, but not mentioning their names. Similarly, on page 6, he refers to <i>‘that lofty point which exists in the palace,’</i> that is, <i>Hokhmah</i> and <i>Binah</i>.",
                "The details of the Names—their aspects and measurements—are not explicated in the <i>Zohar</i> as they are in other kabbalistic works, but are merely hinted at. Nonetheless, the other <i>Tannaim</i> said of R. Shimon b. Yokhai that all his words are ‘revealed.’ See <i>Zohar Akharei Mot</i> 49b, 61a. This is because he did not conceal his visions of the holy in concepts, words, definition, and names, but rather revealed the essence of the prophecy, like the second aristocrat in the parable. Yet in the parable, the teller and tale were pedestrian, while on contrary the <i>Zohar</i> is revelation of actual prophecy, as is said several times in the Zohar, including on folio 61a, cited above. For since God granted him prophetic revelation, each word comes revealed. And yet, R. Shimon b. Yokhai did not reveal matters as did the prophets, for they revealed in the garb of <i>Asiyah</i> and he in <i>Atzilut</i>.",
                "Therefore, for the lowly generation, distant from prophecy and more capable of grasping matters which are defined by measurements and concepts, R. Shimon b. Yokhai’s words seem more concealed. Yet the righteous of his generation said that all his words were from revelation.",
                "However, even we in our lowly state can observe regarding matters about which we do have some grasp, that even when the <i>Zohar</i> does not detail names and their definitions, it will nonetheless detail the essence of the <i>sefirot</i> and qualities as well as the essence of their actions. These details are not necessary for greater intellectual understanding, as when one offers explanation after explanation to one with limited mental capacity in order to explain to him a deep intellectual matter, each addition constituting an intellectual addition. Rather, the additional explanations of the <i>Zohar</i> are in reality additional <i>prophecies</i>, additional explanations of the essence of the qualities and traits above, as they beheld them prophetically. For example, it is known that sometimes the aspects of <i>Malkhut</i>-<i>Knesset Yisrael</i> diminishes until it is a point, and from the letter <i>heh</i> becomes a <i>yud</i>, and the prayers of Israel arouse the aspect of <i>Tiferet</i> to illumine her. She [then] grows back to her prior state and the unifications begin again.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">414</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the citation from the <i>Zohar Parshat Balak</i>, below, for a textual sourcing of this notion.</i> Yet the <i>Zohar</i> does not convey this laconically, with just enough words to explain the matter intellectually, but rather explains in detail how these things operate Above.",
                "Here are their words in the <i>Zohar Parshat Balak</i> [191a]: Black I am but beautiful, O daughters of Jerusalem—like the tents of Kedar, like Solomon’s curtains. Do not look at me for being blackish… (Song of Songs 1:5-6)...When She is immersed in great love for Her Beloved, through the pressure of love She cannot bear, She diminishes Herself extremely until nothing is seen of Her but the tiniest single point...She diminishes Herself extremely until nothing is seen of Her but the tiniest single point...Then She is concealed from all Her forces and camps, and She says, ‘Black am I,’ for there is no white inside this letter, as there is in other letters. This is the meaning of ‘Black am I’- and I have no room to bring you in beneath My wings.’ What do mighty warriors, Her legions [the <i>tzaddikim</i>] do? They roar like mighty lions...Because of the sounds and mighty roars emitted, like lions, by the mighty warriors, the Beloved above hears, and He knows that His Beloved is as passionately in love as He is, until none of Her image or beauty can be seen. Then, through the sounds and roars of Her mighty ones, Her dear Beloved emerges from His place with many gifts and many presents, with fragrances and spices, and comes to Her and finds Her nearly dead, with no image or beauty at all. He approaches Her, embraces Her and kisses Her, until gradually She is revived by the fragrances and spices. By the joy of Her Beloved at Her side, She is restored and—through Her adornments, Her image, and Her beauty—transformed into <i>Heh</i>, as originally...They and all other forces sand ready to hear what She says, and She stands like a king among Her legions…”",
                "I have only cited a portion of this piece, yet it is enough to allow one to understand the passage’s concluding words in the name of R. Elazar, <i>“had Ezekiel the prophet not said this, chaos would enter the world.”</i> This prophetic piece, as much as the sages restricted it in order to draw it down to us, nonetheless is not entirely garbed in the intellect, and is not graspable only via the intellect. Rather, it is a prophetic vision, conveyed as it was seen, and each can see that it is prophecy, for even if Ezekiel the prophet said it, it is wonderous. The text specifies Ezekiel, for this prophet described in detail in accordance with what he saw, more than the other prophets, as it says in the Talmud “to what is Isaiah comparable...to what is Ezekiel comparable…”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">415</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Talmud <i>Hagigah</i> 13b:” All that Ezekiel saw, Isaiah saw.

                "Now, since the revelation in the <i>Zohar</i> is more ‘bare,’ as a soul before it is entirely garbed in a body, akin to <i>Keter</i> which is also <i>Malkhut</i> of the world above it, as mentioned above—therefore, when hasidism was revealed by the Besht and his students, it was an initial messianic revelation<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">416</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., a revelation on the level which will be experienced during the messianic period.</i> in which the vessels did not conceal the soul within them but rather [on the contrary] revealed their light. Thus, many intellectual matters regarding the upper worlds mentioned in the <i>Zohar</i> are then explained more fully in hasidism. Matters subject to definition, measures, qualities, and names—matters grasped by one’s intellect—these are comprehended within hasidism as it received them via the Kabbalah of Cordevero, Luria, and his students. The additional revelation in hasidism in this matter is, as we said above, that the holy structures of the <i>sefirot</i> and names, grasped through the Kabbalah, are not only Above but also within the Israelite person.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">417</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is an extremely significant point for hasidism generally and certainly for R. Shapiro. The entire matrix of the <i>sefirot</i> as a depiction of the supernal realm is equally a depiction of the inner life of the Jew (Israelite). All of the dynamics which take place <i>Above</i>, therefore, also take place <i>within.</i> Hence the ability of a Jew’s inner life—including, notably, his emotional life—to interact and effect the supernal realms of reality.</i> This revelation is in the world at large and even more so in the Israelite, [expressed] in the <i>Zohar</i> and in their unification with Him especially at times of Torah, prayer, and <i>avodah</i>. They do not grasp these only intellectually, in terms of measurements and definitions, but rather also grasp their essence. And we [correspondingly] do not grasp these matters merely with our intellects, but rather also with <i>our</i> essence. Some of these matters are understood through hasidism; that is, specifically in hasidism, for some matters in the <i>Zohar</i> are more clearly and fully explained through the specific mode of hasidic revelation.",
                "For example, it says in the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Vayikra</i> 4b): “Furthermore, Israel perfects faith on earth, and Israel is perfection of His Holy Name. When the people of Israel are perfected by their deeds, the Holy Name, as it were, is complete; but when they are not perfected below and are sentenced to exile, the Holy Name, as it were, is incomplete above. For we have learned: One ascended, the other descended—Israel ascended higher and higher; Assembly of Israel descended below... But there is no one whose spirit is aroused, so the blessed Holy One says,” Why have I come, when there is no man? Why have I called, when no one responds?...There is no one whose spirit is aroused.” <i>Mikdash Melekh</i> explains that “perfects faith on earth” means that through Israel, His faith is revealed in the world. “Israel is perfection of His holy name” means that through their good deeds they cause the unification of male and female...thus through them the divine name is completed. He thus explains that Israel is the cause, through their deeds, effects above. “Israel perfects faith on earth” means that they cause the revelation of His divinity on earth. ”And Israel is the perfection of His holy name” similarly, that through their good deeds they cause the unification of the holy <i>sefirot</i> Above.”",
                "This is not the case with the hasidic mode of revelation, through which these words of the <i>Zohar</i> are almost self-explanatory, even according to our meager grasp. For all the chains and <i>sefirot</i> exist in Israel, and in point of fact all the supernal worlds emanated and were created and formed for the sake of being revealed in the Israelite person. It is for this reason that they were made in the image of a person.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">418</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rather than the human form imitating the supernal form of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, the latter, in fact, reflects the former!</i> Thus the <i>Zohar</i> says that Israel completes God’s faithfulness [or, belief in God; <i>emunah</i>] in the world. First, because they reveal His divinity in the world, as the <i>Mikdash Melekh</i> explains. But further, because they themselves—literally, they themselves!—actively do this, since in them exist all the worlds, <i>sefirot</i>, etc… <i>“Israel is the completion of the Holy Name.”</i> So too, the unifications which they perform and intend not only affect that which occurs Above, but also unify all the holiness inhering within them, until <i>Atzilut</i>. When they are in exile and descent, both physically and spiritually, their Holy Spirit is distant from their bodies and souls. This is the separation between <i>Tiferet</i> and <i>Malkhut</i> within them, and within all the worlds. This is not to say, God forbid, that it is totally distant from us, for it is with us even now. The lack is “Why, when I came, was no one there, Why when I called, would none respond?,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">419</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 50:2</i> <i>no one whose spirit is aroused?”</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">420</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The capacity and potential for unification remains alive; all that is needed is spiritual awakening and arousal to enact it.</i><i></i> The essential point is that the person should <i>be,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">421</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, truly exist and live.</i><i></i> and that means that his spirit should be aroused. He should not just say words of the prayers and perform the commandments, but rather his spirit should be aroused, for as we have already said, this is the essence of hasidism: the awakening[<i>hitorerut</i>].",

Rather, <i>‘know that which is above you—</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">423</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishnah <i>Avot</i> 2:1.</i><i> ”</i> that everything which happens Above, is from you.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">424</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Teaching ascribed to R.

Israel strengthens not the just its capacity to be revealed in this world, but rather on all the hidden treasures of the king, that is, also those Above—all are ruled through Israel down below. Know, that which is Above—it is all from you.",
                "Is there anything simpler for hasidism than the holy statement in <i>the Raya Mehemnah, Zohar, Parshat Behar</i> (109b): “The Holy Blessed One, when He is not close to <i>Shekhinah</i> in all of Israel who are men of traits (<i>middot</i>), who are her limbs...and it is as if the Holy Blessed One is not one…” We need not strip the text of its simple meaning, saying that it is because the <i>Shekhinah</i> is Above she is adorned by Israel and their [fulfilled] commandments. Rather, it is straightforward: every Israelite person in this world is literally the limbs of the <i>Shekhinah</i>, and when the Holy Blessed One wishes to unite and draw close to her, He unites with Israel. If He does not unite with them, it is as if He is not one.",
                "This is the way of revelation from Above. After it is revealed, we see it everywhere. And now, after the Besht opened the gates of Heaven and the supernal light flows even to the vessels and bodies, we see that the <i>Zohar</i> intended this as well. This is the way of revelation from Above, as well as of the soul when it is revealed—it is apprehended in correlation with the vessel into which it has been drawn. In the ear, its auditory character is apparent, while in the eye, its visual character is revealed. So too regarding the <i>sefirot</i>: the same simple divine force, when it is revealed in the vessel of <i>hessed</i>, its character of [the <i>sefirah</i> of] Hessed is revealed, and when in a vessel of <i>Tiferet</i>, its character of mercy is revealed. Yet they are all true and alive and holy, as we have already explained in other works.",
                "The <i>Zohar</i> was the first of the revelations in the aspect of <i>Atzilut</i>, and the manner of its revelation was in the soul. Even the measurements and other mental tools of comprehension which it was restricted and revealed were vessels of the soul.",
                "Therefore, the <i>Zohar</i> is apparent in all paths of Kabbalah of the holy kabbalists—Cordevero, Luria, etc.., each according to his respective character, Cordevero in his character and Luria in his. All the more so in the path of Besht, in its revelation in which the vessels themselves are sanctified and purified. The soul of the revelation, the initial messianic one, in which the paths of the <i>Zohar</i> and Besht became as one, appear as one revelation.",
                "Through this, we can understand even with our lowly understanding why it is that hasidic masters did not command us to learn or recite kabbalistic works which one does not understand, though each letter within is holy and sanctifies the learner; while they did command this regarding the <i>Zohar</i>—that even those who do not understand it should nonetheless recite the holy <i>Zohar</i> and become sanctified. For the crux of the revelation of the <i>Zohar</i> as refracted in hasidism is one in which even the vessels are sanctified, and even one who does not understand is made holy.",
                "Thus, we may rightly say of the revelation of the Kabbalah, which is revelation of <i>Atzilut</i>, that the <i>Zohar</i> is its <i>Keter</i> and hasidism its <i>Malkhut</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">426</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, hasidism transmits the <i>Zohar’s</i> revelation from its higher intellectualized manifestation, pulling it downwards and spreading it outwards, translating it into other modalities of expression, including the emotional and physical.</i> the last of the messianic revelation through which the kingdom of heaven will be revealed.

            [
                "Chapter 7 <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">430</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Chapter 7, R. Shapiro defines the term hasid, not as a sociological term but as a spiritual one: a hasid is a ‘soul-full’ individual who engages in a particular level of <i>avodah</i> as discussed further in this chapter. R. Shapiro further stresses the significant role which even the common hasidim play in the hasidic system.</i><br>The term ‘hasid,’ by which the followers of the Besht are called, is not a new one. Already in the Prophets we find the term deployed to describe a person of a stature closest to holiness, such as “The hasid is lost” (Micah 7), “Guard my soul for I am a hasid” (Ps. 86), “His praise is amongst the congregation of hasidim” (ibid. 149), etc. Yet what remains unarticulated there is, which actions one might do in order to rise above the rest of Israel and be called a hasid? For every Israelite is commanded to fulfill the Torah and its commandments, <i>‘and you are not free to be exempted from it</i>.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">431</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishnah Avot 2:16.</i> If so, the hasid must do more than fulfill the Torah and commandments—but how so? Merely by doing more of them, quantitatively and qualitatively?",
                "From various statements of the Sages, we may infer that a hasid is one who performs all his deeds by going beyond the letter of the Law.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">432</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hebrew, <i>Lifnim Meshurat haDin.</i> See, for example Talmud <i>Berakhot</i> 45b; cf. the related notion of ‘<i>middat hasidut’</i> (e.g. Talmud <i>Bava Metziah</i> 52b).</i> Further, the Mishnah in <i>Avot</i> 5:10 states: <i>“What is mine is yours, and what is yours is yours—this is a</i> hasid<i>.”</i> Yet also other actions which are not related to the Law nor going beyond it are correlated by the Sages with the hasid, such as “the early hasidim would wait one hour before prayer…”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">433</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishnah <i>Berakhot</i> 5:1</i> Note, they did not say that they prayed an hour earlier or took longer to pray, in the sense of working within the parameters of the laws of times for prayer and going beyond the letter of those laws. Rather, they did something new, waiting an hour before and an hour after.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">434</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Shapiro notes that, while some talmudic texts imply that the hasid is one who executes his <i>legal obligations</i> in a superogatory manner (such as praying even earlier than is mandated by the law), others associate the hasid with one who adopts extra or <i>supra-legal behaviors</i> entirely (such as preparing for prayer before beginning the mandated prayer itself).</i> Yet, see <i>Bava Kamma (100a Tosafot s.v. Lifnim Meshurat haDin</i>), that the principle of going beyond the letter applies only to cases in which others would have been obligated.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">435</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And as such is correlated with legal requirements. R. Shapiro is evidencing his claim that the definition of the hasid extends beyond acting <i>lifnim meshurat hadin</i>, for his path extends into non-legal engagements while (according to the <i>Tosafot</i>) actions characterized as <i>lifnim meshurat hadin</i> are indeed legally required—they are just not required for this particular actor!</i> And in the ‘teaching of R. Pinkhas b. Yair’ at the end of Sotah,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">436</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Actually, Talmud <i>Avodah Zara</i> 20b.</i> hasidism is mentioned after all the other levels of <i>avodah</i>, even after the level of ‘separation,’ that is separation from that which is permissible, as Rashi explains;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">437</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi ad locum.</i> and it is the highest of the levels, bringing one to divine inspiration. This implies that the term hasid does not just describe one who performs a set of actions and is stringent with himself, but rather describes a spiritual state and lofty path of <i>avodah</i>. His additional <i>avodah</i>, as expressed in going beyond the letter of the law yet also in other manners, are the result of his spiritual state and path of <i>avodah</i>.",
                "And yet: Maimonides, in the sixth chapter of his Eight Chapters,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">438</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Maimonides’ introduction to his commentary on Mishnah <i>Avot</i>.</i> has already described the spiritual state of the hasid. The hasid despises those things which people innately know to be evil, such as theft and stealing, while one who is not a hasid desires those things and must control himself and overcome his inclination. Maimonides distinguishes here between rational commandments which the soul of the hasid despises, from the irrational commandments [<i>hukim</i>] which the human intellect does not understand. The Sages said about this latter type, “one should not say- I do not desire pork etc.. but rather I certainly desire it, but what can I do? My Father in Heaven has decreed against it.” <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">439</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Maimonides argues that one should innately abhor violation of rational commandments, with one’s impulses aligned with that of the Torah, while with regards to the irrational commandments, one should obey them solely out of sense of obligation rather than out of internal [moral, ethical, or other] motivation.</i>",
                "[Yet,] in <i>Shaarei Kedushah</i> of R. Hayyim Vital I:3 it says that a hasid has all good traits incorporated into his nature, to the extent that he has no need to overcome his inclination but rather fulfills all six hundred and thirteen commandments joyfully and with love. That is, he [innately] desires to fulfill even the irrational commandments. And do not issue a challenge to this by citing the [aforementioned statement of the] Talmud<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">440</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Midrash Sifra: Kedoshim</i> 9:12.</i> on “one should not say I do not desire pork,” for the Talmud merely says that had the Torah not forbidden this thing we would have desired it, for there is nothing inherently wrong with them. Yet, now that the Torah has in fact forbidden them, we have so imbibed the will of God that we, of our own accord, do not desire it—as every Israelite sees in himself that in truth he does not desire pork or non-kosher meats.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">441</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a bold statement indeed for an author living in Warsaw in the 1930s, where many Jews did in fact eat non-kosher, that is, improperly slaughtered, meats. Perhaps R. Shapiro intends that even these Jews avoid prohibited species, such as pork; but the matter remains unclear, and it is equally plausible that R. Shapiro is here making a normative, rather than a descriptive, point.</i> Shall we say therefore that we are violating the words of the Sages when they said ““one should not say I do not desire pork etc.. but rather I certainly desire it…?” [No,] for indeed we <i>do</i> say that, and <i>would</i> desire it—were it not for the fact that the Torah has forbidden it. But since the Torah has in fact done so, the words of the Torah enter me [<i>sic</i>] until I in truth do not desire it.",
                "The <i>Zohar Parshat Naso</i> (145) reveals more of this matter, helping even of us meager understanding it more clearly. “It is taught...All who have fear of Heaven merit humility; all who have humility merit <i>hasidut</i>...It is taught: Everyone who ‘has’ <i>hasidut</i> is called ‘an angel of the Lord…’ R. Yehudah said, “Just as an angel of the Lord of Hosts is priest Above, so an angel of the Lord of Hosts is priest below. The high priest below...is called an angel of the Lord of Hosts, since he comes from <i>Hessed</i>...R. Yehudah said, But have we learned: Totality of male and female! He replied, ‘Certainly so! For whoever is joined male to female is called Adam, and is then sin-fearing. Not only that, but he is imbued with <i>hessed [</i>kindness, graciousness<i>]</i>. And whoever is not male with female possesses neither awe nor humility nor <i>hasidut</i>...Since the priest is called hasid, he must bless...Thus shall you bless...your devoted ones [<i>hasidekha</i>] will bless You.” That is, hasid comes from the term <i>‘hessed</i>,’ and it is only through fear of Heaven and humility that one arrives at it and becomes as an ‘angel of the Lord.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">442</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This passage is cited to support the contention that to be a hasid is no mere sociological category, but is rather a state of being characterized by specific virtues, and correlated with specific (divine) traits.</i>",
                "If we have both heard and seen that previously, hasidism was entirely focused on <i>avreikhim</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">443</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, before R. Shapiro’s and his colleagues’ intervention, with their focus on hasidic youth.</i>—well, they spent much time in their rebbe’s presence, who (in turn) spread his spirit upon them. They sanctified themselves, as well as all those surrounding them —from the learned to the simple folk—with the rectifications [<i>tikkunim</i>] of hasidism. One might think that this focus was due to the simple fact that it was these <i>avreikhem</i> who had more time available, since they were supported by their fathers in law; and the younger hasidic boys/adolescents were still too young—for at that time they married at fifteen or eighteen years old. Thus, now that boys are single into their twenties, occupied in hasidism, thank God, there is no need for the <i>‘kest’</i> system in order to render the <i>avreikhim</i> free for divine service and hasidic <i>avodah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">444</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the 19-20th century Eastern European ‘<i>kest</i> system,’ young men, unmarried or married, who continued in local, full time Torah study, were supported by their parents and/or parents in law, often for a period of three years.

Accessed October 11, 2019, &lt;https: yivoencyclopedia.org=\"\" article.aspx=\"\" childhood=\"\"&gt;.</i> If one thinks this, he errs. About this very matter the <i>Zohar</i> reveals to us that only a bit of the light of hasidism is directed to the intellect. The bulk of it is beyond the intellect, consisting of divine secrets and mysteries from the upper worlds. This is hasidism: grace [<i>hessed</i>] from Above, whose holy lights extend downwards to the extent that it reaches to the sense of ‘and your faithful [<i>hasidekha]</i> will bless You;’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">445</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalm 145:10.</i> for just as the lights are drawn to this world, so too does blessing. The hasid is like an ‘angel of the Lord,’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">446</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Malakhi 2:7.</i> and the essence of hasidism is specifically [expressed in the life of ] a married person.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">447</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Shapiro has not articulated the connection between the notion that hasidism is grace and blessing from Above and the claim that hasidism must be enacted specifically by married <i>avreikhim</i>, nor does he elsewhere within this text; perhaps there is some mystical explanation that he intended to articulate elsewhere. The closest he gets in this text to explaining the focus on married <i>avreikhim</i> is when he discusses the need for the <i>kest</i> system and the ability of <i>avreikhim</i> to be freed from worldly concerns and to be totally focused on their practices; but in theory, this is an economic matter which did not require being married per se.</i> As such, nowadays when, due to the vagaries of the time and to our sorrow, young boys delay getting married, it is a positive thing, indeed a salvation of God, that they occupy themselves in hasidism. But they do not thereby replace the <i>avreikhim</i>. If we would not, God forbid, have <i>avreikhim</i> free to serve God through hasidism, all of hasidism would be diminished and lacking, Heaven forfend. We will speak more about this, God willing.",
                "The fundamental essence of the hasid lies in the aspect of ‘<i>hessed</i>.’ What is <i>hessed</i>? In <i>Patakh Eliyahu</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">448</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A Kabbalistic section of the introduction to <i>Tikunei Zohar</i>, named after its initial words, where it is attributed to Elijah the Prophet.</i> it makes reference to [in relation to <i>sefirot</i>] ‘one long, one short, one medium.’ ‘One long’ means that the vessel is not totally closed and its light shines forth from it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">449</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Presumably corresponding to <i>Hessed</i>.</i> ‘One small’ corresponds to <i>Gevurah</i>/might, meaning that the vessel is closed and its light is mostly concealed within it, only a bit revealed outwards. And ‘one medium’ corresponds to <i>Tiferet</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">450</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The intermediate combination of the former two.</i> Accordingly, the term ‘hasidism’ does not have a defined, unique definition; rather, it refers to [qualities of] grace and revelation, for the soul of the hasid is not concealed within vessels and materiality, for he has purified them, as cited above from <i>Shaarei Kedushah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">451</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, rather than defining hasidism by a particular set of behaviors, this text delineates the term as measures of revelation. To adhere to hasidism, then, is to cultivate and partake in greater and greater degrees of revelation, extending to revelation within physicality.</i>",
                "This is the intent of Rashi<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">452</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud <i>Pesakhim</i> 40a: “Rabbah said, a ‘master of his soul’ (<i>baal nefesh</i>) will not soak wheat [in water during Passover, lest it become leavened].” Rashi there equates a ‘master of his soul’ with ‘a hasid,’ ostensibly indicating that this individual acts extra piously and cautiously in avoiding leavening grain. R. Shapiro interprets the phrase hyperliterally, as a hasid being one who has mastered the spiritual art of revealing his soul even within its corporeal vessels.</i> (Talmud <i>Pesakhim</i> 40, cited in <i>Hakhsharat haAvreikhim</i>), that a ‘soulful person’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">453</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Baal nefesh</i>, often rendered as a ‘pious individual.’</i> is a hasid—that is, his soul is not hidden and concealed in his body, but rather in the aspect of <i>Hessed</i>—‘one long’—until his very soul is revealed in it. He is thus called a soulful person, and his revealed soul yearns for God, to the extent that of its own accord it desires not sin but only fulfillment of the commandments. He engages in many and varied good deeds in order to draw closer to God, going beyond the letter of the law, delaying for an hour before prayer and after and during, being scrupulous in all the levels enumerated in the teaching [<i>beraita]</i> of R. Pinkhas b. Yair, until he comes to the [capacity of ] Holy Spirit. For this is the beginning of this rung: to reveal the root of his soul—as said in the introduction to <i>Shaarei Kedushah</i>, which we have cited in the beginning of <i>Hakhsharat haAvreikhim</i>—until he becomes as ‘an angel of the Lord.’ He even draws blessings to this world, for all his actions are ‘soulful.’",
                "All <i>avodah</i>, from prophecy onwards, functions in the sense of hasidism, as mentioned above from verses and statements of the Sages in which they employ the term hasid. For hasidism is not a particular defined path, but rather revelation of the soul and holiness. All additional levels of revelation, within each path throughout the generations, were called hasidism. Nonetheless, the path and revelation of the Besht, who revealed not only the light contained inside the vessels but rather that which inhered within the vessels themselves, and who demonstrated that even that which we had thought to be merely a vessel—material and concealing—from now on shone—could we call this anything other than hasidism, of a sort reaching even the vessels themselves? This, indeed, is the hasidism of the beginning of the messianic revelation, may it arrive speedily in our days.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">454</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Beshtian Hasidism is thus both heir to and continuation of all prior instantiations of ‘soulful’ <i>avodah</i>, as well as an evolution thereof, as it extends soulful piety to its fullest extent, into engagement with the material world itself, as fitting for the final rung of <i>avodah</i> before the advent of the messianic period.</i>",
                "In this, the similarity between hasidism and prophecy is more apparent. For regarding prophecy, a simple man who wanted to come close to the prophets so that their light should shine on him, would become transformed into another person [upon encountering prophets] and prophesize with them. And even if he himself would not prophesize, or if his prophesizing would cease when he was physically or spiritually distant from them, like Saul and his men, nonetheless when they came before Samuel they prophesized. So too with hasidism: even simple people, if they would be but God fearing and observant of the commandments, wholesome and faithful, would become hasidim when they cleaved unto their rebbe according to their respective stature, though hasidism is indeed a lofty level. When his students traveled to the holy Besht and his fellows, angels of God, even the simple people, workers and lease owners [Yiddish, <i>aranderin]</i> traveled as well, and he would draw them close. He would even at times send his great disciples, geniuses and righteous ones, to a simple person to learn from him some good trait, such as simplicity or trust- simple faith in the Sages or love of Israel etc… For does not the soul of Israel, a portion of God above, inhere in these [people] as well, even if not in a revealed manner? And when this person would come to his rebbe, a spark of fire would fall upon him, and his soul would come aflame with a flaming fire.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">455</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Just as a mighty fire can emit a mere spark unto kindling and ignite another fire, so too, the fire of hasidism can spark forth onto a simple hasid near his rebbe, and develop in him into a powerful force.</i> [We will speak further of this, God willing, within the book, as to why sometimes simple people have stronger faith and other simple traits, to the extent that the Besht would at times send his greatest disciples to learn from them].",
                "In the end of the <i>Noam Elimelekh</i>, in the ‘holy Epistle,’ it says that his son, the holy and righteous R. Elazar, inquired of him regarding the liturgical change which the hasidim made, from the Ashkenazic rite to that of the Sefaradim.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">456</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On this shift in liturgical rite, see Biale et al, 91 and 172.</i> His father replied that the sefaradic rite is a lofty one, with a light so great the world is unfit to use it. Therefore, the <i>Beit Yosef</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">457</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Yosef Karo, in his commentary on the <i>Arba Turim</i> code.</i> established the Ashkenazic rite in its stead, for it is equally usable by all of our stature. But certainly it was not his intention that the righteous who had washed themselves of their filth and were as punctilious with themselves as a thread of hair,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">458</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A talmudic idiom; see Talmud <i>Bava Kamma</i> 50a.</i>cease from praying with this rite.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">459</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Sephardic rite is therefore presented as the more authentic one, with the Ashkenazic rite an innovative, second-tier substitute for the average folk. Rather than themselves instituting a change in rite, as charged, the story casts the hasidism as the tradionalists, holding fast to the sacred and original Sephardic rite.</i> Now, you might challenge me [by pointing out] that there are some people who are not on this level and yet pray with this rite. [I would retort that t]his is because they are connected to the lofty hasidim and thus they too are called hasidim<i>.</i> The <i>Noam Elimelekh</i> continues on to explain, citing the verse “and they believed in God and in Moses His servant,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">460</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 14:31.</i> that Moses had sanctified himself until the level of prophecy, and ascended Above and brought the Torah down to Israel. Yet all of Israel were unable to come to his level and receive the Torah from the level of prophecy; it was on account of their belief in Moses that they tied and bound themselves to him, and he caused the Holy Spirit to flow onto them so that it was as if they too were on this level. Thus, they were all able to receive the Torah, through their being united and bound to Moses.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">461</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Comparably, even the simple hasidism are capable of attaching themselves to the divine and to divine inspiration, via their connection with the rebbe.</i> This is a summary of his words there.",
                "We might compare those hasidim, who are not truly fit to be called hasidim,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">462</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e. Members of the hasidic community and participant in its norms, but whose personality and inner life are insufficiently molded by hasidism.</i> to Israel, who were not all fit for prophecy and receipt of the Torah. Nonetheless, through their cleaving unto and belief in Moses, they were elevated and received the Torah. Yet [on the other hand], though the masters of Kabbalah sanctified those that came to them, we have never found that therefore the insights and wisdom of Kabbalah should enter suddenly into one who has not studied them. Nor have we found this with the Talmudic sages; indeed, they investigated and concluded that if one says <i>‘I did not toil yet I found, he is not to be believed.’</i> (Talmud <i>Megillah</i> 6b).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">463</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, while divine inspiration can be imbibed by osmosis via connection to one’s rebbe, one must invest in one’s studies personally in order to see results. Talmudic learning, as well as kabbalistic learning, can only be gained by personal investment.</i> The common folk were distant from them [the sages], and those who desired to come close to them were as leaves, whose entire purpose is to protect the fruit, as it says in the Talmud (Talmud <i>Hullin</i> 92).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">464</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud <i>Hullin</i> 92a: “Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: This nation is akin to a vine. The branches of the vine support the clusters of grapes [and] the leaves... The clusters of grapes are the Torah scholars. The leaves are the ignoramuses…Let the clusters pray for the leaves, for if it were not for the leaves the clusters could not live.”</i> [However, t]his is not so regarding prophecy, and especially hasidism, whose entire purpose is to expand and spread forth His holy light, even to the distant places; in which the vessels are light and even those things which appear to us as concealments are all holy. Even if he be a simple person, nevertheless by coming close to the illuminating light and the burning fire, his soul, dulled within, is lit, and his light shines, as mentioned above.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">465</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The hasidic leaders, like the prophets, have the ability to hallow and inspire even the simple and uneducated. This is a corollary of the nature of their spiritual paths, in which even the ‘vessels’—simple material existence—is revealed to be composed of divinity.</i>",
                "Further, <i>Tana d’bei Eliyahu</i> refers to these simple hasidim, as it says there in the beginning of Chapter 12:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">466</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Seder Eliyahu Zuta</i>, Chapter 12.</i> “The hasidim of the common folk, though they have not read...since they have seen to it that their sons have read and learned, and they do not worship other gods, and do not thieve nor steal, and do not engage in sexual immorality or murder, and support Torah scholars from their possessions—God brings them and seats them by the righteous, and they receive pleasure from the sun shining for the righteous, until the days of the son of David and the world to come.” This is almost exactly like the words of the <i>Noam Elimelekh:</i> since they withheld from basic transgressions and raised their children to [a life of] Torah and cleaved onto Torah scholars, Elijah calls them hasidim, who will in the next world be found by the righteous, receiving pleasure from their sun.",
                "In fact, it is just the opposite [of such elitism]! It is one of the roots of hasidism not to distance but rather to incorporate even everyday householders, even the simple folk; that they have a place in hasidism doing the ‘work of leaves,’ guarding the fruit by working and supporting them. Yet their purpose goes further than this: with their rebbe and the lofty hasidim, they too are lit, and all together they form a flaming, shining torch, illuminating the whole world with the light of God and heavenly fire. This benefits not only themselves but also the great righteous, servants of God, who ascend higher as well when they are connected to the rest of Israel, even with the common folk.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">467</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this argument, R. Shapiro balances his call for an elite fellowship with a more popular reinforcement of the value of the common hasidim. His agenda is to inspire all ranks to reinvest in their hasidism.</i>",
                "In <i>Beit Aharon, Parshat Nitzavim</i>, it says: “They tell a parable in the name of the holy righteous R. Shlomo Karliner of blessed memory: A king needed to get something from a very high place but did not have enough ladders. What did he do? He had ten men stand on each other’s shoulders until they reached this very high place etc...It is not the case that the one on the ground is superfluous, for if he would move they would all fall! So it is—actually [<i>mamash</i>]—with the holiness of the Holy Blessed One. In truth, it is impossible to grasp the blessed Creator without 600,000 of Israel, constituting the entirety of Israel—including [perforce] people of low stature. Without them, the great would not grasp the lifeforce of the blessed Creator.” They are not merely leaves guarding the fruit—rather, even the great ones could do not grasp without those of minor stature.",
                "From whence did this great capacity come, upon which the great righteous themselves ascended higher? From the fact that they maintained their position<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">468</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Alternatively, ‘kept their feet on the ground; remained rooted.’</i> and served their Creator from it. For since the Besht and his disciples drew down His holiness, spreading it even in this world, with its lowliness and vessels, every Israelite—with his body and lowliness, his particular situation, will, traits, simple faith—is able to seize onto His glory and be tied to Him.",
                "As it says in the writings of R. Asher the Great of Stolin: “One thinks that God is in Heaven but God is really in the lowest earth. Thus, every Jew can reach out and grasp Him. Even the smallest and most ordinary Jew can reach and grasp God. The only sin is for one to sleep the time and opportunity away.” Almost all of hasidism is summed up in these holy words.",
                "We can even see that hasidism has its own path regarding divine inspiration [<i>ruakh hakodesh</i>]. For it says in <i>Shaarei Kedushah</i> 3:7: “Regarding the practice of achieving divine inspiration nowadays...one should do not despair...for we have heard with our own ears and seen with our own eyes how unique individuals have achieved the level of divine inspiration in these very times; they would offer portends, and among them were holders of wisdom which had not been revealed in prior generations.” The author thus says that even now we can achieve divine inspiration and offer portends not seen by prior generations. Yet he does not explain the reason for this ability to merit even more than prior generations.",
                "The hasidic masters, however, <i>do</i> explain this matter through their path of <i>avodah</i> and revelation of holiness, as it says in <i>Noam Elimelekh Parshat Vayeshev:</i> “I have heard a sweet parable on this matter from the mouth of the <i>Maggid</i> of Rivne:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">469</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, R. Dov Ber, the ‘Maggid of Mezeritch,’ who moved to Rivne (Ukraine) towards the end of his life.</i> “We see that when we are in the bitter exile, there are some who merit divine inspiration with more ease than in the days of the prophets, who required many oaths and meditations, as is known, in order to achieve prophecy and divine inspiration. He offers a wondrous and sweet parable of a king who remains in his palace etc... and a certain admirer of the king comes, wanting to invite the king to a feast at his own home. Certainly the king will become angry with him, for it is not in accordance with his honor to leave his own palace for someone else’s home, even if there be some great feast there; and it is impossible for this person to fully prepare and appoint advisors to intervene and convince the king to join him. Yet, when the king is traveling and wants to spend the night on the road, then as long as he finds someplace clean—a clean inn, even if it be in some village—then this is his lodge for the night. The analogy is self-explanatory: When the Temple stood, with His Presence (<i>Shekhinah</i>) residing in the Holy of Holies, when one wished to draw forth from the Holy Spirit or prophecy, he required great <i>avodah</i>...but now, in the exile, when the <i>Shekhinah</i> has been exiled with us, with Her great desire being to find a place to reside in, if She finds a clean place to rest—a person clean of transgression and sins, then that is Her lodging.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">470</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ironically, and stated strongly: the more exilic one’s existential state is—that is, the more distant one’s generational state is from God—the easier it is to access Him!</i>",
                "In <i>Maor vaShemesh Parshat Vayigash</i> it says, “When one comes to a state of humility and subjugation, then he is automatically stripped of his physicality a bit… and is left in a spiritual state, connecting himself to the upper worlds...This is known, and I have seen it among the greats and the righteous ones. When they connected to the upper worlds, they were stripped of their physical garb; the <i>Shekhinah</i> rested upon them and spoke from their throats, their mouths uttering prophecies and portends.”",
                "Why, then, is it more possible nowadays to merit divine inspiration than it was in the days of the prophets? Because after the destruction of the Temple, the light was drawn farther down, even to the exile, as mentioned above from the great <i>Maggid</i>. How can one draw himself closer so that he too might merit divine inspiration? By humbling himself, as mentioned earlier in the <i>Maor vaShemesh</i>. This is their holy path—to draw light down even to the vessels and lowliness. They ascended to the Heavens via the earth, and traveled through Eden, and debated the angels and laid themselves before the Throne of Glory and intervened on behalf of Israel. All this through their path, the path of the lowly: drawing and revealing the light even in the lowliness, such that even in the low places, His divinity is present.",
                "We have already spoken in <i>Hakhsharat haAvreikhim</i>, chapter 10, of the meaning of “The Lord is God in Heaven above and the Earth below, there is no other”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">471</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 4:39.</i>—not only is there no other divinity besides Him, there is no <i>existence</i> besides Him. There is no existence other than divine existence, and nothing happens which God has done made happen. Everything is divinity and every occurrence, God has made. The <i>avodah</i> of the Israelite is to see, reveal, and expand His divine illumination- inside himself, in his surroundings, both exalted and lowly. There should be nothing in them other than His divinity, will, and instruction/Torah. As in says in <i>Beit Aharon</i> to <i>Sukkot</i>, “I have heard of R. Menakhem Mendel of Baar [a disciple of the Besht] that he would always pray with his eyes cast downwards, because he was searching for a very low place, for there as well is His divinity and lifeforce, ‘and there is no place free of Him.’”",
                "Returning to our topic above: even simple folk, when they travel to the rebbe and connect with the hasidim, are called hasidim as well. This is as we cited above from the holy epistle in the <i>Noam Elimelekh</i> regarding the sefaradic rite. True, the essence of hasidism is geared towards the learned and masters of Kabbalah, as we cited from the holy works to the effect that only masters of Kabbalah can grasp the path of the Besht, learning not only with their intellects but rather as men of the heart, minds ablaze with holy flames. However, when all are connected together, they receive from one another, to the extent that the lofty hasidim cannot ascend without the smaller ones and common folk, as we cited from R. Shlomo Karliner regarding the king who needed to reach something high and assembled ten men, one on top of the other. They all need to help one another: the lofty ones helping the smaller ones and common folk, and vice-versa, as in the parable, one standing on the other. In general, hasidism is not for people on one particular stature, but rather for all. It is a revelation of the soul for all, to each according to his situation and <i>avodah</i>. As the Messiah said to the Besht, he would come when ‘your springs spread outwards;’ with a stress on the word <i>outwards</i>, meaning to all. For this purpose, the holy fellowship <i>[hevraya kaddishah]</i> is needed."

                "Chapter 8 <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">472</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Chapter Eight, R. Shapiro stresses the need to reinstate the hasidic practices of travel to the rebbe, of forming a holy fellowship of elite disciples <i>[hevraya kaddishah],</i> and of the <i>kest</i> system in which young men are supported by their parents or in-laws so that they are free to focus on their studies and spiritual growth. These practices are deemed to be absolutely critical preconditions for the cultivation of true hasidim and <i>of</i> hasidism; their dissolution is implicated in hasidism’s contemporaneous decline.</i> <br>As we said, the term ‘hasid’ derives from the word ‘<i>hessed</i>,’ which is ‘one long one,’ that is, that the light spreads farther. The Besht worked to spread the light to vessels and bodies as well. This is Rashi’s intent when he explains the term “soulful one’ [<i>baal nefesh</i>] as “hasid” —for such a person’s soul is revealed, without any concealment, since the light extends even to his otherwise concealing body.",
                "Therefore, hasidism is focused not only on the mind and intellectual apprehension but rather also on <i>avodah</i> which involves the entire person, including his traits, senses, and inclinations. Each hasid is constituted of light, and he must utilize all components of his selfhood in service of God, transforming himself into a fiery flame. Similarly, when hasidim come to their rebbe, it is not merely in order to listen to his words with their ears, but rather in order that the(it) lights should be connected and that at that moment, the giver [<i>mashpiah</i>] and the receivers should cleave together, as occurs with the <i>sefirotic</i> unifications. True, they are indeed in need of his Torah and guidance. Yet, these are only efficacious when they are also connected and unified—this one giving to that, this one receiving from that.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">473</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The language here alludes Isaiah’s vision (6:3) of the angels calling out, one to the other (<i>zeh el zeh</i>), as they praise God.</i> This is how they rectify themselves, this world, and the upper worlds.

into a hasid—then he will not reach even the edge of hasidism. So too, if he does not travel to a rebbe, or does [perfunctorily] travel but not as a hasid must travel, and is not as a hasid must be when he is with his rebbe, without effecting the aforementioned unifications—then he, too, is not a hasid. The descent of hasidism in our generation, in which even many hasidim do not know what hasidism is—a question we have pursued in <i>Hakhsharat haAvreikhim</i> and here—may be to a large degree based on this error. People wish to understand hasidism only intellectually, but not through <i>avodah</i>; they treat it lightly even when they travel to the rebbe, and their travels are thus not ‘hasidic,’ as they need be.",
                "Let us see the distinction between the travels of prior days, as expressed in the holy works, especially <i>Maor vaShemesh</i>, and as we have heard from the elder hasidim, and the travels of the hasid nowadays:",
                "Back then, when an individual, an <i>avreikh,</i> would serve God in Torah and <i>avodah</i>, and desired to sanctify himself—yet saw that it was difficult for him, that though he desired and yearned for all of himself that all his desires and thoughts and traits would be sanctified to God yet nonetheless there was much dross in them... He would become anxious and embittered, saying “Do I not see that I am distant from God, God forbid! What will be my life’s purposes hereon in? Shall I remain banished from holiness, God forbid, stuck in filth, Heaven forfend?!” Moved by his great anxiety and bitterness, he would say “I shall travel to my Rebbe! There, on the mountain of God’s house,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">475</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Shapiro frames the visit to the rebbe in the image of the ancient pilgrimage to the Temple, a common rabbinic and especially hasidic motif. See, for example, Biale et al, 415.</i> the evil inclination has no control. The Rebbe will instruct me in the holy path, and seize me by my sidelocks <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">476</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This possibly alludes to a saying of R. Nahman of Bratslav to the effect that he would do all he could to redeem his disciples, even pulling them out of Hell by their sidelocks. See Biale et al, 117.</i> and remove me from my lowliness. I will become connected to him, and he will perforce purify me and elevate me to the One who is pure. Yet, terror will seize him, for the rebbe will recognize all the not-good things he has done; and at the same time, this is his is very desire-to show the rebbe all his blemishes so that he might purify him. And he, the rebbe—in him he puts his life’s hope, both for this world and the next. With a broken heart and with this hope, he goes to the rebbe. The path itself becomes, immediately, one of repentance, for where does he go? To ‘gaze upon the beauty of the Lord, to frequent His temple.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">477</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 27: 4.</i> Thus, it is to God that he is returning. Whether he feels like Israel of yesteryear, as they traveled to go up to God’s house, to ‘appear<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">478</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Vocalized in Feldheim printing as <i>lirot</i>, to see, rather than <i>leraot</i>, to be seen or to appear, as per the Masoretic vocalization.</i> before the Sovereign, the Lord’ <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">479</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 23:17.</i> or as a soul Above, released from Hell and being led to Eden, there to derive pleasure from the glow of the <i>Shekhinah</i>, along with the other righteous souls—either way, as he travels, he feels supernal yearning and the joy of Eden.",
                "Usually along the way he meets other hasidim who are traveling to their rebbe as well, or perhaps they are traveling to his rebbe. The caravan travels on—far from the city and from other people with their freneticism and ambitions—with one heart and desire, to seek the face of God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">480</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Psalms, ibid. v. 8.</i> They tell each other of their soul’s blemishes, and of how his rebbe has helped him already, and how just as they wash their clothes, his rebbe—literally!- washes his soul. Yet, they caution one another, before we arrive at the rebbe’s, we must repent, lest the rebbe find it distasteful to approach us, to seize and raise us up.",
                "How great is the fear as well as the desire, when the hasid sees his rebbe’s city while yet afar—and all the more so when he is in the rebbe’s chambers. In <i>Maor vaShemesh Parshat Devarim,</i> it says that when the hasid comes to the house and his rebbe’s chambers, he would be in such a state of fear and terror that he would no longer know where he was. And in <i>Parshat Ki Tisa</i> it says, that through this fear of the hasid to approach the rebbe, to ‘trample upon his courtyard,’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">481</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 1:12.</i> he would come to fear of God’s greatness, for he would think, “Why am I so fearful of this <i>tzaddik</i>? It is from nothing other than the holiness of God’s existence, Who is here with the <i>tzaddik</i>, dwelling with and connected with him.” Through this, he arrives at such fear.",
                "Indeed, he has seen his rebbe many times; and yet, can he express with words that which he feels from the ‘peace unto you’ [‘<i>shalom aleikhem</i>,’a traditional salutation] when he greets his holy face? How great is his desire for him then—his heart and his entire soul are so drawn to the rebbe, till he is prepared to give over all of himself in order to draw close and cleave unto him. [Note: See in the holy book <i>Avodat Yisrael</i> On <i>Avot</i> 2:9, <i>s.v. Amar R. Yose</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">482</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Israel Hopstein’s commentary on Mishnah <i>Avot.</i> In <i>Avot</i> 2:9, the sage R. Yose is cited as directing one [ostensibly, his students] to ‘go forth and see/discern’ the proper path to take. R. Hopstein interprets this to mean that even R. Yose’s great disciples were to ‘go forth/down’ from their lofty spiritual states in order to ‘see to’ the needs of the world around them.</i> He [even] desires to bend over and place himself before him as his footstool. And with how much desire does the rebbe extend his hand to him, and with how loving rebuke, from a hidden love, does he look upon him. This already suffices—he already feels his rebbe’s effect upon him. He runs to the house of study and throws himself entirely into Torah and <i>avodah</i>. Yet, his desire so burns within him that he will not be sated by the pieces of Torah he now learns. His heart burns inside for God as a furnace, as a flaming timber he is entirely aflame, ‘unsatisfied by wealth.’ But this is the very reason he has come to the rebbe: to sanctify him and bring him closer to God, more than he could do on his own. For though it is true that the rebbe himself is higher than his grasp, nonetheless from that which he is able to grasp of him, he sees that there is no screen dividing his rebbe and his Creator. The <i>Shekhinah</i> rests upon him, and he—all his actions, including his eating and drinking and speech, each movement of his eyelids—all are done for God’s sake. The rebbe is entirely Above, cleaving unto God, with but a bit [residing] in this world. Thus, when the hasid cleaves to his rebbe, he cleaves to the <i>Shekhinah</i>.",
                "So pass a couple of days before the Sabbath. Already, the hasid sees that he has turned into a different person. In repentance he returns to God, allowing his soul to pour forth its bitterness, and with his elevated state he allows his soul to arise and rejoice in God. If only he could be at home as he is now, before the Sabbath! And yet—as the Sabbath draws near, then, during the prayers, during the rebbe’s sanctification blessing [<i>kiddush]</i> and holy tables (Yiddish: <i>tishen</i>)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">483</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For more on the institution of the <i>tish</i>, see Biale et al, 194-197.</i> that he conducts, he can literally feel how his rebbe pushes aside this world, drawing down the supernal worlds in its place. Especially when the rebbe shares words of Torah, they all feel as if he has broken open the heavens and brought down Torah from <i>Atzilut</i> to <i>Beriyah</i>, to <i>Yetzirah</i>, to <i>Asiyah</i>. His words appear, at first blush, like simple words of <i>Asiyah</i>, yet one who discerns sees how all the worlds are in fact present. And from the very manner of the rebbe’s speech, they can see how he is at that moment Above, speaking to them the word of God from there.",
                "For a few weeks, the hasidim stayed by their rebbe, and through his hasidic path they served God and rectified themselves, along with the other hasidim and with the holy cohort. Occasionally they would enter into the ‘sanctum’ to inquire regarding various matters of <i>avodah</i>, whether in action or speech or thought; as well as matters regarding apprehension of His divinity, revealed to each according to his stature in the hasidic path. All this they sought from the rebbe, and he would instruct each according to his situation: at times with rebuke, at others by raising up. As for them—all of the rebbe’s words and expressions, on the Sabbath and during the week, as well as in the tales he would tell him—-they imbibed them all, all of these entering into their heads and limbs down to the nails on their feet. They all—the rebbe and the hasidim—ascended through this, as a holy soul which, upon encountering a holy body, enters into it, both being built up and growing through this.",
                "The first insight gleaned by the hasid as he lived in the rebbe’s shadow was that service of God is not something that can be done with casual effort. Even if one would not violate positive nor negative commandments, God forbid, nonetheless it is possible that he might yet not be considered a servant of God, and be yet quite far from being a hasid. Our Sages said (BM 30b) <i>“Jerusalem was only destroyed because they ruled according to Torah law.”</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">484</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this reading, the Sages are arguing that Jerusalem was destroyed because its inhabitants were merely observant of the Torah, without recognizing that that is insufficient. God desires servants and hasidim, beyond merely observance.</i>",
                "And in <i>Divrei Elimelekh</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">485</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Elimelekh Shapiro of Grodzhisk (1823-1892), father of the author.</i> on Purim it says in the name of my grandfather, the genius and holy of Mogielnica,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">486</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, note 333.</i> who remarked in his great humility: “When I gaze into the Torah, I find myself in it a bit; yet when I gaze at the holy <i>tzaddikim</i> who are on this earth, I do not find myself at all compared to them.” Every limb, every ligament and fiber of flesh must serve God, striving in this effort. Each discrete thought, every individual will and speech and action, has its own <i>avodah</i>, be it in the sense of turning from the evil in it or raising it through His service. The essence of it all is effort and hard work. When a hasid does such by his rebbe, he begins to recognize a bit of the greatness of His divinity. For this is not able to be apprehended by knowledge alone, nor through the intellect can we draw down the revelation of hasidism, which is a kind of prophecy. This can only be done by sanctifying all of oneself through effort.",
                "In <i>Maor vaShemesh, Parshat Shemot</i>, it says that this [sanctification] was acquired by traveling to [be under] the shade<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">487</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Psalms 84:11.</i> of the rebbe. He says that “the essence of all <i>avodah</i> is to understand that there is a God, Who rules and guides all the worlds with individualized providence, and that there is no place devoid of Him. However, this requires great effort. To truly understand this, one must meditate alone and examine oneself in all matters, to oversee oneself in each and every movement; and one’s heart must be aflame like a burning fire in enthusiasm and yearning for the Creator. Through this he may come to truly know of His divinity. This is the essence of everything...and this is the essence of travel to the rebbe, to stand in the generation’s <i>tzaddik</i>’s shade in order to come through this to know that He is the essence and root of all worlds.”",
                "The <i>Maor vaShemesh</i> continues on to say that it was not just the <i>bnai aliyah</i> among the hasidim of yesteryear who achieved such a state by traveling to their rebbe. Rather, any hasid willing to dedicate himself to this <i>avodah</i>, even those who bodies were still ‘physical,’ merited this. In brief we might say that a hasid who searches for God and desires to come close to Him, when he returns from his travels would know and recognize that He is the only existent, with nothing else besides him. There is no physicality nor materiality nor any existence in any of the worlds—rather, all is divinity. He too, the hasid, is His divine illumination, with no other existence in him. All his doings, all day and all night, in thought, speech, and action, even the pedestrian—all are <i>avodah</i> to God.",
                "When he returns from these travels to his home, he strengthened himself mightily to practice in the hasidic path, the path of God, which he had traveled along while in his rebbe’s home. Even if he is a merchant at home, working to earn a living as he had done before—he remains a hasid in all these activities, a hasid and servant of God who also [happens to] work for a living. After some time, when he can no longer abide his yearning and missing of his rebbe, he travels there again. He finds that his rebbe has become more elevated since the last time, and that he, the hasid, receives more from him and has become elevated in [a] specific <i>avodah</i>, and in hasidism generally.",
                "Such was the level of the travels of yesteryear. What a state they are in nowadays, when Israel’s troubles have increased and they are preoccupied with things which embitter their lives, may God have mercy on them! There are times that the Israelite doesn’t even know if he is alive. Satan arises before our sons and daughters in the form of ideological parties [<i>miflagot</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">488</sup><i class=\"footnote\">E.g. communism, zionism, and socialism.</i> to poison their souls and defile their bodies with heresy and other disgusting, filthy sins, may God have mercy on them. There are some houses in which, when the father returns from the ritual bathhouse [<i>mikveh</i>] and prayer on Friday night, dressed in his sabbath finery, and wants to enthusiastically and passionately arouse the holiness of God and holiness of the sabbath whilst making <i>kiddush—</i> and at the very same time, his son is smoking cigarettes, may God have mercy; or reading romance novels which defile the soul and body alike, may God have mercy; or the children are discussing the defilement they read about or saw in the theaters; or some or even all of them leave the pure Israelite home at this time and go to the theaters, to sin and defile themselves and all of Israel.",
                "And the father who sees this, his heart quakes and his thoughts ring. All his enthusiasm falls away, and instead of elevated joy, he feels depressed. At first he becomes angry and bitter, even despising his very life. But as time goes on, he becomes used to his fall and lowliness. As a prince who had long been in captivity among the drunkards and the vacuous, he too loses his lofty spirit and wisdom and remains as a dumbfounded simpleton, like a villager who knows nothing beyond his sustenance and livelihood, a man without aspirations nor lofty yearnings. And if he sometimes will remember his past days, when he was an <i>avreikh</i>, a hasid, a student of Torah [<i>ben Torah</i>], and will want to strengthen and arouse himself—again, he falls when he remarks, “What am I and what is my life?!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">489</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A reference to the liturgical confessionary prayer.</i> The days of the workweek are hellish, and this is my Jewish home, and this is my holy Sabbath?! I am distant from God, God forbid, banished from His holy Temple.” All his prayers are despairing, his commandments performed shame-facedly, as he says, ‘what do I have to do with them [i.e. the commandments]?’ In the midst of this depression and fall, he might recall himself and say, ‘I shall travel to my rebbe on the Sabbath.’ Yet many preoccupations and sorrows prevent him from fulfilling this desire. When he is finally able to travel, it is late Friday afternoon, and by Saturday night he is already rushing to return to the Hell in which he is forced to suffer and boil in its streams, may God have mercy. And what is he like over the Sabbath? On Friday night, he is exhausted, a pounding mill in his head from the noise of the market and business and home which he has fled from. He pays no heed to the fact that he is a hasid sitting now with his rebbe.",
                "Even when his rebbe says Torah, he either dozes or is unable to focus his mind, and reduce his thoughts to listen to him. He hears the words, yet like a preoccupied one full of travails who passes by the house of study and hears the voices of the students speaking pleasantries of Torah—partial admission [<i>modeh bamiktzat</i>], total denial [<i>kofer bakol</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">490</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmudic discussions in e.g. Talmud <i>Bava Metziah</i> Chapter 1.</i> the Sabbath domains, two which are four,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">491</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishna <i>Shabbat</i> 1:1. R. Shapiro is referring to commonly studied Talmudic passages.</i> etc…—and reminds himself that he too once learned [Torah]. Yet now, he cannot put together what they are saying. So too, he does not understand what his rebbe is saying—broken words ring in his mind as shattered vessels: hasidism, lofty and lower fear, love, to rectify and purify himself, feeling, <i>sefirot</i>. They merely agitate his spirit. Throughout the whole Sabbath he feels himself distanced—what does he have, what has he do to with hasidism and <i>avodah</i>? Sometimes he doesn’t even understand why the rebbe continues to demand hasidism and lofty <i>avodah</i> from us [sic]? What do we have to do with greatness, what do we have to do with lofty hasidism??",
                "After the Sabbath, he hurries to give the rebbe his written request, and pour out his broken soul, bent over with many sorrows, God have mercy. Then, he rushes out on his way. On the road or back at home, he finds, at times, that even worse thoughts - thoughts bordering on heresy—plague him, God have mercy. Even if this be only on occasion, it is enough to be saddening, for on account of his falling and distance from hasidism, he felt nothing in his travels. He thinks, ‘how have the Rabbis helped us?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">492</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A Talmudic idiom; see e.g. Talmud Sanhedrin 99b.</i> What did I gain from my travel? Has the rebbe increased my fear of Haven? I feel nothing. I do not see that he imbued me with any good trait. The <i>tzaddik</i>im of prior generations raised up the hasid by force and blew into him the spirit of repentance and hasidism. But I am now just as I was before my travels.’ After a couple months, when his friends ask him if he will travel to the rebbe again, he gives them excuses as to why he will not, while thinking in his heart “I did not see how my travels helped. Even my material situation has not improved since then.”",
                "He will not realize that regarding the early <i>tzaddik</i>im, who were truly able to purify and cleanse souls in such a lofty manner that we have no grasp, the hasidim came to listen and stayed by their rebbe for some time.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">493</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, he is forgetting the ‘student’s obligation’ to invest in his own spiritual growth.</i> And, if they were not able to stay for a long duration, they did come more regularly. All their desire was focused on receiving even one thing, even a movement or hint from their rebbe. They inclined their hearts to receive the light and holiness which the rebbe would send directly into their hearts without words nor speech.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">494</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Psalms 19:4.</i> Nor will he consider [the difference between] how the hasid traveled then and how he does now, as mentioned above; and how we no longer have among us the holy sages, and how even they were different, some quick to learn and slow to forget, others slow to learn and quick to forget,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">495</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Mishnah <i>Avot</i> 5:12.</i>etc., and, how it is impossible to inspire one who travels so infrequently. Even would the rebbe gird all his strength for an entire Sabbath in order to cleanse him and remove his garments and raise up his troubled soul and revive it from its weariness until it is capable of receiving of the rays of light he sends it—still, one Sabbath alone will not suffice. Especially when so much time passes between each visit until he returns, so that the rebbe’s <i>avodah</i> during the first visit has already weakened.",
                "In <i>Maor vaShemesh</i> (<i>ibid</i>), he cites in the name of the holy Rabbi, the holy lamp Menahem Mendel<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">496</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Menakhem Mendel of Rimanov, c. 1745-1815.</i> that one who goes in circles wondering how to serve God but without grasping the answer, and encounters obstacles and separations and cannot learn or pray properly, and his heart is bitter so he goes to some <i>tzaddik</i> hoping that perhaps he will discover some respite for his soul—then he benefits the <i>tzaddik</i> as well, and through this the <i>tzaddik</i> is able to raise up that man in divine service. This is not the case when one does not pursue service of God and does not go humbly to the <i>tzaddik</i>, in which case he does not cause the <i>tzaddik</i> to rise in his own service of God, nor is there any benefit to that man [this was true even regarding the earlier <i>tzaddik</i>im].",
                "Consider: Why are there some of your fellow hasidim who <i>do</i> feel in their travels a spirit of purity and betterment, even now? [Why are] there among them some for whom in every prayer and <i>tish</i> a new spark shines within them, as they know that it is only through their hasidic path that they hold onto the holiness of Israel, and that were it not for hasidism they would already be as naught, God forbid? Even when they are back in their home, their rebbe inspires them with a spirit of awakening in Torah, <i>avodah</i>, and prayer. And further, why should you complain about your physical situation, which unfortunately has not been bettered God forbid after your travels? Do you not know that it is a time of sorrows for Jacob and that in general Israel is afflicted and pursued more than any other nation? And besides this, recall that when our father Jacob came to bless Manasseh and Ephraim, he reversed his hands, placing the on Ephraim before Manasseh; and when Joseph inquired about this, he replied that the younger brother would become great.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">497</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 48.</i> Why, then, did he not bless the older that he become greater than the younger; after all, Joseph had not asked him to tell the future but rather to bless them—so let him bless the older that he at least not be lesser than his younger brother! This story implies that blessings are also contingent on the one who receives them. Two people may be blessed and prayed for, yet the prayers and blessings work more for one than the other, for the faith of the one being blessed has a great effect. Yet this too [i.e. the level of faith in blessing] is not one what it once was.",
                "And yet, even the hasidim who do travel with a sense of connection and yearning to receive hasidism feel the effect which hasidism is already affecting them: the Sabbath and holidays which they spend with their rebbe are among the best of their lives, lofty like the days of yore and of Eden, pure amongst the desolate desert of the profane days of this world filled with lowliness and haughtiness. Even the travels of these [contemporary] hasidim are unlike those of the earlier hasidim, especially as regards dwelling in their rebbe’s house with the other hasidim [which is no longer practiced], along with other practices.",
                "Because of this, not only has hasidism itself descended, but also many practices have been forgotten. Not only the inner practices performed within the heart and soul of the hasidim, hidden within, but also many external practices which they performed in order to arouse their souls and activate themselves internally. And, even of those practices which had not been forgotten, many nonetheless appear to be superfluous to the hasidim of our generation, and are paid no heed.",
                "As a rule, the essence of hasidism is not inscribed in a book, but rather in the <i>hasidim</i> themselves, in the sense of “This is the book of man’s lineage.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">498</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 5:1. JPS translates “This is the record of Adam’s line.” R. Shapiro interprets the verse along the lines of “Man’s life and legacy is a book.”</i> The person(s)—the hasidim—are the text(s) of hasidism : their travels and work on themselves and their emotions, how they worked to reach each ‘line of light’ and vitality in fulfilling the commandments and in prayer and the various levels of hasidism, and how they experienced themselves at each point. Only a bit of this is recorded in the holy books, and even that which is written is not organized as a ‘<i>Shulkhan Arukh’</i> [Code of Jewish Law] with straightforward commandments so that a hasid might follow them all proceeding from strength to strength, first one then the next, and with alternative directives if one piece of advice doesn’t work, and highlighting pitfalls if one does arise to a certain level, etc… This is on account of the aforementioned point, that the essential locus and story of hasidism inheres in the very selfhood of the hasidim. It is not written in some book how one who wants to be a hasid should practice, because each <i>avreikh</i> who joins the hasidim in their physical and spiritual work on themselves, under the guidance of their rebbe, becomes a hasid.",
                "Now, we do find recorded in the holy books many <i>etzot</i> and practices. We have already cited from the Besht of the need for strategies in <i>avodah</i>, and from the <i>Maor vaShemesh</i> that we need new strategies from time to time. At that time, when they would direct someone to be aroused in love or fear, they did so with their holy spirit, for the <i>tzaddikim</i> were able to draw forth a holy fire from Above to each of the hasidim. They also gave <i>etzot</i>, like the ‘<i>words of the living God</i>’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">499</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An allusion to Talmud <i>Eruvin</i> 13b.</i> which we cited from the <i>Noam Elimelekh</i>: how one should gaze at the Heavens and see the stars in their paths, and envision the Holy Temple built before him etc… And in <i>Beit Aharon</i>, how he should envision that he is in lying in a grave, afflicted, and they say to him ‘stand and pray!’ etc… And the tune which the Besht instructed should be sung before almost any Torah is spoken. And as cited in <i>Beit Aharon</i>, “<i>Tashuri meRosh Amunah</i>”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">500</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 4:8. JPS renders “<i>Trip down from Amana’s peak</i>.” In this Yiddish saying, R. Aharon plays on the terms ‘<i>tashuri,’</i> relating it to a root meaning ‘sing,’ and ‘<i>amana</i>,’ relating it to a root meaning ‘faith.’</i> –the greater a Jew’s faith, the more he will sing his head off.”",
                "And in the <i>Likkutim Yekarim</i> (an anthology from the Besht and his students, published in 1850), other general guidelines are cited, such as how one should engage in personal meditation <i>[hitbodedut</i>] whether alone or even with others in the room; and how before prayer, one should not recite many chapters of Psalms in a state of <i>dveykut</i>, lest one’s body thereafter become tired [during the course of the prayers] and he becomes unable to pray further with dveykut. On Yom Kippur, before [the closing prayer of] <i>Neilah</i>, he should recite from the prayerbook in a state of narrow consciousness [<i>mokhin dekatnut],</i> so that he be able to pray the closing prayer of <i>Neilah</i> with great <i>dveykut</i>. For when one is in narrow consciousness, he can pray from a prayerbook; yet when one is cleaving to the supernal world, it is better that he pray with his eyes shut. He should think of how it would be good for God to help him pray half, or most of, the prayers with <i>dveykut</i>, and afterwards when he is tired, he should pray with as much focus as he can till the final <i>Alenu</i> prayer. Even when he merits to ‘ascend,’ it is written how he should experience his feelings: “When he speaks from [within a state of] <i>dveykut</i> with the supernal world, without any foreign thoughts, and a thought comes to him as a prophecy, it will certainly be as follows etc…..At times, he will hear something speaking, for the supernal voice will have cleaved to his prayer and the sound of his Torah study, and he will hear a voice issuing portends…”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">501</sup><i class=\"footnote\">All these are examples of the <i>etzot</i> and practices recorded in hasidic texts. While it is true, R. Shapiro argues (in this book!) that hasidism cannot be truly conveyed via a book, texts can provide some examples of practices and strategies. True spiritual direction, though, requires in -person mentorship.</i>",
                "Even the [practices of] drinking of liquor, dances, and conversations among <i>hasidim</i> which are indeed still practiced have become weakened, if not discontinued entirely, as if they were superfluities. Many contemporary hasidim think, “Can we not be hasidim if we don’t drink liquor etc?! It is not mentioned in the <i>Shulkhan Arukh</i>, nor do we find this commanded in hasidic works.” They do not understand that even if these things are not commandments in of themselves, they are meant to cause an awakening of hasidism within a person. It has come to the point that there are some hasidim who are identical to any other fervent [non-hasidic] Jew, and furthermore have no understanding of what hasidism requires of those who are drawn after it. Is this the meaning of ‘<i>your springs will spread outwards’</i> on which the Messiah rests his coming, may it be speedily in our days? Torah learning, too, has diminished in our days, and people do not learn as before; but at least one who still learns does indeed learn a bit.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">502</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Though the quantity of Torah learning had diminished, the time still dedicated to such study was beneficial. This is in contrast to contemporary practice of hasidism, R. Shapiro bemoans, which has become so diluted that its adherents can scarcely be called hasidim at all.</i> Yet this is not the case with their practice of hasidism. For if even those who are called hasidim and truly desire to be connected to the righteous Besht and his disciples, if even they hold onto nothing —neither great nor small—of the hasidism of the Besht, they are not truly hasidim. We can only call them students of Torah, scrupulous in the performance of the commandments, just like non-hasidim. If so, what will become of hasidism, and what will be with the coming of the Messiah?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">503</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Talmud <i>Berakhot</i> 35b.</i>",
                "Part B<br>Let the heart of every hasid be weakened on account of the decrease of hasidic inner spiritual effort and the almost entire cessation of external hasidic efforts and strategies. All the more, the greatest reason for mourning is the complete disappearance of that great foundation of hasidism, the holy fellowship [<i>hevraya kadisha</i>]. It is clear that without it, hasidism cannot exist as it must, for even a day or two. The rebbe cannot be the rebbe hasidism requires of him, nor the hasidim truly be hasidim, without this fellowship. It all, literally, totally, ceases to be.",
                "When I search for the model of such a fellowship in the Torah, I discover it in the ‘students of the prophets,’ which includes the prophets of each generation, those whose words were not recorded. Even regarding the supernal <i>sefirot</i>, each can only receive in accordance to its influence on the <i>sefirah</i> below it. When Moses our Rabbi, father of the prophets, saw how Israel had fallen from their yearning and supernal cleaving, as they requested meat for pleasure, he said to the Holy Blessed One: “If You would deal thus with me, [kill me rather]...and let me see no more my wretchedness;” and He said to him, “Gather for Me seventy of Israel’s elders...and I will draw upon the spirit that is on you and put it on them…”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">504</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 11: 15-16.</i> God chose seventy men to be with him for the reason we have explained: because Israel could not receive greatness, a casting of light and continuous prophecy, as before, which is why Moses called it “my wretchedness”—that is, a deficiency which affects the giver as well. Therefore, and from then on in, He would give to the seventy elders—“and I will draw upon the spirit which is on you and put it on them.” That is, through them [i.e. the elders,] Moses too could receive [prophecy], or reveal that which he had already received. And through them, they and Moses spiritually influenced all of Israel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">505</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So too, the rebbe himself can only sustain his spiritual level through the support and influence of his devoted hasidim, members of the fellowship.</i>",
                "We see something similar regarding the other prophets. Whether or not they had prophecies, portends, or chastisement to give over to Israel at a given time, the prophet and his disciples gathered together nonetheless to serve God with a supernal, prophetic <i>avodah</i>. The prophet revealed the light which appeared on him, and they in turn were illuminated by his light and also spread additional light upon him. As the verse states [I Samuel 19:20], “They saw a band of prophets speaking in prophecy, with Samuel sanding by as their leader;” and the Targum [Jonathan] translates, “...a band of prophets were praising <i>[meshabkhin]</i>.” This indicates that the prophet gave onto them all of his light from Above, and even the servants of Saul prophesied when they came under his holy shade. Yet, how could this be possible, that the prophet would give over the majority of his light to people who spend their whole year in vineyards and olive-groves, only coming to him occasionally? Can one build a prophet from this, with all his loftiness and influence, to people preoccupied with this world and its needs, even be they servants of God?! If this is what the prophet and his disciples needed, they would be established by him continuously, praising and serving His name with him. Some of them merited thereafter to become one of the forty-eight prophets, and the others were at the least prophets for their own generations, as we said above. They prepared their generation, purifying and elevating it to be able to receive actual effluence of holiness, souls, <i>sefirot</i>, and the spirit of God which He sent him.",
                "We have already spoken of the fellowship in <i>Hakhsharat haAvreikhim</i> Chapter 11, but there we spoke primarily to our generation, of how even now we could renew it. That is why we requested of the greatest of the lay hasidim—those with mastery of Torah and understanding of hasidism, each according to his stature, and who want to serve God in the hasidic path—to together form a fellowship. This is not how it was before, when the holy fellowship was formed from those who stood above the hasidim who worked [to earn a living]. While, except for those <i>avreikhim</i> who were supported by their parents, there were hasidim who were engaged in a greater or lesser extent in earning a living, the fellowship itself consisted entirely of people who threw the whole world behind their backs and dedicated their entire being to Torah and hasidic <i>avodah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">506</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The challenge now, R. Shapiro states, is to form a fellowship of hasidim who must work to earn a living. Hence the importance of reinstituting the kest system (cf. below), freeing up <i>avreikhim</i> to renew the fellowship with full dedication of resources.</i>",
                "We said there that, generally speaking, all of the members of the fellowship grew to become rebbes and leaders. We must elaborate and explain that many of these holy fellows, even when they traveled to their own rebbe, were already righteous, worthy of being rebbes and leaders. Yet they did not act as such, tending their own flocks in Israel, because of the great shepherd standing over them—their rebbe, greater than they, who sated and soaked their bodies and souls with Edenic dew. They could not slake their thirst and stop suckling from his holy influence and turn to nursing others.",
                "We can, in small measure, gather the extent to which they were already ‘rebbes,’ though not functioning as leaders, while in the shade of their own rebbe, from the fact that on one Rosh Hashanah eve, the Besht gave a request with his name and that of his mother along with redemption money to his student R. Dov Ber, as is known from the discovered letters.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">507</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From the Kherson Genizah; see below, note 490.</i> Further, the Besht appointed R. Dov Ber to fill his role when he was traveling away from home. We can also surmise in some measure the great holiness of the fellows while still in the shade of their rebbe from the honor shown them by the rebbe. For example, the Besht, in his letter to the holy R. David Lakis, writes “Peace to the honorable one, beloved of my soul, the righteous holy rabbi, man of God, our master and rabbi.” And to the holy rabbi, author of <i>Toledo Yaakov Yosef,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">508</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Yaakov Yosef of Polyenne, an older contemporary and eventual disciple of Besht. See Biale et al, 62-67.</i><i></i> he writes “to my student, the holy rabbi, expert in revealed and esoteric realms, man of God, our master and rabbi.” So too thereafter, the great and holy <i>Maggid</i> R. Dov Ber to his students, may their merit protect us, such as when he writes to the holy one of God R. Zusha: “Long life and peace to his honor, my holy primary disciple, holy and righteous one,” etc...",
                "Now, though we have described in small measure, per our meager grasp in the holy books, the erstwhile activities and holy <i>avodah</i> between a rebbe and his hasid, nonetheless the activities of the holy fellowship—rebbe- students, angels of God, with their great and holy rebbe upon them—we cannot describe, nor even surmise or contemplate. For is it possible to surmise, for example, that which is known, that when R. Dov Ber would begin to recite a verse to say Torah about, R. Zusha would start thrashing about, becoming impassioned and aflame? If the other students tried to push him outside so that he not prevent them from hearing their holy rebbe’s Torah, he would recite, from outside, the new Torah their rebbe revealed inside. When asked from whence he knew it, he responded that when the rebbe merely said the verse, he opened up the gates of wisdom and the new lights of the secrets of the Torah were drawn forth. Thus, when he heard the verse, he already knew the new Torah, the secrets and insights and ways of <i>avodah</i> which the rebbe would say. This was the reason for his thrashing and impassioned state upon hearing his rebbe recite the verse. Not because he heard, nor that he sensed his rebbe’s thoughts, but rather because the rebbe had opened the gate Above and the light flowed over. [Just as we cannot surmise such influence of the rebbe on the student], we cannot surmise the students’ effect on their rebbe.",
                "Yet, we can contemplate this one point, which we have already spoken of above (in chapter five), of the various holy pathways in hasidism. So it was that the holy students, members of the holy fellowship, after their rebbe passed away and they became leaders of Israel in their own right, almost every one of them revealed a new path in hasidism. For example, my holy ancestors R. Elimelekh of Lizensk, the <i>Maggid</i> of Kozhnitz, the holy R. Aharon the Great of Karlin, and the Rabbi (R. Shneur Zalman of Liadi) all traveled to one rebbe, R. Dov, and received one hasidism . Nonetheless, even we with our limited spirit and minds can see how the path of hasidism in Noam <i>Elimelekh</i> stands alone, the works of the <i>Maggid</i> of Kozhenitz stand alone, of the Rabbi [R. Shneur Zalman of Liaidi] stand alone, and the holy path of Karlin stands alone. Is it possible that only after their rebbe passed and then began to lead their communities that they each suddenly began to reveal diverse pathways, while when under their rebbe they did not have different paths, totally unaware of their own individual holiness? This is impossible. And given this, can we surmise the effect such students had on their holy rebbe—rebbe-students, righteous in their selfhood and various paths, requesting and seeking different <i>avodah</i> and insights from their rebbe, and even affecting him, suckling the pure dew from Above within him?",
                "It was not only with these supernal angels, rebbes and righteous ones, the first hasidic rebbes, that the holy fellowship functioned with such greatness. Rather, in the following generations till our own, this holy fellowship has been the foundation of hasidism, benefiting the rebbe and acting as a foundation for the hasidim. For when the hasidim are not constantly near their rebbe, so that he might influence them, with them receiving and indeed requesting this from him, they not only will they not ascend the rungs of holiness without great difficulty, but they will also be unaware and unfeeling of that which is already within them. It is like earth: without a seed planted in it, or a vine nourished by it, its vitality goes unrecognized. And, though the quality of humility<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">509</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e. the humility the rebbe might experience when his vitality goes untapped, without hasidim to cultivate.</i> is a good and necessary one, nonetheless this can cause a negative fall and diminishment for the rebbe. At times, he may feel that he has not Torah nor <i>avodah</i>, nor anything at all, that he is empty, with nothing within. In truth, everything shrinks within him when he has no one to speak to and to influence, as a heart will not move unless it spills out its blood and soul to the limbs and the limbs return it to him along with their dross, and this is its vitality. So too, the rebbe is the heart of the fellowship, and they its holy limbs.",
                "From his <i>avodah</i>, ascents, even his falls which are followed again by his ascents, he speaks to them. He hears and receives their contrite pleadings [in the sense of a child pleading before his father]. He speaks of and invests in them to understand lofty matters of Kabbalah according to hasidism; how everything, large and small, is made up of divinity. He speaks of how one can subjugate his will and turn his physicality into holiness and service of God, from subjugation and joy. He not only instructed but also performed this service together with them. Does not the whole world, from the speck of earth on the land to the angels in heavens- is not all their yearning and desire only to praise, glorify, and sing before Him always?!",
                "He even, at times, reveals to them a ‘hands-breadth’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">510</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Talmud <i>Nedarim</i> 20b.</i> description of his spiritual rungs; of how, when he recites ‘from one world to the next You are God,’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">511</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Citation of the Sabbath and holiday liturgy.</i> he literally sees the world, and how He fills the world; and when he recites “this is my God and I will glorify Him,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">512</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 15:2, recited in the daily morning prayers.</i> he feels or sees before him He who speaks to him, and so forth. He also speaks of more lofty matters, above our grasp, all in proportion to the rebbe and the fellowship. They hear not only his words but also feel his soul which emerges as he speaks, until they see something of what he sees, and become aflame from his passion. When they come close together and are connected as described above, the rebbe’s <i>avodah</i> of selfhood begins to affect them, and theirs on him. This is an <i>avodah</i> which cannot be transcribed in a book. Much light which had been concealed within the rebbe is now revealed to himself and to them, as they are all given an effluence of new light. All arise higher and higher each time, till over time they rise to great holiness. Is it possible to capture the effect on the <i>avreikh</i>-hasid when he came to the rebbe and entered this holy fellowship, and how he prayed and sang songs and praises to God, Who is so revealed to their hearts, minds, and entire being along with these servants of God, priests of the Almighty?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">513</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Genesis 15:18.</i>",
                "Listen to that which is cited in <i>Maor vaShemesh, Parshat Shoftim s.v. “V’ki yavo haLevi…:”</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">514</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 18:6.</i><i></i> “For when a person is awakened...his heart aflame within, to discover the path to light of repentance...he would travel to the <i>tzaddikim</i> of the generation...and they would tie his soul to its roots...Yet we have already said that when one wishes to cleave to the <i>tzaddik</i>...that he should instruct him in his ways, he must cleave as well to those who grew up around the <i>tzaddik</i> so that they can instruct him how to draw from his faithful waters. For he will not understand on his own the ways of the <i>tzaddik</i>, without connection with and love of friends who already know his ways.”",
                "And so, when one of the fellows, or an <i>avreikh</i> who has been with the rebbe for awhile and participated in the fellowship, returns to his home and city and the people there see him pray and learn and perform a commandment—indeed, even when they behold this man’s holy visage—this would be enough for them to draw near to hasidism. Based on the writings found in the genizah in Kherson, which have already been published, it appears that members of the holy fellowship were sent to various cities to recruit for hasidism.",
                "Not only those precious of spirit, pure souls, capable of becoming members of the king’s household and lofty hasidim-not only they, but also regular householders—merchants, laborers, wholesome God fearers—they too entered under the wings of the <i>Shekhinah</i>, spread forth via hasidism. They too traveled to the Besht and became hasidim by connecting to their rebbe, as explained in the end of the <i>Noam Elimelekh</i> cited above. Furthermore, the lofty hasidim instilled awe and reverence on their entire cities, till all holy matters were performed according to their instructions.",
                "But now, due to our great sins, we are without all this. Not only should the rebbe and hasidim bemoans this lack, but all of Israel should cry with eyes flowing with tears. For in place of the <i>avodah</i> of the hasidim of yore, crown ofֿ Israel’s glory, which was to reveal and praise His holy name through lofty <i>avodah</i>, to sanctify every lowly thing in the Holy One of Israel and to hasten the coming of the Messiah speedily in our days, “and all those who dwell on earth shall recognize and know that to You all knees should bow...before You they shall prostrate,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">515</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Reference to the liturgical <i>Alenu</i> prayer.</i> and they shall fear Israel as well, for “they shall see that the Lord’s name is proclaimed over you and they shall stand in fear of you”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">516</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 28:10.</i>—[instead of all this,] now hasidim need to do <i>avodah</i> merely to remain faithful, simple Jews. And how much <i>avodah</i> is required of them at home so that their sons, wives, daughters merely fulfill the commandments and avoid transgression, God forbid! Can we hope from such hasidim that the whole city be nullified before them as was with the hasidim before them, who destroyed the evil of the wicked with their very breath? Why should we be so astounded by the abandonment occurring in the camp of Israel—of the lawlessness and gall of the new generation. We are like one without any strategies—knees weak, hands fallen, as the body of Israel falls into pieces. The fortress of the Holy One of Israel might fall, God forbid, if they have no spirit, and if the spirit of hasidism, the soul of Israel, of messianic vitality, is not breathed into their masses, into their very innards and bones.",
                "Part C<br>Given this, when we now return to our words from <i>Hakhsharat haAvreikhim</i> regarding the need to reinstate these fellowships with each rebbe, we understand all the more why it is impossible to raise up hasidism in our generation and draw it at least somewhat near to its roots and past glory, without establishing the fellowship in at least in the way we have described, that is, a minimal version thereof. For even if we do not presently have rebbe-hasidim who stand heads and shoulders above the working hasidim, who abandon any focus on their livelihood and are distant from their physical being for their entire lives, all their years focused only on Torah and dedication to the <i>avodah</i> of hasidism—nonetheless, the hasidim, students of Torah who desire the <i>avodah</i> of hasidism, should still form and connect in fellowship, even if they all work, as we explained there.",
                "Yet, we must warn, if they desire to establish a fellowship of even this sort, we must first reinstate the practice of an <i>avreikh</i>’s being supported at his parent’s table for some years (<i>kest-essn</i>), a practice which has grown so weak in our days. These days of being supported by their parents were foundational for their growth, and was so even for the hasidim of prior years, including the holy fellows. This is all the more so now, with the difficult preoccupations one encounters in the world and its matters. Furthermore—and this is the primary reason for the necessity of the <i>kest</i>—though to our sorrow we do not have fellows who will dedicate their entire lives to hasidism, we do have those who would dedicate themselves during the years of <i>kest</i>. At least during these years, their primary focus will be in the hasidic path, spent with their rebbe who will guide them in this path. They will not become unfocused by work-related travels, nor will their rebbe become unfocused. For when the hasidim present change every Sabbath, it either becomes difficult for him to speak and explain an entire (coherent) matter to them, or he does speak but his words to do not enter and cleave to the walls of their hearts.",
                "That is, the [aforementioned] ‘entire coherent matter’ is that in which the rebbe attempts to articulate a way for his generation to come close to hasidism, including on the individual level to different types of people, one in this situation and one in that, how each should serve God in their respective manner, etc.., with this amount of <i>avodah</i>, performed with forceful energy, and this amount of thought, as appropriate to him and his <i>avodah</i>. This is in order that they not be like those who wisdom outweighs their actions, nor as a boorish man etc. [Further, the rebbe instructs, if] his <i>avodah</i> has not worked he should do like such and such, and if it has, he should continue another step, and yet another etc.",
                "Or he reveals to them a path in speculative matters, so that they grasp not only that which he reveals to them, but their eyes become enlightened in many matters of thought and <i>avodah</i>.",
                "Now, in general, in order to explain an entire coherent matter, we need to discuss it over the course of many weeks and months, and sometimes longer. How would it be possible, then, to convey it to different people each Sabbath, so that these matters cleave onto their hearts, if each person hears only a third or a tenth of the entire matter? For the part that one hears he has no need [or: form]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">517</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The printing includes <i>tzorekh,</i> meaning ‘need,’ and then, in brackets, corrects the reading to <i>tzurah</i>, meaning form (the words differ only in their final letters). I assume the correction was based on the printer’s difficulty understanding the meaning of the former reading—what does the situation described have to do with the hasid’s needs?—and therefore suggests the latter reading, which would something of a parallelism between the terms for ‘form’ and for ‘understanding.’ The sentence would then read, “…For the part that one hears he has no form nor understanding of it,” meaning, the hasid has no sense at all of what he hears. However, it is clear upon consultation of the manuscript that the former reading represents the scribe’s hand more accurately. A possible recreation of R. Shapiro’s intent is that, when the hasid is not present for his rebbe’s full teaching, it cannot speak to his true needs, as the rebbe’s teachings and the hasid<i>’</i>s needs meet in a ‘fusion of horizons’ when they are together in person. This reading, provocative as it is, still feels stretched. It is therefore probable that the printers were correct and that the scribal reading of ‘<i>tzorekh</i>’ is an error; the reading should indeed be <i>tzurah</i>-form.</i> nor understanding of it. This is not the case when the <i>avreikhim</i> are supported by their parents, so that at least during those years they can be dedicated to hasidism, spending much time engaged by their rebbe in hasidic <i>avodah</i>. This way, besides the fact that they can hear an entire coherent teaching over the course of the several weeks that they are with their rebbe, even if they miss one or even a few teachings they will not suffer on account of this. This is because every time they do come, they will find one of the fellows who did hear what they missed and will fill them in. Not only will these <i>avreikhim</i> alone soak up dew from the streams of God’s supernal waters. Rather, it will extend to the rest of the hasidim in their cities. Even those preoccupied by their vocations will make space for this matter which they [i.e. the fellows] had heard, to enter into them. Was this not the work of the prophets in each generation, to prepare their contemporaries so that the words of the prophet might enter them? Restoring and [re]establishing [the practice of] supporting them at their parents’ table is, therefore, the foundation for the rectification of hasidism.",
                "In the <i>Midrash Tanhumah,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">518</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A collection of <i>midrashim</i> on the Pentateuch.</i><i> Parshat Shelakh</i>, on the verse “God did not lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">519</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 13:17.</i> it reads: “The Holy one said: If I lead them on the straightforward path, each man will seize a field or vineyard, and will become unengaged from the Torah.

                "Granted, the primary reason for the cessation of the <i>kest</i> is the vicissitudes of the times and severe poverty of Israel, may the Merciful One save us. For the majority of householders’ thoughts are on how to scrape together a living and how they might limit even necessary expenditures, so that their households not collapse entirely, God forbid, not perishing in hunger and utter lack, may the Merciful One save them! Or, his mind struggles to devise some new way to get free from his landlord and avoid being thrown on the streets because of rental dues which he cannot pay. When such a person marries off his daughter, he now has another demand placed upon his pitiful head and broken back, to support the couple. And yet: while it is true that Israel’s material troubles torture their souls as well, are not all of the Israelites’ lives bitter and heavy, and the Israelite nonetheless struggles with all his strength and gives over his very soul to be an Israelites and to serve God? Observing the Sabbath has also become difficult for the storekeepers, as is raising children to Torah, and nonetheless every Israelite whose heart has been touched by fear of God, who will never betray his faith—neither he nor his children, God forbid—he does observe the sabbath and raise his children to Torah. Why then [if they still observe these other commandments,] should we treat <i>kest</i> so lightly?",
                "There are many things which were not written in the Torah and which in and of themselves are not commandments, and yet they are <i>prerequisites</i> of Torah. Breaking them leads to the destruction of the entire observance of the Torah, God forbid, and by observing them the whole Torah is preserved. Is not the giving of a dowry quite difficult for the average person—and yet the vast majority knock down walls in order to do so, because it is a necessity, for no one will marry off his son without a dowry. So too, we do not treat the value of the couple’s clothing any more lightly than we used to. On the contrary, we have increased expenditure on them from the times they gave <i>kest.</i> Therefore, the reason for the abandonment of <i>kest</i> cannot be the travails of the times alone, but also the lack of understanding that it, too, is necessary.",
                "Why do we not pay attention to the fact that one causes the other: since they have stopped the kest, the level of the <i>avreikhim</i>-hasidim has dropped in turn; and, since there is no longer an outstanding <i>avreikh</i>-hasid, who is the foundation of hasidism, the fathers see no reason to trouble themselves to feed him <i>kest</i>. Would they see the <i>avreikh</i>-hasid who was even a bit like they used to be, above and beyond his peers, including even those who are students of Torah: his dedication to <i>avodah</i>, revealed and hidden Torah, his impassioned prayers, connected to God Who is before his eyes all day, his purified traits, loving all of Israel without any distinction, sharing the sorrows of each individual and the collective, working for the benefit of all; and how when he returns from his travels back to the rebbe, it is difficult to look at his face, so full of love and fear and nullification before God etc.. Then everyone would see the necessity of <i>kest</i> and establishment of <i>avreikhim</i>-hasidim. And just like the dowry and clothing, so too the <i>kest</i>—the father of the groom would stand at the setting of conditions upon the engagement, and both of them, the father of the groom and of the bride, would attempt to give so that at least the two of them together could feed the couple and they could spend some years without the burden of sustaining themselves. They would fulfill God’s desire and support them for some years, and their own trade or labor would merit success through this. This is not so now, when we do not see <i>avreikhim</i>-hasidim standing head and shoulder above their pious peers and learners of Torah. The parents error as above, ‘before, when they got married at 15 or 16, they needed to support them for a few years after marriage; but now that they marry after 20, they have already eaten the <i>kest</i> in their fathers’ houses, before their marriages!",

This is a high rung on the ladder of divine service and hasidism (again, the student has progressed since prior works), and requires training. It is such training that is the goal of the intended work which <i>Mevo haShearim</i> introduces.</i><br>And now we come to our primary intent in this work which we desire to compose, should the good and forgiving God merit us. Behold, as we have said, hasidism constitutes a drawing forth, which reveals light in even the vessels themselves, even in this world-<i>-”and the whole earth is full of His glory”</i> —, even in earthiness and in the physicality of the vessels. Therefore, [hasidic] <i>avodah</i> is not only performed via rejection of the physical but rather also <i>with</i> the physical, serving God and raising up physical traits, to love God and fear Him with them. Further, we do so not only with the faculties deriving from the spirit [<i>ruakh</i>], but also with the soul [<i>nefesh</i>] and indeed with one’s physical force. These too, we need not afflict and cast aside but rather incorporate them in holiness and service of God. In the holy books, this notion is sourced in a scriptural hint<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">523</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Remez,</i> or allegorical interpretations; one of the four traditional levels of interpretation.</i> found in the verse ‘for from these we shall take to serve God,’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">524</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 10:26.</i>which Moses our Rabbi said to Pharaoh regarding the animals, indicating that these too would come with them [i.e. the Israelites, when they left Egypt]. This means that they would ‘take from them as well,’ that is, from their own animalistic natures, to serve God.",
                "In fact, in <i>Reishit Hokhmah,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">525</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A work by R. Elijah de Vidas (16th century Safed), a student of Cordevero.</i> which preceded hasidism, we find <i>avodah</i> of this sort. In the Gate of Love [<i>Shaar Ahahvah]</i>, end of chapter 4, he says that one who has no will, even the will of desire, is not [truly] a person, for he will have no will with which to serve God. This is as opposed to one who has will and desires. Such a person should bring his will into holiness, by willing himself to connect to Torah and God’s holiness. Then he will have no need of afflictions and fasts.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">526</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In place of a negation of will, de Vidas promotes a channeling of will into divine service. As indicated in the following lines, such ‘sublimation’ of the will is echoed by the Besht as well. However, they part ways in that, while de Vidas aims for the ultimate nullification of physical senses, releasing the soul and its will for purely spiritual experience, for the Besht even the physical senses themselves can be utilized for sacred purposes.</i> It is possible that this is the intent of that which I saw in the holy letters of the archive [<i>genizah</i>] of Kherson<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">527</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The archive, originally ‘discovered’ in Kherson [in Ukraine], is a collection of manuscripts allegedly containing letters and texts composed by Besht and his disciples. The scholarly consensus is that these attributions are inauthentic. Parts of the archive, which was seized during the October Revolution in 1918, are currently housed in the Habad library in Brooklyn, NY. See sources cited in Rosman, Moshe, and Rosman, Murray Jay. <i>Founder of Hasidism: A Quest for the Historical Ba'al Shem Tov.</i> Vol. 5. (University of California Press, 1996). 255, notes 61-63.</i> which have been published, in which the Besht said that the roots of his own path are in the path of Cordevero; and since the author of <i>Reishit Hokhmah</i> was a student of Cordevero, we see how comparable the paths of <i>avodah</i> of the <i>Reishit Hokhmah</i> are to those of the Besht.",
                "However, nonetheless, even with our meager intellect we can also discern a distinction between them. For the <i>Reishit Hokhmah</i> articulates there how one can cleave to holiness and nullify all his senses by strengthening one’s will. Without these senses, his soul will cleave to God. Yet, one who has no will at all cannot accomplish this. He cites the story of one who had an evil will and desire for something, may the Merciful One save, and because of his great desire for this thing all his other senses were nullified.",
                "Yet, he did not attain this thing he so desired. Now, out of the strengthening of his desire his will became so strong until his soul separated from all other physical feeling. He began directing this strong will to desire God, and he became a holy man of God, to the point that his prayers were heeded and his blessings took effect. The author does not say that the foundation of one’s physical senses are [rooted] in holiness. On the contrary, he seeks to distance one from these senses, though the distancing itself can be accomplished even through an expression of willfulness originally directed towards something negative. Even though such a will was not founded in holiness, nonetheless, since he has the capacity to nullify his other physical senses even without afflictions, when this person is strengthened, his will, singled out from his many other physical senses, cleaves to God. Thus it turns out that his entire being will cleave to God. [However,] the Besht added [another layer] onto all this when he said that, since physicality is also holy, there is therefore no need to distance oneself from one’s body and its senses. Rather, one [merely] needs to remove their negative dross and [then] incorporate all of one’s self and all of one’s physical inclinations in <i>avodah</i> and holiness; not to afflict oneself but rather to strengthen oneself, in love, fear, and the joy of God.",
                "As is well known, as the Besht wrote in a letter to the <i>Toldot Yaakov Yosef</i>: “Behold, I have received your letter and see...that your honor says that he is nearly compelled to engage in fasting. My innards trembled on account of this statement, and I add with angelic decree,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">528</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Daniel 4:14.</i> and joining with the Blessed Holy One and His <i>Shekhinah,</i> that he not enter himself into this danger, God forbid. For this is an act of black bitterness and depression, and the <i>Shekhinah</i> does not resides in depression...but rather in the joy of the commandments…”",
                "The Besht thus initiated a new ‘drawing forth,’ of the beginning of a new rectification and revelation, and thus a new path of <i>avodah</i>. For if all is light and holiness, how can we distance ourselves from anything which God has created for us? Do we not thereby distance a piece and spark of holy light? We need merely to remove the evil from it and then the good in it will be revealed, and with it we will serve God. The Besht forbade fasting not only for the [author of the] <i>Toldot</i>, since he was a holy individual, but rather he [forbade fasting] for all. Such is the path of hasidism. As it says in the <i>Noam Elimelekh, Parshat [Ki] Tisa</i>, <i>s.v. veAtah Kakh</i> :”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">529</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 30:23.</i> “One should not say that, since it is forbidden for one to derive benefit from this world and from his desires unless it is all for His sake, which is a very difficult, nay impossible, thing to maintain, that he should therefore separate himself from the physical world, not eating nor drinking at all, and becoming totally separated. One should not say as such, but rather should strengthen himself, little by little, to break his desires and turn things over and over, until he arrives at the essential foundation of holiness and its roots in every physical thing.”",
                "* [Note: <i>Inter alia</i>, there is no contradiction between his words here and those in <i>Parshat Hukat s.v. Veyikhu elekha,</i> for here too he writes that it is a very difficult work to break all of his inclination and do everything for God’s sake, and the holy books say regarding even the righteous that it is impossible for him to be completely pure as he will be at the end of days. Even according to the citation above, hasidism is merely the beginning of the shining of the messianic light. That is why, if it was possible, he would want to not eat and be like an angel who does not eat, as it says there.]",
                "In the holy work <i>Avodat Yisrael</i>, from my holy grandfather, the man of God, the Kozhnitzer <i>Maggid</i>, on the <i>haftarah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">530</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Weekly reading from the Prophets, appended to the Torah reading.</i> to <i>Parshat Vayigash</i>, it says that “there is indeed a simple path available, for a person to engage in Torah and prayer...and to afflict oneself in order to become separate from all pleasures and desirables. And there is another path for those who desire to become sanctified, in which even eating and drinking become sanctified etc.. Certainly, one who is able to sanctify himself with even physical things and with desires, his table becoming like an altar, his holiness is greater and more wondrous...Then the power of his <i>avodah</i> will grow, and he will please God a thousand-fold more.”",
                "Indeed, the Kabbalists in their holiness also drew forth the light of the supernal worlds downwards, demonstrating how the form of the human body is in fact a form from Above which has unfolded below. [They showed] how the names of holiness are grasped in the things of this world, each name—that is, the names of holiness inhering in them via <i>gematria,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">531</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A method of interpreting sacred texts by ascribing numerical significance to its letters.</i><i> notarikon,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">532</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A method of interpreting sacred texts by rendering the letters which makes up a word unit as themselves abbreviations for other words.</i><i></i> etc…, constituting the vitality of the thing.",
                "Yet, there is a great difference between their path [and the hasidic path]. For, as is known, the spiritual realm does not exist in spatial dimensions, and thus the difference between the spiritual rungs is not that of physical spaces or measurements but rather of [non-spatial] levels and rungs. Just as we say about a Torah scholar that he is a ‘great man,’ not intending that his body is larger than another’s, for we also say about one of small physical stature that he is a great man because we call him as such due to his great level and Torah and spirit<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">533</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Shapiro is referencing, directly or indirectly, Maimonides in Laws of the Foundations of the Torah, 2:6.</i>—so too when we refer to the ‘supernal world,’ we do not mean merely that it exists in the highest physical level, above the air, moon, sun, and stars in the sky. Rather, we mean that it is higher in level, in spirituality, purity, and holiness than this world, and every world which is purer and holier is ‘higher.’",
                "If so, when the holy Kabbalists, may their merit protect us, drew down the holy lights and said that there are holy names in physical things, they merely lowered the supernal holiness to physical things. For example, bread is a physical thing, yet there is a spark of holiness in it drawn forth from three aspects of <i>havayah</i> in the gematria of the word <i>lehem.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">534</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>gematria</i> of the Hebrew word <i>havayah</i>, meaning existence, is 26, which is ⅓ of the numerical value (78) of the word for bread, <i>lehem</i>. Thus, there are three iterations or aspects of existence which inhere in bread.</i><i></i> For the spiritual takes up no space, and there is no physical space between them. Even so, in this physical world, the supernal world can exist and yet still be called supernal. Through this bread, the light of the three aspects of <i>havayah</i> which is from the supernal worlds can exist. This is the ‘lowering’ we referenced above regarding the work of the holy kabbalists. So too, a person’s soul is holy, and his body physical and evil. Yet, a form from Above, a spiritual form, descended and shaped it. It is like forming the shape of a person in cement—the cement remains as such [i.e., the matter remains cement] yet with the form of a person inscribed in it. The difference is, though, that the form of the person in the cement cannot vivify nor animate him, while the form from Above inhering within the body of a person allows him to receive a soul which will be garbed in the body, like clothing which remains merely clothing as it was before.",
                "If it is indeed so, that physical matters are lowly—and thus the human body is lowly—and the upper worlds are connected to them only by bending down to them—then, the more one is able to distance oneself from all physical things and to afflict his inclinations, the better. Only with the intellectual faculty of his soul which hovers above his body, in the aspect of his <i>Atzilut</i>, is he able to connect with the lights and names in the aspect of <i>Atzilut</i> which our holy ones have drawn down for him to the world of <i>Atzilut</i>, that is, by performing <i>kavannot</i> with his mind. Had they not drawn down the lights of <i>Atzilut</i> to the world of <i>Asiyah</i>, even though the distance between them is not spatial, nonetheless the [spiritual] distance between them is so great that there would be no <i>kavannot</i> to intend, and they would accomplish nothing even if one would intend them. For he would intend it towards that which is in the heavens, which would not have connected to the earth. But now that our holy kabbalists have drawn the world of <i>Atzilut</i> to the <i>Atzilut</i> within a person, his <i>kavannot</i>, performed in this world, affect <i>Atzilut</i> and the supernal worlds. Through this effect, he is able to sanctify and serve [God] even via his physical activities of this world—though only when they are performed with <i>kavannot</i>. Without them, his body and the things of this world remain merely physical and lowly.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">535</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In short, therefore, the kabbalists succeeded in connecting the lower material world with higher worlds by drawing the latter down to the former; yet they did not change the essentially coarse—and, indeed, evil—nature of the material. It remained as it was—and the more one could flee from it and climb towards the supernal realms, the better. The Besht, on the other hand, went a step further, redeeming the very essence of the lower, material world itself. That is why it is only hasidism which allows true religious engagement with the material world—including one’s own body. One’s speech, one’s eating, all of one’s physical activities, have the potential to be intrinsic forms of <i>avodah</i>.</i>",
                "But the Besht, in the path of hasidism and through his drawing-down, sanctified the body itself alongside worldly things. Therefore, eating itself is holy and a form of <i>avodah</i>, and a person should not afflict himself. Rather, he should strengthen himself little by little to break the power of desire etc... until he arrives at the essential foundation and root of holiness in every physical thing. As cited above from the <i>Noam Elimelekh</i>, an Israelite, when standing in holy service, in prayer or Torah study and the like, becomes so unified with God, reaching even the light of God’s essence, that is, that which is enclothed, not the clothing. Therefore, the awakening of his self, of the impassioned love and fear within him, is the very foundation and instantiation of the <i>kavannot</i>, as said above. It is also the soul of the words of prayer, the words (<i>tevah</i>) he speaks being the body,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">536</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In a common hasidic interpretive move, R. Shapiro puns off the dual meaning of the Hebrew <i>tevah</i>, meaning both word and container.</i> and his passion—which is God’s illumination—giving it a soul. A person gives the soul to the word. “Make a window [<i>tzohar</i>] make for the ark [<i>tevah</i>],”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">537</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 6:16.</i>—that is, put brightness and light into it [the word], says the Besht. He also says that when one reads the Torah and see the light of its letters, even if he does not chant correctly, since he reads with great love and passion etc, though he swallows the words...God loves him greatly. “His banner of love [<i>diglo</i>] was upon me<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">538</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 2:4.</i> —his skipping [<i>dilgo</i>] upon Me is loved.” Furthermore, one who inserts <i>kavannot</i> into his prayer only does so with the <i>kavannot</i> he knows. But when he says the word with great connection, all the <i>kavannot</i> enter into the words on their own. (<i>Likutim Yekarim</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">539</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An anthology of teachings attributed to the Besht and other early masters.</i>",
                "In <i>Noam Elimelekh, Likutei Shoshana</i>, on the verse “This [<i>zeh</i>] is the day the Lord has made,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">540</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalm 118:24.</i> it says: We might posit that this is a hint of the twelve combinations of [the letters of the Tetragrammaton] YHV-H, which one must intend every day, all day.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">541</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The numerical value of ‘<i>zeh</i>’ is twelve.</i> Now at first glance [we might wonder,] does the combination not happen automatically as God has made them?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">542</sup><i class=\"footnote\">What need is there, then, for humans to effect the permutations and combinations? The master answers that the need is only to inject feelings of love and fear into the dynamic.</i> Thus the first verse continues, “We will rejoice and be glad in it,” that is, the work is to inject love and fear into this intention<i>.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">543</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For the permutations themselves are in actuality effected by God, as the verse declares “that God has made.”</i><i></i> This implication here is that, to the contrary, one does not accomplish much through his mind’s intentions, for they exist on their own. Rather, the crux is [in] his love and fear. His <i>kavannot</i> only incline the vessels of the upper worlds in order to inject love and fear into them.",
                "Since all this holiness exists within the person, he is therefore capable of turning his desires, his physicality, every lowly thing, and the animalistic-soul within him.",
                "For the root of an Israelite’s animalistic-soul is the face of the ox in the Chariot, as is known from the <i>Raya Mehemna (Naso</i> 123) and in the other holy works, and has become physical in this world and within him due to his lowly actions. When he kindles his light and soul, the holy root of his animal soul is revealed and becomes holy again. When his body and inclinations become holy, the worldly things which he eats and drinks, and which become his flesh and energy, become literally holy when he serves God with the force accrued by eating them, as is said in the holy books. All of this is dependent on the active <i>avodah</i> he does—not sleepily or weakly, but with force, revealing his holy soul. Then his animalistic soul, and that of the world, become sanctified. This is what his cited in <i>Beit Aharon</i> on the verse “turn from evil and do good:”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">544</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalm 34:14.</i> turn from evil by doing good. For by the good one does in serving God, he will thereby remove the evil.",
                "Part B<br>Now, since the sanctification of the world is dependent on the sanctification of a person and on his transformation of himself and of his materiality, and of even the transformation of his evil inclinations to good, we must first clarify this [important matter]. We need to explain all this to you, <i>avreikh</i>, so that you may understand how, according to the hasidic path, even the animalistic soul is transformed into holiness, each person according to his <i>avodah</i>. And how, in this book, we hope to God to discover ways for even our generation on how to quiet the murmuring desires in a person’s heart; and how he may not merely desire to be good and righteous—for what Israelite does not, for his entire existence, in this world and the next, desire and yearn to be among the One who is holy, and whose servants are holy? Who does not tremble and quake from fear, saying ‘Who knows if I am not perhaps banished from Him, God forbid, in the filth of the other side and snakes’ blasphemy?!’ Everyone wants this, and yet not everyone has control of his heart, and cannot always control all his thoughts, traits, and feelings. His rectification and hope lie beyond merely refraining from doing evil. He must also raise up his inclinations and traits themselves to holiness, so that they themselves activate his love and fear of God. Even ‘hasidic seeing’—to see the light of God in everything, not with only intellectualized understanding but with literal seeing, about which we began speaking about in <i>Hakhsharat haAvreikhim</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">545</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See there, beginning of Chapter 10.</i>—will emerge from him until his entire being will shake from it etc.",
                "To explain this, we must first examine a passage in the Talmud (<i>Shabbat</i> 156a): “It was written in R. Yehoshua b. Levi’s notebook… that one born under Mars will be a shedder of blood. R. Ashi said: He will be either a blood-letter, or a thief, or a slaughterer, or a circumciser. Rabbah countered, ‘[But] I was born under Mars.’ Abbaye retorted, ‘Master [i.e. Rabbah] punishes and kills.’” On the face of it, this [passage] is difficult to understand.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">546</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For it indicates that one’s moral virtues are determined by astrological forces rather than one’s own free will.</i> The Talmud’s position that wealth and poverty are dependent on the stars is reasonable, for since, in any event, there is ‘no reward in this world’ even if one is righteous,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">547</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Talmud <i>Kiddushin</i> 39b.</i> it is possible that he born under a star determining that he will not be rich. But regarding service of God, how can we say that it is dependent on the stars whether he will be a thief or other of these evil things mentioned by the Talmud? Perhaps the Talmud means only that he is born with this capacity and tendency, yet is able to overcome his inclination for evil. Yet, if so, why when [the Talmudic sages] Rabbah said ‘I was born under Mars’ did [his junior colleague] Abbaye reply that he [i.e. Rabbah] punishes—that is that he punishes as a religious act—implying that since he was born under this star it was impossible for him for to do anything else, other than directing his tendency towards a religious act? Is it not possible for one born under Mars to overcome this tendency?",
                "Even more difficulty emerges from [ibid.] 156b, regarding R. Nahman b. Yitzhak. The Chaldeans said to his mother “He will be a thief.” She covered his head, saying to him “Cover your head so that the fear of Heaven be upon you.” Nonetheless, the Talmud concludes, one day he was sitting and reciting [teachings] under a date palm… (when his cloak fell off his head and) his nature overcame him. He climbed the tree and bit off the dates with his teeth (though they did not belong to him).” Why was it that, even though R. Nahman b. Yitzhak had certainly overcome this tendency, his nature overpowered him and he broke a branch which wasn’t his—[all] because he was born under such a star?",
                "We have already said and repeated that we do not intend to understand and describe the state of the talmudic sages and righteous ones, for as we have no comprehension of the angels, we certainly have no comprehension of these individuals and their holiness. All our speech about them is merely in order to learn how they might hint towards our own service and how they might enlighten our paths, the path of God.",
                "Behold, Maimonides, in the eighth of the Eight Chapters, says that “we should not think in accordance with the lies of the astrologers, who believe that one’s birth determines his stature or deficiencies and that one is compelled to commit those actions. Indeed, I know that the thing agreed upon from our Torah..<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">548</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Interestingly, R. Shapiro elides over the following of Maimonides’ words here: “in accordance with Greek wisdom.”</i> that one’s actions are entirely given over to oneself, without compulsion, nothing else bringing him to them...other than his constitution...which makes something easier or harder. Yet there is nothing to the notion that he is compelled or prevented from doing something.” This implies that Maimonides’ opinion is that there is no compulsion, only inclination; and even the inclinations that one has for this or that is explained by Maimonides as due to his constitution, and not to the stars, as the Talmud indicates.",
                "Therefore, it seems clear that he intends something akin to the way the luminaries of the sky affect the earth with their light, as Rashi says on <i>Parshat veZot haBerakhah</i>, on [the verse] “with the bounteous yield of the sun [and with the bounteous yield of the moon…:”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">549</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 33:14.</i> [T]here are some fruits ripened by the moon [i.e. cucumber and melon].” Just as the orbits effect changes in the four elements of fire, wind, water, and dust, mixing them and changing from one to the other, and these in turn are the causes of all existence, as Maimonides writes the Laws of the Foundation of the Torah 4:4-6, so too do the stars [have an effect] regarding [human] service of God. Though they do not have an effect on the soul, for the soul and its free will are above the stars, nonetheless they do have an effect one’s body and constitution. Note carefully [Maimonides’ word choice of] <i>his</i> constitution [<i>mizgo</i>]: this one for murder, that one for robbery...Therefore, if one does not merely subjugate and remove his inclinations but rather uses them for holiness—becoming a ritual circumciser, or a slaughter, or a judge—then it might be that he does not fall into transgression because of these inclinations, since he has removed his inclinations and ‘martian’ constitution and tamed them [by directing them into] holiness. This was not the case with R. Nahman b. Yitzhak, for we do not see that he used his star’s inclination for holiness. Therefore, though he tried to force himself to abstain, ‘his nature [nonetheless] overpowered him,’—though, that is not to see that his actually [stole the fruit], God forbid, but rather that his constitution overpowered him for a moment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">550</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The distinction drawn is a familiar one by this point in the text: utilizing and sublimating one’s inclinations and traits versus attempting to flee from and negate them. The danger of the latter stratagem is that they may always return and ensnare one in sin, as indicated in the tale of R. Nahman b. Yitzhak.</i>",
                "Maimonides considered the words of the astrologers to be madness, because according to them not only do the stars effect the person alone,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">551</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, one’s body and constitution.</i> but also determine his actions themselves. That is, they not only determine if one is inclined towards theft, but also whether a given act of theft or murder will take place, and by whom. According to them, all is determined by the stars—wealth, poverty, and all other this-worldly matters. If so, these matters are compelled. That is madness. For they [i.e. the stars] in fact only have an effect on one’s nature, on what constitution he will have. As such, they can only <i>incline</i> a person [towards a given action]. After all, if one is born with a sharp mind and then studies philosophy, would we say that he was born under the stars to be a philosopher and not a Torah scholar? Did he not have the ability to choose Torah and to use this mind to become a Torah scholar? The words of the Talmud are in lockstep with those of the Maimonides, for when it comes to service of God and free will, it is certain that the Talmud’s intent is that the stars have an effect on one’s body and humors, as his constitution and capacities are in accordance with them. So too in <i>Shaarei Kedushah</i> of R. Hayyim Vital I:2 it states something similar regarding the effect of one’s constitution and ‘material’ upon him. As we cited above, anger and arrogance come from the foundation of fire, and vacuous things from that of wind, and laziness from that of dust. If one is himself lowly and evil, such that besides his evil inclination, illuminated by this angel, his humor themselves are evil, what is the need for the evil inclination? To add lowliness to his lowliness? His own lowliness should suffice!",
                "Behold, in the holy work <i>Imrei Elimelekh</i> from my father and master, the Rabbi and <i>Tzaddik,</i> on <i>Parshat Toldot</i>, it says that the evil inclination of fiery temper can be channeled into holiness, bringing one to a state of great passion [<i>hitlahavut</i>], one’s heart inflamed like a torch. Similarly, in the prayerbook of the author of the <i>Tanya</i> in his commentary to <i>k’gvana</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">552</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A citation from the <i>Zohar</i> recited in the hasidic rite prior to the evening prayers on Friday night.</i>—which we cited in <i>Hovat haTalmidim</i>, in the [opening] ‘Conversation:’ “The heat of anger derives from the heat of the heart, and every man who is inclined by nature towards temper, his heart is fit for becoming impassioned by the burning coals of desire.” Upon analysis, we discern the following distinction: Maimonides, when he explains how one can free oneself from his temperament if it be ‘not good,’ says that he should strengthen his effort more than one with a good temperament.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">553</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Maimonides, <i>Eight Chapters</i>, Chapter Four.</i>",
                "And my honorable and holy father, as well as the author of the <i>Tanya,</i> do not say that he should merely work to merely weaken his hot temperament, but rather say that he should channel it into holiness. Indeed, on the contrary [to Maimonides’ advice], therefore, this [approach] inflames [one’s temperament] all the more. This is not merely a piece of good advice, meaning that he could rectify himself without doing so, but that it is merely better to channel it into holiness. This is not so, for it is impossible for him to rectify himself in any other way. This is not merely in order to gain more holiness, but rather that it is impossible to remove their evil without channeling it into holiness.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">554</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The hasidic directives, then, are in fact superior to Maimonides’. It is impossible for the latter’s approach to truly remove evil, as it might always emerge in a given moment. It is only the former’s approach of redirecting evil tendencies into holiness that guarantees both doing good and turning from evil.</i>",
                "In <i>Noam Elimelekh Parshat Tzav,</i> on the verse “<i>Zot torat haOlah</i>,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">555</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 6:2.</i> it says: “It is impossible for one to break all his tendencies with which he has grown up with from his mother’s womb. Rather one must raise them to holiness. For example, one who has the trait of anger should turn away from ‘external’ anger and be angry at the wicked. So too with all traits.” This refers to the aforementioned hasidic <i>avodah</i>, of ‘for from it we shall take to serve the Lord.’",
                "Furthermore, it is not clear that Maimonides himself would not hold this way, given that he wasn’t speaking there of <i>avodah</i> at all but rather of capacities of understanding. For a pure mind is more receptive than a thicker mind, which can only receive [input] with difficulty. So too, it is difficult to make one who is of cool spirit into a mighty person without much difficulty.",
                "Behold, as we explained above, the Talmud speaks of temperaments and inclinations, and when it speaks of stars it does so only regarding the inclinations and temperaments caused by the stars. Nonetheless, since we do not now have any knowledge of astrology, when we wish to speak and elaborate bit about it, it is best that we do so in the manner of <i>Shaarei Kedushah</i>, who does not speak of the stars at all but only of the temperaments which are of the person himself. By doing so the words of the Talmud will become clarified to us as well a bit.",
                "As is known, there is an angel of the good inclination and an angel of the evil inclination. They both come to try to have an effect upon a person, turning him towards the good or, God forbid, to the bad, through the means of one’s limbs, forces, feelings and thoughts, which use them and become enclothed in them. The good inclination entices one to fulfill a commandment, such as eating <i>matzah</i>. It does not put the <i>matzah</i> in its hand and place it into one’s mouth, but rather becomes enclothed in the person, animating him and thus placing the <i>matzah</i> into his mouth. So it is with the evil inclination when it approaches to cause one to sin by eating forbidden foods, God forbid. If one does not have at the time a hand or if his mouth is shut and he is sick, neither the good inclination could accomplish his eating of the <i>matzah</i> nor the evil inclination for a transgression, may the merciful One save us.",
                "Since the work of the angels- that is, the good and evil inclinations- is not meant to merely affect one’s physical actions but rather the entire person—his will, thoughts, traits etc.., therefore, they utilize and are enclothed in all one’s capacities. For example, the element of fire is its own entity, causing hotness. [The use of this entity is] contingent on who is enclothed within and utilizes it: if it is the good inclination, it arouses ‘heat’ for holiness, self-work and passion for God, while if God forbid it is the evil inclination, then it is for anger and haughtiness.",
                "The element of wind causes verbosity, and it is contingent whether it is for words of Torah or words of naught, etc... As to how they both can utilize the same capacities, this one for the good and this one for the evil, it is cited in <i>Etz Hayyim</i> 7:2 that the good inclination filters the purity of the blood, drawing the soul close, and the evil inclination the dregs. Now, ever since Adam’s sin, the evil inclination has mixed and become more deeply enmeshed within a person, and it even precedes the good inclination, for the evil inclination is present from birth, <i>‘sin couches by the door’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">556</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 4:7.</i> and conquered the body and elements of a person. Therefore they are used to feeling physicality and desire. If a person would merely struggle with his desires and subdue his evil inclination so that it not seduce him, then the feeling and awakening of desires in his body, powers, and elements will continue to be seized by it. The evil inclination will have already conquered them and make use of them, to the extent that we could say that it is not the evil inclination alone which seduces him to evil but rather the person himself, in his foundations, is aroused towards evil, from the foundation of fire etc, as aforementioned.",
                "Arousal towards evil in one’s body and his foundations and feelings with which he struggles, will not be quieted. His blind, animalistic yearning, without human understanding, from powers and physical foundations without understanding and intellect, will never cease as long as his body, powers, and foundations are within him. Even if one desires and works to distance these from his heart, will, and thoughts, [he will not be successful] since they come from his body, powers, and foundations. This is not the case when one works and expresses his capacities, strengthening the natural temperaments for <i>avodah</i> and holiness. If the temperament of his star, Mars, is strengthened and directed towards murder, he becomes a ritual slaughterer, circumciser or judge, and if that of fire is strengthened and directed towards anger, he should direct it towards holy enthusiasm.",
                "Then, on the contrary, he captures his capacities and foundations from the evil inclination and brings them into holiness, leaving the evil inclination outside, like a mere seducer without powers, foundations, or physical tendencies in which to clothe himself and utilize. Thus, he will not have merely stopped up and subdued his physical, evil desires, afraid that they might return to agitate and become strengthened again. Rather, he will have turned them towards holiness. Even if he does not feel them for a long time and thinks “I have purified myself from my sins and filth,” they have really only been [temporarily] subdued within him, capable of returning in the future to seize and impassion him, God forbid. In fact, sometimes after a while they seize him more strongly, as is the nature of forces which are locked up for a while and thereby becoming more agitated and potent. Furthermore, many times it is difficult for one to control himself, conquering and subduing them, and he is left with only good intention, without the means to implement the good deeds, because his good inclination has nothing—no powers or physical foundations with which to enclothe himself and to utilize, for the evil inclination has conquered them for himself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">557</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If, for example, one’s body remains under the jurisdiction of the evil inclination, how will one enact good deeds—which require that same body—inspired by the good inclination?</i> The goodness inhering within him is left [in the state of] will, while his body is dedicated entirely to desire, may the Merciful one save us.",
                "Indeed, according to what is said in the opening chapters of the <i>Tanya</i>, to turn the evil to the good, from darkness to light, bitter taste to sweet, is of the level of the completely righteous, the <i>bnai aliyah</i>. Yet Rabbah said about himself that he was merely an average person (end of Talmud <i>Berakhot</i> chapter 9)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">558</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibid. 61b.</i> and not a completely righteous person like King David, who killed the evil inclination. But that is about the angel of the evil inclination itself, the evil itself, subduing it or turning it to holiness—that is indeed a very lofty level which only the <i>bnai aliyah</i> merit—that is, that the angel of the evil inclination turns into the good inclination. And even the level of the average person, which is to subdue the evil inclination, is itself very great, to the extent that Rabbah called himself average. But here, we are not speaking of the angel of the evil inclination itself, rather only of capacities and physical foundations which the evil inclination uses. Regarding these, everyone can steal them from the evil inclination and bring them into holiness, as stated above, even though he hasn’t done so with the angel of the evil inclination itself.",
                "Possibly, this is the matter expressed in the second teaching in <i>Likutei Torah</i> of the Rabbi, author of <i>Tanya)</i> to Song of Songs on the verse “[Y]our teeth are like a flock of ewes,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">559</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 6:3.</i> speaking of subjugation and reversal together.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">560</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, of both subduing inclinations as well as turning them— ‘reversing them—towards noble ends.</i> It refers not only to the greatest righteous ones but also to every man; for by drawing the blood of circumcision from him and then, when he is in school and does not wish to learn, they hit him with a strap, he thus turns from darkness to light and subdues the other side, see there. [Note: ‘Subduing’ means merely preventing his inclination from acting, while ‘reversal’ means turning it towards holiness, that is serving God even with it. This accords with what we wrote above: since he turns the physical capacities towards holiness, he subdues the evil inclination and conquers it to the extent that he refers to it as a type of reversal—even though he does not turn the essence of the evil to the good, as do only the greatest of the righteous referenced in the <i>Tanya</i>.]",
                "Behold, even the ability of a man to rob his powers and elements from the evil inclination and turn them to holiness, derives from the Besht’s drawing-forth which he revealed even in the vessels, that they and their roots are holy. For as long as the vessels themselves were not sanctified, though their roots were in holiness, nonetheless filth and the ‘other side’ grasped their essence. Evil and one’s capacities were not separate entities, separable so that the latter could be brought into holiness. It was only on account of the shining of the initial messianic light into the vessels, accomplished by our holy ones, that we are able to separate them from the evil and to bring them into holiness, establishing them in the aspect of reversal, as aforementioned.",
                "One could ask: [I]f our <i>avodah</i> in subduing and reversal now is not as it once was, for it is now focused not on the evil inclination itself but on our capacities, foundations, and physical feelings, how could our <i>avodah</i> be efficacious? For it is possible that we will direct them into <i>avodah</i> and holiness, and nonetheless not subdue the evil inclination, for it [s inactivity would be only due to its] temporarily having nothing to utilize since one’s capacities and feelings are occupied with holy <i>avodah</i>. Yet after a while, when one rests from his <i>avodah</i>, and his capacities are freed-up, the evil inclination will again seize him and utilize them for evil, God forbid, since he had not subjugated the evil inclination itself. Can one who eats non-kosher, God forbid, be assured that he will not eat it again if he has an illness of the mouth and teeth for a couple days and so the evil inclination has nothing with which to cause him to sin and feed him? Certainly, after he heals it will return to cause him to sin again, God forbid. Is it possible for one to be continuously and vigorously occupied with <i>avodah</i> which uses the entire body for service?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">561</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Do we need not, with our focus on rectifying and elevating traits etc, not ignore addressing the evil inclination, to our own peril? R. Shapiro replies to the effect that, in fact, the former efforts help mitigate the potencies of the evil inclination, turning it itself towards the good. Additionally, if one does not learn to know oneself, one will be subject to the evil inclination, regardless.</i>",
                "To this question we would reply [first] that indeed, this <i>avodah</i> of turning his capacities and feelings to holiness will not ensure that he become a completely righteous person, the evil inclination itself turning into the good inclination. For he will not have turned the evil inclination, the angel, itself, but rather its vessels. Do we think that by doing so we can raise someone to the level of the completely righteous, greater than Rabbah, who called himself average [<i>beinoni]</i>? If only we could be average and so subdue our inclination that he we experience no emotions for evil, nor in our thoughts, speech and actions, as the <i>Tanya</i> describes the average person! Nonetheless, we can say that when one continuously engages in this <i>avodah</i> of which we speak, not <i>abandoning</i> his capacities and physical inclinations but rather <i>grabbing</i> them from the evil inclination and serving God with them, then he will come little by little the level of the average person. For first and foremost, he will not sin but rather serve God. By doing so continuously, his inclination and the essence of the other side will be subdued to holiness.",
                "Secondly, there are rules and orders of one’s foundations and capacities and emotions, even of his thoughts. If one knows them and uses the elements of his body and soul, he can conquer and subdue them. But if he does not know them nor their paths, not only will he be unable to do so but it will be difficult to make them listen to him even once. This is the cause for a person’s grief when he wonders at himself: even when ‘he’ truly desires something, his body, soul, and thoughts do not protect him. Knowledge of the rules and orders of one’s body, emotions and soul—this is our goal in this composition, with the help of the One who teaches Torah to Israel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">562</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A reference to the blessing recited prior to studying Torah.

Shapiro outlines the pressing needs of the time, and sums up his proposals for the reinstatement of <i>kest</i>, of the holy fellowship, and overall, for a renewed and focused training of <i>avreikhim</i>.</i><br>Since the essence of hasidism is not in the intellect but rather in the hasidim themselves—in their purification and <i>avodah</i>—therefore, we see that one expression of its great holiness is in its unfolding (<i>hishtalshelut</i>). That is, its greatness and that of its <i>tzadikkim</i> unfolds in accordance with the unfolding development of the generations. While [the meaning of] textual learning is in a sense fixed, each generation grasping it in accordance with how high or low it is, hasidism, whose locus is in people, inscribed in them, must <i>ipso facto</i> develop and unfold with them. This is not in the sense of being lenient with them, God forbid. On the contrary, they [the hasidic masters] were extremely meticulous and stringent with themselves in their entire process of purification and coming close to holiness. They literally ‘gave over their lives’ to it, and it is impossible to surmise the extent of their reverence and fear, ‘for a hair's-breadth.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">564</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Talmud <i>Yevamot</i> 121b.: “God judges those surrounding Him to the hairs-breadth.”</i> This is why they always saw themselves as deficient sinners, on account of [minor transgressions,] ‘dust of dust’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">565</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmudic idiom for traces of sin.

Elimelekh was praying according to the Ashkenazic rite himself, or—more radically—he was praying the Sephardic rite, and thus could have spoken, but since in a different rite speaking at that point was prohibited, he held it forbidden for himself as well. Regardless, it was a relatively minor transgression, and yet he weighed it with immense severity.</i> His mind was only put a bit at ease because he interrupted for the sake of an ill person, and nothing trumps saving a life.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">568</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This story reinforces the prior point, to wit, the progressive unfolding of revelation unto the hasidim themselves was in no way lenient or accommodationist. R. Shapiro continues on to explain what, then, he intends when claiming that the revelation in a sense ‘fit’ the hasidim.</i>",
                "[Returning to the main point,] there was thus an unfolding, lowering the ladder to the state that the generation had become lowered to, in order that they could then climb up higher, and to each time find ways to rectify them according to their generation’s state. For example, regarding the study of Kabbalah: the kabbalists virtually legislated that only one who afflicts himself as they prescribed and as presented in the holy works, who distances himself from the world, and performs the acts of repentance which they defined, is allowed to study Kabbalah. Yet in the holy work <i>Sur Mera</i>, with the additions of the holy righteous author of <i>Bnai Ysoskher</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">569</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Zvi Elimelekh Spira of Dinov, late 18th-mid 19th century.</i> he is lenient, saying that there are some weak individuals for whom it is impossible to fulfill all these prescriptions for their entire lives. On a more basic level, regarding the rectifications which we must do as part of our repentance to God, we see that the generations have descended in their capacities and consciousness. Thus, our righteous ones have been lenient regarding the rectifications for one’s past’s sins which have damaged the supernal worlds, leaving him to instead expend vigorous effort going forward to serve God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">570</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These are examples of the differing demands of <i>avodah</i> for different generations, in accordance with the differing degrees of ‘unfolding’ into the hasidim of each period.</i>",
                "In the holy work <i>Imrei Elimelekh</i> from my holy master and father the Rav of blessed memory, <i>Parshat Vayetzeh</i>, it says in the name of my grandfather the holy righteous Rabbi of Mogielnica of blessed memory in the name of my great-grandfather the [Kozhnitzer] <i>Maggid</i> of blessed memory, that a person who desires to truly repent to God...should not first focus his efforts on rectifying that which he has damaged Above, but should first flee from the evil inclination chasing him now...and when he has rectified all his traits, then he can rectify the damage. And in the holy work <i>Beit Aharon</i> he explains that the fact that repentance nowadays is only focused from the present forward is because of the unfolding and descent of the generations. Here are his words in the anthology, in the name of R. Shlomo Karliner: “In order to achieve full repentance, four minutes may not go by without thoughts of repentance. Yet we do not have this capacity so we fulfill the words of the <i>Zohar Parshat Shelakh</i> [which reads]:’ When one awakens in the morning, he should make several blessings, placing his phylacteries on his head…”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">571</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, since in our generation we do not have the capacity to constantly repent (for our wrong doings), R. Shlomo of Karlin recommends instead focusing on performance of daily positive commandment, basing himself on the <i>Zohar</i>.</i>",
                "And (further) in his words of inspiration there: “Our repentance is to repair oneself alone regarding what is to come...With a bit of vim and vigor, one can overcome anything...Because waiting for [the right time] to perform self-repair is not in the capacity of contemporary consciousness, as most of what it’s [trying to] work out within is wandering and lost...Repentance, in our scope, we can translate from [the verse] “Turn from evil” by means of “do[ing] good...” When one draws up holiness into the self, one is, as a matter of course, drawn away from wickedness.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">572</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Translation by Joshua Schwartz; see n389, above.</i>",
                "This is all the more true for us, for whom most of the things we need to speak of in hasidism, and most of the books which need to be written, regard the breadth of hasidism rather than its depth. This is so regarding the revealed facets of Torah as well.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">573</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Shapiro now applies the notion of unfolding to questions of curriculum and educational foci, such as breadth versus depth of study.</i> It is true of a student of Torah who has already filled his belly<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">574</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Maimonides, Laws of the Foundations of the Torah 4:13.</i> with Torah, that when he discovers greater depth in the commentaries and sees deeper insights in the <i>Gemara</i> [Talmud], Rashi and <i>Tosafot</i>, his desire to diligently engage in Torah is aroused. But will deep insights help the youth who have abandoned Torah study because they do not want or are unable to strengthen and expend effort in it? Will we rectify this abandonment and draw them close to Torah by adding books with greater depth? If we want to benefit them, we must write books with greater breadth of Torah, which will make it easier from them from the beginning, with minimal efforts, to understand G’R’T [<i>Gemara, Rashi, Tosafot</i>]. Then, when they ‘taste and see that it is good,’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">575</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 34:8.</i> they will expend effort and toil, even in depth. The same is true with hasidism: Now we must unfold and develop along with the generation; for how will it help us to teach them from the deep secrets of hasidism, if they will not understand them? And even if they do, it will be only with their intellects, for they will not expend effort to become sanctified, to become hasidim, with their entire selves.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">576</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The strategy of merely increasing traditional learning as a bulwark against attrition is therefore deemed either totally inefficacious or, at best, insufficient.</i>",
                "Furthermore, regarding the matter of the need for breadth with which we must occupy ourselves now, both in speech and writing: Our sages said in <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> on Song of Songs Chapter 2: “R. Isaac said, in the past the Torah was the focus, and people requested to hear Mishnah and Talmud; now that Torah is not the focus, they request to hear Bible and Aggadah. R. Levi said, in the past when there was money, one desired to hear Mishnah, <i>Halakha</i>, and Talmud; now that there is no money, and all the more so when they are ill from the servitude, they only request to hear blessings and consolations.” What then will we reply, in Israel’s horrific current state, with constant troubles rather than occasional ones, attacking us from morning to night and night to morning?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">577</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here and in the coming paragraphs, one might imagine R.

If so, we have thus encountered a rule: through becoming accustomed to something, we conquer our capacities and feelings so that they remain subservient or even turned into holiness even without our knowledge, to the point that it is impossible for the head to remain uncovered, and we serve God from our very selves. Further, why do some ideas which remain imprinted in our minds even without our being accustomed to it [by experiencing it regularly]? For example, if one has a great scare, if this feeling was great enough he will remain afraid even when the person or fire which scared him no longer exists. This indicates that there is another rule: if one feels some emotion especially powerfully, that thought will remain deeply imprinted in him, even against his will. If so, we thus have an <i>etzah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">582</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Spiritual direction, advice, and/or strategy.</i><i></i> as to how to imprint a good thought within us to the point that we will be under its influence even unknowingly, by great emotion.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">583</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ostensibly, <i>Hovat haAvreikhim</i> was to be filled with such <i>etzot</i> and stratagems, which have just now been demonstrated to have great power, assuming one understands the ‘rules and orders’ of human psychology.</i>",
                "If the sages of yesteryear gave, alongside the grace [<i>shefa</i>] from Above which they and the holy fellowship channeled, also <i>etzot</i>, even simple advice, to those who wished to come close to Him via hasidism, how much must we now try to discover more <i>etzot</i> as to how to capture and conquer our capacities, traits and feelings, even turning them into holiness. We do not wish to suffice with merely making a dry impression with this advice, but rather [desire that it] enter into a man, God willing, into his innermost soul and body, that he should recognize himself and his innermost soul and body. He should be able to look at them and know the ins and outs of their laws. Then he will know how to place a bit and bridle in their mouths in order to make use of them and direct them into holiness. This will be so not only during the times of <i>avodah</i>, resulting in the danger that, God forbid, his inclination might steal them back from him when resting from his <i>avodah</i>. Rather, he will turn them into holiness. This can only be done when he knows and recognizes them. If not, then it will be difficult to bend them to his will even for a short time.",
                "For example, in <i>Hakhsharat haAvreikhim</i> we already began to introduce ourselves to this <i>avodah</i>, by recognizing ourselves and the laws of our souls, to conquer them—especially in Chapter Nine, where we spoke of how since our natural law is that when we look at one thought, it dissipates, therefore we should use this law as well when a thought interferes with our thoughts during prayer—that we should look at the foreign thought, seizing it in our minds. Now, we might add to this, that through this knowledge we can identify another weakness which we sometimes encounter in our <i>avodah</i> and, by recognizing its foundation, know also how to heal it. As is known from the holy books, one should envision the Tetragrammaton before one’s eyes, in the sense of ‘I place God before me always.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">584</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalm 16:8.</i> It is a bad omen for him if one wants but is unable to do so; and in an manner which seems designed to frustrate, the more he wants and tries to do so, the more difficult it becomes. It is difficult for him to even see the image of one letter, as he worries about this, his forehead starting to sweat and yet he is unable. And yet, do you not already know from <i>Hakhsharat haAvreikhim</i> that even the most familiar image of your father or brother or son which are always in your imagination, including now—when you begin to think ‘What is now in my imagination? The image of my father. I want to imagine it well. Is his image truly in my imagination?’ then the image will weaken in your imagination and cease completely. The more you want and try to imagine it the more it disappears. Therefore, when you fashion a familiar image in your mind and begin to think ‘What is now in my imagination? I want to fashion it well’ etc, thereby strengthening his consciousness and human intellect, then his imaginative faculty becomes weakened and completely passes away.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">585</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is only by understanding this psychological truism that a hasid can realize that at some point, the way to achieve meditative focus is by avoiding meta-cognition of the meditation itself.</i>",
                "Indeed, for one whose soul is holy and whose body, capacities, and inclinations are continuously becoming sanctified, there is no natural, bodily impediment preventing him from envisioning the Tetragrammaton with his imagination, whenever he wants. For the spirit of holiness governs him, and all else is subservient to it. But one who does not have this spirit governing him so much because he has damaged it, the evil inclination which desires to impede him from becoming sanctified through this holy fashioning of ‘I place God before him always,’ uses and is enclothed now in this person’s nature and impedes him. The more he desires to be strengthened and fashion it, the more his consciousness and human intellect is strengthened and expressed, and the weaker the imaginative faculty becomes and thus the more difficult it is to form the holy name.",
                "Among the early hasidim, if something like this occurred to one, he would travel to the rebbe. Whether the rebbe would or wouldn’t give him advice on this, the holy influence of the rebbe and fellowship and the lengthy stay that the hasid would reside there had the capacity to nullify the force of his physicality and emotions until they had no power or natural ability to counter him. Then the man was able to envision the holy name, and besides the fact that the rebbe purified him with his holy influence, he himself [was able to] rectify that which he has damaged. [Note: I have not seen this <i>etzah</i> in any book].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">586</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is unclear if this note is that of R. Shapiro or of his scribe. While the handwriting in the manuscript is that of the scribe, it is inserted into the text in the same manner as the other notes, which, prima facia, were authored by R. Shapiro. On the other hand, it seems odd that R. Shapiro would himself cite this <i>etzah</i> and then note that he does not know of its source. Perhaps his intention is that he knows on no written source, but had learned of the practice mimetically.</i>",
                "This is not the case nowadays, when the rebbe is not like the rebbe R. Ber [of Mezeritch], may the memory of the righteous and holy be for a blessing; and when there is almost no fellowship—though we wish to reinstate it, with God’s help—and the hasid’s travel to rebbe is not as it once was.",
                "With the current state of the rebbe and fellowship and pilgrimages, though they do add holiness to the hasid who makes the pilgrimages of hasidism, it is difficult to claim that his entire self and nature and state of feelings become entirely nullified, such that he might immediately and without obstacle envision the holy name. Therefore, he needs to utilize more <i>etzot,</i> [coming] to know the ways and rules of the imagination. Then he can steal back the laws and nature of his feelings from his inclination and use them for the good, in <i>avodah</i>. Even if his inclination desires to disturb his holy imaginative visualizations, it will be unsuccessful, for it will have nothing with which to accomplish this. For, as explained, the evil inclination does not extend forbidden foods to a sinner with its own hands, but rather uses and is garbed in the hand of the sinner himself.",
                "When we know the order and laws of his soul and of his deficiencies, then we can know how to conquer and bring them into holiness. While it is true that we have not yet articulated all the physical causes and preventions of the soul which make it difficult to envision the holy name—though we hope to God that He merit us to explain them more within the book itself—nonetheless, even now we can offer some healing remedy. Behold, this individual’s primary will is to envision the holy name, and thus his ego [<i>enokhiut]</i>, selfhood and consciousness are tied to this [effort]. As a result, the more he strengthens his will to accomplish this, the more his consciousness and human intellect are strengthened, weakening his imaginative faculty. Therefore, he should abandon this thought of envisioning the holy name, and begin with thinking of something not connected to his will. Since his will is not [implicated] in this [other visualization], it will not be difficult for him to envision it. For example, he should envision the Torah reader, with himself standing or sitting nearby listening. Then, suddenly, they call him up to the Torah [and he should invest his consciousness in imagining this in detail]. At first, he is a bit panicked, for he has never been called up before [or other thoughts which he had once had now arise in his mind] and he does not know whether to go up from the rebbe’s side or the other side. He opens the Torah and the reader chants, and he is looking at each verse—”And God spoke to Moses saying”—and he should focus his thoughts, trying to recall if in that passage it said ‘and Elohim said’ or ‘and YHV-H said.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">587</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, he should focus on which particular divine name is employed in the verse at hand.</i> In this manner, he will envision the entire verse as well as the Tetragrammaton in his imagination, without his inclination interfering. This stratagem will work as long as he gazes carefully at the words and the holy names each time he is called to the Torah, inscribing them in his mind and imagination. There are many diverse ways and paths in this vein. It takes study as well to [learn how to] strengthen the imagination itself. For how can one envision the holy name or the other things mentioned in the holy books, especially in the <i>Noam Elimelekh</i> “that he should envision Him as if he literally sees Him with his eyes,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">588</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Noam Elimelekh, Parshat Lekh Lekha.</i></i> if his imaginative faculty is weak, as we have discussed a bit in <i>Hakhsharat haAvreikhim</i>?",
                "Even rectifying his character traits requires examination of the soul’s interiority and its expression in the body, for there are primary and derivative rules [to its functioning]. Thus, if he wants to rectify a derivative trait, he will be unable to do so, or will trick himself into thinking that he has rectified it though in truth he has not. For it is impossible to do so as long as its underlying root has not been rectified. As for identifying the thoughts which pass through a person though he is unaware of them—as is said in the <i>Noam Elimelekh, Parshat Vayereh</i>, and if they are of the animal soul, why does human consciousness which also derives from the animal soul not know of them—we pray to God that we may speak of this in the book. We must know all this in order to know how to serve Him, may He be blessed.",
                "As stated, it is not enough for one to have a list of <i>etzot</i>. Rather, he must recognize his soul and its ways. Maimonides says in the <i>Eight Chapters</i> that one who is soul-sick requires a soul-doctor, just like one who is physically sick requires a doctor of the body. In Chapter One, he says that just as a doctor of the body must first have knowledge of the body and its parts, that is to say the body of a person etc.., so too a doctor of the soul who wants to rectify one’s traits must know the soul and its capacities in general and particular. That is, one must know not only the soul of the ill person and its sickness but rather also the healthy soul, its feelings, murmurings and movements. Then he will know how to utilize them and enter and turn them into holiness—even his animalistic body and soul—not just during the time of <i>avodah</i> but rather continuously and always.",
                "When we examine <i>Noam Elimelekh Parshat VaEtkhanan, s.v.Hishamer,</i> we are moved by this wonderous thing—for he says that it is impossible for one to walk continuously in <i>dveykut</i>, contemplating God’s majesty, without first contemplating, using his soul, as to <i>what</i> his soul is. For in five ways the soul is akin to the Holy Blessed One,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">589</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Berakhot 10a.</i> and if he does not know them he will not know the Creator; see further there. That is, it is not only necessary for one to be familiar with pieces of advice as to how to conduct himself in order to recognize his soul. Rather, in order to achieve elevated comprehension, he must know his soul first.",
                "Yet this is one of the many differences between knowledge of one’s soul and even a small measure of comprehension of the Creator’s works and wonders. For though the Sages said the soul fills the body as the Holy Blessed One fills the world, nonetheless, He is not categorized as of the world,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">590</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, according to R. Shapiro, hasidism teaches panentheism (God is included within the creation but is greater and more than it), but not pantheism (God is identical with creation).</i> and is not affected by it. The soul, however, is categorized with and effected by the body and the bodily soul, as is stated in the holy books and as we spoke of in <i>Hakhsharat haAvreikhim</i>, Chapter Two.",
                "This is one of the reasons for the difference between individual people: besides the fact that the root of one’s soul might be higher than that of another, the body surrounding the soul has great effect. If the state of his body, limbs, mind, and heart are purer, then the soul within them and effected by them is purified or, at least, not hindered by them. If they are coarse and thick, then it too becomes more material. Thus, a person can change not only his in his actions but in his soul as well. When he is wicked, his soul will become different from when he is righteous; and his soul before he enters his entire self into <i>avodah</i>, even had he not been wicked, will be different from when he does enter his entire self into <i>avodah</i>. How great is the distance between generations—besides their distinct roots in God, their actions and deeds of body and soul, even their speech and thought distinguish them and divide them. This is why Maimonides needed to add knowledge of the soul to that which his predecessors taught us, teaching us that in order to rectify our soul and traits we need to recognize and know our souls, because of the change in his generation’s souls. And what then can we say, when our bodies and souls and spirits have so dramatically descended? In order to know how to steal our capacities and inclinations for the evil inclination and to serve God with them, and to raise up via this knowledge to at least a bit of God’s wonders, we must gird ourselves and descend into its depths, as it is now, and to recognize it.",
                "This is not to say that one should study diseases of the soul and become a soul doctor<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">591</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, a psychologist or psychoanalyst, who R. Shapiro speaks of disparagingly.</i> like those in the broader world. Our way and understanding is as distant from theirs as is east from west. For, as is known, understanding of the nature of the progression of one’s thoughts, feelings, and other soul activities can only be accomplished by gazing at oneself and the movements of one’s soul, when one looks at them and listens to them, and by listening to others as they convey what they saw when they too ‘toured’ their own souls. Recognition of these hidden phenomena is not like that of the body, which is visible to all who want to know it and to feel, dissect, and see the corpse of another body. The soul is not like this; one cannot see another’s thoughts and feelings. Thus, it is examinable only by self-gazing.",
                "Generally speaking, the worldly scientists who examine thoughts and feelings of the soul are without Torah. There are things which an Israelite, fervent for the word of God, fears from doing or even casually thinking of doing, Heaven forfend, yet for the worldly scholars of the soul this is not considered bad and even sometimes positive. Therefore, many of them examine and study only lowly, filthy thoughts. Therefore, not only are our thoughts distant from theirs, but our souls are different; for besides the fact that the soul of an Israelite is higher—a piece of God above<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">592</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Job 31:2 and <i>Tanya</i>, Chapter 2.</i>—do they not also agree that the soul is activated by one’s thoughts, to the extent that there are many diseases of the nerves whose source is not the material nerves and brain but rather confused and convoluted thoughts and desires which one gets caught in? Since they behold a soul, activated from physicality and thoughts unaffected by thousands of years of Torah<i>, Zohar</i>, and hasidism, they evaluate/judge the man’s soul as an ‘evil spirit’ investing it as full of filthy processes.",
                "This is not the case with us, the people of God, who for more than three millennia have desired God, all our thoughts on His holy Torah and pleasing commandments. True, some were more dedicated and some less—but all, from young to old, women and children, every Israelite, everyone’s ultimate purpose and pinnacle of intention was on God’s holiness and eternality. How many <i>Tannaim</i>, kabbalists, pure righteous ones did the holy God send us from above to sanctify us, inside and out? And then the hasidism which the Besht revealed, whose root is to sanctify the vital soul as well as physicality and the body, from the holiness of the days to come—how can we, God forbid, compare our souls, bodies, thought, traits, feelings, all the murmurings of our hearts, to theirs?! If they have scientists who cast aspersions on the soul of a person, it is because they gaze only a trash heap, corpses of filthy thoughts and desires which they have sullied! This rotting heap covers the spark of holiness in them, and for them it is not seen nor found. While as for us—even our animal soul is holy. We want to reveal all its step, and want for each person, with God’s help and following our ancestors as much as possible, to know himself and govern himself with knowledge.",
                "The <i>etzot</i> which emerge from this for us are necessary and precious, for through them our bodies and inclination, even our thoughts, will serve God—not to be merely fervent, but to be a genuine hasid.",
                "And therefore, you, <i>avreikh</i>, besides those esoterica which you have heard from the <i>Zohar</i>, “as has been clearly demonstrated to you”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">593</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 4:35.</i> that hasidism is entirely dependent on <i>avreikhim.</i> For to serve God passively, by avoiding transgression and fulfilling commandments,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">594</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is striking that R. Shapiro categorizes fulfillment of positive commandments alongside avoidance of violating negative prohibitions, terming both ‘passive.’</i> the elderly along with the <i>avreikhim</i> are capable. But to enter all our warmth, feelings, actions, and even human imaginative faculty into God’s house, turning them into wings and soaring as angels- for all this<i>, avreikhim</i>, with their warmth, feelings, actions, and human imaginative faculties, are more capable. Is such <i>avodah</i>, with its exercises, possible, if not for <i>avreikhim</i> supported by their parents, free from labor and business?",
                "If [you], a hasid, will be free [from such material concerns while an <i>avreikh</i>], then thereafter, when you got out into the ‘market,’ even while you are standing in your shop, you will be a hasid, one whose very limbs and fibers are full with hasidism and soaked with holiness.",
                "We must, with God’s help, reinstate the <i>kest</i>, and make hasidim- avreikhim, and [re]establish the holy fellowship—sanctifying the whole world, the Besht’s wells spreading forth, hastening the coming of the Messiah, with God’s mercy!",
                "From the depths of my heart I pray to God: Please, merciful Father, who has mercy on his lowly children that they not be banished, and on his righteous children-prophets and servants—that they not be pushed aside.

Enlighten my eyes so that they see my innards and soul’s secrets, that I may see each path unbeknownst to the eagle’s eye, each vein revealed to me, and I will return it and myself to You. And via my gaze so too may others gaze at themselves, and in my return may they return. May I be built from them, and in their merit may I merit as well.
