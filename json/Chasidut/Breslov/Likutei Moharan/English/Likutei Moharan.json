For the intellect is a great light and shines for him in all his ways, as is written (Eccl. 8): \"A man's wisdom makes his face shine.\" ",

But one needs for this the nullification of all his feeling and materiality; then the man can hear his praise, and he will not have any haughtiness, like Moshe Rabbeinu, who saw it written in the Torah: \"And Hashem spoke unto Moshe,” “And Hashem said unto Moshe;\" and Israel reads every day in the Torah the praise of Moshe, and he himself tells them his praise; and Moshe did not have any glory or haughtiness from this, as is written: \"Now the man Moses was very humble,\" and certainly through his humility there was power in the hand of Moshe to atone the sin of the Calf, as is written: \"but a wise man will pacify it.\" ",

If a lighted torch is prepared for him, he is saved from thorns, pits and thistles; but he is still afraid of wild beasts and robbers, and does not know the road in which he is going.

Also we see tangibly, when a child is busy with his things of nonsense, even though he has great lusts for this, despite this when he sees his mother, he throws all his lusts behind his shoulders and draws himself to his mother.

What is the meaning of the words, 'Even so they shall be sheared and he shall pass'? — In the school of R. Ishmael it was taught: Whoever shears off part of his possessions and dispenses it in charity is delivered from the punishment of Gehenna. Picture two sheep crossing a river, one shorn and the other not shorn; the shorn one gets across, the unshorn one does not. ‘…And though I have afflicted you…’ Mar Zutra said: Even a poor man who himself subsists on charity should give charity. ‘…I will afflict you no more…’ R.

This is the 'davar'/word that Hashem commanded (Num. 30).\" And Rashi explained: All the prophets prophesied with \"B'cho amar Hashem.../so says Hashem\"; Moshe is added on past them, for he prophesied with \"Ze hadavar/this is the word.\" Because 'coh'/so is like a mirror that is not shiny, and \"zeh hadavar\" is like a shiny mirror.

                    "Hence, when there is some affliction or judgement in the space-time-soul then surely the it reduces from the joy of Hakadosh Baruch Hu, as is written (Gen. 6): \"And it grieved His heart;\" and as they said (Sanhedrin 46): \"What does the Shechinah say? 'My head hurts' etc.,\" ",
