This is the meaning of the Mishna: since he could reach this aspect of silence, he created time and space in the empty void between the scholars, for only through silence can one enter this place. \"The exposition is not what is essential, but deeds, and whoever increases words increases sin\" - because all the words and exposition of the scholars is not only for the sake of explaining things, but rather for deeds [<i>ma'aseh</i>, which can also mean 'creation'], for they create worlds through their words, and yet \"whoever increases words increases sin\" - an over-abundance of light creates the <i>klippot</i>.",

At the end of days reward will be given, and one will be able to comprehend the paradox of the empty void, which is truly empty and yet filled with divinity.

On that day, the \"top of Amanah\" will be revealed, which we have seen refers to the highest melody of the highest faith, by which all the contradictions of the empty void will be annulled. ",

                    "Be it known to you that, via [self-]renewal of Torah, rivers are made: for when one begins to innovations in Torah), one then begins to spout forth a spring, in the behina (dimension/aspect) of: “A spring shall issue from the House of the Lord” (Joel 4:18); which (viz. the House) is the intellect, as it is written: “A house is built by wisdom” (Proverbs 24:3). ",

                    "        As such, if one wishes to innovate novelties of Torah that are substantive, one must cry beforehand; for when said rivers are formed and all come to drink from them, then will the husks and the Sitra Ahara (the Other Side, or realm of evil) come as well, God forbid, to drink also from there. Therefore, one ought to cry beforehand, and consequently make rivers from crying, in the behina of: “He dams up the sources (or ‘the crying’) of the streams” (Job 28:11); that by means of crying one rectifies the rivers, from which all of the husks and the Sitra Ahara can drink that which is needed for their satisfaction. Accordingly, when one makes rivers out of Torah novelties that are innovated in the wake of [the rectification via crying], one can then draw down/extend them just to the appropriate places, so that “strangers” (that which is foreign/alien, viz. the husks and the Sitra Ahara) shall not drink from them. ",
                    "And for that reason the composition of the halakhot and the novelties are called “masekhet” (lit. tractate), as this is the behina of “v’Shikuvai b’v’Khi masakhti,” “and mixed (masakh) my drink with tears” (Psalms 102:10); that one must blend the drink with crying, because one must cry beforehand, as stated.",
                    "And this is the behina of: “By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat, sat and wept” (Psalms 137:1)—this is the behina of the Babylonian Talmud, that was composed at the yeshivot (seminaries/houses of study), from which rivers are made, as stated. And hence: “and wept” — because one must cry beforehand, in the behina of: “and mixed (masakh) my drink with tears” (Psalms 102:10), as stated."
