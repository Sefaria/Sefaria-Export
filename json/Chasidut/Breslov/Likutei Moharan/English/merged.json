        "Introduction": [
            "“O generation, see the word of God” (Jeremiah 2:31). The prophet does not say hear [the word of God], but see it. See that God has given you a precious gift, something which stands at the very summit of the world. As our Sages teach: <i>v’limekhaseh atik</i> (coverings of old)” (Isaiah 23:18)—this is the one who covers over that which <i>Atik Yomin</i> (the Ancient One) covered over. And there are those who maintain that this refers to the one who reveals that which <i>Atik Yomin</i> covered over (Pesachim 119a).",
            "Both are true of this holy work. It both reveals and conceals: revealing and explaining exalted and hidden matters, new insights, rudiments which are precious, awesome and wondrous; providing advice from afar, it is “the work of a master craftsman” (cf. Isaiah 25:1). All these teachings stem from the very exalted and awesome source of living water, [so that] “a wise man scales the city of the strong, and brings down the stronghold in which it trusts” (Proverbs 21:22).",
            "[These teachings are taught to us] through numerous constrictions and diminutions—from the Cause of Causes to the caused, from the upper intellect to the lower one (see Lesson #30)—until they have become clothed in these garments, the cloak of the Sages, in a clear and beautiful manner. They are in the form of pleasant, wondrous and sweet discourses, in the way of wisdom, reason, dialectic and logic, and the way of life—the reproof of ethical instruction, which is like a fire that burns to the very heart of heaven.",
            "All the lessons which Rebbe Nachman revealed to the Chosen People are filled with wonderful and awesome counsel in the true service of the Blessed Holy One. This will be obvious to anyone who studies them, provided he does so in search of the real truth.",
            "For this alone was the Rebbe’s holy intention: “to rouse the sleeping and waken the slumbering” (<i>Shabbat Liturgy</i>); to make straight the hearts of men, our Jewish brethren, with God’ “to tell the imprisoned, ‘Go free,’ to those residing in darkness, ‘Come out’” (Isaiah 49:9); “to give sight to eyes that are blind” (ibid. 42:7); ‘to redeem those bound in fetters’ (cf. Psalms 68:7), to “release the shackled from confinement, those who sit in darkness from [their] prison” (Isaiah 42:7)—those bound to their passions, trapped in their folly, cast out by their sins. [His desire was] to turn their hearts to the Holy One, to return them to God in truth, along the straight and true path, the path which our forefathers have followed from yore.",
            "And so, even though these points are somewhat obvious and understood from the simple interpretations of the teachings, there is more to them—they are “twofold in insight” (Job 11:6). For the inner meaning of the teachings remain hidden and concealed from all. They are matter that <i>Atik Yomin</i> covered over, which we must cover over and reveal in order to bring them into this world.",
            "This is because the covering <i>is</i> the revelation, as is explained in the writings of the Ari (cf. <i>Etz Chaim, Shaar HaKlallim</i> 2), and as we once heard from the Rebbe’s holy lips, when he said that the discourses that he revealed are thousands and thousands of levels lower than the exalted level at which he perceived them (<i>Tzaddik</i> #360).",
            "Precisely this is his strength and his awesomeness (cf. <i>Yoma</i> 69b): That his holy, lofty intellect succeeded in clothing and bringing down such high and awesome matters as these; holy, subtle and very spiritual matters which he clothed in numerous garments and contractions so that they have become suitable for all. [The Rebbe’s intention was] to inform people of God’s strength, and to reveal advice, ways and paths for attaining His service in truth, so “that all the peoples of the earth might know that God is the Lord, there's no other” (1 Kings 8:60).",
            "“It is superfluous to go on extolling” (Proverbs 14:23) the great holiness and awesomeness of this book. This is because anyone who is prepared to study it honestly will appreciate and understand the extent of its greatness on his own. But one whose heart is doubtful and who has no interest in perceiving the work’s holiness will not be aided at all by these words. Even so, “to all my comrades and friends” (Psalms 122:8) I shall relate a bit of the ways of this holy work, the remainder they will come to on their own—their eyes will see and then their hearts will rejoice.",
            "Each and every lesson of this holy book covers a number of different subjects. [These include] various positive character traits, numerous mitzvot of our holy Torah, as well as learning to keep away from negative traits. And each lesson discusses specific topics not mentioned in a previous teaching.",
            "Thus, the discourse entitles “Speak to the Priests” (Lesson #2) discusses prayer and guarding the Covenant, one being dependent upon the other; and the need to have the quality of judgment in order to know how to do battle with this sword [of prayer]…for which it is necessary to give charity before praying; as well as extraneous thoughts in prayer, studying the holy Torah, establishing the Tabernacle, and the need for binding prayer to the tzaddik of the generation. In the lesson, all these matters are explained by means of a link that is awesome and amazing, and which has no parallel.",
            "Then, a later discourse, such as “With Trumpets” (Lesson #52), covers entirely different matters: performing the mitzvot with joy, praying enthusiastically, fear, and so on. Other lessons deal with different topics, for all the teachings of this holy work are filled with advice which is both good and amazing.",
            "They speak about all the character traits and the mitzvot, and about the keeping away from and breaking of all human desires: primarily lust, avarice and gluttony. [Also discussed is the need for] keeping oneself from honor, anger, impatience and haughtiness, and the great value of truth as opposed to the disgrace of falsehood; keeping away from depression and idleness; keeping from the damage caused by the spoken word through slander and gossip, and from spiritually blemishing one’s vision or other senses; sanctifying one’s eyes, nose, ears and mouth (Lesson #21), these being “the seven lamps that radiate their light to the center of the holy menorah” (Numbers 8:2).",
            "[Further topics include] the holiness of Shabbat, the Holy Days and the New Moon; the Three Festivals and each holiday in particular: Pesach, Shavuot and Sukkot, and the mitzvot which are customarily performed on each one—e.g., eating matzah and the prohibition against <i>chametz,</i> reading the Haggadah and drinking the four cups on Pesach, and similarly the mitzvah of <i>sukkah</i> and the Four Species, Hoshana Rabbah, Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah, and receiving the Torah on Shavuot—as well as Rosh HaShanah and blowing the shofar, Yom Kippur, Chanukah and Purim.",
            "[Among the daily mitzvot, the lessons] deal with tzitzit, tefilin, reciting the <i>Shema</i> and prayer, charity and Torah study, engaging in business honestly, faith in God and faith in the Sages, humility, fear and love, the great value of holy desire and longing. [Rebbe Nachman also discusses the great value] of praying with enthusiasm and concentration, whether it be the three daily prayers or the other, very valuable supplementary prayers, supplications and requests which we must recite each and every day and in abundance. He pays particular attention to the special value of <i>hitbodedut</i>—daily expressing oneself before the Holy One, in the language one normally speaks, pouring one’s heart out to God that He should make one worthy of coming closer to His service; the importance of reciting the Psalms, through which one succeeds in repenting; the value of crying before the Holy One like a son begging his father for forgiveness.",
            "[The lessons likewise probe] the advantage of a broken heart and avoiding sadness; the benefit of joy, for which the Rebbe offers numerous wondrous suggestions, and for which a person must always strive; the value of the holiness of the Land of Israel, the Tabernacle, the Temple and Jerusalem; the disgrace of contentiousness and the great value of peace, repentance and fasting, of the holiness of thought and shunning of extraneous thoughts; and all the holy ways and means that exist in the world for which we all have need.",
            "[The Rebbe discusses] the great benefit of being close and attached to the tzaddikim (Lesson #123)—the very holiness of a Jew being dependent upon this; [the importance] of melody and musical instruments, and the ten types of song; of clapping and dancing, and of sighing and the “returning voice”—matters about which the ear has never heard, neither heard nor seen a revelation of the awesome mysteries, [though] the world has great need for matters such as these in which the ways of God are greatly hidden.",
            "Study elsewhere in the <i>Zohar</i> and the writings of the Kabbalists where, from a distance, you will discover and understand the very great concealed mysteries which are present in every human movement, especially when it involves something holy such as clapping one’s hands while praying or when it stems from the joy felt from observing a mitzvah and the like (see <i>Tikkuney Zohar</i> #69; <i>Tzaddik</i> #504, #507). Open your eyes, see, and understand.",
            "Again and again the lessons speak directly to a person’s heart, encouraging him in the service of God. He should never despair no matter what; never fall because of anything in the world, but always be stubborn in God’s service and never, under any circumstances, backslide from his achievements. For ‘the kindness of God never ends, His mercies never cease’ (cf. Lamentations 3:22)—ever.",
            "And in general, [the lessons speak] of the 613 Commandments of the Torah and their offshoots, all the rabbinical edicts; of the Written Law and the Oral Law, revealed and hidden, Halakhah and Kabbalah, secrets and deep secrets. All are mentioned and each is spoken of time and again with amazing approaches and links and new insights. Without exception, they are wonderful suggestions for how to draw closer to the Holy One. [Everything is discussed,] so that there is no mitzvah, holy matter, or good advice needed by all the people of the world on all the different levels, which is not mentioned in the holy and awesome work.",
            "For the Rebbe’s thoughts are very deep. He speaks of the universality of everything, in general and in particular; including al the universes and levels that exist in the world of each person, great and small alike, from the starting point of creation— the initial point of <i>Atzilut</i>—to the ultimate point of <i>Asiyah</i>—the physical world in which man resides. Each individual, in accordance with the place and level he is on at that moment, from the greatest of the great to the smallest of the small, and even one who is located on the lowest rungs of the ten “unholy crowns,” having fallen into the farthest reaches and even further because of his sins—Rebbe Nachman arouses, awakens and inspires each one of them so that they never despair, God forbid, from [His] mercy. The Rebbe’s words support the one who is falling, he strengthens the one who has weak knees (Job 4:4; as is explained in <i>Likutey Moharan</i> II, 7, “He with Compassion for Them will Lead Them”).",
            "In general, each and every topic with which Rebbe Nachman deals, he discusses again and again, each time taking a different approach, suggesting some different advice.",
            "For example: In Lesson #5, “With Trumpets,” it is explained that intense prayer corresponds to thunder, and that through such prayer one merits straightening the crookedness of the heart and observing the mitzvot with a great joy stemming from the mitzvah itself. Then, in Lesson #48, “Because you were Unfaithful,” it is explained that through intense prayer one merits sons, and that such prayer corresponds to the <i>sukkah</i> and the Land of Israel, whereas elsewhere (Lesson #44) it is explained that intense prayer eliminates haughtiness, self-interests, and foreign thoughts during prayer. And in the teaching “The Deeps Covered them,” Lesson #9, it is explained that by praying intensely one receives the essence of life-force and sustains all the worlds—“lower, second and uppermost”—and merits miracles and wonders, complete faith, the Land of Israel, etc.",
            "The same is true of all the character traits, mitzvot, directives, practices and holy suggestions of which he speaks. The Rebbe discusses all of them over and over again, each time in a novel and amazing way, with a new and amazing link. One time the Rebbe connects and links together guarding the Covenant, through which one merits faith, which is the aspect of Shabbat, through which charity and Torah are made complete…and then one merits a holy desire to be a righteous person so that his eating corresponds to the showbread of the Temple, as explained in the teaching “We Have a Well in the Desert” (Lesson #31). Another time he connects guarding the Covenant with eliminating haughtiness, which is idolatry, and rectifying the thirty-nine works [prohibited on Shabbat], which are all the business activities in the world, the upper and lower unifications, Halakhah and Kabbalah…and through this, meriting speech that inspires repentance to the point where one merits deep Torah understanding, as explained in “I am God” (Lesson #44). Similar such examples can be found with respect to other mitzvot and character traits.",
            "The Rebbe gave wonderful advice, spreading hope through various new and wonderful ways. Because of our utter weakness, and because of the great force with which man’s evil inclination overpowers him, attacking him daily, as our Sages teach (Sukkah 52a-b), we therefore need advice and awakening to His service in different ways. This is because sometimes a person will be aroused to a specific path or service through the light of a particular lesson. Other times, he is not aroused by that lesson, but only by a different teaching. Everything depends upon the person; his spiritual level, the place and the time. “Taste and you will see that God is good” (Psalms 34:9). ‘Hear the Rebbe’s words for they are very pleasing’ (cf. Psalms 141:6). They are for anyone who truly desires and is willing to look at himself and take pity on his true life, willing to consider his end and departure from this world: with what sort of face will he ascend before the King…as each person knows in his soul and heart.",
            "Understand and see as well that all the words of each and every lesson in this book contain great depth; there is great profundity in the totality, in the specific, and in the fine details [of the lesson]. As I myself heard from Rebbe Nachman’s holy lips, when he said, “There are great depths to my teachings” (<i>Tzaddik</i> #347, #348). Why, “the words of this holy work are like a fire and like a hammer splitting rock” (Jeremiah 23:29; see <i>Kiddushin</i> 30b). Each lesson can be divided into numerous new and vital rudiments, and into the various topics and subjects which emerge from each teaching.",
            "For each and every discourse that appears in this holy book is in itself an awesome and mighty structure—“built fortified” (Song of Songs 4:4), a fortress to which all turn (Berakhot 30a; <i>Shir HaShirim Rabbah</i> 4:11)—comprising many chambers, room within room within room, with windows and openings leading from one to another. And each and every chamber, each explanation, topic and rudiment which appears in a teaching has in it very great depth. The more these explanations and topics expand—as the “waters cover the sea” (Isaiah 11:9)—the deeper and deeper they get, so that “the clever man studies deeply his way” (Proverbs 14:15).",
            "Each time a person goes from chamber to chamber, from room to room, and from subject to subject within the same topic, he must turn and look back to understand well the sweetness and depth of the words; the end of the matter from its beginning, the beginning from its end. Everything is bound, connected and intertwined; the opening with the conclusion, and the conclusion with the opening, as well as with the body of the text and the marginal points. The reader who traverses the material will increase his understanding, especially with respect to the broader perspective of the lesson, which is bound and sealed, inclusive of many wondrous and deep explanations and topics—‘broader that the sea itself’ (cf. Job 11:9).",
            "And you, the serious student, should understand in the Rebbe’s words that there are times when, in an awesomely intricate and pleasing fashion, he brings two or three proofs for one point. However, due to the cursive style in which the material is presented, it may seem as if there is only one proof. Such is the manner of this book: often using “because” or “for” or some similar word more than once within a single statement, thus making it appear as if it is but a single reason and proof, when in truth there are a number of reasons. But, because each one is linked to the next, it is impossible to separate them. For numerous are the reasons and proofs, set forth in an amazing way, each one fastened and bound to the next (see <i>Parparaot LeChokhmah’s</i> Introduction).",
            "Indeed, because of the great depth of each and every statement, it would have been fitting to write each time” read carefully,” or “understand this,” or “study this well,” or some similar expression cautioning the reader to pay close attention to the point being made so as to understand it well. But I realized that if that were the case, it would be necessary to write some such comment following just about every point, considering the abundant sweetness of the intellect and depth contained in every topic and in almost every statement. In general, there is such great depth to the Rebbe’s words that none of these expressions could suffice. I have therefore withheld my pen and kept myself from employing any such language, although occasionally and upon rare instances some such expression did escape from the quill.",
            "Anyone who has a brain in his head and studies these teachings with an open mind will, on his own, appreciate their depth. They are ‘broader and deeper than the sea’ (cf. Job 11:9), ‘higher than the sky, deeper than the depths’ (cf. Proverbs 25:3). Anyone who wants to taste the sweet nectar of these words should analyze them honestly and in great depth, understanding each matter in its context as best he possibly can. “Happy is the one who has found wisdom and who draws insight” (Proverbs 3:13), understanding well the simple meaning of the lessons which appear in this holy book (see <i>Tzaddik</i> #353,#361, #362, #365).",
            "Even so, it is something which is suitable for everyone. Even someone whose understanding of intricate matters is limited can find tranquility for his soul in the words of this holy book, in the holy advice and wonderful moral guidance which emerges from each and every lesson—to the degree that God enlightens him in understanding the simple meaning which the Rebbe intended in his holy teachings. Because the truth is, that all the teachings of this awesome book contain extremely exalted and deep insights—infinitely so. Concealed and cloaked within them are very great and fantastic matters which only appear in the Torah by means of an allusion or in an esoteric teaching.",
            "All the writings of the holy Ari and the discourses of the holy <i>Zohar</i> and the <i>Tikkuney Zohar,</i> as well as all the ways of the Kabbalah, are all included in this holy book. Each and every lesson speaks about the deeper intentions of some mitzvah and of a particular portal in the <i>Etz Chaim</i> in some amazing and spectacular fashion. This we have seen with our own eyes and not through another’s, for the Rebbe opened our eyes and occasionally revealed a drop of his great intention, as is hinted at every so often in this work. For each lesson contains <i>PaRDeS: Pshat</i>—explanation of the simple meaning of the text; <i>Remez</i>—explanation of the allusions within the text; <i>Drush</i>— explanation of the text using the principles of hermeneutics; and <i>Sod</i>—explanation of the text according to its esoteric interpretation. In each approach, there is great depth, though Rebbe Nachman’s primary intention is the simple meaning of each lesson.",
            "This is because “study alone is not the main thing—doing is” (Avot 1:17), as has been explained in a number of places (see <i>Rabbi Nachman’s Wisdom</i> #19, #27, etc.). The essence of his holy intention in each teaching that he revealed and in every statement which issued from his holy lips was only in order to add merit to Israel and bring them to upright actions, to hint to them from far and near, to teach them fantastic counsel and guidance in drawing closer to the Holy One from wherever one is. This the observer will surely notice provided he chooses to view it with an honest and open eye. For the Rebbe’s whole intention was only that we diligently work at understanding the service and advice which come out of each lesson, beseeching God, prostrating ourselves before Him and striving, with simplicity, to fulfill all that appears in them.",
            "And we trust God that anyone who pays close attention to the holy words set forth in this holy work, his heart will be kindled and his eyes opened, and he will desire and yearn for the service of God. He will then return to Him in truth, with his entire heart, soul and strength. A heart as fixed as a rock will be moved from its place. “If it is stone, it will melt; if it is iron, it will splinter” (Kiddushin 30b). As we heard from the Rebbe’s holy lips: “If a person is prepared to study this work honestly, then without any doubt his heart’s obstinacy will be shattered and he will repent totally” (<i>Tzaddik</i> #349).",
            "In truth, it is well nigh impossible to speak the praises of this holy and fantastic tome, and certainly of the praises and holiness of its author: the exalted, great and precious light, our master, teacher and rabbi (may remembrance of the righteous and holy bring blessing). In his case, ‘silence is the most fitting praise’ (cf. Psalms 65:2), especially because we are aware of the great conflict—many having stood up against him and us without provocation or cause. Because of this we have had to bridle out mouths and remain silent from the good, from truthfully delineating the praises of his holiness and sanctity, his simplicity, righteousness and humility.",
            "“For in the place of his greatness and exalted wisdom”—his having reached tremendous heights in all aspects of the Torah: in the revealed and the hidden, in the sea of the Talmud, its earlier and later codifiers, and in all the concealed exalted insights, so that “no secret escaped him” (Daniel 4:6), nor did anything remain obscured from him—“there we find his humility!” (Megillah 31a). He was forthright, patient, long-suffering, and whole in his deeds; serving God with wondrous self-sacrifice, never ceasing day or night, neither relaxing nor resting from his service of Him with very great and fantastic wisdom and insight, as your eyes will clearly see from this holy work. Because any reader who pays attention to these words will judge favorably, for it is impossible to attain teachings such as these with a full belly. How greatly he toiled, how hard he worked, how many thousands of fasts—time and again from Shabbat to Shabbat—how many mortifications, how many, many years spent in secluded prayer, separating himself in every way from all desires, sanctifying himself with all types of holiness.",
            "And above all, he ascended and sanctified himself with awesome and exquisite holiness through the sanctity of the Land of Israel, for which he endangered his life. He travelled to the Holy Land at a time when [the Napoleonic} War was fiercely raging in those lands through which he passed. How many difficulties he encountered along the way. God is righteous, He judges in the same manner as the flax-dealer: [putting the mighty, not the meek, to the more severe test] (Bereishit Rabbah 32:3; <i>Rashi,</i> Psalms 11:5). For in those times the Rebbe was beset by all different kinds of relentless and unceasing adversities and dangers, including the afflictions of plague and the tumult of war which had beset the Holy Land so that no one could be certain that he would live another day, as well as other kinds of severe hardships, physical, spiritual and monetary, which are impossible to explain in writing (see <i>Rabbi Nachman’s Wisdom: The Pilgrimage</i>). Yet, in His mercy, the Blessed One gave the Rebbe an iron will to endure all this suffering and hardship from every direction, such as no man can bear, so that he merited overcoming all obstacles and entered the Land of Israel. He departed and returned in peace (cf. <i>Chagigah</i> 14b) unharmed, having attained that which he did both in the revealed and the hidden.",
            "Because, aside from “those hidden things which are God’s” (Deuteronomy 29:28), which he achieved through the Land of Israel and which remain hidden from all living creatures, also in those things manifest, ‘we saw that God was with him’ (cf. Genesis 26:28). Thus, the teachings which he revealed after having been in the Land of Israel immeasurably eclipsed in insight and level those that he revealed before his journey; despite the fact that even previously his holy lessons had tremendously enlightened the world. The words of his teachings were always amazing, but just as ‘the heavens are high above the earth’ (Isaiah 55:9), so, too, the ways of the teachings which he revealed after visiting the Land of Israel are high above the ways of the teachings which he had earlier revealed, as we explicitly heard from his holy lips a number of times (see <i>Tzaddik</i> #55, #130-135, #357). The work itself is almost entirely made up of lessons which he disclosed after being in the Land of Israel. There are but a few lessons, perhaps two or three pages worth, which are from the lessons given prior to his pilgrimage (these are interspersed among the lessons bearing the mark <i>leshon chaverim</i> [written not by Reb Noson but by other followers], which appear between Lesson #73 and #110, and then only a very few of these).",
            "This book was first published thirteen years ago in Ostrog, in 5568 (1808), while Rebbe Nachman was still alive. But, because we were not present when it was printed, the local printers tampered considerably [with the text]. As a result, a good number of mistakes were made during the printing. In a number of places, whole lines went missing or the order was changed, and some pieces were totally exchanged with others. This, aside from other errors in the demarcation between lessons, as well as within the lessons themselves, where a space or a break is occasionally required between different points. In all these areas, the printers introduced considerable distortions. There were places where large gaps were inserted into the text for no reason at all. In other places, where a division in the text was called for, they combined and put together two separate pieces, sometimes leaving no empty space even at the very beginning of a lesson. Having set my heart and mind on fixing all of this in the best way possible, to the extent that God was with me, I have corrected all the mistakes and distortions that appeared in the first printing.",
            "It should also be mentioned that the first printing took place quite unexpectedly and without my being present, while the Rebbe, of blessed memory, was in Lemberg (Lvov). Thus, although in a number of places in the text it had been necessary to make certain revisions, because of the great rush to print, it was printed the way it had been originally recorded in the initial version. I therefore saw fit and made it my business to make corrections in many places, to expand and explain the material further. I did this in accordance with what I knew and understood to be the intent of the teaching, in line with what I heard from his holy lips. As for the lessons which had been written in the Rebbe’s own holy language, I’ve never subtracted nor added to them, not even so much as a single letter. Only in those places where it was absolutely necessary to include some interpretation and explanation, there I presented the material within braces so that it would be clear that this was not from the Rebbe himself.",
            "I’ve also made an effort to research all the references for all the verse quoted from Scripture and the rabbinical teachings from the Talmud, Midrash, the holy <i>Zohar,</i> the <i>Tikkuney Zohar</i> and the writings of the Ari. There are very, very many of those in this work and, with God’s help, I’ve recorded their sources—“where the place of their glory” (Liturgy) is found.",
            "I also marked off each lesson, assigning each teaching a different letter according to the order of the Hebrew alphabet so that it is easier for the student to find what he is looking for. In addition, within each lesson itself, I affixed a letter adjacent to each topic so as ‘to indicate a break and a notation between one topic and the next’ (cf. <i>Rashi,</i> Leviticus 1:1) and to point out that at this juncture the discourse changes topics to teach and explain another rudiment and subject, as will be understood when one analyzes these parts of the text.",
            "Furthermore, in this book there are a number of discourses which are brought twice, one full length and one abridged. The reason for this is as follows: Such was Rebbe Nachman’s way. Generally speaking, in those lessons which he recorded himself there were numerous differences between his spoken and written versions. Because of the speed at which his holy mind worked at the time he recorded the teaching, he would either delete from or add to what he said when he delivered his discourse in public. The same cannot be said of me, because I was careful to write down exactly what I heard from his holy lips, without subtracting or adding. There are also a number of teachings which I transcribed, only to later have the Rebbe’s own written version come into my possession. For the reason mentioned earlier, there were differences between these versions and I consequently decided that both were good. The rule is that anything taught twice has only been repeated because of some aspect which is unique to the second (Chagigah 3a).",
            "This concludes our limited words which contain a great deal for making known just a modicum of the ways of this holy book—“a little which holds much.” It is impossible to go on about and relate any more of the amazing and tremendous holiness which exists in this holy and awesome work. Whole reams of paper would not suffice for telling the praises of even one lesson of this holy book. This is especially so because of the current increase in controversy which has arisen because of our many sins. And, because of our many transgressions, we have witnessed the fulfillment of “Truth has been thrown down to the ground” (Daniel 8:12); and, “The truth is absent” (Isaiah 59:15)—namely, the truth has been broken into many different groups (Sanhedrin 97a), with each group claiming that it alone possesses it. Even so, the truth remains one and testifies for itself.",
            "He that chooses shall choose, while we will put our trust in God. “For there is no one for us to rely upon other than our Father in heaven” (Sotah 49b) to Whom we turn. Your mercy and compassion have stood by us until now, may You never ever forsake or abandon us. “Provide us with Your light and Your truth, they will guide us” (Psalms 43:3). “May God our Lord be with us as He was with our fathers” (1 Kings 8:57), and “may the pleasantness of God our Lord be upon us; establish the works of our hands upon us” (Psalms 90:17).

            "Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai gave assurances that through him the Torah would not be forgotten from the Jewish people. As our Sages teach (Shabbat 138b): When our rabbis entered the yeshivah in Yavneh, they said, “The Torah will one day be forgotten by the Jews.” But Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai said that it would not be forgotten, as is written (Deuteronomy 31:21), “It will not be forgotten from the mouth of his offspring.” And, as is explained in the <i>Zohar</i> (III, 124b): Because of this work, the Book of the <i>Zohar,</i> [the Jews] will be redeemed from exile. So now come, see and understand the hidden wonders of our holy Torah. This is why Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai based himself on this verse: “It will not be forgotten from the mouth of his offspring.” For, in truth, this mystery is hinted at and concealed in this very verse. Through the offspring of Yochai, this being Rashby, the Torah will not be forgotten by the Jews. This is because the final letters of the words in this verse “<i>kI loA tishakhaCh mipiY zar’O</i>” are the same letters as YOChAI. This is what the verse hints to and reveals: “It will not be forgotten from the mouth of his offspring”—specifically “from the mouth of <i>his</i> offspring.” That is, “from the mouth of the offspring” of the one who is himself alluded to and hidden in this verse, this being the sage Yochai. Because of the offspring of Yochai, who is hinted at in the final letters of the words in this verse—this being Rashby—the Torah will not be forgotten; for with this <i>Zohar</i> they will be redeemed from exile, as above. And know! the mystery of Rabbi Shimon himself is alluded to in another verse. Know that the holy sage Rabbi Shimon corresponds to (Daniel 4:10): “<i>Ir V’kaddish Min Shemaya Nachit</i> (An angel, a holy one, descended from heaven)”—the first letters of which are ShIMON….\n"

However, this necessitates the negation of all one’s emotions and corporeality. Then, a person can hear himself being praised and not come to any pride. This was the case with Moshe Rabbeinu, who saw it written in the Torah: “God spoke to Moshe,” [and] “God said to Moshe.” Each day, the Jewish people read in the Torah [God’s] praise of Moshe.

When the Holy One commanded the trees [to yield fruit] after their own kind, the grasses drew an inference with regard to themselves: If the trees—which are large and do not [reproduce] in close proximity—were commanded by the Holy One “after its own kind” (Genesis 1:11), then all the more so we—who are small and do [reproduce] in close proximity—must bring forth [only] “after its own kind.” The ministering angel of the world spoke up and said, “May God’s glory be forever; [God shall rejoice in His works]” (Chullin 60a, cf. Rashi).",
                    "For in truth, even the great ones—whose marital relations are not in close proximity, but from one Shabbat to the next—are also warned by the Torah concerning guarding the <i>brit.</i> They must guard themselves. As is brought in the <i>Kavanot</i> (Pri Etz Chaim, Shaar HaShabbat 18): It is written (Exodus 31:16), “<i>v’shamru B’nei Yisrael Æt Hashabbat</i> (the Children of Israel shall keep the Shabbat)”—the first letters of which spell <i>BYAH</i> (sexual relations). In other words, even though his marital relations are only from Shabbat to Shabbat, he still must exercise great <i>ShMiRah</i> (guarding). This is “<i>v’ShaMRu</i> ….”",
                    "All the more so the small ones, who correspond to the grasses. Their marital relations, which also take place during the weekdays, are in close proximity. They must certainly exercise great caution in guarding their <i>brit.</i> They must guard themselves in accordance with the Torah, in the aspect of “after its own kind.”",
                    "As soon as the ministering angel of the world—this is Metat whose rule is the six weekdays, corresponding to the grasses/the lower unification—heard this, he spoke up and said, “May God’s glory be [forever].” Specifically “glory,” because, as explained, by guarding the <i>brit</i> on both levels glory is complete.",

And the way to merit prayer is through the revealed Torah. This is because the Torah which is revealed corresponds to Sinai, as our Sages taught: “Sinai” or “an uprooter-of-mountains,” which is preferable? And they answered, “Sinai” is preferable, for everyone requires the grain merchant (Berakhot 4a). The revealed Torah is something which everyone needs.

As a result of this, it is possible for him to die—the aspects of “he gazed and died,” and of “one who serves God.” And there is one who goes out of his mind, because he ascends higher than his level—the aspects of “he gazed and was stricken,” and of “one who does not serve Him.” Be that as it may, even the “gazed and died, gazed and was stricken” both correspond to the tzaddik.

Therefore, perforce he finds that which belongs to him by the tzaddik—he finds something with which to “cut plantings.” Of him it is said, “the wicked stumble in them.” For the teacher must have both these qualities, as explained.",

                    "In order to somewhat explain the matter we must go back and explain the theme of this lesson. The general principle of the lesson is that, as explained at the beginning of <i>Etz Chaim,</i> when God wanted to create the world, the Light of the Holy One was <i>ein sof</i> (infinite) and so there was no place for the creation of the worlds. He therefore, had to contract the Light of <i>Ein Sof</i> to the sides, so to speak, thus making a hollowed space. Within this <i>Chalal Hapanuy</i> (Hollowed or Vacated Space) He created all the worlds. And all the worlds were created by means of <i>Chokhmah,</i> as in, “You created everything with wisdom.”",
                    "Now, the essential purpose for creating the worlds was for the sake of <i>Malkhut</i> —i.e., in order to reveal His Kingship. This is possible only by means of the worlds, for there can be no king without a nation. Because of this there was a contraction of the <i>Chalal Hapanuy,</i> so that there would be a place for the creation of the worlds, so that God’s Kingship might be revealed.",
                    "All this is explained in the <i>Zohar</i> and the writings, and Rebbe Nachman, of blessed memory, explains how all this applies to every person. For each and every Jew is “a portion of God from above,” and the essence of Godliness is in the heart. Moreover, the Godliness in a Jewish heart is the aspect of <i>ein sof.</i> This is because the light of its flaming reaches to <i>Ein Sof</i> —i.e., there is no end or limit to its yearning.",
                    "Thus, considering the degree to which the heart of a Jew is set aflame, reaching all the way to <i>Ein Sof,</i> it would be impossible to perform any devotion or reveal any good attribute. For by virtue of its great flaming till <i>Ein Sof,</i> he is incapable of doing anything—this being the aspect of the beginning of creation, when there was no room for the creation because everything was <i>Ein Sof.</i> This is because creation of the worlds [is creation] of the attributes themselves, as explained above.",
                    "Therefore a person certainly has to contract the light of his heart’s flaming, which is till <i>Ein Sof,</i> in order that he might serve God in stages and with measure. For God desires our service, that we serve Him with devotions and good attributes, which is possible only by means of the contraction, as explained above.",
                    "Thus, when he contracts the light of his heart’s flaming, there is an hollowed space left in the heart, corresponding to “and my heart is hollowed within me” (this being the deeper meaning of the Vacated Space at the beginning of creation). And within this hollowed space, his good attributes—this being the deeper meaning behind the creation of the worlds that took place within the <i>Chalal Hapanuy</i> —are revealed. For the attributes are themselves the worlds, as explained above.",
                    "In other words, by means of the contraction, his having contracted the light of the flaming, the aspect of the <i>Chalal Hapanuy</i> is made, corresponding to “and my heart is hollowed within me.” Through this he serves God in stages and with measure, doing good deeds and [acquiring] good attributes. For all this is the aspect of revealing the attributes, the worlds, within the hollowed space in the heart.",
                    "Now, the creation of the worlds was mainly by means of <i>Chokhmah,</i> as explained above. This is the aspect of why the essence of serving God, meriting good attributes and deeds, is through guarding the wisdom in the heart—i.e., the thought in the heart. For we must carefully guard the thought in the heart, which is the aspect of a wise heart—this being the essence of the inclinations. The good thoughts are the good inclination, and the evil thoughts are the evil inclination.",
                    "In other words, when he thinks good thoughts, this being the aspect of the wisdom in the heart, then, as a result, he merits good deeds and attributes. This is the aspect of the revelation of the creation/the attributes within the <i>Chalal Hapanuy</i> by means of the wisdom in the heart, which, as explained above, is the aspect of the good thoughts in the heart. But when he thinks evil thoughts, God forbid, he then spoils the space in the heart, this being the deeper meaning of the Vacated Space. Hence, he clogs up the space in the heart, in the aspect of a foreskinned heart. This is the aspect of the spoiling of the creation, which came about through the wisdom in the heart, as explained above.",
                    "Thus, the crux of the service—for which we need the above mentioned contraction and to think good thoughts in order to merit good deeds and good attributes—is entirely so as to reveal His Kingship. Creation was essentially for this purpose. For by meriting through all of the above to good deeds and attributes, he wholly accepts the yoke of the Kingship of Heaven. This is the aspect of the revelation of God’s Kingship, which is revealed by means of the creation of the worlds that are within the <i>Chalal Hapanuy</i> through <i>Chokhmah.</i>",
                    "The principle is that the creation of the worlds and serving God through good deeds and attributes are one and the same aspect, as explained above. Understand this well.",
                    "And once God’s Kingship is revealed through his good deeds and attributes, which were revealed within the space inside his heart, this is the elevation of the above mentioned two houses—“‘who’ together with ‘this,’” the upper house and the lower house. For the revelation of <i>Malkhut</i> is the aspect of the lower house, whereas the beginning of the contraction, which is the hollowed space in the heart, is the aspect of the upper house. This is because the main intention behind the contraction was in order to serve God so as to merit revealing God’s Kingship. Therefore, the rectification and elevation of the upper house is not complete until there is an ascent of the lower house—i.e., until God’s Kingship is revealed—as this is the intended purpose behind the creation.",
                    "And so, when God’s Kingship is revealed, precisely then the upper house undergoes an ascent. For precisely then, the two of them, the upper house and the lower house, ascend together in the aspect of “Who is this that ascends”—”who” ascends together with “this,” as explained above. For “I will not enter the city until holiness is in your midst”—the Holy One will not enter Jerusalem of above, which is “<i>Binah</i> is the heart,” until Jerusalem of below, the aspect of the revelation of God’s Kingship, is built.",

Yet for the discerning, the words are unambiguous. The main thing is to fulfill them simply: to carefully guard oneself from evil thoughts, for evil thoughts are the essence of the evil inclination—corresponding to “a formation for evil.” Therefore, a person must carefully guard his thinking and force himself to always think good thoughts, which are the aspect of the good inclination, and merit thereby good deeds and good attributes, etc., to pray attentively and to repent.",

                    "For an instrument is a gathering of the <i>ruach,</i> which is a mixture of good and evil. There is a <i>ruach</i> of depression, a gloomy <i>ruach,</i> a <i>ruach</i> of evil, as it is said of Shaul, “an evil <i>ruach</i> began to terrify him” (1 Samuel 16:14). There is also a good <i>ruach,</i> as it is written, “Let Your good <i>ruach</i> guide me on level ground” (Psalms 143:10). This is the aspect of the <i>ruach</i> of prophecy, Divine <i>ruach</i> .",
                    "But when a person is a mixture of good and evil, he cannot receive truthful prophecies. Thus it is written of Shaul (1 Samuel 19:24), “he began to prophesy… and he lay <i>arom</i> (naked).” Rashi explains that this connotes madness, because he had been infused with a <i>ruach</i> of folly, a <i>ruach</i> of depression. <b>{“Let our lord order the courtiers attending you to look for someone skilled at playing… his hand will play, and it will be good for you”</b> (1 Samuel 16:16)<b>.}</b>",
                    "The person whose hand plays an instrument collects and gathers up with his hand the good <i>ruach,</i> the <i>ruach</i> of prophecy, from within the <i>ruach</i> of depression. Thus he must be “skilled at playing,” knowing how to collect and gather and find the components of the <i>ruach</i> one by one, in order to build the tune, the joy—i.e., to build the good <i>ruach,</i> the <i>ruach</i> of prophecy, which is the opposite of a <i>ruach</i> of depression. For he has to raise and lower his hand on the instrument he is playing in order to direct the buildup of the joy to perfection.",
                    "Thus, when the prophet hears this music from one who is “skilled at playing,” he receives from him the <i>ruach</i> of prophecy which [the musician] gathered with his hand from within the <i>ruach</i> of depression. This is the explanation of “his hand will play, and it will be good for you”—specifically “it will be good for you,” because he gathers and refines the good from within the evil.",
                    "And the main gathering and building up of the <i>ruach</i> of prophecy is by means of the hand, because the deposits of the <i>ruach</i> are there, as it is written (Psalms 31:6), “Into Your hand I deposit my <i>ruach,</i>” and as in (Job 12:10), “in Whose hand is the life of every living thing and the <i>ruach</i> of all human flesh.” This is the explanation of “As the musician played, the hand of God came upon him” (2 Kings, ibid.) .",

This is why he must be “skilled at playing,” and why the instrument he plays must be whole, so that he can properly extract and direct the music to perfection. This corresponds to extracting the good <i>ruach,</i> which is the aspect of joy/the <i>ruach</i> of prophecy, from the <i>ruach</i> of depression/the <i>ruach</i> of evil, as explained above. For when the instrument is not whole, or he is not skilled at playing and so does not know how to raise and lower his hand in order to extract the good <i>ruach</i> from the evil <i>ruach,</i> it is said of him (Proverbs 29:11), “A fool vents all his <i>ruach</i>”—i.e., he gives out all the <i>ruach</i> at one time, so that the music is certainly not built up.",
                    "This is because the essential beauty of the music is achieved through the extraction of the <i>ruach</i> {this is the air from which the sound comes, as is known to those skilled in music}. In other words, the aspect of music comes essentially through the extracting of the good <i>ruach</i> from the evil <i>ruach</i>. But when he brings out the <i>ruach</i> all at once, it comes out as it is: a mixture of good and evil. As a result, the music and joy are not built up, and the imagination is not subdued.",
                    "This corresponds to “His <i>ruach</i> goes out; he returns to his <i>adamah</i> (dust)” (Psalms 146:4). “To his <i>aDaMaH</i>” is the aspect of the <i>meDaMeH</i>. In other words, when all the <i>ruach</i> comes out, he returns and goes back to the imagination. This is because he has not subdued the imagination, since he is unable to gather and extract the good <i>ruach,</i> so that all the <i>ruach,</i> which is a mixture of good and evil, comes out.",

For the heart contains the <i>ruach</i> of the pulse, which exists from before birth, transporting on it all the fluids and all the blood and all the juices. This <i>ruach</i> of the pulse circulates and beats in all the limbs. By its circulating and blowing through them, it agitates, blusters and disperses the decay in them, so that they do not atrophy or waste away.

This brings to a depressed <i>ruach,</i> and because the <i>ruach</i> is depressed, it does not beat steadily. As a result, the limbs become heavy, because the <i>ruach</i> of the pulse does not blow inside them in a steady fashion. The hands are then in the aspect of “Moshe’s hands were heavy” (Exodus 17:12).

Because the <i>ruach</i> of the pulse grows weaker, the limbs become heavier still. And as a result of the limbs growing even heavier, the <i>ruach</i> of the pulse grows weaker and weaker.

In other words, we take so much and so much in volume and weight of a particular medicament and a particular grass, and so much and so much in weight of another grass, and also weigh a number of different types, each grass having a different potency. Then we mix all the types together and make a compound out of them. It is this compound that has the power to heal the person who is ill. We see then that the cure’s essential potency comes from its being a compound. It acquires a new and different potency through the energy it receives from all these grasses that have been mixed together. And it is specifically this potency of the compound that heals the illness. This is why an expert doctor is needed, someone who knows how to make the compound. However, someone who is not an expert, even if he uses the grasses that have the power to heal, he will still not accomplish anything because he does not know how to compound them.",

However, from the Torah itself it is impossible to learn anything, except by means of the sages of the generation, for they expound it. For “the words of Torah are sparse in their place but enriched from elsewhere.” The sages assemble, mix and compound the Torah, and with the Thirteen Principles expound one place based on another: “removing, adding and expounding” (Bava Batra 111b). And even though in the Torah it is written one way, they remove a letter or word from there and add it elsewhere, and with this interpret it in accordance with what they know, as was given over to them. Therefore, when someone disgraces a Torah sage, he has no cure for his punishment. This is because the main healing energy that we get from the Torah can be gotten only through the sages of the generation, for it was given over to them to expound and they know how to compound the Torah’s letters, as mentioned above. This is the essence of the healing energy, because all the grasses receive potency from the Torah, as explained above, and their healing energies comes mainly from the compound, as mentioned above.

And this is the aspect of “The fear of God is His treasure house” (Isaiah 33:6), the aspect of “He built her like a storehouse”—narrow on top and wide at the bottom (Berakhot 61a). Although the day’s beginning is narrow, afterwards, as a result of fear, it expands and progresses with increased holiness, as explained above.",
                    "Thus it is through fear that we merit length-of-days, which is the aspect of an elder/the rectifications of <i>Atik,</i> through which we merit wealth. This is because fear protects against the opposite of wealth, namely poverty, which stems from the aspect of “Grace is deceptive, and beauty is vain” (Proverbs 31:30). For there are various forms of deceptive grace that a person effects in the way he stands or eats or speaks with people. This is true of other things as well; each thing has a different grace that is unique [to it]. And all these types of deceptive grace stem from vain beauty, in the aspect of “Grace is deceptive,” <i>when</i> “beauty is vain”—i.e., one who does not guard against the beauty of women consequently acquires the desires associated with deceptive grace. Yet fear is the opposite of this, as it is written, “Grace is deceptive, and beauty is vain; it is for her fear of God that a woman is to be praised!”",
                    "Therefore, when Avraham and Yitzchak arrived at a place where fear was non-existent and sought to enter there, they immediately sensed this; since, commensurate with their extensive holiness, they began to sense the beauty of the women. Thus they sensed that there was no fear there, and so forbade themselves relations with their wives, as with one’s sister; as it is written (Genesis 20:11), “for I said, the one thing missing in this place is the fear of God…” Afterwards, Avraham rectified this [absence of fear] and drew length-of-days, as it is written (Genesis 21:34), “Avraham lived in the land of the Philistines for many days,” the aspect of “The fear of God prolongs one’s days,” as explained above.",

Therefore, when Yitzchak arrived there, he too had to forbid himself relations with his wife as if she were his sister, until he had drawn length-of-days there; this being the aspect of fear, which saves a person from this [vain beauty], as explained above. And then she was permitted to him, as it is written (ibid.:8), “After [Yitzchak] had been there a lengthy time, Avimelekh looked out…” By his drawing length-of-days he merited wealth there, as it is written (ibid.:12), “Yitzchak sowed in that land and in that same year reaped a hundredfold…,” as explained above.",

This is because wealth is produced by extended breathing. Beauty, however, is produced by suspended breathing, since at the moment the drop of semen emerges, breathing must stop. There are two reasons for this: a) so that the breathing, the cool air that one constantly takes in, does not cool off the drop, which has to be warm when it emerges if it is to produce offspring; and b) since the ejaculatory force is engaged in issuing and pushing out the drop, breathing must stop. Breathing entails exhaling air and inhaling air. Since the ejaculatory force is occupied with pushing out the drop, one cannot exhale the air, and consequently breathing is suspended. This breath of air that was previously inhaled and remained there is encompassed in the ejaculatory force, and through it the drop emerges.",
                    "And to the degree that the breath is pure and clear, the offspring is likewise fair and healthy. For if the breath is pure and clean, then the drop that emerges, in which this breath is encompassed, is likewise clear and clean. And then the offspring is accordingly fair and healthy. But if there is turbidity within the breath, the drop becomes turbid as well. This is the aspect of “Man is like <i>hevel</i> (a breath)” (Psalms 144:4), since the formation of the offspring is in accordance with the breath; and it is the aspect of “The children of men are but <i>hevel”</i> (ibid. 62:10), since the breath determines whether the offspring will be fair and healthy, as explained above. And this is the aspect of “beauty is hevel,” since the beauty is commensurate with the hevel (breath). Thus it is that vain beauty stems from suspended breathing. We find, therefore, that someone who desires the beauty of women acquires the aspect of suspended breathing. He is then the opposite of wealthy, since [wealth] is the aspect of extended breathing.",

                    "<b>8.</b> This is the aspect of what the Sages, of blessed memory, explained concerning this verse “their leaves <i>litruphah”</i>— <i>l’hatir peh</i> of the mute and <i>l’hatir peh</i> of the barren (Sanhedrin 100a). Rousing people from their sleep by telling stories—which is the aspect of “their leaves for healing,” as explained above—this is what leads to the aspect of unbinding the mouth of the mute. Earlier, when they were in the aspect of sleep, they did not hear the sage’s rousing and their ears did not hear his words. “Fortunate is the one who speaks to ears that hear” (Zohar II, 186b), but they were like the deaf. They did not hear at all, and because of this they were unable to speak, since “the term ‘deaf,’ unless modified, refers to someone who neither hears nor speaks” (Terumot 1:2)—i.e., because he cannot hear, he cannot speak. But now that the sage rouses them and they hear his words, they can speak. This is the aspect of unbinding the mouth of the mute &lt;by means of the aspect of “their leaves,” as explained above&gt;. {“Open your mouth for the mute, for the rights of all the <b><i>bnei chalof</i></b> (orphans)” (Proverbs 31:8) .}",
                    "This is likewise the aspect of “Open your mouth for the mute,” which in turn brings about the aspect of unbinding the mouth of the barren. These words, which had been repressed inside them for so long because they were deaf and mute, now emerge, and they do so with great strength, in the aspect of “Strong warriors, <i>O’Sei</i> (makers of) His word” (Psalms 103:20). And this strength reaches the reproductive organs, the aspect of “my strength and the first fruit of my vigor” (Genesis 49:3). That is, the generation’s God-trusting people, who are the aspect of the reproductive organs, receive this strength, in the aspect of “But they who put their hope in God will renew their strength” (Isaiah 40:31). This is why the kidneys are called “trusters,” since the kidneys are reproductive organs.",
                    "Thus, when the generation’s God-trusting people receive the strength in these words, they receive it by right and justly; each one receives this strength commensurate with his trust. This is the aspect of “Open your mouth for the mute, for the rights of all the <i>bnei chalof</i>.” &lt; <i>Bnei ChaLoF</i> are the generation’s God-trusting people,&gt; the aspect of “But they who put their hope in God <i>yaChLiFu</i> (will renew) their strength.” &lt;That is,&gt; by means of “Open your mouth…,” the strength in the words reaches the reproductive organs, the God-trusting people, who receive it by right and justly, as explained above.",
                    "It is therefore necessary to ensure that the speech organs are near and close to the reproductive organs, so that they can receive the strength in the words, as explained above. They should not be in the aspect of “You are close to their lips, but far from their kidneys” (Jeremiah 12:2). This is why the organs of speech and reproduction are very similar: as these are filled with veins and nerves, so are those. They are a single aspect, since procreation comes about by means of the &lt;organs&gt; of speech, as explained above. This is the aspect of “their leaves for healing”— unbinding the mouth of the mute and unbinding the mouth of the barren, since the one is dependent upon the other, as explained above.",
                    "This is the aspect of union through kissing and sexual union. Union through kissing precedes sexual union, as is brought in the sacred writings. The strength in the words, the aspect of unbinding the mouth of the mute, which is the aspect of union through kissing, brings to sexual union, the aspect of unbinding the mouth of the barren, as explained above.",
                    "It is likewise the aspect of breaking an earthen dish when formalizing an engagement. We break it to show that now that this bond has been made, its objective is procreation; that it is in the aspect of trust, the aspect of kidneys, which are reproductive organs, as explained above. This is the aspect of “Her husband’s heart trusts in her” (Proverbs 31:11), as a result of which the aspect of trust of the Other Side is nullified and broken.",
                    "This is why we break an earthen dish, in the aspect of “and you put your trust in fraud and corruption… It is shattered as [one shatters] a potter’s jug… so that no earthen shard is left in its breakage…” (Isaiah 30:12, 14). The trust of holiness created by the engagement, as explained above, is the opposite of the trust of the Other Side, which is in the aspect of breaking an earthen dish, as explained above. In addition, we hint to [the couple] that if they fail to conduct themselves in holiness and betray the aspect of trust/procreation, God forbid, then they will be in the aspect of breaking an earthen dish, which is caused by “the trust of the unfaithful” (Proverbs 25:19), as explained above.",
                    "This is “Trust not an <i>aluph</i> (confidant); guard the openings of your mouth from she who lies in your bosom” (Micah 7:5). That is, it is not possible for trust, namely the reproductive organs, to be close to the words, which is the aspect of <i>“ALuPh”</i>—an acronym of <i>L’hatir Peh Ilmim</i> (unbinding the mouth of the mute). This is the meaning of “from she who lies in your bosom”—i.e., that this should lead to procreation; “from she who lies in your bosom” is the aspect of “let her lie in your bosom” (1 Kings 1:2). The only way that this is possible is by “guard[ing] the openings of your mouth,” as explained above.",
                    "And this is “Let him put his mouth to the dust; there may yet be hope” (Lamentations 3:29). “Dust” is the aspect of an absence of speech, as it is written (Isaiah 29:4), “and your speech will be lower than the dust.” That is, a person must instill the aspect of speech &lt;in the one who is the aspect of “dust,” since he is in the aspect of a mute, in order&gt; to unbind the mouth of the mute, as explained above. Through this, the strength of the words reaches those who hope in God, who are the reproductive organs, as explained above. This is &lt;“Let him put his mouth to the dust,” as explained,&gt; “there may yet be hope”—in order that the words might reach those who hope in God. And this is “your descendants will be like the dust of the earth” (Genesis 28:14), since procreation is dependent on the aforementioned aspect of “Let him put his mouth to the dust.”",
                    "<b>{“Many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake, some to eternal life, and some to disgrace and eternal shame”</b> (Daniel 12:2)<b>.}</b> This is likewise the aspect of “Many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake”—i.e., they wake them and rouse them from their sleep, as explained above. This is “who sleep in the dust of the ground”—from the aspect of an absence of speech, as explained above.",
                    "And this is “some to eternal life.” &lt;That is, those who are worthy of receiving the ability to speak will have “eternal life”&gt;—i.e., the aspect of speech, as it is written (Genesis 2:7), “man thus became a living soul,” which Onkelos renders as: “a speaking spirit.” This is the aspect of unbinding the mouth of the mute.",
                    "“And some to disgrace”—i.e., the aspect of “Disgrace has broken my heart” (Psalms 69:21). [This is] the aspect of forgetfulness, breaking the heart, which is the aspect of the breaking of the Tablets, as in, “the tablet of your heart.” And the breaking of the Tablets brings to forgetfulness, as the Sages, of blessed memory, said: Had the First Tablets not been shattered, there would be no forgetfulness (Eruvin 54a). In other words, those who are not worthy of receiving, who are the aspect of the skin of a non-kosher animal, forget [what they heard], as explained above."

One has to break the wrath and mitigate it.

As long as this aspect of <i>ruach</i> (spirit) has yet to enter the hands, it is still prior to existence. This is because existence is primarily in the aspect of the hands, which are the instruments-of-doing. It is mainly there that the spirit is revealed, as in “Into Your hand I entrust my spirit” (Psalms 31:6) ; and as in “That in His hand is the soul of every living thing and the spirit of all human flesh” (Job 12:10) .",

In other words, the hands, in which the two spirits are revealed, have yet to unfold and separate. This is because the potential and actual [states] are still bound together and there is no difference whatsoever between them. There is thus no distinction between right and left. It is as yet the aspect of pre-Creation—i.e., prior to actualizing potential—at which point they are bound together, as explained above.",

For example, if one shows a child an object that delights him and then immediately grabs it and hides it from him, [the child] will go on chasing after that person, begging for the object and desiring it very much.

The more a thing is withheld and concealed from a person, the more he desires it and it delights him. Herein lies the root of lust and the overpowering desire to sin, God forbid; may the Compassionate One save us. Because man is largely barred from sin—for we are ordered, warned and commanded not to transgress, and so it is substantially withheld from us—there is therefore an overpowering desire for it; this being the aspect of “bread eaten in secret is a delight.”",

The extent of the desire has to be in proportion to the magnitude of the desired objective. Therefore, when the desired objective is very great, one’s desire has to be very great.

A sage advised him to not be concerned about it; to let the idolater stand there, and even so to go about his business and pray. By doing so, it would leave him. This, however, is only a temporary solution; for as long as he still has not sanctified his body. For the main thing is to sanctify and purify himself.

Hence he corresponds to a child, as if he were born today. And then it is like ink written on fresh paper—well etched and pictured there, without any smudging.

And as a result of this silence, the thoughts ascend, for the evil thoughts of heresy are nullified, as explained above. This is the aspect of “Be silent!

                    "For discord is the aspect of thunder, as is brought elsewhere. It is also brought that thunder is produced by the emergence of fiery hot vapors. The clouds draw these hot vapors in large quantities, and when they have drawn more than they can contain, the cloud bursts and this produces thunder.",
                    "This is the aforementioned aspect of discord. Since the Torah is an aspect of fire, as it is written (Jeremiah 23:29), “Is not My word like fire…,” it is confined within his heart like a burning fire, because he does not reveal it. As a result, it bursts forth and emerges in the aspect of thunder, which is the aspect of dispute, as explained above.",
                    "This is also the aspect of “The conversation of Torah scholars requires study” (Avodah Zarah 19b)—i.e., all the Torah scholars’ conversations in which they talk about and quarrel with one another require study. This is because in the main, discord is the result of a lack of study, for he does not teach his Torah to others, rather his good remains within, as explained above. Thus it is that the discord of the tzaddikim stems from the Torah, as explained above.",
                    "However, there is the discord of the wicked, which in no way stems from the Torah. This is David’s remonstration to God (Psalms 119:85), “Deliberate sinners have dug <i>ShiChot</i> (pits) for me, not in keeping with Your Torah”—they <i>meSiChin</i> (talk about) and quarrel with me, not at all based on the Torah. Thus, this is what David pleaded, “May only goodness and lovingkindness pursue me”—that whenever he would be the victim of persecution and discord, the discord should be only from there, from the aspect of “goodness and lovingkindness,” as explained above."

But afterwards, when he emerges from danger—this being thanksgiving/ <i>halakhah</i>—the truth shines, as in “Ascribe truth to Yaakov, kindness to Avraham” (Micah 7:20). “Kindness to Avraham,” i.e., <i>halakhot,</i> causes the truth to shine and perfects speech.

Just as [the subject] there is charity, here, too, it is charity (Zohar, Introduction, p.13b). By giving charity he is called “human,” because charity, from which speech is derived, is the definition of a human being.

Through prayer we nullify God’s decrees, and then Israel is called “ <i>El</i>.” This causes speech to shine, as in “and because of Your might they will speak” (Psalms 145:11).

Women took nine portions and the entire world took one (as our Sages, of blessed memory, taught; Kiddushin 49b). As long as there are no marriage bonds, speech lacks perfection.

The Jewish people are a holy nation. The great measure of their innate spirituality and their great refinement make it impossible for them to bear the burden of sin for even a single day.

He has to conceal himself there, in the concept of gestation. For this path has not yet been revealed in the world. He has only just entered there in order to reveal it. And so this is the concept of pregnancy, as in “In the path of wisdom <i>horaysikha</i> (I instruct you)” (Proverbs 4:11)—alluding to <i>heirayon</i> (pregnancy). He has to wait and hold back there, warming himself there like a fetus in the mother’s womb, until the time comes for him to come out into the air of the world, to reveal this path in the world. Thus when he comes out before his time, it is the concept of a miscarried fetus. This flaw is produced by quarreling.",

Rather, they lose the miscarried fetuses—i.e., the people themselves who became famous and came out into the world before their time. This is similar to when they shove a pregnant woman and she miscarries. There are two possibilities. Sometimes she loses only the fetuses; through their emerging prematurely she miscarries them. Other times the pregnant woman is herself harmed by this and she passes away.",
                    "The same applies to the aforementioned concepts. Sometimes, having gained prominence too soon and so become the concept of miscarried fetuses, the people themselves are lost. However, the path of wisdom itself has not yet departed, only the miscarried fetuses. Thus others can become implanted there—i.e., the aforementioned concept of <i>heirayon—</i> as in the example of the pregnant woman.",

                    "And the punishment is commensurate with the flaw. As is explained in the Torah, “if there is no fatal injury” to the woman, “he shall surely be punished” with money—i.e., poverty, as when the flaw is not that great. “But if there is a fatal injury” to the woman, so that they caused the path itself to be lost, in that case “you must award a life for a life”—i.e., death, as mentioned above.

This is as Rashi comments on the verse <i>Bereishit:</i> The reason Scripture begins with “In the beginning” (Genesis 1:1) is to prevent them from saying, “You are robbers….” Scripture therefore began with “In the beginning,” [to make known] that God created everything, and by His wish He gave it to them, and by His wish….

Jews come there, conquer the place and sanctify it, making it a Jewish place. This, too, is the concept of the Land of Israel, and they could have said, “You are robbers. You conquered this place which is not yours.” However, through “the power of His acts,” the concept of Ten Utterances, we are permitted to conquer the entire world and sanctify it with the sanctity of Israel, because God created it and of His own will gave it to us.",

They are all full of troubles, worries, misery, sadness and aggravation—always! Each one with his particular woes. And so, of all the rich and the privileged there is not a one for whom everything is always in order and as he would have it. They are all as one constantly full of suffering and worry. This is clear and known to anyone who is somewhat familiar with them and their ways.",
                    "We spoke of this a number of times and would see it all with our eyes. Even someone who seems to have <i>Olam HaZeh</i> completely, with all its pleasures—wealth, possessions, esteem, great riches, enormous palaces, amazing vessels and jewelry, and the resources of kings—if they would look at him closely, [they would see that] he, too, is always full of much frustration and grief in many different ways and matters. This is empirically obvious, and there is no need to explain it to anyone who has a brain in his head and honestly observes them a bit. It is as King Shlomo, of blessed memory, said: “Also all his days [bring] frustration and grief…” (Ecclesiastes 2:23). And it is written: “But a man is born to toil… he is short-lived and sated with anxiety” (Job 5:7 and 14:1).",
                    "This includes every human being in the world, from the smallest to the greatest, because all are born to toil and so are full of anxiety and suffering. Nor is there any advice or ploy through which to be spared from this toil and sadness, except by fleeing to God and being occupied with Torah.",
                    "This is as the Midrash brings: “But a man is born to toil”—fortunate is he whose toil is in Torah (Bereishit Rabbah 13:7). In other words, since every person is born to toil and it cannot possibly be avoided, even if he owns all the riches in the world he will certainly experience much toil, suffering and worries. And so, “a wise man has his eyes ahead of him” (Ecclesiastes 2:14). He turns the toil into the toil of Torah, which is the reason he was born—to toil in Torah. Then, fortunate is he, because he is spared the toil of this world and merits life in the World to Come."

                    "One of our group told me that, as was his way, he was discussing serving God with Rebbe Nachman, of blessed memory. The Rebbe understood that he was concentrating on some <i>kavanot</i> (Kabbalistic meditations) while praying. The Rebbe was very firm with him and told him not to continue the practice. He was not to pray with Kabbalistic meditations, but rather to concentrate on the straightforward meaning of the words. {Although it was at Rebbe Nachman’s behest that this individual studied the writings of the Ari, of blessed memory, the Rebbe did not want him to pray with <i>kavanot</i> at all.}",
                    "Rebbe Nachman, of blessed memory, also said to him that when one who is not fit to pray with <i>kavanot</i> does so, it is like sorcery. Of the black arts it is said: “you shall not learn to do” (Deuteronomy 18:9). Our Sages, of blessed memory, expounded: “You shall not learn [in order] to do,” but you may learn [in order] to understand and rule (Shabbat 75a). The same applies to the Kabbalistic meditations, <i>l’ havdil</i>. The only reason to learn them is to understand and issue rulings, but not to use them—i.e., to concentrate on them while praying if one is not fit to do so.",
                    "The Rebbe also said: The essence of prayer is attachment to God. It would thus be better to pray in one’s native tongue. When a person prays in his native tongue, the heart is very close and bound to the words of prayer, and he can better attach himself to God. However, the men of the Great Assembly have already established the prayer liturgy for us {because not everyone is able to format the prayer liturgy on his own, as is brought}. We are therefore obligated to pray in the Holy Tongue, as they formatted the liturgy for us. Yet the main thing is to concentrate on the straightforward meaning of the words. For this is the essence of prayer: We pray to God for each and every thing, and through this we draw closer to God and become attached to Him.",
                    "Now, whoever always converses in the Holy Tongue, such as a Jerusalemite, is not required to think about the meaning of the words. Instead, he should pay attention to what he is saying, and this is the focus of his concentration while praying.",
                    "And for the spiritually advanced true tzaddikim, all the <i>kavanot</i> of the Ari, of blessed memory, etc., are the meaning of the words. That is, the way they mean the words includes all the Kabbalistic meditations."

It is possible that already in a previous incarnation he prayed the rest of the service with proper concentration, so that now, in this incarnation, all he has to pray with proper concentration is this section until <i>Barukh Sh’amar</i> . Consequently, he should invest all his energy into this modest amount, praying with proper concentration until <i>Barukh Sh’amar</i>. Then, afterwards, when he reaches <i>Barukh Sh’amar,</i> he should think that he may have to rectify from <i>Barukh Sh’amar</i> to <i>Va’yevarekh David</i> and so also recite that section with proper concentration, and so on.",
