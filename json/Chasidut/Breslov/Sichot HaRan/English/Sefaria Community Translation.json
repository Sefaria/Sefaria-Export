But the general idea is that every one of these new concepts that the wise ones devise, in holiness - simple explanations, or drawn out teachings, etc., for example - or, not to compare the two, in matters of their wisdom, everything floats down to them and is sent to them, into their minds, from above - to everyone from the place appropriate for him, as said above.]"

And this was like it`aruta diltata [arousal from below], to draw down perceptions of Godliness that he clothed in that story. And so it was with each and every story. ",
            "And so it was with several Torot he revealed that were not at a fixed assembly time. ",
            "And in all this we always saw the wonders of Hashem and the greatness of the level of the Tzaddik, that all the utterances in the world were for him Torah and revelation of Godliness. But much more did we see this with this awesome story of the Seven Beggars which is wonderful awesome high revelations without bound. As an understanding person will understand by himself if he puts his heart to them with an eye of truth to understand and perceive holy wonders of the boastings of each one mentioned there each day, ",
            "and in particular the greatness of the holiness of the boasting of the seven beggars themselves who boast each day:  that the blind one boasted that he doesn’t look at the world at all, therefore he is actually blind to this world; and likewise the deaf one who doesn’t hear any sound of this world etc., therefore he is deaf etc. etc. And likewise with each speech of this story which are all wonderful revelations even according to meager minds even though we do not understand them at all. ",
            "And all this revelation, it is all through stories of worldly matters; through them it came about that he had pity on us in such extraordinary compassion and revealed to us all this, in order to benefit us and our children forever. ",
            "He said regarding the tales that he told, that it would be better to not reveal of them what any of the clues hint to, for when the thing is hidden, more can be accomplished with it that is needed. ",
            "But he was forced occasionally to just reveal some hint, in order they should know there are hidden things in them."
