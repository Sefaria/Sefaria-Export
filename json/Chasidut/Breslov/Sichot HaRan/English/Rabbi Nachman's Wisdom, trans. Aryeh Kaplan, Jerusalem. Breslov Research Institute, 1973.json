This lesson was said on <i>Shabbat Chanukah</i>, shortly after the passing of the great Rabbi Gedaliah of Linitz.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">207</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This lesson was said on <i>Shabbat Chanukah</i>, 2 Tevet 5564 (December 17, 1803) (<i>Parparaot LeChokhmah</i> ad loc.; <i>Tzaddik</i> #185). Rabbi Gedaliah was a student of Rabbi Yehudah Leib, the Maggid of Polonnoye, who in turn was a major disciple of the Baal Shem Tov. He was among those who sided with the Rebbe in his dispute with Rabbi Leib, the Shpola Zeide (<i>Tzaddik</i> #19). Rebbe Nachman credits Rabbi Gedaliah with the creation of <i>Shevachey HaBaal Shem Tov</i> (\"Praise of the Baal Shem Tov\") (<i>Avenehah Barzel</i>, p. 29, #30). The author of <i>Shevachey HaBaal Shem Tov</i>, Rabbi Dov Ber ben Shmuel, the <i>shochet</i> of Linitz, in his introduction, also credits most of the stories to “Rabbi Gedaliah, as told to him by Rabbi Shmerl of Varhavka.” A number of sources, such as Rabbi David HaLachmi's <i>Chakhamey Yisrael</i> (Tel Aviv, 1957) and <i>Hilulah Rabbah</i> (published with <i>Mazkeret Shem HaGedolim</i>), erroneously give the date of Rabbi Gedaliah's death as 5545 or 5548. However, we find that the Rebbe and Reb Noson visited him as late as 5563 (<i>Yemey Moharnat</i> #2; <i>Avenehah Barzel</i>, p. 15, #12).</i> In this lesson, the Rebbe is actually eulogizing Rabbi Gedaliah.

When a child is conceived, his conception depends on the food previously eaten by his parents.",

This is what could be gathered from it:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">351</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From the context, it appears that this lesson was delivered on a Shabbat when <i>VaYeshev</i> was read during the week of Chanukah. This is a rather rare occurrence, and happened only five times during the Rebbe's career – in 5554/1793, 5561/1800, 5564/1803, 5567/1806 and 5568/1808. In the latter three years, Chanukah contained two Shabbats, the first being <i>VaYeshev</i> and the second, <i>Miketz</i>. In 5564 and 5567, respectively, Lessons #14 and #30 in <i>Likutey Moharan</i> I were delivered – in both cases on the second Shabbat, namely that of <i>Miketz</i> (see end of Lesson #30 where <i>Miketz</i> is mentioned). Lesson #14 was also delivered on the Shabbat of <i>Miketz</i>, as discussed earlier in note 316. (Additional evidence that the second Shabbat was always kept can be derived from <i>Alim LeTerufah</i> #32, where we find that Reb Noson also kept the second Shabbat in 5591/1830, another year which had two Shabbats fall during Chanukah.) The year 5568 found the Rebbe in Lemberg during Chanukah, and there is no record of his having given any lesson at all. In the years 5554 and 5561, however, <i>VaYeshev</i> was the <i>only</i> Shabbat to fall during Chanukah. Therefore, this lesson was most probably said in one of these years, either in Medvedevka or Zlatipolia. This might explain why this lesson was discovered only after the Rebbe's passing, and why Reb Noson never edited it under his supervision.</i> It is written, “Jacob dwelt in the land of his father’s sojournings, in the Land of Canaan.

            "These are among the many thoughts which the Rebbe shared with us regarding the above. All this talk about the good old days is the work of the Evil One. He wants people to speak like this to make them suffer and worry all the more about their livelihoods. He would like to make them feel that there is no hope at all now, Heaven forbid.",
            "This is all false. God continuously sustains the world and people rise and fall financially in every generation. If you look carefully at any period, you will find people who were poor, with menial jobs, who became wealthy. Yet they too claim that times are not as good as before – because they always want more. Now that they have tasted wealth, they are no longer satisfied and want more all the time. They now live ostentatiously and cannot meet their expenses, so they complain that times are not as good as before. But we ourselves recall that not too many years ago, most of these complainers were poor or working as domestics or the like.",
            "Whether or not this is the fact, what use is it always to cry that the past was better? The wise King Solomon refuted this idea long ago when he said, “Do not say that the former times were better than these, for it is not out of wisdom that you ask this” <small>(Ecclesiastes 7:10)</small>.",
            "<i>Rashi</i> may interpret this verse to teach us that everything depends on the merit of each generation. Still, “The Torah has many faces” <small>(<i>Bamidbar Rabbah</i> 13:15)</small>, and, “The scripture does not depart from its simple meaning” <small>(<i>Shabbat</i> 63a; <i>Yebamot</i> 24a)</small>. King Solomon was the wisest of all men and spoke with Divine inspiration. He said that it is great foolishness to say, “The former times were better than these.” In every generation, there have been people who say this. But if you look closely into the matter, you will see that the world is constantly becoming more prosperous. People constantly live better and spend more than in the past.",
            "What difference does it really make? If the world were really to be poorer now than before, that is all the more reason to flee to God and involve yourself in Torah and devotion. If there is suffering and trouble in the world, the only place to escape is to God and His Torah. It is written, “For man is born to struggle” <small>(Job 5:7)</small>.

            "The person who says that “the first days are better than these” and worries, and is constantly anxious about his finances, accomplishes nothing. His attitude causes him to struggle more and more to earn a living and waste his days in worry and vexation. This foolishness keeps him from Torah and prayer, and regarding his end, it is written, “He takes away nothing for his effort” <small>(Ecclesiastes 5:14)</small>. It is also written, “For in vanity he comes, and in darkness he leaves” <small>(ibid., 6:4)</small>.",
            "If you have eyes to see and a heart to understand, you will perceive that the past had as much suffering and troubles as the present. Look in books written hundreds of years ago and you will find that their authors also suffered from poverty and endured the most difficult struggles just to earn a livelihood. This did not deter them and they still wrote many holy books. It is written, “What was, that is what will be … there is nothing new under the sun” <small>(ibid., 1:9)</small>.",

How many years ago did the Book of Job say, “Man is born to struggle – of few days and full of trouble” <small>(Job 14:1)</small>? The scriptures wrote about this long ago.",

You can flee from them and trust in God, abandoning the struggles of this bitter world and involving yourself in the work of Torah. God will certainly sustain you. Does He not sustain the entire world, now as always? And now God directs the world better than ever before.",

It is written, “In pain you shall eat” <small>(Genesis 3:17)</small>, and, “By the sweat of your brow you shall eat bread” <small>(ibid., 3:19)</small>. This was decreed since Adam’s sin and there is no place to escape. These worries and pains destroy a man’s life; the only shelter is God and His Torah.",

After telling us the struggles we must endure – “bread with salt you shall eat” – how can the Mishnah state, “'You shall be happy' – in this world\"? Many writers attempt to resolve this by way of homily, but their explanations remain strained. In fact, there really is no question. If you have eyes to see and a heart that truly understands the world, you know this. If you have absorbed the wisdom contained in the Rebbe’s awesome teachings, you know the truth. The Mishnah means exactly what it says.",

Thus, our Sages teach, “The more possessions, the more worry” <small>(ibid., 2:7)</small>. The poor may not realize this. They may think that they would no longer have problems if they were wealthy. But they are sadly mistaken, as we can see with our own eyes. The truth is as our Sages have taught it. Whether you are rich or poor, you cannot avoid worries. The world is filled with pain and suffering and there is no avenue of escape.",

Everything you manage to grasp will be diluted with suffering. Look with truth and you will see this yourself.",

Firmly resolve to follow the dictum of the Mishnah, “Bread with salt you shall eat … a life of privation shall you live.” Accept upon yourself a life of deprivation and hardship in order to involve yourself in the Torah – “in the Torah you shall toil.”",

            "Imagine a world filled with good and riches. Imagine a world in which there was no pain or suffering or worries. It would still be empty and devoid of all purpose. For time passes like the blink of an eye, and life is over. It is written, “Our days are like a passing shadow” <small>(Psalms 144:4)</small>. Our Sages comment that life is not even permanent, like the shadow of a palm tree <small>(cf. <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 96:3; <i>Kohelet Rabbah</i> 1:3)</small>.

            "If even a perfect world would itself be purposeless, what shall we say about the world in which we live? It is filled with pain, sorrow and suffering without end. Every man’s life is filled with worries about finances and concerns, troubles and problems, from the greatest to the smallest, from the richest of the rich to the poorest of the poor. Every man is trapped by his limitations. The greatest emperors and kings are filled with worries and fears without measure, as is understood by those who know about their lives.",

You will have chosen to live such a life, eating bread with salt, drinking water by measure, sleeping on the ground and living a life of privation. You must be willing to accept such a life, for there are times when even bread with salt and water by measure will not be abundant. But accept all this in order to immerse yourself in the Torah – “in the Torah you shall toil.” If you do this, you will certainly be “happy and it shall be good for you … happy in this world.” You will have accepted any suffering from this world and will be worthy of true life.",
