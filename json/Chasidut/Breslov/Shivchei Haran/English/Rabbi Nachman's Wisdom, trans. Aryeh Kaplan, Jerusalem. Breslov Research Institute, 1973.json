            "I, Reb Noson, son of Rabbi Naftali Hertz of Nemirov, fully realize that an account of our awesome holy Rebbe’s life should be written.<br><br>I have therefore recorded a small portion of his saintly ways, from his earliest perception until his departure from this world in peace. I myself heard some of these accounts from the Rebbe’s holy lips. Others were gleaned from those who knew him during his lifetime. Much of what is written here was seen with our own eyes.",
            "The Rebbe had much opposition, and I know full well that many will not believe these accounts. I will not let this deter me. Many people yearn for these words and have urged me to publish this volume.",
            "Deep inside, my thoughts assure me and my innards tell me that these words should be published for the sake of those who would follow them. It does not matter who initiated them — they are obviously pure and holy ways. How can I withhold this volume from those who sincerely thirst for it?",
            "The truth is its own witness. Look at the Rebbe’s writings with an unprejudiced eye, and you yourself will see that he revealed concepts that cannot be perceived with the unaided human intellect. These teachings could only be attained from the highest source, through holiness and purity.",
            "It is impossible to go into further detail. Anything more would only be superfluous. As people say, “It is either unnecessary, or else it is futile.”",
            "At first, my heart beat with uncertainty and I did not know which path to follow. Then I resolved that I would write freely, no matter what the consequences, “that future generations might know … and arise and tell it to their children” <small>(Psalms 78:6)</small>. They will see this book and walk in the footsteps marked along these paths.",
            "It is self-evident that these ways are precious and holy. Every man can follow them and bring himself close to God; for they apply to everyone, great and small alike.",
            "No matter how low you are, you can follow the paths charted here. Have pity on your soul and consider your true purpose, and you will be worthy of eternal life, soaring like the Children of the Highest Abode.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bnei Aliyah</i>. Cf. <i>Sukkah</i> 45b; <i>Sanhedrin</i> 97b.</i> Just be firm in your conviction, like a firmly-driven stake that cannot be moved, never straying from the path mapped out in this book.",
            "What we have recorded here is less than a drop in the ocean of the Rebbe’s great holiness and outstanding qualities. They tower high above, in a place where human intellect cannot reach.",
            "We also have no desire to retell any of the Rebbe’s miracles and wonders. Our only concern is to present ideas that can bring others to fear of God. Let them read this and learn a way.",

They were married four years later, in Cheshvan 5565/1804 (<i>Tzaddik</i> <i>#</i>114, #117).</i> God willed that the Rabbi of Volochisk would then settle in the Holy Land, taking along his son, the Rebbe’s son-in-law, to study with him.

                "No matter how high he stood, the Rebbe was never satisfied with his accomplishments. He had practiced honestly and earnestly every type of devotion mentioned above, fasting and praying and forcing himself to do things to overcome his desires and emotions. He had already withstood countless temptations and spent days and years secluding himself with God to express his thoughts in his own words.",
                "Constantly striving in this manner, he merited to an extremely high and lofty level of the utmost sanctity and the utmost selflessness, with a degree of closeness to God on the level of the greatest denizens on high. The Rebbe attained all this while he was literally in his childhood. He neither rested by day nor slept or was silent by night. Never keeping still, he toiled and labored day in and day out, until literally in his youth he achieved lofty, awesome sanctity and profound perception on the level of the greatest denizens on high.",
                "But even after achieving all this, the Rebbe was not satisfied and did not allow himself to stagnate. Every hour and every day, he would desire, long and yearn for God as if he had not yet begun to serve Him at all. Even after the Rebbe returned from the Holy Land – where he attained a perception so high that it was beyond measure – until the day he departed from the world in peace, he always had this longing and yearning for God. He may have stood on the loftiest heights, but in his mind he had not yet begun the climb.",
                "It would consume many volumes to tell even the small amount we were worthy of understanding from what we heard from his holy lips and saw with our own eyes. For this was the Rebbe’s way. He would constantly thirst for God, genuinely humbling and pitying himself as if he had never inhaled the perfume of true devotion and had not yet achieved even the level of a beginner.",
                "To understand this, you must imagine a person who had committed every possible sin time and time again. Imagine now that such a person was aroused to true repentance. Try to depict the way he would look at himself. He would certainly have great humility and self-pity, and be bitter and brokenhearted because of his past deeds. All his self-pity and brokenheartedness would not come to a thousandth, or even a millionth, of the great humility, self-pity and brokenheartedness that the Rebbe experienced each time before he attained a new degree of perception.",
                "The Rebbe was a man who never rested or stood still. Even as an adult, when he had already attained an awesome perception of the Godly, he was not satisfied and continued to aspire for more. He accepted upon himself unparalleled suffering and abounded with prayers and petitions urging God to help him. He continued with a powerful, intense yearning until he would finally attain an even higher level of perception.",
                "When he achieved a new level, he would be happy for a brief time. Occasionally, we were worthy of hearing new insights from his mouth and he would experience some joy. But then he would immediately begin anew. All his previous efforts would be forgotten as if he had not yet even taken the first step. He would begin afresh, like one taking his first steps into the realm of holiness.",
                "Often we heard the Rebbe say with longing and yearning, “How is one worthy of being a Jew?” <small>(see “<i>His Wisdom</i>” #159)</small>. He would mean these words sincerely, for he truly felt that he had not yet really taken the first step. This occurred numerous times.",
                "Although he reached awesomely high levels, he would constantly seek a higher level, soaring ever higher. Still, he was never satisfied with himself. As soon as he reached a new level, he would again begin anew with a broken heart and deep humility, until he was able to attain a still higher step. This was always the Rebbe’s way, even at the end.",

See \"<i>His Wisdom</i>\" #153; <i>Yemey Moharnat</i> #51; <i>Tzaddik</i> #112.</i> He would even say this shortly after he had revealed words of enduring truth <small>(cf. <i>Pesachim</i> 119a; <i>Bava Batra</i> 91b)</small>. His wisdom shone forth and still he insisted that he was totally ignorant. In this respect, the Rebbe was most unique.",

They have a set level to which they aspire, and when they reach it, they are satisfied. They are like servants of a king who aspire to attain a particular rank of office through their efforts.",
                "The Rebbe then said, “If I knew that I was now standing on the same level as last year, I would totally reject myself.” He would consider remaining at last year’s level the greatest detriment, for he constantly aspired to reach a higher level.",
                "There is much to say here, but it cannot all be put into writing. Those who were worthy to see it with their own eyes and hear it with their own ears might be able to understand this to a small degree. They might perceive how the Rebbe never stood still at any level, but always yearned for the next step until he was worthy. This was always true of him.",

Even though a person may attain the goal of realizing his ignorance, it may only be in one area of knowledge. He must then begin to work on a higher plane, aspiring to realize his \"not knowing\" at this higher level. And no matter how high one reaches, there is still the next step.",

They tortured him in the cruelest ways possible, but despite his great agony, he refused to tell them anything. He withstood the test without yielding his secret. Seeing that their tortures were to no avail, his tormentors assumed that they were mistaken and that he actually had no secret. They let him go, and he passed through their land to deliver his message to the other king.",

Some said that the first messenger was most deserving, for he had acted cleverly enough to hide his secret completely. Others gave the most credit to the second messenger, for though he was discovered, he was smart enough to escape.",

Certainly, he had also wanted to hide his purpose, but was not successful. After being captured, he underwent every possible torture and torment. Had he revealed even one secret, he would have received the greatest honors [from his persecutors]. Nevertheless, he withstood the test, revealing nothing. Therefore, his reward is above all the rest.",
