However at that point he had a limited mind, and it appeared to him that this was impossible that he would leave his meals according to what he was used to eating in the morning and in the evening etc. Therefore he decided within himself that he wouldn't chew what he ate, rather he would swallow it as is in order that he wouldn't experience any flavor in his eating. And when he did this it caused him swelling in his throat.",

                "And this behavior I heard that it is a great thing, from a an extremely righteous man, that he himself behaved like this, that he swallowed his food without chewing. However he (Rebbe Nachman) acted like this when he was (only) six years old."
