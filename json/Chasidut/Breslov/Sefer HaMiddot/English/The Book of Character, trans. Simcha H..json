        "Introduction": [
            "This book elucidates all the traits and conduct arranged according to the aleph-bet/alphabet. It is divided into two sections which are known to us by the names \"Aleph-Bet of Old\" and \"Aleph-Bet of New.\" The first part is a wondrous collection, collected by our pure and holy master in his childhood, all that his huge intellect perceived by understanding one matter from another; and he gathered from all the holy books, everything that he found in them pertaining to morals, conduct, and upright behavior -- which he recorded to have by him for memory's sake. Whatever he found elucidated in the words of Our Sages of blessed memory, whether it be a virtue of a good trait, or the opposite -- derision of a bad trait -- everything in its entirety he would gather little by little and copy them by him in the order of the Aleph Bet by each and every trait, so that he should have them for remembrance, to see with his eyes the significance of each and every trait and its converse, in order to go in the ways of the good and guard the ways of the tzaddikim (based on Prov. 2:20). Moreover, his powerful intellect perceived many precious and wondrous matters which are not explicitly elucidated in the words of Our Sages OB”M; just by the sheer magnitude of his perception he understood one matter from another, and conceived precious novelty in the concepts of the traits from within the Scriptures and from within the words of Our Sages OB”M, which are not explicitly elucidated in their words, just hinted to -- for a genius of his caliber.",
            "Everything he gathered and assembled together in the order of the Aleph Bet, and in the course of time there was found by him a complete compilation on all the traits, and he instructed to copy all of it, and from his mouth he read to me, and I transcribed in the book (according to Jer. 36:18), in order that this book should not desist from our mouths (Josh. 1:8) to speak (/think) it always, in order that we cease from bad traits. For everyone, when he sees arranged the utter derision of a bad trait and the great loss it causes, and the dreadful violation that is realized through it, he will have compassion on his soul, and he will gird his loins to stand up against it, and he will beseech from He to whom mercy is His, to escape with his soul from the abyss, to save him from those bad traits or bad desires or similar ones, and so in the converse regarding good traits.",
            "Furthermore, (Prov. 16:20 -- Rashi) one who gives heart to contemplate his words (to forge his way), will find good -- true advice how to guard one's self from any particular vice, through making sure to be safe from the vice which is close (in the set up of the book, and it thus revealed that they are associated) to, for they are neighbors to each other, and each one guards her friend, as (this is) explained subsequently in the introduction that I heard from his holy mouth. The importance of this book, there is no need to explain, to anyone honest, who desires truth, and longs with cherishing to grasp the ways of propriety, certainly he will find in it a repose for his soul. Fortunate is he who takes hold of it, then it will be good for him in this (world) and in the coming (world), because this entire book is founded on verses of the Bible (Torah, Prophets, Scriptures) and on the words of Our Sages OB”M, all of them cogent to the understanding and straight, for those who have found cognizance (Proverbs 8:9).",
            "The second part is also similar to the first part, in form and arrangement, there is no (marked) difference between them, for it is also an elucidation of the virtue of good traits and the derision of bad traits and the like.",
            "Nevertheless, there is a difference between them, for the items elucidated in the first part, on each and every trait, they are matters which are elucidated in the holy books, explicitly or at least in allusion, so that someone who puts his heart to understand the matter, and who he who wants to study in depth to understand one matter from another, can understand and comprehend from where the Rav extracted this item, from which verse or from which teaching of Our Sages OB”M. For, all the matters elucidated in the Aleph Bet of Old are not remote and not distant (based on Deuteronomy 30:11) from the one studying them -- to come to its property, to understand and comprehend from where the items effuses. Albeit, without the Rav, who illuminated our eyes with these matters, it would not have occurred to the reader to extract these matters from within the holy books. However, after he already opened our eyes to these matters, it is possible for the enlightened (reader), whose heart is complete with the holy books; with the Tanakh (acronym for: Bible, Prophets, Scriptures -- 24 books in all), and with the Aggadot (lore) of Our Sages OB”M, and with the other commentaries, to understand and comprehend the relevant sources.",
            "In contrast to this, the issues elucidated in the second part are lofty and awesome conceptions perceived by the author OB”M, in the days of his greatness. All of these matters transcend human comprehension and are hidden from all eyes. For each and every item there is a very wondrous and awesome taam (reason, taste, cantillation, secret) and it is supported by some verse or teaching of Our Sages OB”M through a very wondrous and fabulous allusion, in his wondrous style, as the reader will see for himself. For there are many items elucidated here without (presentation of) any reason or proof, and within the major compilation of discourses (Likutay Moharan -- A Collection of the Teachings of Rabbi Nachman) it is expatiated there, a complete matter, and a wondrous and awesome exposition on this item at great length, and this you will find in many places. So too one should learn the characteristics of the vague from what is explained, that also in the places that he did not explain the item explicitly, also there his masterful hand attained a complete conception of it (the item presented without elaboration), just, for some ulterior reason he did not want to provide the explanation of the item.",
            "For all these matters, all of them are supernal and from a holy place they traverse, from a very extremely awesome lofty source, and they do not contain a single matter which does not command an awesome and wondrous exposition on what its foundations were cast, the reason for the matter, its characteristics, and a very hidden, deep, and wondrous support from within the Written Torah or Oral Torah. It is not for us to elongate on the paramount praise of these matters, because all who add, detract. For it is not hidden from our eyes the lowliness of our worth -- and the greatness of our master the holy Rav, supernal candelabra, OB”M, and his utter hiddenness and concealment from the eyes of the world (people), this being the case, we must put restraint to our mouth, to be silent and not to mention, not to relate the magnitude of his holy praise, not a matter nor half a matter, and the enlightened will be silent now, Almighty G-d Hashem -- He knows and Israel will know (based on Joshua 22:22). Fortunate is he who waits and reaches the days that have aspiration, at the time when the glory of Israel will rise, truth from the earth will rise (Psalms 85:12), a language of truth will be established forever (Proverbs 12:19), it does not say 'was established' but 'will be established' (Tikunay Zohar 63, pg. 95a). The medication for the matter -- silence, everyone, according to the fathoms of his heart, will understand and comprehend the extent, to where these matters reach.",
            "Still, we come with these words, to arouse the hearts of the readers, to make known to them the nature of the book and its affairs. It is incumbent upon us to make known and reveal to the ears of our peers (the hasidim of Breslov), that our honorable master, the hidden light, of holy and blessed memory, warned strongly to engage in this book, and that it should not cease from our mouths, for it is our life. He himself wrote it in a very small volume and said that his intent was to enable each and every one to carry it with him always, because the traits are the foundation of the entire Torah -- and with this a youth (or someone of that standing) will make his ways meritorious to heed everything that his written in this book, then he will bring success to his ways, and then he will be enlightened. For this is the main task of a person, all the days of his life, to flee from vice and bad desires, and to cling to virtue and upright conduct, that are elucidated in this book.",
            "Fortunate is the person who listens to these words, to fulfill all that is written herein. He will never slip (based on Psalms 112:6) and his righteousness will answer for him in the time to come (based on Beraishis 30:33), when he comes to receive his reward. In the measure that a person meets out -- so (In that same measure) is he met with. Fortunate is one who chooses life -- Hashem will repay his endeavors, if it is to scoffers He will scoff (Proverbs 3:34), he will not gain wealth and his wealth will not endure (Job 15:29), woe to his soul -- for the retribution of his handiwork will be done to him (Isaiah 3:11), it will not be cast to the ground (but on their heads -Job 15:29), one who is good before G-d will escape from it (Ecclesiastes 7:26). How great is the goodness hidden away for him (based on Psalms 31:20), in his joy no stranger will take part (Proverbs 14:10), a laboring soul benefits from its labor (Proverbs 16:26, see also Tractate Sanhedrin 99b -- he works here and his Torah works for him elsewhere). Let us pour out our souls to Hashem to put our portion with Him, to stand at the threshold of His shade, they will have no regrets -- those who put their trust in Him (Psalms end of Chapter 34), no eye has seen (their reward) except for You G-d, what He will do for those who put their hope in Him (Isaiah 64:3).",
            "The words of the transcriber, whom is reduced to sighing and is crushed by the departure of the splendor of our heads, the majesty of our strength, the cherishing of our eyes, what can we say? May G-d (lit. the place -- for G-d is the place of the world and not vice versa) comfort us very soon, the little one, Nussun, son of my master my father our teacher Rav Naftoli Hertz may his candle shine, from the greater Nemerov, son-in-law of the Rav, the genius, the famous, the tzadik, our teacher Rav Dovid Tzvi OB”M Chief of the Court of the Congregation of Muehluv."

It is interesting to note, that I found in a booklet on chirology, Khuchmas Hayad, page10, that on the palm of the left hand are engraved the lines that are incumbent on a person from his mazal and from his previous incarnation, and also hereditary illness in his family, and the right palm conveys if a person rectified his deeds and the happenings of his life, in the past, present, and future).",

Someone who does not alter the truth with his words (t.n. the terminology here is used frequently in the context of not honoring one's commitments), he is able to humble the high and raise up the lowly (t.n. This concept of humbling the high and raising the low is found also in the Story Tales of Ancient Times that Rabbi Nachman revealed, in the 4th story of the King Who Decreed Apostasy -- the King's great success came from a statue that had certain powers which were contingent on the King raising the low and humbling the high, and when the King reneged on the special privilege of the Jew -- which according to what we learn here, would possibly divest the king of the ability to humble the high and raise the low -- shortly afterwards the King had his downfall, and he was not even successful therefore in humbling the Jew).",

                "9. Through truth comes the Redemption (end of the exile. t.n. The commentaries do not bring any citation here, and there are many pertinent sources, see e.g. Likutay Moharan, Torah 66, and in its own right the verse from Proverbs 12 quoted there. Likutay Moharan Torah 112. Another verse that comes to mind is Job 28:3 -- an end he puts to the darkness; darkness being falsehood, also the numerical value of the first letters of the words here is the same as \"emess\" -- truth, thus we see that the \"ketz\" comes through truth)."

For example, the lion's profile is different than that of the sheep: in its strength, and in the structure of its limbs, (and its voice). Also, within the species of the lion itself, there is a distinction between each one. Further, in all the created beings, their differences are all encoded in the image of the letters and their permutations. One who merits understanding the Torah can understand the code of all the differences between the creations, and will also know their unification -- that is, their origins and purposes (/beginnings and endings). For in origin and purpose (/beginning and end), they are united without differentiation.",
                "2. Know, that according to greatness of one's knowledge of the Torah and of the natural world, so the world is placed and committed in his charge. Thus, the lions were subdued under Daniel, for Daniel was a great sage, and no secret was concealed from him (Daniel 4:6), and he knew the nature of the lion. Nature acts according to the wisdom of the Torah, and it is under the power of that wisdom.<br>(Transcriber's note: I heard from our Teacher, Rabbi Natan, may the memory of the tzadik be for blessing, that this paragraph -- 2, is connected to the one above it -- 1, to what is explained there, “One who merits understanding the Torah can understand the code of all the differences between the creations etc.” because this is the aspect of all the natural phenomena of the world, and building on this comes article 2, “Know, that according to the greatness of one's knowledge of the Torah and of the natural world,” i.e. according to how much one merits to understand the permutations of the letters of the Torah, because according to the greatness of his understanding of the letters of the Torah and their permutations etc. so too will be the greatness of his knowledge of the nature of the world, understand this. Refer to Likutey Halachot, Yoreh Deah, Laws of Circumcision, Law 5, article 23 and 24, until the end of the chapter. See there a wondrous explanation of this, and it will forever pleasant for you. The truth is, whoever looks with a good eye, with a true eye, with a straight heart, does not have any problems with this (t.n. The opposers somehow took this entry and tried to use it for bad ends), on the contrary, from here can be seen the wondrous greatness of G-d and his true tzadikim. The opposers who speak against the venerated tzadik, who from the start look at his books with a bad eye, seeking and searching to make a libel, no explanation would be sufficient. For after all these words and truth, he will search and seek to accuse and wrong, to speak against the above mentioned tzadik and his students, may their merit protect us, venerated, with haughtiness and scoffing. Even still I was unable to hold back from presenting what I heard a little about this, and the truth endures, whereas lies are ephemeral, and G-d is forever true, and will save us from double edged sword, just like His Mercy, Blessed is He, helped us until now, amen so should be His Will. Also see Likutey Moharan, I:19 in the Teaching of “The Prayer of Chabakuk”, and you will understand a little, and also see teaching 17).",

Also see Likutay Moharan Torah 55:6 regarding tall people, and see Rabbi Nachman's Story Tales of Ancient Times, the Story of the Master of Prayer, where Rabbi Nachman attributes the tall man ('vainger' in Yiddish) as the \"gibur\" -- the man of great physical might, so it is very logical to say that this adage is based upon the aforementioned Torah in Likutay Moharan).",

From this we can learn what Rabbi Nachman says here that if the wealth is given to the Tzadik people will try to emulate him. However according to this reason their repentance has a tinge of materialism. Earlier Part One:#20 we learned that when the tzadik has wealth there is a better seat for the Divine Presence, it would follow that this would bring a holy aura of repentance, also see Part One:#158. t.n.

Therefore, one who knows from the taste of the Land of Israel, each according to his level, it is imperative for him to sense the Land of Israel, when he meets and gets together with this man who had been by the true tzaddik on Rosh Ha Shana.

No one is able to throw words into the mouth of his friend from a distance (t.n.: a concept found in the Medrash on the verse (Exudos 4:12), that G-d shot His words into Moshe's mouth).

This can be derived from the above noted verse, where God says he will “teach” Moshe what to say, and the Medrash offers to additional meanings for the word “teach”: shooting -- hence the first part of this dictum; and the second, to become pregnant with -- hence the contingency of the second part of the dictum).",
