            "Our Rabbi, may his memory be a blessing, cautioned us many times, in several wordings to make prayers from the teachings.  He would say: That one should make from this great delight above. He would say: That still, the only delights like these that would go up before Hashem Yitbarach were not delights made from prayers (in general)) rather that are made from the teachings.  Further, he would say this many times with many people.",
            "Truly, he did not clarify the mater well regarding his holy intention with this, but from his general words we understand that the essence of his intention was simple: that we should try hard to delve into the holy, awesome teachings that he revealed to us to understand and to become wise through the intent of this practical teaching.  (For this is the essence, that it's not about understanding, rather the essence is doing, as clarified to us many times, that the whole essence of the intent of our holy and awesome teachers, z'l in all the instructions that are revealed, was that they are only for the sake of action, that we should try hard and be strong and courageous in all strength to fulfill all that was said in each teaching.) and we considered our ways, how far we were from these recalled words in each teachings, and we prayed and begged to Hashem, in a multiplicity of insistent pleading, and requests, and supplications that God would have mercy on us and remember us and bring us close in God's great mercy, the we merit to uphold all that was said in that teaching, and we poured out our words before Hashem Yitbarach on every matter that was said there, and we should merit to uphold and arrive to them in wholeness"

                "May it be will Your Will Lord Our God and God of our ancestors, who hears prayer of His People Israel in compassion, (the prayers) they awaken Your compassion and Your kindness upon us for Your sake, and prepares our hearts to pray before You with a complete heart and soul, and that our prayers should be regular in our mouths always, and there should not be any impediment, obstruction, or confusion in our prayers.  Master of the Universe, \"O shepherd of Israel who leads Joseph like a flock! You who are enthroned on the cherubim, (Cause to) Appear to us in Your great compassion Your holy light that draws on us holiness and purity, in order that we can compel, subdue, and break our evil inclination, and we should merit in Your abundant compassion and great kindness, that our children and us will guard the holy covenant, and help us always, and save us in Your all-encompassing compassion and great kindness from all types of damages of the covenant &lt;italic&gt; Chas V'Shalom, whether in thought, speech or deed, whether by mistake or intention, whether compelled by force or through desire, whether through the sense of sight, hearing, or all other senses.  Through all of these let us be holy and pure in the holiness of the covenant without any damage or passing thought.  For in Your great compassion You chose us from all nations, and elevate us from all languages, and separated us from all their impurities and from their abhorrences, as You wrote to us in Your Torah, \"I have set you apart from other peoples to be Mine.\" (Lev. 20:26) And You call us Tzaddikim as is written: \"And Your nation are all Tzaddikim\" (Isaiah 60:21)",
                "Please, in Your great compassion, do not make Your Holy  Torah an empty document, chas v'shalom, for Your words are true and everlasting.  Therefore, make for us in Your compassion, and help us, that we will truly be amongst Tzadikim in order that we merit to be of those who guard the covenant.  In order that just by that alone it will be fitting for us to be called by the name \"Tzaddkim\" just as you made known to us through the teaching of Your holy sages, that only someone who guards the covenant is called \"Tzaddik\".  Therefore, just as You helped Yosef, your Tzaddik, in the hour that he came to be tested, and You saved him and gave him strength to overcome his inclination, so too, arouse from Your body and Your compassion on us, and cause us to merit with merit, and the strength of Yosef the Tzaddik, and give us wisdom, experience, discernment, knowledge, strength, and power of holiness, so that we can be saved from all types of damages to the covenant and we can overcome our inclination.  May we merit that our thoughts be connected and attached to Your holiness always without a moment of interruption. So that we will have strength, by virtue of this (through purifying ourselves and guarding the covenant), to appropriately order our prayers before You without any inhibitions, delays or confusion. In the way that You should accept our prayer before You, and arouse Your compassion upon us, and return Your face to us. And quicken us to our redemption and bring to us our righteous Moshiach, do it for Your sake and not ours. Help us that our prayers will be ordered as is proper, and give to us wisdom and knowledge that we will be able to use judgement to measure our words. And we will not stumble in the words of our mouths, and our prayers will not be tilted to the right or left from the straight and true path. And cause us to merit in Your great mercy to give Tzedaka to appropriately poor people. And cause us to have a lot of money and poor people to merit it (money). \"Mighty king who loves justice, it was You who established equity, You who worked righteous judgment, in Jacob.\" (Psalms 99:4) Because everything comes from You and from Your hand we have given to You. Maker of Tzedakah, with everyone You deal justly/righteously, You cause us to merit in Your mercy to included among the doers of Tzedakah. And remove the wickedness from our hearts that we will merit to give Tzedakah joyously with kind faces, and our hearts will have no bad feelings in giving it. Surely open our hands not only to give to a poor or desolate person what is sufficient for their lacking. Let my heart go out to the hungry and clothe the naked. ",
