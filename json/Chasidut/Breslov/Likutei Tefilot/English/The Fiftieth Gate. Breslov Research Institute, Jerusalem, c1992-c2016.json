                "<small>Only through Torah study is it possible to overcome the false ideas that the Evil Inclination tries to plant within us. We should look for the wisdom contained in all things in order to be able to understand God's messages to us and to attach ourselves to Him through everything in the world. Exile has detracted from the <i>chen</i> — grace and favor — of the Jewish People, and from our status in the world. Torah study helps to restore them, leading to the acceptance of our prayers.</small><br>HaShem our God and God of our fathers: Help me to be able to study, teach and practice Your holy Torah for its own sake at all times, and to keep the Torah at the forefront of my mind day and night.",
                "Through the merit and power of Torah-study, give me the strength to conquer and break my evil inclination and drive it out of myself. Help me rid myself of the foolish spirit that has taken hold of me because of the wrong I've done. I'll be able to get free by studying and keeping the Torah, which is entirely made up of Your holy Names. The power of the Torah will overcome any sway this foolishness may have over me. Just help me drive it out and remove it from myself and my life.",
                "Please, HaShem: You know the many thoughts that trouble me every single moment of the day and distract me from serving You properly. They are all caused by the foolish spirit that has taken hold of me because of the wrong I've done and all my sins and transgressions. My mind is in turmoil, and my good sense and intelligence have been severely impaired.",
                "Father in Heaven: You are good to all and merciful to all Your creatures. Forgive me and save me from destruction. Loving God: Give me the strength to conquer my own foolishness and drive it out of myself by studying and practicing Your holy Torah.",
                "Be kind to me and help me not to fall prey to the irrational appeals of my evil inclination. It tries to influence me and prevent me from serving You properly by dressing up its promptings as “mitzvot,” as if trying to persuade me to do something right and proper. The truth is that these “mitzvot” which it dresses itself in are a hidden trap, as You alone know. Please, HaShem, have compassion on my poor soul and save me from the promptings of the evil inclination. Let it have no power to deceive me with these distractions.",
                "I am throwing my whole burden upon You, HaShem, my God and God of my fathers. I am relying on You alone to lead me lovingly on the straight, true path at all times and in everything I do. Let my every movement be in complete accordance with Your will, and don't let me turn aside from what You want either right or left.",
                "You know that we are flesh and blood — it is impossible for us to always know exactly what You want. I appeal to You to show me Your love and help me. Do not let the evil inclination have any power to unsettle and distract my mind with any kind of foolishness and irrationality whatsoever. Let me rely on You alone. Show me Your great love, and lead me on the path of truth at all times. Let all my actions, activities and behavior, and those of my children, my descendants and all who depend on me, be in full accord with Your good will at all times, from now on and for ever.",
                "Loving God: Help me to be able to strengthen the power of holiness so as to overcome the power of evil. Help me to strengthen my good inclination against the evil urge.",
                "Grant me holy wisdom and intelligence. Let me always see all things in the light of the holy wisdom they contain, and so attach myself to You through everything in the world. Let me understand the constant messages and signals You send me to come closer to You.",
                "O God: You are full of favor, tender mercy, kindness and goodness at all times. May it be Your will to have pity on me and shine upon me with grace and kindness. Grant me favor in Your eyes and in the eyes of all who see me. Send me words of grace and endearment that will enter into Your heart. Accept my prayers and requests at all times, and fulfil Your promise to “pour out on the house of David and those who dwell in Jerusalem a spirit of grace and endearment.”",
                "Let the words with which we address You be words of grace and endearment, and give them room to enter into Your heart, and let our words arouse favor and pleasure before the throne of Your glory.",
                "Master of the World, see our poverty, our lowliness and shame. The grace and prestige of Your holy people Israel have fallen in this bitter exile. The Jewish People are despised and lowly in the eyes of the nations of the world and the wicked. All the grace and importance have fallen to them.",
                "Take pity on Your great and holy glory, and exalt, raise up and magnify the grace and prestige of Israel, materially and spiritually. Bring down the idol-worshippers, the unholy and the wicked. Let them have no grace and status whatsoever either above or below. Exalt Your people Israel and hear and receive our prayers and cries at all times.",
                "See our toil and look at our plight, and fulfil what is written: “For He has not despised or spurned the suffering of the poor and He has not hidden His face from him. When he cries to Him, He hears.” Show us favor and answer us and hear our prayer. For You hear the prayers of every single one of Your people Israel in love. Blessed are You who hears prayer."

                "<small>In order to come to perfect prayer, it is necessary to observe the Covenant, guarding the purity of our thoughts, words and actions. When praying, we must measure our words carefully. The way to achieve this is through the practice of charity. We should bind our prayers to the true Tzaddikim, who elevate them to God, putting each one in place in the total structure that will be completed by Mashiach. The essential weapon of Mashiach is prayer.</small><br>HaShem, our God and God of our fathers, who lovingly hears the prayers of Your people Israel: Stir up Your kindness and love for me — for Your sake. Prepare my heart, and help me pray to You with every fibre of my heart and soul. Let my prayers flow fluently from my mouth at all times, freely and without interference.",

Help me at all times, and keep me from all impurity and any breach of the Covenant, whether in thought, word or deed, whether unwittingly or intentionally, under compulsion or wilfully, whether with my eyes, ears or other senses. Let me sanctify and purify all of my faculties with the holiness of the Covenant, and do nothing to breach or blemish it in any way.",

You have separated us from all their impurities and wrongdoing, as You wrote for us in Your Torah: “I have separated you from the nations to be Mine,” and You called us all Tzaddikim, as it is said, “And Your People are all Tzaddikim.”",
                "Please, loving God, do not make Your holy Torah into an empty document, God forbid, for Your Word is true and enduring for ever. Deal kindly with me and help me to be a genuine Tzaddik by enabling me to guard the Covenant. Only in this way can one be worthy of the name Tzaddik, as You have informed us through the teachings of Your holy sages, who said that only someone who guards the Covenant is called a Tzaddik.",
                "You helped Yoseph the Tzaddik when he was tested: You saved him and gave him the strength to overcome his evil inclination. In the same way, arouse Your compassion for me. Through the merit and strength of Yoseph, give me intelligence, wisdom, understanding and knowledge, holy strength and power, so that I will be able to avoid all impurity in my life and conquer my impulses and inclinations. Let my thoughts be bound and attached to Your holiness at all times, without a single moment's interruption.",
                "Through purifying myself and observing the Covenant, enable me to offer You my prayers in the proper manner, without inhibitions, restraints and confusion. Accept my prayers and arouse Your love for me. Turn to us again and quickly redeem us and send our righteous Mashiach. Do it for Your sake and not for ours. Help me to order my prayers properly. Grant me intelligence and understanding, and let me use judgement to measure my words, so as not to stumble in what I say, or stray left or right from the straight, true path when I pray.",
                "Compassionate God: Help me give charity to genuinely needy people. Send me plenty of money, and worthy people to give charity to. “Mighty is the King who loves justice. You founded fairness. You have done justice and righteousness in Yaakov.” “For everything is from You — from Your hand have we given to You.”",
                "God: You deal charitably with everyone. Be charitable to me and let me be numbered among those who give charity. Remove the evil from my heart, and let me give charity joyously and with a kindly expression. Let me have no bad feelings when I hand my gifts to those in need. Let me open my hands and give them sufficient for all their needs. Let my heart go out to the hungry, and let me clothe those who are naked.",
                "In the merit of my charity, bless me, HaShem, and help me express myself to You perfectly in my prayers. Let my prayers be pure and acceptable. Let me have no outside thoughts when I pray, so that no barrier will intervene between my prayers and You.",
                "Please, loving and gracious King, make it possible for me to engage in the study of the holy Torah for many hours each day. Let me study the Torah for its own sake. Let my only motive in studying be to keep, observe and fulfil the entire Torah in love.",
                "The letters of the Torah which come out of my mouth as I study are “sparks of souls”. May they all enter into and be merged and clothed in the holy words of my prayers and develop and be renewed there. Let the light of my prayers then shine forth in full radiance, as You have taught us through Your holy sages of blessed memory.",
                "Help me to make an effort with my prayers at all times. Let me never despair of calling out to You and praying. Bring me to have perfect faith in the power of prayer. Our exile has lasted so long. Your people, the House of Israel, cry out to You every day and appeal to You to shine Your face upon us, build our Holy Temple and redeem us eternally. Despite all this, we have still not been delivered. Even so, let us come to believe and know with firm and perfect faith that no prayer is ever lost or in vain, God forbid.",
                "On the contrary, the Tzaddikim in every generation most certainly lift up our every prayer and put each one in its proper place, building out of them, as it were, the structure of the Shekhinah. Eventually the entire structure will be completed, and then the Mashiach will come and bring the work to perfection and raise the Shekhinah completely.",

                "My prayers may be far from perfect. There may be much about them that is not right. There may not even be a single word or letter that is pure and clean. My words are very muddled and what I say is full of mistakes. I do not speak with the proper concentration and awareness, and my words are far from where my thoughts are.",
                "Even so, Your love and kindness are overwhelming: give Your true Tzaddikim the power to lift up and elevate all my prayers and cleanse and purify them from all blemishes and impurities. Let my prayers rise up and find favor before You, and let the Tzaddikim use them to build the structure of the Shekhinah, to prepare Her, support Her, and lift Her out of her exile. Raise up the fallen Tabernacle of David through our prayers, and return Your Divine Presence — the Shekhinah — to Zion, and shine Your face upon us.",

                "Arouse our righteous Mashiach to receive our prayers and lift them up before You. Let my prayers and those of all Your people Israel be a double-edged sword in his hand to protect and shield us, to fight those who fight against us and to champion our cause. “He takes pity on the poor and needy and saves the souls of the needy.” “Take hold of shield and armor and stand up to help me. Gird your sword on your thigh, mighty warrior, your majesty and your splendor.”",
                "Do it for Your sake and not for ours — for even our few good deeds, our charity and our prayers are all from You. “For everything is from You, and from Your hand we have given to You.” Thus it is written, “Who came before Me that I should pay them?” “Not to us, HaShem, not to us, but to Your Name give glory for Your kindness and Your truth.” “In Your abundant kindness, give me life that I may guard the testimony of Your mouth.” Fulfil for us the verse: “For My sake, for My sake I will do it, for how could I let My Name be dishonored: I will not give My glory to another.” “He magnifies the salvation of His king and does loving kindness to His annointed — to David and his descendants for ever.” Amen.

Yet confession of one's sins before a true Sage and Tzaddik has the power to remove all trace of them and bring complete atonement and spiritual healing.<br>Seeing the face of the Tzaddik (and his inner “face” — i.e. his Torah teachings) has the power to lift a person out of depression and gross physical desires. Giving charity to the Tzaddik (and to institutions devoted to spreading his teachings) enables one to avoid the sin of malicious slander and to break one's pride.

The very thought of them fills me with panic and confusion and sets all my bones trembling. “There is no peace in my bones because of my sins.” They are inscribed on my bones, from the soles of my feet to the top of my head.

In every generation there were true Tzaddikim who led the Jewish People, taking them in their arms like a nurse takes up a little child. They taught them the path of God and brought them close to You.

My actions have been despicable and my thoughts appalling. I have done the same bad things time after time. I have repeatedly promised You that I would not go back to my wrong-doing or make You angry ever again, but I have not been able to keep my promises for even a short time. I've always been quick to go back to my bad ways. This has happened time and time again. How can I dare come before You and try to placate You?",
                "But we know, HaShem, that Your thoughts are way above our thoughts, and the power and depth of Your love and mercy are far beyond the grasp of our minds. It is impossible to apprehend the awesome heights of Your love and mercy. “The mercies of HaShem will never be exhausted, nor will His love ever come to an end.” As long as there is life there is hope. “You return man to the dust” — “Up until the moment when life itself is crushed into dust, sinners are received.” I have trust in Your great love, and I will rely on Your mercy. I know that You will not abandon me.",

The followers of the true Tzaddik experience a powerful sense of fellow-feeling that makes them want to help one another and give each other support and encouragement in pursuing the spiritual path.<br>The Tzaddik's power to ascend with the souls of his followers derives from his having freed himself of the appetite for wealth.

                "<small>For universal peace to reign, God's glory must be revealed to the world, and all must stand in awe of God.<br>The way to influence people to come closer to God is through <i>Torat Chessed</i> — the “Torah of Love”. This means studying Torah with the intention of teaching others and forging a connection with them in the actual situation they are in. The Torah, which is called God's “Primordial Thought”, is the blueprint of the Creation as a whole, and the source of the souls of the Jewish People. When studying Torah, we should aim to bring illumination to the very roots of the souls, which derive from the letters of the Torah. An important consequence of studying Torah with this aim is that it brings blessing to the souls of one's children.<br>True understanding of the Torah comes only through humility. One must therefore empty oneself of all pride. There are three areas in which people are particularly prone to pride: intelligence, power and wealth.<br>It is through the understanding of the Torah that one attains by cultivating humility that one is able to influence others to repent and come close to God. Repentance can be a painful process, because a person's sins cause his soul to be clothed in “filthy garments” (Zechariah 3:4), and these have to be removed. Nevertheless, there is nothing that enhances God's glory so much as when those who were very far from Him repent and come closer to Him. The enhancement of God's glory brings people to awe. This is the first step to universal peace, since peace can only come into the world through prayer, and perfect prayer depends upon awe of God. It is through awe of God that we are able to conquer our bodily passions, thereby attaining inner peace. Only with inner peace and harmony is one able to offer perfect prayer, since prayer is like a sacrificial offering, which must be without blemish.<br>We should pray for everything we need in life. Rather than devoting all our efforts to this-worldly means of trying to achieve what we need, we should have faith that “God is good to all” (Psalms 145:9). The Hebrew words could also be translated as “God is good for everything” — meaning that God has the power to provide us with everything we need with a minimum of trouble on our part. The holy words of the prayers have the power to overcome conflict and thus bring about universal peace.<br>The Chanukah lamp is symbolic of the light of the Torah of Love, which radiates even to those who are farthest away. This is why the preferred position for the Chanukah lamp is next to the street door of one's house, where it shines out for all to see.</small><br>HaShem our God and God of our fathers:",

                "<small>A person who wishes to taste the “hidden light” — the secrets of Torah which will be revealed in the future — must first free himself of all fears except the fear of God. Not only must we fear God because of His power to punish. We must also strive to reach a higher level of fear, where we are in awe of God for His supreme greatness.<br>The path by which this level of awe is attained is one of constant self-examination and self-judgement. We must set aside special times for introspection, and evaluate all our involvements and behavior against the yard-stick of the Torah. People who neglect to judge themselves are judged by Heaven, and may be sent all kinds of worldly fears and worries in order to goad and chastize them. But when a person judges himself, the need for such heavenly prompting is eliminated, as he himself has taken the initiative to bring himself closer to God. He thus becomes free of mundane fears, and stands in true awe of God's greatness.<br>One who reaches this level of awareness is able to attain understanding of the revealed Torah, which requires humility. Through humility one can come to true prayer: instead of praying for one's own needs, one rises above materialistic interests, surrendering oneself to God. God in Himself is beyond all knowledge, but the words of the prayers, which are woven from Divine Names and attributes, are God-given “screens” through which we are able to gaze at His light.

The instrument God gave us to conquer our desires is the “Holy Language.” This refers first and foremost to Hebrew, the language through which God brought about the creation, the language of the Torah and the prayerbook. However in a broader sense this term is also applied to our own private prayers and conversations with God in our mother-tongue. To cultivate the art of prayer is to master the Holy Language. The more we do so, the greater our ability to cool the furnace of our physical passions.<br>In consequence of the eating of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, we live in a world in which good and evil are mixed up in every sphere, including the language we use in our mundane affairs. (This corresponds to Aramaic, which was the vernacular of the Jews of ancient times, and is the language of the Targum — translation of the Torah.) In our everyday conversations it is all too easy to fall into falsehood, slander, vulgarity, idle talk, obscenity and so on. Only when we refine and sanctify our everyday language can we attain complete mastery of the Holy Language of Torah and prayer.<br>The opening verse of the Torah (Genesis 1:1) contains twenty-eight (<i>Kaph-Chet</i>) Hebrew letters: these are the source of the <i>Ko'aCh</i> — creative power — of the Hebrew letters that animate everything in creation. One who achieves mastery of the Holy Language is able to arouse this creative power, and can reach a level where all his pleasure in eating and drinking, etc. derives not from physical food and drink but from the spiritual letters of the Holy Language they contain.<br>Divine power is channelled to the letters animating the creation through the thirty-two names of God [Elokim] found in the account of creation (Genesis 1). These thirty-two (<i>Lamed-Beit</i>) names are, as it were, the heart (<i>LeV</i>) of creation. When a person is nourished by the letters underlying the physical creation, <i>his</i> heart radiates, shining to his face, which becomes so pure that other people are moved to repent purely by looking at him.<br>The relationship between the Holy Language and the language of everyday life — the Targum — corresponds to that between Shabbat and the days of the week. Our task is to sanctify the days of the week by bringing the Shabbat spirit into them, until the entire creation becomes reunified in its Source.</small><br>God: Open my lips and my mouth will declare Your praise.

Bring me to the true holiness of the Covenant and let me come back to You with all my heart and constantly rise from level to level with ever greater holiness, just as You want, until I will ascend and become merged in the supreme Shabbat and You will mercifully grant me the day that is all Shabbat and rest and eternal life.",

                "<small>The essence of being a Jew is to make constant efforts to advance from one spiritual level to the next. This is only possible through the holiness of Eretz Israel — the Land of Israel. However Eretz Israel is one of the things that is attained through suffering (<i>Berachot</i> 5a). The main suffering is caused by those who slander the land. The slander of the Ten Spies (Numbers 13:27-33) is the prototype of all the malicious lies and misconceptions spread by the opponents of the Tzaddikim and of the Torah path in general. These lies create the major barriers confronting those trying to enter and follow the spiritual path.<br>The power to break these barriers and overcome the slanderers derives from original Torah insights — <i>chidushey Torah</i> — both those we develop ourselves and especially those of the true Tzaddik. The only way to attain true insight is through pouring out our hearts in fervent prayer and pleading with God until the “Supreme Heart,” which is the ultimate source of all Torah ideas, is aroused. In approaching God, even the outstanding Tzaddik and Sage may not rely on his own merits: he must plead with God for insight as a free gift. Spiritual insight and connection with God — <i>da'at</i> — must be founded on perfect observance of the Covenant, which entails moral purity in all of one's thoughts, feelings, speech and actions.<br>The words of original Torah teachings create holy angels that have the power to take the “sword of punishment” from Edom, to whom it is entrusted, and with it crush those who slander the land and create barriers for those wanting to follow the spiritual path. However exile weakens the power of holiness, making it impossible to receive the sword from Edom and wield it ourselves, and the only way to overcome the slanderers is by bringing them to justice under the laws of the nations of the world.</small><br>From the narrow straits I called on God; God answered me with wide expansion.

                "<small>The essence of the spiritual life of a Jew is to constantly grow and move forward to higher and higher levels of <i>da'at</i> — knowledge of, and connection with, God. Just as physical movement generates heat, so too exercising the mind in Torah and devotion generates enthusiasm and fervor in the heart, firing one to rise to greater heights of service and putting unholy passions to flight.<br>Any given level of <i>da'at</i> has its <i>makifin</i> — “surrounding” or “transcendent lights”: these are levels of knowledge and understanding that are as yet beyond the capacity of one's mind to grasp. In order to grow, the task is to reach out for these new spiritual horizons and “bring them down” — i.e. internalize them. The <i>makifin</i> are different for each individual at different times, depending on his or her stage of development. They may involve deep facets of Torah wisdom, higher levels of faith, service and devotion, <i>ru'ach hakodesh</i> — holy spirit and prophecy — etc. The prayers that flow from a person when he is inspired are also called holy spirit. In general the <i>makifin</i> are called <i>shefa Eloki</i> — rich blessings of Godly inspiration.<br>The way to draw down and internalize the <i>shefa Eloki</i> is through sanctifying the “Seven Candles.” The Menorah — candelabrum — of the Sanctuary (Exodus 25:31-40) is symbolic of the human mind. The Seven Candles are our two eyes, two ears, two nostrils and mouth. They are the agents of the mind, bringing stimuli into it and arousing it. The lights of the Menorah had to shine “towards the <i>face</i> of the Menorah.” The “face” alludes to the mind. When this is enhanced through sanctifying the Seven Candles, one can then receive from the <i>ohr hapanim</i> — the “Light of the Face,” “the Light of God's Countenance” — and attain new levels of Divine wisdom and inspiration.<br>The key to spiritual growth is thus to sanctify the Seven Candles: the eyes — by avoiding looking at evil; the ears — by listening only to the words of the Sages; the nostrils — by “breathing in” the fear of God (cf. Isaiah 11:3), and the mouth — by avoiding all falsehood and improper language. When inspiration and insight are lacking, one should cry out, whether in one's prayers or Torah study. It is as if the Shechinah is crying out, leading to the “birth” — actualization and manifestation — of levels of insight and awareness which were previously hidden and present only in potential.<br>The stages of the life of the soul in its journey through this world and in the next are bound up with the quest for new and higher <i>makifin</i>. The <i>chupah</i>, the marriage canopy, symbolizes the <i>makifin</i>, while the seven days of marriage festivities allude to the sanctity of the Seven Candles. After death, the soul has to rise to the <i>ohr hapanim</i>, and the seven days of mourning (<i>shiv'a</i>) help to elevate the soul of the dead person. In the world to come the Tzaddikim are depicted as having canopies — <i>makifin</i> which “burn” those who encounter them, i.e. they cause them to become fired with passion and fervor. The <i>s'chach</i> of the <i>succah</i> also alludes to the <i>makifin</i>. The month of Elul is a particularly propitious time to work towards higher spiritual levels.</small><br>“I raise my voice and cry out to God; I raise my voice to God and plead.” “I raise my voice to God and cry out; I raise my voice to God — and He hears.” “From the belly of hell I screamed: You heard my voice.” “Let my cry come up to You, to Your holy Sanctuary.” “Hear my voice: do not close Your ear to my cry for help and my screaming.” “Hear my voice, HaShem — I call out: be kind to me and answer me.” “Accept our cry and hear our shout, You who know hidden secrets.”",

Have pity on us — because we have fallen so low, and we are so despised. Rise up and help us! Save us! Put it into our hearts to cry out to You without respite until You have mercy on us. Turn Your face to us and draw us near.",

Even if I could roar and scream like all the creatures in the world, it would still not be enough to express my inner pain over even one of the rebuffs I suffer in a single day. There's not a cry in the whole world that can help me bridge the terrible gulf that separates me from You. “Even when I scream and shout, my prayer is closed up.” How much more so, seeing that I haven't even begun to cry out to You with all my strength.",

I put my trust in Your abundant mercy and loving kindness. I have hope that You will forgive me, and I am confident that You will save me. I stretch out my hands to You, HaShem my God and God of my fathers. Help me! Be kind to me! Awaken my heart until I feel the true intensity of my pain — the pain of my <i>nefesh</i>, my <i>ru'ach</i> and <i>neshamah</i>. Let me realize how totally far from You I am.

Loving God, help me to learn to use my voice to arouse and give birth to the holy wisdom and inspiration that have become hidden from me because of my sins. My sins are so many that they have weakened the power of Heaven, as it were, so that even the Shechinah is not strong enough to give birth to new inspiration. “You weakened the rock that gave birth to you!” “The children have come to the birth-stool, but there's no strength to give birth.”",

You alone know all secrets. To You it is revealed and known where the potential wisdom and inspiration of every single Jew are exiled and concealed. Help me and all other Jews to use our voices to arouse the holy wisdom and inspiration that have become concealed from us, from each one in a different way, until we will all be able to rise to ever higher levels of vision and inspiration, each according to the root of his <i>nefesh</i>, <i>ru'ach</i> and <i>neshamah</i>.

Save me from ever listening to base language of any kind. Let it never enter my ears. Let me never listen to or accept a single derogatory comment or incriminating statement about anyone.

Let me pray with the utmost devotion. Let my prayers flow fluently from my lips, until the very words of my prayers will be filled with holy, prophetic spirit and I will be able to speak with You and pour out my heart to You “as a man speaks to his friend,” “face to face” and “mouth to mouth.” Help me be a “faithful spirit, who keeps secrets.”",

                "<small>Fear of embarrassment in front of other people has a major influence over the way most of us behave, but shame before God is an emotion that has all but been erased from the consciousness of many in contemporary society. True shame before God is founded on an awareness of our smallness and inadequacy in the face of God's greatness and majesty.<br>The greater our sins and shortcomings, the more embarrassed we should feel before God, but this sense of shame is clouded by the trait of unholy <i>azut</i> — brazen assertiveness — characteristic of our lower bodily impulses and appetites. They thrust themselves to the forefront of our attention, making it difficult, if not impossible, for our higher spiritual powers to manifest themselves. In the world around us, <i>azut</i> is visible in the ruthless arrogance of those who are willing to ride roughshod over the interests of others for the sake of their own power and influence. Such false leaders create formidable obstacles for those wishing to draw close to the true spiritual leader — the Tzaddik.<br>To advance on the spiritual path, it is essential to use holy <i>azut</i> — bold determination to persist without regard for opposition and difficulties. Against the clamor of our inner impulses and the outer distractions, we must raise our own voices in Torah study and prayer. Indeed all holy sounds, such as that of the <i>shofar</i>, and even the chink of charity coins, help strengthen the power of the holy against the unholy. The way to subdue the lower instincts of the body is through submitting it to the discipline of the practical mitzvot, and serving the Tzaddikim through attending to their needs.<br>The foundation of holy <i>azut</i> is <i>simchah</i>, joy, which is associated with constant spiritual growth and development. Whatever level we may have reached, there is always a higher level to aspire to — one that is “concealed” in relation to the “revealed” knowledge and insight already attained. The essence of growth is to rise to this higher level and turn the “concealed” into something “revealed” — only to find a higher “concealed” level to work towards. The concepts of “revealed” and “concealed” correspond to Torah and prayer respectively. Prior to any spiritual advance there must always be a fall: its purpose is to spur us to increase our efforts to climb higher.<br>Only through the holy boldness and daring that come from joy can we connect ourselves with the spiritual leaders who make up the “inner seal” of holiness protecting the Jewish People's relationship with God. These leaders are emissaries between God and the Jewish People, guiding us and pointing out our sins and shortcomings, while interceding with God and pleading for forgiveness. Because they go to and fro, as it were, these emissaries are called the “legs.<br>We also need “hands” with which to receive their guidance and teachings. The vessel with which we receive them is faith, which makes up the “outer seal.” This requires extra protection, since if it is broken, the atheism which then develops causes global conflicts and expulsions of Jews from their homes. The only way to come to genuine faith is through the teachings of the true Tzaddik, who radiates the light of the seven pre-eminent leaders — “shepherds” — of the Jewish People: Avraham, Yitzchak, Yaakov, Yosef, Moshe, Aharon and David.</small><br>HaShem our God and God of our fathers, Master of all works, Lord of all souls: shine on me from Your holy dwelling-place. Inspire me with fear and dread of You, and help me attain holy shame. Clothe me with awe and cloak me in shame before Your great and holy Name. Let me always feel truly ashamed before You, so that I will never deviate right or left from Your will.

                "<i>The covenant / Sexual purity / Happiness / Faith and truth / Earning a living / Mezuzah / Envy / Strife</i><br><small>Since the essence of a person is expressed in his face, the experience of true closeness to God is described as gazing at the light emanating from His “face” or “countenance.” The way to open ourselves to this light is through faith and the search for truth. Experiencing it is characterized by spiritual joy and contentment.<br>We are placed in this material world as a test, so that we may earn our closeness to God through overcoming obstacles and temptations. A person who mistakenly views material gratification as the main purpose of this life is cut off from the light of God’s countenance, and instead becomes attached to the dark “face” of the Other Side, the realm of unholiness. This attachment is characterized by the anxiety and depression experienced by so many for whom money-making is the main goal of life, and who lack the trust that God can provide everything they need.<br>The key to detaching oneself from this unholy “face” is scrupulous fulfillment of God’s covenant with the Jewish people (the mark of which is circumcision), which involves purity and self-restraint in material life, and especially in the realm of sexual morality. Observance of the covenant opens us to the light of God’s countenance and saves us from sinking into the pursuit of materialism. By virtue of being circumcised, every Jew has an aspect of tzaddik within him. However, opposition from others can easily push one down into materialism. Those confronted by opposition, such as people seeking to lead a spiritual life in the face of mockery and even outright persecution, must make a special effort to hold themselves from succumbing to materialistic temptations.<br>Developing our faith and trust that God controls everything can save us from struggles and anxiety in earning a living. One of the signs that we have truly attached ourselves to God and overcome our materialistic inclinations is our readiness to spend money in connection with fulfillment of the mitzvot. The mitzvah of affixing a mezuzah on our doors affirms God’s sovereignty over our material environment. This mitzvah is thus a guard against the sin of envy, which people fall into when they are not satisfied with the portion God has given them.</small><br>Our God and God of our fathers! Living God and King of the world! God of life, our portion and our Rock! Command that our precious flesh be saved from destruction, for the sake of the covenant You have inscribed in our flesh.

Nevertheless, a person who has actualized these levels of his soul to perfection can gain passing glimpses of the Infinite Light. The first step is to carry out the mitzvot joyously — this elevates the holy life force that animates this world from its exile amid the forces of unholiness. Each mitzvah we do has the power to bring blessing into all the worlds. The spiritual seeker should aim to receive the blessings of wisdom and Godly knowledge, and to deepen his faith. He must also develop his power to order and settle his mind. The tendency of the mind to stray outside the bounds of the holy must be held in check. As long as we guard the purity of our thoughts, it is the very interplay between our ability to direct our minds on the one hand, and the race of our thoughts to the limits of what is knowable on the other, that opens us to fleeting perceptions of the Infinite Light.</small><br>How fortunate are we!

                "<i>Tikkun HaKlali: The General Remedy / The covenant / Exile and redemption / Moral purity / Speech and selfexpression / Clothes / Keeping secrets / Livelihood / Charity / Epilepsy / Avoiding drunkenness</i><br><small>To make amends for all one’s sins can be very difficult because each of the various prohibitions of the Torah involves so many details. However, in every area of life there is a <i>Tikkun Klali</i>, a “General” or “Complete” Remedy, which has the power to rectify all one’s sins in that area and provide a sound basis for directing future activities to the service of God. For example, when trying to make a living, it is easy to fall prey to avarice, envy, malpractice, theft, and so on. The General Remedy in this area is to give charity, and to have in mind that this is the aim of all one’s work activities.<br>The General Remedy for the faculty of speech is to speak the praises of the tzaddikim, such as by telling stories about their achievements. Besides the obvious sins involving speech (slander, hurting people’s feelings, etc.), it is an abuse of our faculty of speech to talk without thinking: only when we use our minds as we speak are our words accepted. This applies to our prayers as well. Praise of the tzaddikim is the General Remedy for speech because the tzaddik lives on the plane of mind, spirit and wisdom. By speaking positively about his achievements, we bring wisdom into our words. The words in which we clothe our thoughts are called “garments” of the soul. The teaching, “Your clothes should always be white” (Ecclesiastes 9:8), thus applies to the way we speak, as well as being an injunction to take care of our physical clothing.<br>The concept of the General Remedy applies first and foremost in the realm of moral purity, which is the foundation of the covenant between God and the Jewish people. Moral purity in thought, word and deed is therefore the basis for true closeness between the individual Jew and God. Abuse of the covenant — such as through forbidden sexual thoughts, and indeed, through any sin at all — not only alienates the Jew from God, but is depicted as causing a stain on the Shekhinah. (The image is that of a menstrual stain, which renders a woman forbidden to her husband until she purifies herself.)<br>A commitment to guarding the covenant through moral purity is thus an integral element in teshuvah and in the redemption of the Jewish people as a whole.</small><br>HaShem my God, hear my voice! Have mercy on me and accept my prayer with compassion and favor!",

                "<i>Perceptions of Godliness / Finding the tzaddik / Moses / Overcoming the craving for wealth / Exile and redemption / Atheism and false ideologies / Kindness / Pesach, Shavuot and Sukkot / Holy boldness / Boldness in prayer / Labor and childbirth</i><br><small>By Himself, God is completely beyond the grasp of thought. However, He veiled and “contracted” His light into the Torah and mitzvot to provide us with graded means of attaining successively higher perceptions of Godliness. The tzaddik has the power to “clothe” the “higher wisdom” of Godly perception in the garb of the “lower wisdom,” making it possible for even ordinary people to grasp it. The more outstanding the tzaddik, the greater his ability to reach out to those on the lowest spiritual levels. Thus, Moses alone could lead the Jewish people out of the forty-nine gates of impurity in which they were trapped in Egypt. So too, in the depths of our present exile, we need to search for the greatest possible tzaddik to guide us closer to God, and we should not content ourselves with leaders of small stature. Only the Torah has the power to bring us to genuine perceptions of Godliness. When philosophies that deny the Torah gain sway, the Shekhinah — which rules over the Four Worlds of Atzilut, Beriah, Yetzirah and Asiyah — falls into exile, giving power to the four unholy empires of Babylon, Medea, Greece and Rome. Our task is to extricate the Shekhinah from exile and elevate Her to Her source in the inner light of God’s countenance. This is accomplished through acts of charity and kindness, and through the joy with which we perform the mitzvot.<br>Joy is felt in the heart. The joy of the mitzvot radiates especially on the three pilgrimage festivals, Pesach, Shavuot and Sukkot, which are the “heart” of the year. The special fourfold mitzvot associated with each festival (e.g. drinking the Four Cups on Pesach and taking the Four Species on Sukkot) help elevate the Shekhinah — alluded to in the Hebrew letter <i>dalet</i>, which has the numerical value of 4 — from exile. The safe birth of a Jewish child into the world is also an aspect of the release of the Shekhinah from exile. This is because the unholy forces seeking to hide Godly revelation fight hard against the birth of Jewish children, since each new soul that comes into the world brings about a unique revelation of God’s greatness.</small><br><b>For the 7th of Adar, the yahrtzeit of Moses</b><br>“As the hart pants after streams of water, so my soul yearns for You, O God.

You have brought it down from level to level, from the higher wisdom to the lower wisdom.

                "<i>Shabbat / Faith / Charity / The covenant / Travel / Torah study / Holy yearning and desire / Eating / Livelihood / Divine providence</i><br><small>The ultimate goal of Creation is that every created being should know God. Since it is only through faith that we can come to know Him, without faith there can be no perfection in any sphere. Thus, faith is the foundation of Judaism. The linchpin of faith is Shabbat, which celebrates God’s kingship over the universe. Because Shabbat observance brings us to faith — the precondition for perfection — Shabbat is the source of all blessing.<br>Although the universe appears to run according to the impersonal laws of nature, every detail is in fact under God’s direct providence, as will be revealed fully in time to come. The key to the workings of the entire universe, including those of the planets and stars, is charity. The entire flow of spiritual and physical blessing into the world can be seen as God’s “charity” to His creatures, bringing them to know Him. When we ourselves give charity, we participate in this process, which is why charity is such an exalted mitzvah. Since Shabbat is the key to faith, which is the precondition for perfection, the highest form of charity is that given to enable deserving people to celebrate Shabbat. To come to deep faith, we must keep the covenant. On one level, this involves careful observance of the laws governing what is permitted and what is forbidden. On a higher level, it involves the utmost personal sanctity, especially in the area of sexual morality. The orderly workings of the entire universe depend on our observance of the covenant. (The difficulties people sometimes experience while traveling may be caused by failure to observe the covenant, which inhibits the flow of blessing into the world.) The true tzaddik and leader of the generation must be a perfect exemplar of the covenant both in his personal sanctity and his Torah scholarship, though we should not be misled by the latter into believing that intellectual prowess alone is the essence of Judaism. “Study is not the main thing, but action.”<br>Keeping the covenant engenders deep yearning and longing for God, unlocking wellsprings of spiritual potential within a person. The way to transform this potential into actual, spiritual accomplishment in the form of good traits and deeds lies in articulating and expressing one’s desires and aspirations in detail in private prayers to God (hitbodedut). By doing so, we “make vowels for the letters of the Torah.” In the Torah scroll, only the consonants are written; thus, they have the potential to be vocalized in different ways, positive or negative. Similarly, our physical powers can be used for good or evil. Through articulating our holy yearnings, we are able to harness them for good.</small><br>“I will sing of HaShem’s kindnesses forever; from generation to generation I will make Your faithfulness known with my mouth.”",

                "<i>Finding God in all situations / Overcoming negative desires and traits / Trust in the tzaddikim / Torah secrets / Universal peace</i><br><small>The fact that God is everywhere means that He can be found even in places and situations that may on the surface seem utterly devoid of Godliness. The same applies to the different times we go through in life: not only must we acknowledge God when things are good, we must also search for Him when they seem very bad. A person who gains control of his lower instincts is no longer deceived by outer appearances and can penetrate to the Godly vitality that animates the entire creation. Then the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, which channel this vitality to the creation, stand out clearly for him to see: he is able to find spiritual meaning in every situation. When a person is able to find Godliness in all his different life experiences, he attains inner peace. The way to come to this is through study of the Torah, “all of whose ways are peace,” and by attaching himself to the tzaddikim, who embody the Torah in their very lives and are called “a covenant of peace.” The Torah and mitzvot — God’s gift of love to the Jewish people — are accessible to our finite minds yet provide us with graded ways of coming to know and attach ourselves to the Infinite God. The highest expression of God’s love is “the love contained in <i>da’at</i>” — the concealed level of the Torah known as the “Torah of the Hidden Ancient One,” which is destined to be revealed in the future, though even today it is possible to get a taste of it.

This good point is the “inner tzaddik” within each one of us — for, “Your people are all tzaddikim.” The way to arouse this good point is through expressing our highest spiritual aspirations in words, so as to radiate wisdom from the mind down into the heart. Even though God knows our thoughts, it is necessary to speak out our prayers, since speech is the vessel through which blessing is channeled into the world. The Jewish people are a unity with a collective soul. Therefore, the “points” of all individual Jews are rooted in the soul of the outstanding tzaddik in each era, who has a general soul. The tzaddik is thus the main source of spiritual arousal and inspiration for each Jew, and the wisdom of the tzaddik’s teaching and advice radiates to the heart of each one. But in addition to what the Jew receives from the tzaddik, he also has much to gain from discussing spiritual concerns with his friends, as the “point” within each one is quite unique, and we must receive from each other. Through receiving from the “point” of the tzaddik and the “point” of our fellow Jews, each of us can bring out the radiance of his own personal “point” and thereby deepen his relationship with God.</small><br>“My mouth will speak wisdom and the meditation of my heart, understanding.” “God, hear my prayer; listen to the words of my mouth.” “Please accept the free-will offerings of my mouth, HaShem, and teach me Your laws.” “HaShem, hear my prayer and listen to the voice of my supplications.” “HaShem, hear the voice of my supplications as I cry out to You and lift my hands to Your holy Sanctuary.” “Do not incline my heart to something wicked, to be occupied in deeds of wickedness with men that work evil, and let me not eat of their dainties.”",

                "<i>Teshuvah / Purity of thought / Sleep / Faith / The inner light of Divine wisdom / Honesty in business / Tefilin / Rosh HaShanah</i><br><small>The root meaning of the Hebrew word <i>teshuvah</i>, repentance, is to return something to the place from which it was taken. Man’s soul derives from the Divine wisdom with which the world was created. Our souls manifest themselves in our minds and thoughts, and thus the essence of teshuvah is to guard the purity of our thoughts and clear our minds of all ideas and theories that are contrary to Torah teaching. Profane thoughts lead to sinful traits and behavior. We must use our intellectual faculties to contemplate ways of deepening our service of God. By expanding our knowledge and understanding of the Torah, we develop our souls.<br>When we are tired after the exertions of intense study and devotion, we rest our minds by going to sleep. While we are asleep, the soul ascends to the realm of faith (which is why we affirm our faith just before going to sleep by reciting the bedtime Shema).<br>The soul then receives new strength and power from the light of God’s countenance, the spiritual light that radiates in the upper worlds and is revealed in the seventy faces of the Torah. Besides physical sleep, there are also other categories of “sleep” in which the soul ascends to the realm of faith to receive fresh vitality. For those who spend much time in taxing devotions, study of the simple (as opposed to mystical) meaning of the Talmud and halakhah is a form of “sleep.”<br>Business activity is another form of “sleep” through which we can refresh our minds and souls — on the condition that we conduct all our affairs with genuine faith. Every business situation involves various Torah laws. Not only must we familiarize ourselves with the Torah laws regarding business, but to overcome the trials and temptations of business life, we must also cultivate the utmost truthfulness. (The Talmudic example is Rav Safra, who, having inwardly decided on his asking price, would not change it even if he saw that his buyer would be willing to pay more [<i>Makkot</i> 24a]). Because of the organic unity of the Jewish people, the scrupulous honesty of Jewish businessmen aids tzaddikim and Torah scholars in their efforts to attain higher spiritual levels. Truthfulness is a channel through which we can draw down the light of <i>Chashmal</i> (the spiritual light that shines in the World of Beriah, Creation, also called the World of Binah, Understanding) to protect our faith from being undermined by the unholy forces that abound in our world, the World of Asiyah, Action. The light of <i>Chashmal</i> is also alluded to in the straps of the tefilin (these straps bind the exalted spirituality contained in the Torah portions and capsules of the tefilin to our physical bodies).<br>Hearing the shofar blasts on Rosh HaShanah, which come to remind us of the need to repent, can also reawaken our mental and spiritual powers, as can seeing the face of the true tzaddik.</small><br>At the top of the noisy streets I cry out, at the openings of the city gates I utter my words.

                "<i>Overcoming physical cravings / Holiness of the eyes / Attachment to the tzaddik / Moses / Deepening one’s understanding of the Torah</i><br><small>The exile of the Jewish people among the seventy nations of the world is reflected in microcosm in the inner world of the individual Jew when he finds himself under attack from his physical desires. Each of the seventy nations is associated with a particular negative trait or desire. The root of all of them is the “all-encompassing desire,” namely sexual craving. (This refers to cravings for illicit sexual relationships, as opposed to legitimate sexual expression within the context of marriage as governed by the Torah code of family purity.) Sexual craving, which is man’s main test in this world, is personified in the figure of Balaam, the greatest heathen prophet, who stands counter to Moses on the side of holiness. Because Moses attained the ultimate level of separation from physical desire, he was able to bring the Torah into the world. The Torah has seventy “faces,” or dimensions of meaning, corresponding to the seventy root-souls of the Jewish people (seventy souls went down to Egypt with Jacob). Before a Jew can rise to a higher level of insight into one of the seventy faces of the Torah and Godly devotion, he is first tested with an attack of physical cravings (associated with the seventy nations). Before one can eat the fruit, one must first encounter the husk. To the spiritual seeker, an attack of lust may seem like a regression, but in fact it is a test, the purpose of which is to bring one to a higher level whose attainment is called a “birth.” Just as a woman in labor emits seventy cries before giving birth (<i>Zohar</i> III, 249), so a Jew who is being tested must cry to God repeatedly until he attains his new level.<br>We are the ones who give shape and form to the Divine light shining from above according to the vessels we prepare to receive it. In other words, we interpret the Torah we receive from our teachers according to the degree of our spiritual and intellectual preparation. Someone who is sunk in immoral cravings may radically misinterpret the teachings of the tzaddik. The remedy for an occasional lustful thought is to recite the verses of <i>Shema Yisrael</i> (Hear O Israel) and <i>Barukh Shem kevod malkhuto le’olam va’ed</i> (May the Name of the glory of His kingdom be blessed for all eternity). In Hebrew, these verses contain twelve words and forty-nine letters, corresponding to the Twelve Tribes of Israel and the forty-nine letters making up their names. However, someone who suffers regularly from immoral thoughts must shed tears while reciting these verses in order to cleanse himself of the impurities in his body and surrender himself to the rule of Heaven.</small><br>“Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer; save my life from the terror of the enemy!” “HaShem, hear my voice; let Your ears be attentive to the sound of my supplications!” “HaShem, I call out to You: Hurry to me, hear my voice as I call to You!”",

                "<i>Mind vs. matter / Torah wisdom vs. atheism / Memory / Fasting / Charity / Eating / Kosher meat / Educating children / The Land of Israel</i><br><small>The soul is associated with light, form, wisdom, spiritual awareness and life, while the physical body is associated with their opposites: darkness, substance, folly, animalism, forgetfulness and death. Immersing ourselves in the wisdom of the Torah strengthens the soul, bringing us to the level of Adam, man. However, the pursuit of materialistic ideologies that contradict the Torah leads to the glorification of physical desire, causing spiritual concealment.<br>The way we eat also has a significant influence on whether our spiritual faculties will gain sway over our bodily cravings, or vice versa. It is important to eat in moderation and with dignity. Fasting also helps weaken bodily desires (though Rebbe Nachman advised people to fast only on the mandatory fast days of the Jewish calendar). Another practice that helps the soul gain dominance over the body is giving charity. Through contributing to causes in the Land of Israel, the donor becomes included in the pure air of that Land, which is free of sin, and is able to attain the wisdom of the Torah and overcome the influence of alien ideologies. It is particularly important to protect one’s children from exposure to atheistic influences and to see that they are taught Torah by a sincere, God-fearing teacher, in order not to corrupt the untainted breath of their mouths. The <i>shochet</i>, ritual slaughterer, plays a key role in guarding the spiritual purity of the Jewish people. Eating the meat of an improperly slaughtered animal can degrade and desensitize a person. In addition, the Kabbalah teaches that human souls may be incarnated in animals and birds, and can return to their source only if the shochet has the correct intentions and recites the blessing over the shechitah with the utmost concentration. The soul in the slaughtered animal or bird is then able to rise up to the Shekhinah, Who in turn channels blessings to the Jewish people. Dishonest shochtim fail to elevate these souls, interrupting the flow of livelihood to the Jewish people and giving strength to material cravings and ideologies.</small><br>“Let my life be given to me at my petition and my people at my request.” “Save my soul from the sword, save my spirit from the power of the dog.” “Do not cast off my soul, for I have put my trust in You.”",

                "<i>Attachment to God / Tefilin / Purity of speech / Judging people favorably / Torah study / Teshuvah / Shabbat</i><br><small>We must constantly examine ourselves to see if we are truly attached to God. The tefilin are worn as a sign of our attachment to Him. The way to invest this sign with inner meaning and come to true attachment to God is through learning to use our Divinely-given faculty of speech in a holy way. Slander, talebearing, offensive or unclean language and the like all turn the breath of the mouth into a raging storm wind. Constantly harping on other people’s failures and shortcomings arouses an impure spirit of harsh judgment in the world at large. Because of its destructive nature, this impure spirit is described as “the end of all flesh.” To subdue this destructive force, it is necessary to refine the way we speak. The first step is to get into the habit of expressing ourselves to God with perfect truth and sincerity. The main way to elevate our speech is through Torah study. We must make every effort to persist with our studies even at times of severe financial and other pressures. These times are called “night” and, “One who learns Torah at night draws a thread of lovingkindness upon himself” (<i>Chagigah</i> 12b). The quality of kindness is associated with our patriarch Abraham, who “rose early in the morning” (Genesis 19:27; 22:3), symbolizing how the light of kindness banishes the forces of darkness. The “thread of kindness” puts the accusing forces to flight, allowing the free flow of holy speech, song, praise and thanks to God.<br>When a person is stirred to repent and pours out his thoughts and feelings to God with fervent passion, he becomes aware of his own lowliness and the greatness of God. He is filled with a deep sense of shame over his sins against the Master, Root and Source of all the worlds. This sense of shame and awe before God is the “light of the tefilin” — the inner state of mind in which the mitzvah should be carried out. Even though the tefilin themselves are not worn on Shabbat, the “light of the tefilin” also shines out on <i>ShaBbaT</i> (which has the same letters as the word <i>BoSheT</i>, shame). The more we succeed in bringing the holiness of Shabbat into the six working days, the more the forces of impurity and accusation in the world are dispelled.</small><br>“My soul cleaves to You; Your right hand supports me.” “I cleave to Your testimonies, HaShem, don’t put me to shame.”",

                "<i>Overcoming the Desire for Food / Receiving Spiritual Abundance / Attaining Truth / Becoming God’s Partner in Creating Heaven and Earth / Performing Miracles / Earning a Generous Income / Fasting to Break One’s Desire for Eating</i><br><small>The verse states, “Not in poverty will you eat bread in the Land of Israel.”</small><br><small>Sometimes a person eats bread because he has nothing else available. But the implicit meaning of this verse is that in the Land of Israel — the land of life — a person will overcome his desire for food. Then he will eat bread simply because he has no wish to eat anything else.</small><br><small>The Land of Israel receives its abundance from the realm of truth and, in turn, sustains the rest of the world. It is the conduit through which we receive abundance. Therefore, when we eat, we must have in mind to receive that true spiritual abundance — instead of eating due to physical desire — with the intent of then thanking God.</small><br><small>When a person eats only to satisfy his soul and not due to physical desire, God feeds him from the trait of truth. Then, when he praises God with the power that he derives from such eating, he speaks words of truth. With that power, he can become God’s partner in creating heaven and earth. Then this person can perform miracles. God guides the world through the laws of nature, which are in accordance with the heavenly spheres. Since this holy individual can create a new heaven, he can change those spheres and thus do wonders.</small><br><small>On a less lofty level, a person who clings to truth can earn a generous income, since truth is the source of abundance.</small><br><small>If, however, a person is steeped in the desire for eating, God hides His countenance from him, and the person is far from truth. Even if he is a righteous individual, if he experiences a desire for eating, this indicates that he has spoken falsehood. Furthermore, Heavenly judgments rule over a person who is steeped in the desire for food, and he is liable to experience shame and poverty.</small><br><small>Thus when Jews experience troubles, they fast. Troubles are a time when God’s countenance is hidden and He judges the world. When Jews fast, they break their desire for eating. This leads to spiritual illumination and God’s “uplifted countenance” — and He sweetens and eliminates His judgments.</small><br>My Father, my King — Mighty One, Creator, Redeemer, Holy God of Jacob, Shepherd of Israel, Helper and Savior — in Your compassion and mercy, eliminate my desire for eating so that I will make do with little, with just enough to maintain my wellbeing, in strict and careful measure, and be satisfied with that.",

                "<i>Yearning for God / Constricting the Light of the Flame of the Heart / Serving God with Wisdom / Rectifying Creation / Revealing God’s Heavenly Torah</i><br><small>Every Jew is “a portion of God from above.” The essence of that Godliness lies in his heart, and it is infinite. Thus there is no end to a Jew’s yearning for God.</small><br><small>But if that were all there is, everything would remain overwhelmed by the infinity of that flame. Consequently, a Jew could not serve God or reveal any good traits, since he would become absorbed in Infinity, in God.</small><br><small>Similarly, in the beginning, there was no room for creation, because everything was the Infinite One. But since God wanted to reveal His sovereignty, which requires the revelation of “traits” or worlds, He constricted His infinite light and, within the resulting Vacated Space, created those worlds.</small><br><small>In the same way, every individual must constrict the light of the flame of his heart. By guarding against evil thoughts and thinking only good thoughts on how to serve God, his heart creates a “vacated space” in which he can then engage in good deeds and attain good traits. With that, he can serve God in measure and by degree, and thus reveal His sovereignty.</small><br><small>Just as creation came about through God’s wisdom, so do we serve God with wisdom. When a person’s heart is empty, it is open to wisdom. Thus he can serve God and rectify creation. Should he fail and instead engage in evil thoughts, in the foolishness of the heart, he seals his heart and fills up the Vacated Space of creation. Then it is as though he had destroyed the world.</small><br><small>But when he again engages in good thoughts, he rectifies creation. By purifying his heart, rejecting the bad thoughts and engaging in good thoughts, he renews the creation and can make miracles happen. The essence of returning to God depends on the thoughts in one’s heart: on fleeing bad thoughts and engaging only in good thoughts, on considering one’s end, and on thinking about how to come close to God and thus attain the Heavenly Torah, which contains the secrets of the delights of the World to Come and the pleasure of the Shabbat.</small><br><small>A person must have the strength to run the track. Even after he has repented and repaired what he has damaged, he must make up for what he could have accomplished when he was far from God.</small><br><small>The heart of the Tzaddik is always open to wisdom. Therefore, he can engage in the act of creation and do wonders. (The Tzaddik gains his understanding from the Jewish people. Should the latter descend into the external wisdoms of the nations, he too falls from his understanding.)</small><br><small>When a person prays, he connects the thoughts in his heart to his words. As a result, God’s sovereignty is enhanced. Life, abundance and blessing are drawn to the Jewish people, and the sovereignty of evil falls. This leads to supernal and lower unifications and the revelation of God’s Heavenly Torah.</small><br>God, You Who are the Rock of my heart and the Holy Rock of all worlds, Creator of the universe, Master of every deed and every soul, You Who know all hidden things — You know my heart.",

Everything was true, good and holy (i.e., a complete unity). Even the word “pure” did not exist. Purity was created only when God brought potentiality into actuality, since now there were two realities: the original oneness and creation.</small><br><small>“Pure” exists only in relation to “impure.” It is an intermediary between the holy and the unholy. Thus purity is the intermediary point of our free will. If a person makes a wrong decision, purity can descend into evil and impurity — into falsehood, which is removed from oneness. But because impurity devolves from purity, it can be rectified and purified.</small><br><small>Through God’s providence — even after creation — all things are one with Him. And God’s providence rests on a person through truth. But through falsehood — which is evil — a person removes God’s providence from himself. Therefore, a person who wants everything to be one (as it was before creation) should guard himself from falsehood. As a result, God’s providence will rest upon him, and everything will be one.</small><br><small>Falsehood comes about through distance from oneness. Truth is “one” insofar as there is only one true description of a quality — e.g., an object is composed of gold. Falsehood, however, can be multitudinous. The composition of this same object can be falsely described as silver, tin, bronze, and so on.</small><br><small>Falsehood damages a person’s eyes in that it removes the providence of God’s “eyes.” Without that providence, oneness is damaged, and there is a gap between “after creation” and “before creation.” But through truth, a person draws down God’s providence so that all is one. Then “after creation” is absorbed into “before creation.”</small><br><small>Falsehood can be said to damage a person’s eyes in another way as well. The essence of speech is a person’s spirit, which is associated with the blood. When a person tells a lie, he pollutes his blood. That polluted blood makes its way into his bile. An excess of bile is said to create tears. These tears weaken the eyes.</small><br><small>Tears indicate sadness. But when there is only oneness, there are no antagonisms, no opposition. In messianic times, when everything returns to oneness, opposition, evil and tears will be eliminated. Then the lion will dwell with the lamb, “HaShem will be one and His Name will be one,” and God will wipe away the spirit of pollution from the earth.</small><br>HaShem, God of truth, in Your vast compassion, rescue me from falsehood. Be with me always. Guard me so that I will never speak a lie, whether accidentally or on purpose, against my will or willingly.",

But this is not true. Only God is a Necessary Existent, and He created all worlds <i>ex nihilo</i> in accordance with His free will.</small><br><small>What is the source of the mistaken notion that the world’s creation was necessary? It is the fact that once the souls of Israel were brought into being, the world did become a necessary existent. This is because the entire universe was created for the sake of the Jewish people. God could have chosen to create or not to create the Jewish nation. Once He decided to do so, the entire world became a necessary existent — because He had to create the world for their sake, so that they might rule over the universe.</small><br><small>So God created the world for the sake of the Jewish people — so that Israel should do His will, returning and clinging to their root, which is God. The more the Jewish people do God’s will, the more they are absorbed — together with the worlds that are dependent on them — into God, the Necessary Existent.</small><br><small>To be absorbed into this root, into the oneness of God, a person must experience self-nullification. One attains self-nullification through <i>hitbodedut</i>, the practice of speaking to God in one’s own words. Through this practice, a person eliminates his desires and evil traits, until he eliminates all his physicality and is absorbed into the root of his being.</small><br><small>Ideally, this practice takes place at night, when the world is resting from its business. This is because the energy of the affairs of the world keeps a person from nullifying himself and being absorbed into God, even if he himself is not involved in those affairs. Moreover, this practice must take place in a specific, unfrequented site outside the city, where people do not pass by, because if a place is frequented by people — even if they are not presently there — that too disturbs a person’s <i>hitbodedut</i>.</small><br><small>And so, at that time and in that place, a person turns aside from the affairs of this world until he attains perfect self-nullification. First, he prays a great deal until he nullifies one trait or desire. Then he does the same to nullify another trait or desire. He continues in this way until he has nullified them all. Yet something still remains — and so he nullifies that as well, until nothing at all remains.</small><br><small>At last, this person’s soul is absorbed into its root — into God, the Necessary Existent. Then the entire world is absorbed with his soul into its root, and the entire world itself becomes a necessary existent.</small><br>“My soul desires You at night; with my spirit within me I seek You.” “At night, I recall Your Name, HaShem, and I keep Your Torah.” “Upon my pallet at night I sought Him Whom my soul loved.” “I sought Him, but I did not find Him. I will recall my song at night. With my heart I will sing, and my spirit will search.”",

                "<i>Guarding One’s Spiritual Awareness / Understanding God’s Hints / Sleep / Tzitzit and Tefilin / Torah Learning / Prayer / Business / Redeeming Holy Sparks / Avoiding False Imagination and Slander / Joyous Music / Prophecy / Midnight / Chanukah</i><br><small>It is very important to constantly guard one’s awareness, or “memory,” of the spiritual realms, and not fall prey to spiritual forgetfulness, which is the “death of the heart.” Therefore, as soon as a person gets up in the morning, he should contemplate that spiritual reality. Throughout the day, he should strive to understand the hints that God sends him in his thoughts, speech and deeds on how to serve Him.</small><br><small>A person who understands these hints might wish to restrict himself to this-worldly matters, through which God guides him. But that would be improper, for two reasons. First, this would be a risky endeavor, in that the holiness within the world is surrounded by “husks.” Second, there are better ways of serving God — i.e., Torah and prayer.</small><br><small>At any rate, most people lack the ability to understand God’s hints. However, an analogue to this process occurs for them automatically when they sleep, wear tzitzit and tefilin, learn Torah, pray and engage in business: When a person sleeps, his soul and thoughts cleave to the World to Come. The tzitzit and tefilin which a person wears correspond to spiritual greatness and expansiveness. The Torah which a person learns is a Tree of Life that contains all sustenance — enough for everyone to receive what he needs. Prayer deals with this-worldly life — i.e., with the holiness within the world. And through business, the sparks of holiness which are scattered throughout the world — holy letters that broke and fell into everything in the world — are rectified.</small><br><small>For instance, a person receives an object with whose sparks he shares a common root. He receives vitality from the broken letters in that object. As a result, those letters are absorbed into his life force and made whole. When this person finishes making use of the letters and sparks related to his root, the object goes to someone else who will raise other sparks and letters within it, related to his soul. Sometimes an object returns to the first owner because his soul has developed over the course of time and he is now able to rectify letters that he had not been able to affect previously.</small><br><small>In order to guard his awareness of spiritual reality, a person must protect himself from an evil eye, which corresponds to the “death of the heart” and the shattering of the Tablets. In particular, he must guard his own eyes from being deceived by false imagination, which is an animalistic trait — for animals too possess imagination. Such false imagination is generated when a person engages in slander and, as a result, falls to an animalistic state. Then his animalistic trait of false imagination grows stronger. Instead of loving God, he then experiences animalistic desires.</small><br><small>Such false imagination seeks a container — a body — to enter. Therefore, it goes to people who create <i>halakhic</i> insights. Holy Torah insights create heaven and earth, bringing about abundance and blessing for the world. Should a Torah insight be created through the false imaginative faculty, however, vain heavens are created, bringing famine to the world.</small><br><small>The energy of false imagination of the “husks” was created at twilight after the sixth day of creation and remained without a body. Thus it seeks a body in which to rest. It therefore goes to those who learn <i>halakhah</i> and who create realities with their words of Torah, in the hope that a body will be created for it to enter.</small><br><small>A person can overcome this false imaginative faculty through joyous music, which can even inspire prophecy. A musical instrument gathers together air (i.e., wind), or “spirit.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew word <i>ruach</i> means both “wind” and “spirit.”</i> Initially, it contains a mixture of good and evil: a depressed, evil spirit and a good, holy spirit of prophecy. A person who contains both these spirits cannot experience prophecy.</small><br><small>The musician separates the good spirit of prophecy from the depressed spirit. He builds a tune of joy. When the prophet hears this tune, he receives a spirit of prophecy.</small><br><small>Depression strengthens false imagination. A depressed spirit blurs the clarity of the good spirit of prophecy, of spiritual “memory,” clinging to supernal reality. Playing joyful music brings forth the good spirit, overcoming the spirit of false imagination — the evil spirit, the spirit of foolishness.</small><br><small>Therefore, a harp hanging over King David’s bed would begin to play a holy tune at midnight. Midnight is an ideal time to strengthen oneself to arise and serve God. These ideas are also expressed in the underlying concepts of the festival of Chanukah.</small><br>“I will recall my song even at night. I will speak in my heart as my spirit searches.” “At night I recall Your Name, HaShem, and keep Your Torah.” “I recall the works of God; I recall Your wonders from the beginning.” “I recall the days of old; I consider all Your deeds.

We overcome evil in general by praying together with Jews who are far from perfect — who are, in fact, sinners. By praying with them, we nullify their evil; and, in fact, that former evil is transformed into a platform — a throne — for holiness.</small><br><small>In addition, when we pray, we should connect ourselves to the souls of departed Tzaddikim and arouse them to pray with us.</small><br><small>We must lift up people who have fallen into false faith with our prayer and plant perfect faith in their hearts. When a person is a philosopher, although he may have intelligent thoughts, those thoughts are greater than his deeds. Consequently, when his thought settles in his heart, his heart cannot contain it, since the heart is strengthened by good deeds. This is particularly true of licentious people who learn philosophy. When we pray with intensity, we rectify the hearts of these philosophers, so that their hearts can contain their intellect.</small><br><small>Not everyone can achieve such rectifications, however. Sometimes one is faced with the energy of very wicked people, and whoever challenges them endangers himself. To deal with this, one needs great prayer, such as that of Moses himself.</small><br><small>In addition, praying with intensity transforms all insults to honor. When a person stands in the palace of the king, he makes himself as nothing, so that he sees only the king. Should he hear any insult, he interprets it as expressing the honor of the king — because who would enter the palace and insult the king? Thus he makes an effort to interpret those words as a token of respect for the king. Also, he cannot imagine that these insults are meant for him, since he has nullified himself completely, so that only the king exists.

One person may rule in his home, another in his community, another over the entire world.</small><br><small>Sometimes that sovereignty is revealed, but at other times it is hidden — i.e., a person rules over souls that are subject to his influence. And every Jew possesses something of that hidden sovereignty. Indeed, it is possible for a person to possess no revealed sovereignty, yet sway a great deal of hidden sovereignty, even over the Tzaddikim of the generation.</small><br><small>A person can use his sovereignty for selfish purposes, exploiting it like a slave who serves his desires. But it should be free — that is, he should use it to serve God, by teaching and admonishing others.</small><br><small>Each person has a responsibility to admonish the people from his soul-root who are under his sovereignty. When he shirks this responsibility, he is punished. But if does not know what they need, how can he do so? Thus he requires the proper awareness to know how to admonish them. He can attain that awareness through a state called “length of days.” He attains this state by learning Torah. </small><br><small>The Torah is the name of God. Just as we call a person by his name, so too do we call God to come to us by learning Torah. God is the Source of life. Therefore, when we call God to ourselves, we are calling life and “length of days” to ourselves. Yet we must absorb that life force in the proper measure. Should there be too much, it will be like too much oil, which extinguishes a flame. We make that proper measure by learning Torah.</small><br><small>A name is an object’s container, in which that object is defined and delineated. The life force of God, Who is the Source of life, is contained within the Torah. Indeed, the Torah consists of containers: letters, words, verses and chapters. They hold God’s life force in a measured manner. By learning Torah, we draw “length of days” to ourselves. In that way, we attain awareness, because awareness itself is our life force. And when we attain awareness, we are able to admonish those people over whom we have sovereignty and for whom we are responsible.</small><br><small>But sometimes God’s life force is hidden.</small><br><small>There are two types of spiritual concealment: simple and doubled. If God is concealed simply, although it is hard to find Him, then insofar as a person knows that God is hidden, when he toils, he will find Him. If God is doubly hidden, however, the very fact of his concealment is concealed. Then a person does not even know that God is hidden and, of course, he cannot find Him.</small><br><small>Nevertheless, even in that double concealment, God is present, because nothing exists without His life force. Thus God is contained within all objects, deeds and thoughts. Even if a person sins, God’s life force is there, although it is very hidden and constricted.</small><br><small>The Torah is the life force of everything. Thus it is contained within everything — in every thought, even a sinful one — although the Torah is then very hidden and constricted.</small><br><small>When a person sins, he takes God’s words and rearranges them, calling evil, good, and vice versa. This person’s conscience, however, is still functioning. This is one level of concealment. But at times, there may be a double concealment, when a person has sinned so much that he has no sense that he is doing anything wrong. There too God is hidden in the letters of the Torah.</small><br><small>We must reveal those concealments. We do that by drawing “length of days” into our sovereignty. This gives us the awareness that even within concealment — even within a double concealment — God is to be found within the Torah. Then the concealments themselves are transformed into Torah, and then the Torah itself admonishes people. Indeed, the Torah is always admonishing us, but we do not hear its voice because it is concealed.</small><br><small>But when we learn Torah, we draw “length of days” into sovereignty. We draw God’s life force into “days” and “measures.” As a result, we attain awareness, and we are able to admonish even those who are far from God — those who suffer from concealment within concealment.</small><br><small>The Torah teachings that are contained within a double concealment are very high. They consist of the secrets of the Torah. If the Torah contained within such low places — in the midst of people who have sinned a great deal — consisted of simple meanings, then the evil “husks” would be able to derive much from it, and that would cause great damage. Therefore, God hides and contains a high-level Torah there — the secrets of the Torah, the Torah of HaShem itself — from which the “husks” cannot derive very much. When that Torah is redeemed, it literally becomes the “Torah of HaShem.”</small><br><small>There is an energy that opposes holy sovereignty, and that is evil sovereignty. Holy sovereignty gathers everything together. Evil sovereignty gathers money together. Fearful lest its prey — the sparks of holiness — be taken from its mouth, it gathers money, which consists of sparks of holiness — the supernal colors inherent in gold, silver and copper. Thus a person experiences a desire for wealth, which corresponds to sovereignty. Holy sovereignty has the power to take money from evil sovereignty, together with all the holy sparks that evil has swallowed up. That money itself is then transformed into Torah. </small><br><small>The greater a person’s awareness, the easier it is for him to earn a living. Earning a living without excessive toil is dependent on one’s awareness. When a person’s awareness is increased, peace is increased as well. Then two opposites, such as a lion and a lamb, can live together. Then anger and cruelty cease to exist, because they are the result of a lack of awareness.</small><br><small>This corresponds to the festival of Shavuot. Shavuot embodies a very high level of awareness — of supernal love and compassion which depend on awareness. Therefore, it is customary on Shavuot morning to go to the mikvah. That is the gate of supernal awareness, which saves a person from troubles and purifies him from all impurity.</small><br><small>Dispute is normally the opposite of awareness. However, there is “a dispute for the sake of Heaven.” That is actually an even greater state of awareness than the awareness of peace. To attain a dispute for the sake of Heaven, a person must truly sigh, for that strengthens and steadies his pulse — which was weakened and made unsteady and heavy by depression. Then he receives inspired words from Heaven. It is possible that in a practical sense, the <i>halakhah</i> is not in accordance with his words. That is something that we cannot understand. Nevertheless, we must respect this person’s words and realize that they form part of a dispute for the sake of Heaven.</small><br>“Why do You hide Your face and forget our suffering and oppression?” Why, HaShem, do You reject my soul?

                "<i>God’s Speech and Angels / Heavenly “Hands” / Torah and Healing / Raising Fallen Faith / The Delight of the Shabbat / Eating on the Shabbat / Fasting / Anger / The Image of God</i><br><small>Every word that issues forth from God’s mouth is divided into a number of sparks, and an angel is created in accordance with every spark. Each angel is in charge of something, such as a tree or a blade of grass. The angel’s ability to receive vitality from God’s speech — the Torah — and give to the entity that it influences is called its “hands.”</small><br><small>Since the Torah gives power to the angels, and they in turn influence grasses and herbs which are made into healing medicines, all medicines ultimately depend on the Torah. If a person lacks faith in the Torah sages and ignores their rulings, he removes the “hands” from the angels. As a result, he suffers from illness that cannot be cured. Only when he raises up his fallen faith can he be healed.</small><br><small>He raises up his fallen faith by making vows. This elevates him to the spiritual level that is the source of the sages, and then he can appreciate and believe in them. This leads to an elevation of the spiritual pleasure of the Shabbat, which is expressed in eating in holiness.</small><br><small>When a person eats on the weekdays, the Other Side derives some benefit from it. But when he eats on the Shabbat, the Other Side derives no benefit. His Shabbat eating is completely holy and Godly. Therefore, on the Shabbat, a person can accomplish with his eating what he could accomplish on a weekday only with fasting — and that is the downfall of his enemies. Why is that?</small><br><small>Anger is associated with the liver — which, during the weekdays, takes precedence over the brain. When a person is angry, he can be attacked by enemies, since they do not fear him. Human beings are feared only because of the image of God that they possess. When they no longer possess that image, they become animalistic. When a person grows angry, the image of God leaves him, and thus he is not feared. But when a person fasts and does not feed his liver, he restores his Godly image. Then his enemies fall before him. A person who attains the delight of the Shabbat, however, has no need to fast. Indeed, the peace attained by the delight of the Shabbat is superior to the peace attained through a weekday fast. And superior to both is a level called “a profusion of peace,” which a person attains by giving charity generously. “One who increases charity increases peace.”</small><br>“HaShem, You are my God; I will exalt You.

These three entities came to them originally due to the spiritual influence of the three patriarchs. Thus the well, with its waters of kindness, corresponded to Abraham. The clouds corresponded to Isaac, who had clouded eyes. And the manna corresponded to Jacob. Moses’ soul was composed of the three patriarchs; therefore, he could maintain the existence of these entities.</small><br><small>As a whole, the patriarchs represent the covenant (of circumcision, referring to sexual purity), which was polluted by Amalek when it attacked the Jewish people in the wilderness. With the power that he received from the patriarchs, Moses was able to defeat Amalek and rectify the covenant. In doing so, Moses attained a double portion of spiritual abundance.</small><br><small>The well, the clouds of glory and the manna correspond to drink, clothing and food. A person attains these in accordance with the degree to which he internalizes the traits of the patriarchs: Abraham’s kindness, Isaac’s might and Jacob’s harmony and truth. A person is kind in that he teaches Torah and brings people close to God. He is mighty in that his fear of sin precedes his wisdom. He possesses harmony in that he expresses his wisdom carefully, so that his words will not be unappreciated.</small><br><small>When a person’s consciousness is complete — when he has attained these three traits — he can fight the battles of HaShem. Then, after he overcomes entities hostile to Jews and strengthens weak Jews, he is able to create original Torah thoughts on the Shabbat, which corresponds to a double portion of spiritual abundance.</small><br><small>Through the illumination of the Shabbat, the entire world is thereby aroused to repent out of love and delight. Then all the Tzaddikim are healed and granted respect, and every individual can receive honor and respect — which represent the double portion.</small><br><small>They must take care, however, lest they allow this honor and respect to mutate into unseemly pride. Also, the spiritual nature of the Shabbat is dependent on guarding one’s speech. If the generation does not guard its speech, then — even though the wise Tzaddikim spread the influence of the Shabbat and repentance — the light of repentance, honor and respect are damaged.

Should any “husks” take hold of the thoughts of his heart, he should summon the angels of his own heart — his heart’s fervor — to incinerate those “husks.”</small><br><small>This angelic fervor is created when a person judges and weighs his words. By doing so, he guards his spirit by building a wall around it. That is a wall of patience, which keeps out anger. When a person keeps anger out of his life, he also attains abundance and wealth. Indeed, should a person ever feel driven to get angry, he should know that God is sending him prosperity at that very moment, and his evil inclination is attempting to thwart it.</small><br><small>When a person guards his soul with such a wall, then the souls of all people want to be incorporated in him. This is because the root of all souls lies in abundance. (That is why people like to associate with wealthy people.) Similarly, when a person has many students, their souls are incorporated in him.</small><br><small>All this comes about because this person judges and weighs his words. As a result, he can teach his wisdom to students without harming them. There are some wicked people whom he may not teach, however, since they might cause him spiritual harm.</small><br>“Fortunate are those who cleave to judgment, those who perform charity at every moment.

                "<i>Deep Contemplation / Abundance and Wealth / Spiritual Length of Days / Awe / Awakening from Spiritual Slumber / Torah in the Form of Stories / Primal Stories / Giving Hearing to the Deaf / Making It Possible for Barren Women to Conceive / Rosh HaShanah</i><br><small>Certain areas of Torah can be attained only through deep contemplation. And a person can attain that contemplation only with abundance and wealth. Thus Moses and all the prophets were wealthy. Indeed, the Torah itself is called “wealth.” In regular Torah learning, one introduces ideas which he sets aside after reaching the main point. So too in this deep contemplation, one first needs introductory material, which is wealth.</small><br><small>To attain that wealth, a person needs “length of days.” This means that a person must spiritually enhance his days. Each day begins narrowly. It can be difficult to start — to pray, to learn Torah, and so forth. One begins little by little, and then enhances, broadens and lengthens every successive hour with holiness.</small><br><small>Increased holiness is attained when a person achieves a state of consciousness called “fear” and “awe.” This awe guards a person against poverty, which results from a state of consciousness that expresses itself in acting with “false charm” and derives from a weakness for feminine beauty. The opposite of that state of consciousness is the state called “awe.”</small><br><small>Awe is divided into three parts: awe of Heaven, awe of one’s Torah teacher and awe of one’s parents. Each of these is subdivided into three. Consequently, the awe of Heaven is divided into three states of consciousness, as one contemplates God’s greatness. The awe of one’s Torah teacher is divided into the three different aspects of the Torah. And the awe of one’s parents corresponds to that which one inherits from them, which is divided into three aspects.</small><br><small>This awe is associated with awakening from spiritual slumber. Some people sleep away their days, even though it seems to others that they are serving God, learning Torah and praying. But their service gives God no pleasure, because it remains below and cannot rise.</small><br><small>Vitality is related to the mind. When a person serves God with an awakened consciousness, his service is alive and can rise. But when a person suffers from a constricted consciousness, from sleep, his service cannot rise. Some people have fallen asleep due to their desires and bad deeds, and others due to eating in an unholy fashion. Such people must awaken themselves, and then they can be assisted.</small><br><small>But that assistance must come in a graduated fashion. Thus the teacher may clothe his Torah teachings in the form of stories. Sometimes a person has fallen so far that he can be awakened only with primal stories from which the Torah itself derives its life energy. When a teacher awakens a person normally, that is kindness. When he awakens him through such primal stories, that is “great kindness.”</small><br><small>A person who works to awaken people must guard himself against unworthy students, so that their evil will not harm him. He cannot prevent such unworthy students from hearing him. But when he teaches properly, God protects him and causes the unworthy students to forget his words.</small><br><small>This person gives hearing to the deaf, and thus he gives them speech. Associated with that, he makes it possible for barren women to conceive.</small><br>“HaShem, when I heard Your message, I feared; HaShem, revive Your people in these years; in these years, make it known that even in anger, You remember to be compassionate.”",

                "<i>Responding to a Heretic / Questions That the Mind Cannot Comprehend / Relying on Faith / The Holy Source of Dispute / Learning Halakhah / Perfecting One’s Faith / Elevating the Sparks of the Holy Letters / Fasting / Defending Those Who Lack Faith</i><br><small>We must sharpen our finite minds, so that we can understand matters clearly and “know what to respond to a heretic.” But that is true only in regard to questions that have comprehensible answers. There are other questions whose answers the human mind will not understand until the coming of the Mashiach. We are forbidden to delve into these questions, because doing so will only cause us to go astray. Instead, in such cases, we must rely on faith.</small><br><small>Our knowledge of God comes from the good inclination in the heart, and the concealment of that knowledge comes from the evil inclination in the heart. That concealment is heresy and doubt, and we must rectify it at its source. Its source is dispute. The dynamic of dispute originates in the realm of holiness and then devolves from level to level until it manifests in the doubts of the evil inclination.</small><br><small>An example of holy dispute is that of arguments between the Talmudic sages, in which one forbids something and the other permits it. A person rectifies holy dispute by deciding <i>halakhah</i> or by learning what the <i>halakhah</i> is. By doing so, he clarifies his mind so that in regard to answerable questions, the gates of his mind are opened and he can “reply to the heretic.” But in regard to questions that have no answer, he must strengthen himself with faith. And when he perfects his faith, he can bring others, including non- Jews, close to God</small>.<br><small>In order to do that, he must elevate the sparks of the letters of his speech. When the holy sparks of the letters of his speech are purified and separated from the “husks,” the “husks” remain lifeless. Then the non-Jews who have hitherto drawn energy from those “husks” cast away their faith and come to Jewish faith.</small><br><small>But first, in order to elevate those holy sparks of speech, this person needs to fast.</small><br><small>The “husks” derive their energy from the “back” of holiness, because the “face” of holiness is too bright for them. The main desires are those of eating and drinking. Since they are close to the organs of speech, when they are strong, they draw speech into exile, so that a person cannot speak to God. In order to take away their power, a person must fast. By doing so, he draws down the “waters of kindness.”</small><br><small>These moisten his throat, and then he can speak. Then faith itself speaks in defense of those people who are distant from God, and asks God to bring them under His wings.</small><br><small>It states that those who are far from God see that the world is guided by natural laws of cause and effect. They conclude that there is nothing else except nature or, at the very least, there is a God but He acts only through intermediaries — e.g., the intermediaries of working in order to earn a living, and taking medicine in order to overcome illness. In truth, God is the First Cause and, ultimately, no other cause is needed. This awareness is reinforced when we see how the Tzaddik overcomes the laws of nature with his prayer.</small><br>HaShem, my God and the God of my fathers, plant Your faith in the heart of every Jew, including myself.",

                "<i>The Tzaddik is Revealed and Concealed / God is Revealed and Concealed / The Snake and the Ant / The Tzaddik Battles the Ideologies of the Heretics</i><br><i><small>In Breslov circles, this lesson is known as, “The Mystical Intentions of the Circumcision.” While the lesson does not speak explicitly about circumcision, it does explain the Kabbalistic intentions. Therefore, this prayer contains many references to guarding and maintaining a pure moral lifestyle, which is implied in the covenant (of circumcision).</small></i><br><small>Sometimes the Tzaddik is revealed to the world; at other times, he is concealed. He is concealed in that he is so exalted. People cannot understand him, and so he must contain his wisdom in small packets so they will be able to receive from him. Moreover, the Tzaddik may be concealed in that people may question and even attack him.</small><br><small>God too reveals and hides Himself. He is revealed in that we must cling to Him. Yet the more we cling to Him, the more we must realize how truly far we are from Him. Sometimes the Tzaddik reveals God’s providence by accepting abundance and Heavenly favor. At other times, he conceals God’s providence in that he refuses these and instead accepts suffering.</small><br><small>The Tzaddik works unceasingly to make sure that God’s presence is revealed in the world. He can be compared to an ant resting in the mouth of a snake. The snake represents heretical thinkers. Sometimes the snake can do nothing more than crawl. This metaphor tells us that the ideology of the heretics is not developed. They can harm only those who are close to them, such as their own students and colleagues. Furthermore, their words do not enter deeply into other people’s minds, but merely cling to the surface.</small><br><small>But when the populace speaks evil words, particularly when they slander Tzaddikim and other great people, the snake gains wings with which to fly. This means that the minds of the heretics grow swift, allowing them to develop their heretical ideologies, which fly throughout the world and harm many people.</small><br><small>The ant in the mouth of the snake is the just and righteous Tzaddik of the generation who enters into those heretical ideologies in order to battle them. In doing so, he suffers greatly. He is attacked by confusion and false belief, and his faith in God is attacked.</small><br><small>Whether the snake crawls or flies, the ant suffers and fights — but especially when the snake flies. The ant can relax only when the snake is gliding — i.e., when the heretics are at rest, such as when they eat and sleep.</small><br>HaShem, You Who guard the covenant in Your lovingkindness, guide me from this moment on to guard my holy covenant and cause no more spiritual damage whatsoever.",

Therefore, He constricted His light to the sides, which made a Vacated Space. In that Vacated Space, He made “days” and “measurements” — i.e., the world.</small><br><small>This constriction of the Vacated Space will not be understood until the times of the Mashiach. For it involves the paradox of simultaneous “being” and “non-being.” The Vacated Space results from constriction, so there is no Godliness there. But Godliness must be there, for nothing can exist without God.</small><br><small>There are two types of heresy. One involves the secular sciences. In the Vacated Space, there was an excess of light. This light caused the spiritual “vessels” to break, and as a result, “husks” were brought into being. These “husks” are waste matter deriving from holiness, and secular sciences come from this. About such ideologies, our sages stated, “Know how to respond to a heretic.” This type of heresy can be answered. A person who has descended into this type of heresy can be saved. He can find God if he looks for Him, because the sparks and letters of holiness have broken and fallen there. Thus he can find the Godliness with which to answer heretical questions.</small><br><small>But there is another type of heresy which consists of questions raised by philosophers. In actuality, these questions contain no wisdom and are essentially null. Since human intellect cannot answer these questions, however, they appear to be strong. These questions cannot be answered because they come from the Vacated Space, where there is no Godliness. Therefore, since one cannot find God there, one cannot find an answer to these questions. Thus the verse states, “Whoever comes to that will not return.”</small><br><small>With their faith, the Jewish people bypass such ideologies, including the heresy that comes from the Vacated Space. For they believe in God without philosophy, but with perfect faith that He fills and surrounds all worlds.</small><br><small>There must be a division between the universe and that which transcends it. If not, everything would be one. That division is the Vacated Space. The Vacated Space surrounds the universe, and God surrounds the Vacated Space. He fills all worlds — which were created in the Vacated Space — and He surrounds all worlds, including the Vacated Space. When we have faith that God fills and surrounds all worlds, we believe that the Vacated Space itself was made with His wisdom and that God is truly there (although this cannot be understood with the human mind). Then we can find God in the Vacated Space. But when people delve into philosophy, they get lost in the Vacated Space because they cannot find God there.</small><br><small>A great Tzaddik on the level of Moses can study such heresy even though he cannot answer its questions. By doing so, he raises souls that fell and were immured in it.</small><br><small>The confusions and questions which people experience in this regard are on the level of silence, since no thought or letters can solve them. Creation came about through speech, which contains wisdom. Speech represents limitation, the boundary of things; for example<i>,</i> God limited His wisdom in letters. But in the Vacated Space which surrounds the universe, there is no speech — not even thought without speech. And so the confusions that come from there are on the level of silence.</small><br><small>Therefore, in that realm, an ordinary person must believe in God in silence. Only the Tzaddik on the level of Moses may study those heretical confusions.</small><br><small>With their words — and particularly with their disputes — Tzaddikim create worlds. For when they argue, each draws himself to a different side. This creates a Vacated Space in their midst, in which creation is brought about. The Tzaddikim must be careful not to say more than is necessary to create worlds. Should they say too much, it generates an excess of light. Then the “vessels” cannot hold the flood of light and they break. As a result, “husks” are created.</small><br><small>The Tzaddik who corresponds to Moses raises souls from the heresy of the Vacated Space through melody. Each wisdom has its own melody. Even heresy has its own melody. Every level of wisdom has its own tune.</small><br><small>At the very beginning-point of creation, the beginning of emanation, where there is nothing higher than the light of the Infinite One which surrounds the Vacated Space, there too wisdom exists. But that wisdom cannot be known, because that is God’s infinite wisdom, which cannot be understood. There, only faith exists: belief in God and belief that His infinite light surrounds all worlds.</small><br><small>Faith also has a tune. Even idolatrous faiths have their own tunes. The supernal faith which is higher than all wisdoms and beliefs, the faith in the light of the Infinite One Who surrounds all worlds, itself possesses a melody that is higher than any other tune in the world. All other tunes are drawn from this melody.</small><br><small>This melody is attained by the Tzaddik of the generation who corresponds to Moses, who is on the level of faith, the silence that transcends speech. With this melody, the Tzaddik on the level of Moses raises and liberates all the souls that fell into the heresy of the Vacated Space. For all other tunes — including those of heresy — are nullified and absorbed into his supernal melody.</small><br>God, “You Who do great things beyond comprehension and wonders without number,” Master of all, You transcend everything.

As a result of this holy silence, may all confusions and questions then fall away, and every foreign thought and phantasm — of blemished faith, of sexual and other desires, of ideas that disturb my prayer and Torah learning, and of any other evil, foreign thought, doubt or perplexity that blocks holiness — grow distant from me.

                "<i>The Field of Souls and the “Master of the Field” / Making a Unity of the Prayer Service / Seeing the Goal of Existence / One’s Troubles are Divine Favors/Joy Comes from the State of Self-Nullification / Creating New Torah Insights and Relieving Suffering</i><br><small>There is a field where beautiful “trees” and “grasses” grow. These trees and grasses are holy souls. There is also a “master of the field,” who involves himself in watering and tending these plants and seeing to their rectification. There are also other souls, naked souls, which wander about outside this field waiting to be rectified by the “master of the field” so they will be able to return to their places.</small><br><small>When the souls in the field bear fruit — that is, when they do God’s will—the master’s eyes are illumined. Then he can look at every individual and bring him to the ultimate goal of existence. In particular, he can look at every individual’s words of prayer and see whether or not they are properly rectified.</small><br><small>When a person recites the words of prayer, he is gathering beautiful flowers, like one who gathers blossoms to create a bouquet. He proceeds from letter to letter until a word is formed. Then he joins together two words, and then completes a blessing. He proceeds from the first blessing of the prayers to the second, and so forth.</small><br><small>But as soon as the very first letter emerges from his soul, it begs his soul not to part from it, pleading, “There is such a deep connection and love between us. You see my loveliness, radiance, glory and beauty. How can you leave me? It is true that you must go on to gather more blossoms. But how can you go away from me? At least see to it that wherever you go, you do not forget me.”</small><br><small>Similarly, when this person finishes an entire word, the word embraces him and does not want to let him leave. However, he is obligated to recite more words and blessings until he finishes the entire order of prayer. And so, in order to please the letters and words of prayer even as he fulfills his obligation, he must make a unity of the entire prayer. With every word that he speaks, all the other words must be present. He must turn his entire prayer, from beginning to end, into a single unity. When he reaches the last word of prayer, he should still be standing at the first word. In this way, he can recite the entire prayer without being separated from even the first word of prayer. This is a unity that reflects the ultimate goal, which is entirely one, entirely good.</small><br><small>A person suffers when his clear mindfulness is taken away from him and he cannot see that ultimate goal. When he wants to look at the goal, he must close his eyes to the desires and vanities of this world. Then he sees the light of that ultimate goal. He is nullified to the ultimate reality, and all his suffering is nullified as well.</small><br><small>Upon seeing the ultimate goal, this person realizes that all the troubles he experienced were not evils but great favors, for they came from God for his benefit, whether to remind him to repent or to erase his sins. Now, as he focuses on God’s intent, he is filled with joy, because he sees so much good in the ultimate meaning of his suffering. He sees that there is no evil in the world. Everything is one; everything is good.</small><br><small>But a person cannot remain in that state forever. Otherwise, he would no longer be a human being. So he must flit in and out of that state, “running and returning.”</small><br><small>When his mind returns from that state of self-nullification back to his normal consciousness, it cannot integrate the awareness of that transcendent reality, which is on the level of infinity, complete oneness, complete goodness. As a result, his suffering temporarily grows even worse.</small><br><small>Originally, his suffering led him to a state of self-nullification to the ultimate source. While he was in that state, he understood that his troubles are Divine favors and he was filled with joy. After he returns from that state of self-nullification, an after-impression remains. The joy remains with him and forms a vessel in which he can create new Torah insights. As he attains these new insights, he slakes the thirst of his soul and his suffering is mitigated.</small><br><small>And so, when a person’s suffering is followed by the creation of Torah insights, that is a sign that he attained a state of self-nullification to the ultimate reality, and that he has worked through his suffering and received it properly.</small><br>God — You Who are unique and alone, You Who were, are and will be — guide me to be absorbed into Your oneness.",

                "<i>A Tzaddik and His Students / Receiving a Double Spirit of One’s Teacher’s Greatness / Potentiality and Actuality / The Two Yods in the Divine Names / Transforming God’s Wrath into the Spirit of Messianic Times / Separating the “Hands” of Being / Perfecting Speech / Calling Out To God / Overcoming the Wicked / Attaining Truth / Praying without Ulterior Motives / Yearning to Perform a Mitzvah / Heightening Holy Desire / Overcoming Obstacles / Never Being Satisfied with Less than Doing God’s Will</i><br><small>A Tzaddik and his close students may be compared to a tree trunk and its branches. These close students feel all the Tzaddik’s ascents and descents, even when they are not in his presence. And at the time that he leaves this world, they can receive a double portion of his spirit. What makes that possible?</small><br><small>The Tzaddik possesses a supernal spirit and a lower spirit. Shortly before he dies, his supernal spirit comes down and unites with his lower spirit. This supernal spirit then rises, taking him and his lower spirit with it. Before it does so, however, it brings about a great supernal illumination affecting those present at his deathbed — especially his close students. Since they share the same spiritual root as he, his supernal spirit is theirs as well — and so, when it descends, they cling to it and can receive a double portion.</small><br><small>This concept of the supernal spirit and lower spirit appears in other contexts as well. Something not yet brought into being contains within itself potentiality and actuality in an as-yet undifferentiated state. When the potentiality blossoms into actuality, the two are separated and individuated.</small><br><small>This is alluded to by the shape of the Hebrew letter <i>aleph</i>, which is comprised of two <i>yods</i> separated by a <i>vav</i>. These two <i>yods</i> allude to the states of potentiality and actuality. One <i>yod</i>, representing potentiality, begins God’s Name, <I>YHVH</i> (the Tetragrammaton); the other <i>yod</i>, representing actuality, ends God’s Name, <i>Adonoy</i>. Initially, the two <i>yods</i> were blended. But as the universe went from potential to actual, they were separated by the <i>vav</i>, which represents a doorway, an opening.</small><br><small>Potentiality and actuality correspond to the supernal spirit and the lower spirit. These two spirits come into full being when we, through our service of God, mitigate His wrath, as it were, and transform it into the purified atmosphere, or spirit, of Messianic times. Then reality is fully realized, and everything that had been in potential is actualized. Related to that, our circumstances blossom as God sends down an abundance of income with a broad and generous hand.</small><br><small>Initially, this Messianic spirit preceded being. Then, as creation began, it was revealed on the level of “hands,” which relate to being — for hands are the organs of action. However, the hands were still blended and undifferentiated — that is, they had not been separated. Creation reaches its completion only when this potential is fully actualized. Then the hands separate and one can differentiate between right and left.</small><br><small>This dynamic of potentiality and actuality operates in the realms of human action as well.</small><br><small>In terms of wrong action, when a person thinks of sinning, his sin is in a state of potentiality. Should he commit the sin, he brings it into actuality.</small><br><small>In terms of the holy realm of right action, a person goes from potentiality to actuality by perfecting his speech, which is the bridge that links thought to action.</small><br><small>Speech is imperfect at present, since the world is not calling to God. But in the future, speech will be perfected so that even non-Jews will call out in God’s Name. Related to that, all people will recognize the greatness and beauty of Tzaddikim and worthy people. This will also be a time of great judgment regarding each individual’s every action — for God forgets nothing — and the difference between the righteous and wicked will grow clear. At that time, the wicked will be cast down.</small><br><small>This level of Messianic times must be drawn into our present world, so that the wicked will experience a downfall now, as well. This occurs when speech is perfected and all call out in God’s Name.</small><br><small>To perfect speech, we must attain truth. A person attains truth by not being dependent on others. When a person needs others, he is apt to act in a false, sycophantic manner. Particularly when he prays in public — that is, as he expresses himself to God in speech — he may find himself acting in ways designed to impress others. Even if he doesn’t need others for his income, he may need them for honor and the like.</small><br><small>Sometimes, even if he wants to pray earnestly, he finds himself trying to please those around him. He may rationalize his behavior, but by doing so, he gilds falsehood with truth.</small><br><small>When a person is not dependent on others, however, he is linked directly to truth. Then the Messianic perfection of the letters of speech is drawn into this world.</small><br><small>But it is not enough for the letters of speech to be perfected. A person must also express them. Sometimes, these letters of speech are stuck in his throat; to express them, he needs vowels. (In Hebrew, only consonants have letters; vowels are added with other symbols.) This allows the letters to proceed from potentiality to actuality.</small><br><small>A person draws vowels to speech when he yearns to perform a mitzvah. One cannot do anything without desire, so before a person performs a holy deed, he is given the desire to do so. Desire is heightened when an obstacle is put in his way. When a Jew must work on improving his Jewishness, particularly when he must do something great and essential, such as going to a true Tzaddik, he is faced with obstacles. These obstacles are meant to increase his desire. The greater the desired object, the greater the desire.</small><br><small>A person should not content himself with the argument that since he wants to do something but cannot, God considers it as though he did it. That argument is true. But if a person really wants to do the mitzvah, it is no consolation to him that God considers it as though he did it. Instead, he will make an effort to overcome the obstacles, which were created solely to intensify his desire.</small><br>God of all spirits, Ruler of Heavenly and earthly beings, You Who hold the souls of the living and the dead, You “Whose hand holds the spirit of every living creature and the breath of every human being,” help me to draw down onto myself a spirit of the true life of holiness from the true Tzaddikim, who comprise our very lives.",

                "<i>The Root of All Souls / Receiving Honor in This World with Holiness / Eating Properly / Insolent Leaders / Giving Charity / Overcoming Spiritual Enemies / Giving Birth to and Bringing Up Honor / Helping an Elder Who Has Forgotten His Torah Learning</i><br><small>A person’s soul comes from a realm called “honor.” The dynamic of that realm appears on all levels of existence — including the expression of honor as we know it.<br>When a person receives honor in this world, it is for one of two reasons. First, he might be about to die, and so honor has come to gather in his soul. Usually, however, this is not the case, since the universe functions on the principle that overall, good prevails. Thus, it is more likely that this honor is coming to bring this person to a new, higher level of soul. In either case, he must receive that honor with holiness — that is to say, solely for the sake of God.<br>When a person eats improperly, he can lose a<br>measure of honor. The reason for this is as follows.<br>When a person eats properly — that is to say, when he has broken his lust for eating — he attains an elevated countenance. The table on which he eats stands before God and it, too, has a countenance of holiness. But if this person has a lust for food, his honor is damaged and consequently lacks a countenance of holiness. When honor is damaged, it falls to a level where insolent people can reach it and use it to gain power in the form of sovereignty without a crown. When these people gain honor, they become the leaders of the generation.<br>The word <i>tzedek</i> (strict judgment) is related to the phenomenon of insolent people receiving honor.<br>The first letter in the word <i>tzedek</i> is a <i>tzadi</i>. This letter is a combination of two letters: <i>yod</i> and <i>nun</i>, so arranged that the <i>yod</i> is turned away from the <i>nun</i>. The <i>yod</i> corresponds to the countenance of holiness. It turns away because at present it is hidden. The <i>nun</i> represents sovereignty.<br>The second letter in the word <i>tzedek</i> is <i>dalet</i>. The word <i>dal</i> means “poor,” and so the <i>dalet</i> corresponds to an impoverished honor, one that falls to the Side of Evil.<br>In that realm, insolent people imitate good people, like a monkey imitating a human being. The Hebrew word for monkey is <i>kof</i>. This is also the name of the last letter in the word <i>tzedek</i>, which is <i>kuf</i>. Just as the letter <i>kuf</i> has a long, descending leg, so too, the “feet” of honor now descend to death.<br>Therefore, at present, when good Jews wish to protect the Jewish religion against attack, they must descend spiritually and seek the help of the gentile authorities.<br>A person raises honor and sovereignty from insolent people when he gives charity — which, states the verse, “saves from death.” Then the word <i>tzedek</i> has the letter <i>hei</i> added to it. The letter <i>hei</i> has the numerical value of five, corresponding to the five times that the word <i>tzedakah</i> (charity) is mentioned in the Torah. This added <i>hei</i> turns <i>tzedek</i> into <i>tzedekah</i>. Then its feet are raised from death.<br>The person who eats properly or gives charity and thus restores honor is a wise person. Unfortunately, demonic enemies cluster about him in order to derive energy from him. But this can actually help him, because these enemies siphon off his unholy consciousness, leaving him with a pure and holy consciousness.<br>As mentioned above, usually when a person receives a new measure of honor, that serves as a container for a holy soul that he about to receive. That honor is comparable to a pregnant woman, and the new soul to the fetus within her. A person must make sure to give this soul an easy birth. Should the birth be difficult, both the mother (honor) and child (soul) may die, and then the person himself will die. And once the soul is born, the person must raise it as one raises a child.<br>A person facilitates the birth of this soul, as well as the growth of holy honor and God’s sovereignty, by giving charity. In regard to this latter point, it is the custom to give charity at the section in the prayers that states, “You are sovereign over all.”<br>When a person’s “honor” is dislocated from his soul, he may forget his wisdom and Torah learning, or he may grow weary. Sometimes an elder forgets his Torah learning because he has prayed without the intent of his heart. Prayer corresponds to honor, and the heart to the soul. Now that they are separated, the elder loses his wisdom. Similarly, it may be that a younger person has prayed without feeling, as a result of which his soul is far from its “mother,” honor. Consequently, his soul grows weary. To rectify this, he must give honor to the elder who forgot his Torah learning. By giving honor to that elder, he revitalizes his own soul. This is because he creates “thunder,” which causes “cool water” to revive and heal his soul.<br>This idea is based on the following understanding of how thunder works. Hot vapor enters a cloud and explodes. That tears open the cloud in a burst of thunder. And as that thunder rips open the cloud, it causes the cloud to distribute rain wherever it is needed.<br>The elder’s forgetting Torah is comparable to a cloud. Just as a cloud obscures the sun, so too, his forgetfulness obscures his ability to see — i.e., to access his knowledge. The honor that someone gives him is comparable to hot vapor entering a cloud. Then the elder’s mind and memory are restored. This is comparable to the cloud tearing open with a clap of thunder. Now the old man’s knowledge is distributed to everyone who needs it. This is comparable to the rain falling out of the cloud. When that “cool water” reaches the younger person who had prayed without the intent of his heart, it revives and rectifies his soul. It revives his bones that had previously been blemished. Then he can pray with all his bones.<br>The same effect is brought about when a person hears Torah from a true Tzaddik, in contrast to learning Torah from a book. When one learns from a book, he does not know how much to learn in order to revive his soul. But when he hears Torah from the Tzaddik, the Tzaddik gives him exactly the amount of Torah — or “cool water” — that he needs.</small><br><b>The Precious Souls of the Jewish People</b><br><b>“M</b>ay my soul be precious in Your eyes.”",

But because money grows coarse after it descends, a person should desire only the source from which money comes.<br>Even in this-worldly terms, it would be fitting that all Jews have money. However, there is a character trait that a person possesses from childhood and onward that keeps money away from him. This trait is difficult to overcome, even if he intends to do so in order to attain money. This trait is anger, which also comes from the same source as money and the soul.<br>When the Side of Evil sees that a person is due to receive money, it entices him to grow angry, and that prevents him from receiving money. <i>CheiMaH</i> (anger) destroys the <i>ChoMaH</i> (wall) that had been protecting him spiritually. Even if a person is already receiving an abundance of money, when he gets very angry, he may lose it.<br>When a male child enters the world, he is assigned his wife-to-be, the amount of money he will attain, and the children he will father.<br>These are analogous to three parts of a tree. His wife is the tree trunk, his money the branches, and his children the fruits. Also, his <i>nefesh</i> — the feminine portion of his soul — is associated with his wife, and thus with the tree trunk.<br>When a thief robs his victim, he steals the branches of his victim’s tree. If the victim’s children (who are compared to the fruits) still need to be nurtured by their mother (who corresponds to the tree trunk), they might die. If the victim does not yet have children, he may remain childless.<br>Also, when the thief robs his victim, he comes to desire the victim’s wife. This is because he wants everything that is associated with his victim’s soul. If the thief is married, he may lose his own wife. He may reject his wife and take his victim’s wife, or he may try to possess them both. If the thief is unmarried, he may lose the woman who had been destined to be his wife. In addition, once a psychic link is established between the thief and his victim’s wife, she may feel attracted to him.<br>Sometimes the victim’s soul constricts its light in order to keep the thief from attacking it. In that case, the thief cannot harm his victim’s children or his soul. Then, even if the thief does rob his victim, the money that he takes is spiritually not considered to be money, but dust.<br>Even coveting someone else’s property can deprive the victim of his money and children. The covetous person can rectify that by giving charity, and he may then keep the money that he gained as a result of his covetousness. (However, in case of literal thievery, a person must return what he stole.)<br>If someone has no money, it is because evil “husks” surround his soul and reduce its light. By giving charity, a person retrieves his soul from these husks.<br>When a person’s mind is spiritually obscured, he desires money. Because his mind is unclear, his enemies gain strength. Sometimes such a person loves money so much and so foolishly that he acquires enemies who hate him for no reason at all. A wise person, however, shares the wealth of his wisdom with others in order to bring them close to God.</small><br><b>The Grave Sin of Anger</b><br>HaShem, my God and God of my fathers, protect me always from the grave sin of anger.",

But although everyone wants that Great Compassion and it stands before everyone’s eyes, no one knows where it is, no one can pray and draw it down, because — due to our oppressive exile — no one recognizes God’s greatness. Therefore, God Himself must pray for this. And what brings Him to pray? Our repentance, which we attain by learning Torah.<br>The mechanism behind this is as follows.<br>Every person possesses a portion of the spiritual worlds in the form of holy “letters” and permutations of holy energies. One connects these to whatever he chooses to cling to. If he pursues base desires, he connects them to the Side of Evil. Then the holy letters and permutations of holy energies are confused, and consequently, his mind is confused. That constitutes the exile of God’s Divine Presence. Then, because one lacks proper awareness, he lacks access to God’s Great Compassion.<br>This person must study Torah, proceeding through three phases.<br>First, when he sits down to learn, he brings all of his thoughts and consciousness into the Torah so that he is contained within in it like a fetus in its mother’s womb. Second, he learns Torah and comes to understand it — that is called birth and nursing. And third, he infers one matter from another and creates original insights — that is the level of independent intelligence.<br>When this person proceeds through these three phases of learning Torah, he attains complete repentance. He now restores the holy letters and permutations of holy energies to their root. In doing so, he becomes a new person. His awareness is whole and, as a result, God has compassion on him.<br>Now God prays on his behalf. That means that God’s Simple Compassion awakens His Great Compassion.<br>This may be conceptualized as follows. A certain person is in need of a great deal of charity. There are two philanthropists in his community. One is accessible, but does not have enough money to help him. The other does have enough money to help him, but is accessible only to the first philanthropist. The person therefore asks the first philanthropist to petition the wealthier philanthropist on his behalf.<br>In the same way, we ask God to arouse His Simple Compassion on our behalf so that it will draw down His Great Compassion.</small><br><b>Learning Torah</b><br>HaShem, our God and God of our fathers, help us learn Your holy Torah always, day and night.

God then brought down the souls of the Jewish people so that they might draw that sovereignty to themselves.<br>Today, however, the Divine Presence is in exile, and so the light and power of God’s sovereignty are diminished.<br>However, there is a positive aspect to this. Because God loves the Jewish people, His Presence — or holy speech — accompanies each individual Jew even into the filthiest place, like a mother accompanying her child wherever he goes. And so no matter how low a person falls, with holy speech, he can recall God and take strength in Him.<br>One way that a person can return to God through speech is to confess his sins to Him. Also, one can rectify the realm of speech by learning Torah, reciting the words of the prayer service, and engaging in his own prayers to God.<br>When a person learns Torah or prays, he clothes his body in the holy letters of Torah and prayer. As a result, he protects his body from the fire of his heart — whether that fire is for the sake of holiness or for the sake of the things of this world.<br>God Himself is at present “clothed” within the worlds that He created.

In other words, he must repent.<br>There are two types of repentance. The first kind is temporary. A person engages in business and the vanities of this world and, in the midst of that, he thinks of repenting — but then he returns to his original ways. He may flip back and forth repeatedly in this manner — between life and death, kosher and non-kosher, clean and unclean, forbidden and permitted. This type of repentance corresponds to the six days of the week.<br>The second type of repentance is permanent. In this case, evil is entirely expelled. This type of repentance corresponds to the Shabbat, and is associated with the level of Moses and Mashiach. Thus, Moses carried the staff of God in his hand, with which he transformed reality from evil to good. <br>On the Shabbat, a Tzaddik repents completely and then he can see how small he is and how great the Jewish people are. That is why every true Tzaddik — principally Moses — dedicates himself to helping the Jewish people.<br>When a person sees his lowliness, no one can deprive him of his livelihood by attempting to remove him from his place.

For example, he might have forgotten the sins that he committed, or he might find confession too upsetting. To engage in confession successfully, a person must experience joy — particularly the joy of performing a mitzvah, especially a mitzvah whose joyous aspect is paramount, such as getting married.<br>Joy is a structure that possesses its own anatomy of 248 limbs and 365 sinews (corresponding to the anatomy of the person feeling that joy). Every mitzvah possesses a limb of that anatomy. If a person transgressed against a particular mitzvah, he damaged it. Later, as he rejoices and proceeds through the anatomy of joy, when he comes to a limb that corresponds to the damaged mitzvah, his joy ceases and, to the contrary, turns to its opposite, which is worry.<br>To succeed in experiencing the entire structure of joy, a person must perform a great many mitzvot. The great joy of these mitzvot shines so brightly that it eradicates the obstacles that were created by his sins. This can even be experienced by a Jewish sinner — because, our sages state, even Jewish sinners are filled with mitzvot.<br>The blemishes of this person’s sins had affected his soul, which is associated with speech.

He then engages in good deeds, which kills his evil inclination. As he becomes a good and pious person, he wants to grow more spiritual — particularly by traveling to a Tzaddik.<br>But as he makes his way to the Tzaddik and reaches him, he loses his original urge to connect to the Tzaddik. Why does this happen?

In order to keep from losing his initial, idealistic urge, a person must overcome this new evil inclination.<br>Regarding the concept of a “greater” evil inclination, most people are low and coarse, and their evil attribute of judgment, but then He broke His attribute of judgment and partnered it with the attribute of compassion. God’s attribute of judgment corresponds to the evil inclination. Just as God created the dynamic of breaking His judgment, so too, a person can break his evil inclination.<br>If someone is experiencing troubles, it indicates that he is the subject of Heavenly judgment, which is associated with the evil inclination. In order to put an end to his troubles, he must do whatever he can to overcome his evil inclination, which will result in the eradication of Heavenly judgments against him.<br>A person who wants to be God-fearing and untroubled by bad thoughts should ignore such thoughts and instead learn Torah, pray, and engage in earning a living. He should not allow himself to fall prey to depression, which is harmful and strengthens the coarse evil inclination. Should he have idolatrous or lustful thoughts that he cannot get out of his mind, he must seek to purify his body and blood, and go to a wise man who will tell him how to repent.<br>Sometimes a person experiences an overwhelming passion and desire for God.

These correspond to the first three years that a fruit tree grows, when its fruit is forbidden and is called <i>orlah</i> (literally, “foreskin”).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Leviticus 19:23.</i> All of the insults that a person suffers come from these three “husks,” or <i>orlah</i>. There is a fourth “husk” called <i>nogah</i>, which is sometimes absorbed into the impure “husks” and at other times into holiness. This corresponds to the fruit of a tree in its fourth year, which may be eaten after it is sanctified.<br>In his description of one of his Heavenly visions, the prophet Ezekiel refers to an energy called <i>chashmal</i>. A person is absorbed into the holy energy of <i>chashmal</i> when he ignores the insults that come from the realm of <i>orlah</i> and remains silent. The first syllable of the word <i>chashmal</i>, “<i>chash</i>,” means “silence.” The person is silent out of love, because he does not want to insult another person. Then <i>nogah</i> is absorbed into holiness.<br>Conversely, if a person stays silent because he knows that doing so will upset his opponent, his silence is absorbed into the realm of <i>orlah</i>, of disgrace and insult.<br>The second syllable in the word <i>chashmal</i>, “<i>mal</i>,” has the numerical value of seventy. In addition, it is related to the word <i>milah</i> (circumcision). This indicates that at times <i>nogah</i> is absorbed into the seventy lights of holiness, into the state of rectified sexuality and circumcision.<br>On Friday afternoon, prior to the coming of the Shabbat, <i>nogah</i> is absorbed into holiness. At that time, the three impure “husks” attempt to rise and grasp holiness, but a fire of God descends and burns them away. Corresponding to that, at this time we bathe in hot water.

But this teaching can be interpreted to refer to a Jew as well. If, while a person is reciting the set prayers or engaging in his own prayers to God, he falls spiritually, that is the equivalent of having the “thoughts of a gentile.”<br>That person experienced this descent because his faith is damaged. This caused him to turn his face away from God, and then God correspondingly turned His face away from him. As a result, he and God now stand back to back. When this happens, a person must break his spirit so that he feels shame and regrets having fallen from Heaven to earth.<br>In doing so, he cuts himself away from his backto- back relationship with God.

                "<i>To Overcome Dispute, a Person Must Fast or Give Charity / Reviving the Dead Days of One’s Past</i><br><small>When people attempt to prevent an individual from carrying out his purpose — whether in the material or spiritual realms — he is unable to pray properly or otherwise serve God. In order to nullify that dispute and make peace, he must fast (or engage in its equivalent, which is giving charity). The reason is as follows.<br>A person’s heart is filled with many disparate drives. When he fasts, he subjugates and weakens his heart. As a result, all of his desires are nullified before the will of God and, consequently, his heart clings to God. When that happens, the will of others is nullified before his, in keeping with our sages’ dictum, “Nullify your will before His will, so that He will nullify the will of others before your will.”<br>Also, when a person fasts, that revives his former days that lacked life. Each day receives two influxes of energy. First, as an independent entity, it has its own life force. In addition, it receives a flow of energy from Above. When a person performs mitzvot and good deeds, the flow of energy from Above to that day is abundant and generous. But when he does not perform mitzvot and good deeds, the flow of energy from Above to that day is reduced. Furthermore, if he engages in evil, he deprives the day on which he does so of both sources of energy — the flow of energy from Above and its own life force. As a result, such a day is a lifeless corpse.<br>Fasting revives these dead days. The reason for this may be explained as follows. When a person fasts, he receives no life force from that day. Instead, he makes use of the energy of the previous day. Should he fast more, he makes use of the energy of previous days until, ultimately, he reaches all the way back to the beginning of his life. At the same time, as this person fasts, he conveys the Divine life force and power of mitzvot to the lifeless days of his past, until he revives and illumines them all. And since that life force comprises a structure of joy, he brings joy into his life.</small><br><b>God Desires Our Repentance</b><br>HaShem, God of truth, You Who are unique and preceded all existence, You Who devise thoughts so that no one will remain exiled from You, You Who are good and do good to all, You Who gaze upon the wicked person with the desire that he will become righteous, You Who proclaim the generations from the beginning, You Who desire repentance — for the sake of Your Name and for the sake of our holy fathers, restore us to You in complete repentance.",

This faith must be so complete and clear that when the person believes in something, it is as though he sees it before his eyes.<br>Every story that tells how a Tzaddik performed a miracle can be matched by a story of how a wicked person performed a wonder. A person must be able to discern the difference between them — namely, that the Tzaddik performed a miracle with prayer, whereas the wicked person performed a wonder with trickery, magic or some other power derived from the Side of Evil.<br>What does telling stories about Tzaddikim accomplish?<br>When a person’s mind is confused and his awareness diminished, it is associated with judgments, and so he experiences troubles. But stories of Tzaddikim are associated with expanded awareness. And so when a person tells (or hears) these stories, his mind is cleansed and he is saved from his troubles.<br>As one tells stories about Tzaddikim, he purifies his thought, which enables him to go beyond words and attain an internal silence. Every story about a Tzaddik is at first a constriction from the world of thought into the world of speech. But as a person tells a story, his speech rises and returns to the world of thought.<br>One must know the proper way to tell these stories in order to clarify and purify his thoughts. He must also know about whom to tell. The Tzaddik whom he tells about must be greater than he, so that these stories can uplift him.<br>Ultimately, to tell these stories properly, a person must gain access to Divine Providence — which is to say, he must leave his nature-bound state. Doing so constitutes the totality of holiness. He can attain this by connecting himself to the Land of Israel, which is also the totality of holiness, and which is therefore under Divine Providence.</small><br><b>HaShem’s Wonders and His Wonder-Workers</b><br><b>“G</b>reat are the deeds of HaShem, accessible to all those who desire them.” “How abundant are Your works, HaShem, You made all of them with wisdom; the world is filled with Your possessions.” “How great are Your deeds, HaShem; how very deep are Your thoughts.”",

Only a person who knows how to differentiate between light and darkness can differentiate between such stories.",

                "May we recognize that the difference between the deeds of those people and the deeds and wonders of the true Tzaddikim is as stark as the difference between light and darkness.

Rather, he should judge them positively and do them favors. In this way, he makes himself like the earth. Everyone tramples on the earth, yet it generously provides all good things: fruits and vegetables, gold, silver and precious stones.<br>His opponents may be compared to people attempting to breach someone’s house by digging a tunnel under it. If he digs back, the intruders will get in more easily. But if he shovels dirt into the tunnel, he will overcome them.<br>Sometimes righteous people attack a person. Their intent is only for the good. By attacking him, they are lifting him up and sweetening judgments against him in a secret, hidden way. They may be compared to people digging a tunnel under someone’s house so that they can secretly throw in a gift. When righteous people engage in dispute against a person and judgments against him are sweetened at their root, then he blossoms.<br>*<br>The earth yields medicinal herbs. Medicinal herbs that are picked in the springtime are the most powerful. Herbs picked at other times of the year lack the same efficacy.<br>The power of these herbs is ultimately derived from the Land of Israel, which is the principal land, from whose essence all other lands receive their power. The Land of Israel has two levels, called “land of Canaan” and, simply, “land.” In a time of dispute, it is called the “land of Canaan.” The word <i>KaNa’AN</i> (“Canaan”) may be read as <i>KaN ONi</i> (“Here is a poor person”). Dispute deprives people of their livelihood. Moreover, during a time of dispute, the medicinal herbs cannot derive power from the Land of Israel, and so they lack efficacy.<br>When there is peace, however, the Land of Israel is called “land.” At that time it gives its power to all the produce of the world, including medicinal herbs.<br>*<br>The Shabbat meals are the essence of the Shabbat. They are very precious, entirely holy and Godly. <br>A person cannot entirely avoid desecrating the Shabbat. Eating the Shabbat meals rectifies that desecration. The mechanism behind this works as follows.</small><br><small>The Shabbat is compared to a man’s first wife. The desecration of the Shabbat constitutes, in a sense, the death of this first wife. And our sages teach that “when a man’s first wife dies, his steps are shortened” (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 22a).<br>Thus, it would seem that honoring the Shabbat should be associated with long steps. But, to the contrary, our sages teach that a person should not take long steps on the Shabbat (<i>Shabbat</i> 113b).<br>The answer to this apparent contradiction is as follows.<br>Every mitzvah is a complete structure. On a weekday, the “feet” of a mitzvah descend into the realm of the “husks” of evil. Therefore, when a person performs a mitzvah on a weekday, the Side of Evil derives benefit from its “feet.”<br>On the Shabbat, however, the “feet” of the mitzvah rise from the “husks” to the realm of holiness, and so the Side of Evil cannot derive any benefit from a person’s mitzvah. Then this mitzvah proceeds before HaShem hesitantly and uncertainly, like a toddler beginning to walk. Although this toddler cannot yet walk well, his father lovingly helps him, praising and encouraging his every accomplishment. So too, when this mitzvah begins to “walk,” HaShem supports it and ultimately lengthens its steps.</small><br><small>And this is connected to the mitzvah of eating the Shabbat meals, for eating the Shabbat meals gives power specifically to the “feet.” Thus, our eating the Shabbat meals rectifies these initial, small steps. And so, corresponding to the process of rectifying the “steps” of the mitzvot on the Shabbat, we take small steps when we walk on the Shabbat.</small> <br><b>Judging Everyone Favorably</b><br><b>“M</b>y God, guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking deceit.

If a person suffers a lack of faith, that damages everything in his life. Such damage can be repaired only by his restored faith.<br>To attain faith, a person must draw counsel from the depths of darkness, to which end he requires the assistance of a holy man of understanding. A person should strive to be among the students of such a Tzaddik, in whose company he should strive to gather and rectify all of the elements of faith.<br>In general, a person must seek the holy words of the true Tzaddikim who revive all souls, from the greatest to the smallest. These Tzaddikim have composed many holy books filled with counsel and inspiration on how to serve God.<br>*<br>God can cause plants to grow and to be picked at the proper time so that they will have the power to heal Jews’ diseases. When a person possesses a simple wholeheartedness, he receives exactly what he needs in order to be healed.<br>*<br>Some gentiles become converts in potential, others in actuality. Ultimately, all people will know of God and will yearn for true faith. Everyone will come to serve God and recognize the power of His sovereignty. Many gentiles will become Jews for the sake of God’s great Name.<br>However, pollution taints converts, and that causes blemishes. The righteous converts must purify themselves of that pollution, even as Jews ask God to rescue them from those blemishes.<br>*<br>Each Jew must strive to be rescued from the sword of egotism of the false leaders of the generation, who rule over the impoverished nation by usurping rabbinical authority.<br>*<br>A person must nullify his bad desires — particularly the lust for sexual wrongdoing. He must pray that he will never experience a nocturnal emission. Because such an emission comes as a result of depression and bitterness, he must strive to strengthen himself with joy.<br>When judges and rabbis are corrupt and pervert justice, holy types of love fall and inject sexual impropriety into the world. This results in the uncleanness of nocturnal emissions. When a person recites the description of the binding of the Chariot before going to sleep,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The binding of the Chariot refers to the “Chariot of God” which is surrounded by four angels — Michael, Gabriel, Uriel and Raphael — and upon which “rests” the <i>Shekhinah</i>, the Divine Presence of God. It is customary to recite the binding of the Chariot during the Bedtime Shema.</i> he can attain a rectification of judgment.<br>One must strive to nullify the lust for sexual impropriety and, more generally, rectify the “seals of purity” in the merit and power of Moses, the Seven Shepherds,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Seven Shepherds are Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, Joseph and David.</i> and all true Tzaddikim. That is related to attaining the holiness of tefilin, which constitute the seal of truth.<br>As a person waters his heart with holiness, he extinguishes the heat of the heart that burns for evil lusts — particularly the lust for sexual wrongdoing.<br>Beyond that, he should not accustom himself to indulge in sexual desire even when it is permitted, and he should sanctify himself when engaging in marital relations. He must guard the moisture and fluids in his body, not expending them through this desire, so that they can rise to strengthen and renew his mind.<br>*<br>Even in holiness, a person should not seek that which is beyond him. Instead, he should gaze only at what he is permitted to. He should draw onto himself the holy constriction appropriate for his mind, so that it will not be destroyed by going beyond its limits.<br>*<br>One should avoid evil musings and worthless dreams, which come about by means of a demon.<br>By sanctifying his power of imagination, he rises from the animal realm to the human realm. By incorporating the power of his imagination into the power of his holy awareness, then, when his mind is quiescent during sleep, the power of his imagination and the residue of the consciousness of holiness will be on the level of an angel. <br>He should strive to draw the image of God onto himself, until he attains dreams by means of an angel, dreams that are good and straight, holy and pure. In such a dream, he sees the light of the face of the true Tzaddikim and he hears them speak words of God without any admixture of falsehood.<br>Then, when he awakens, he should strive to remember everything that he saw and heard in his dream.<br>*<br>When a person eats in holiness and purity, solely for the sake of maintaining his soul as well as his body, new comprehensions are drawn onto him, until he has the power to draw up the deep water of good counsel from which holy faith grows. In addition, he strengthens the angels, which bring him abundance and good income. Such angels do not allow the Side of Evil to siphon off energy from the abundant flow that is drawn onto it. The Side of Evil can take, at most, a minimal amount to provide it with a constricted life force.<br>*<br>A person should draw the holiness and joy of the month of Nisan onto himself. He should then strive to draw that onto the entire year. This strengthens the holy angels, bringing them laughter, might and gladness.<br>The mitzvot and good deeds that a person engages in throughout the year are, as it were, delicacies that God tastes on Rosh HaShanah.<br>On that day, a person should strive to hear the shofar from a worthy shofar-blower.<br>In the merit of the <i>tekiah</i>, he should draw onto himself holy wisdom, understanding and knowledge.<br>In the merit of the <i>teruah</i>, he should draw onto himself the holiness of the true shepherd of Israel and the holiness of the covenant.<br>And in the merit of the <i>shevarim</i>, he should attain true dreams that come by means of the holy angel and attain the rectification of judgment.<br>During the Ten Days of Repentance, a person should continue to rectify all of the blemishes that he caused throughout the previous year — particularly those of the covenant. He must ask God to help him find everything that he lost throughout his life and help him purify and sanctify himself.<br>On Sukkot, he should strive in the merit of the mitzvah of sukkah to rectify and strengthen the holy angel and attain a dream by means of an angel, and to eat pure, unadulterated foods.<br>In the merit of the holiness of Shemini Atzeret, he should strive to rectify the judgment of holiness, and in this way be rescued from the blemish of the covenant.<br>For the sake of God, a person should be willing to engage in behavior that appears mad to others. He should cast himself into all kinds of trash for the sake of God’s commandments.<br>*<br>A person should draw upon himself the holiness of the lungs from their supernal root, so that they will not suffer from any blemish, whether physical or spiritual.</small><br><b>The Waters of Counsel That Heal Blemished Faith</b><br>“From the depths have I called to You, HaShem.

Moreover, he must know how to implement his compassion properly. For instance, just as a parent must refrain from feeding an infant adult food, so too, a compassionate leader must refrain from granting wicked people inappropriate kindness.<br>The souls of the Jewish people originate in a sublime source. As such, they are extraordinarily spiritual and refined, and are in essence entirely removed from sin.<br>A Jew sins only when a spirit of foolishness enters into him. That is the most pitiable state that he can find himself. Compared to that, any other suffering is as nothing.<br>A Torah leader must have compassion on such a person and fill him with proper spiritual awareness. In doing so, the leader relieves him of the heavy burden of his sins.<br>Moses was a uniquely compassionate Torah leader, dedicating himself to helping the Jewish people even at the risk of his own well-being. He opened the light of consciousness for the Jews. In doing so, he worked to create a civilized world, because the essence of a human being is his consciousness. A person who lacks that is uncivilized — in fact, he is not even considered a human being, but an animal in human form.<br>*<br>In our world, people can be divided into two groups: those who are above (compared to a “son”) and those who are below (compared to a “student”). The Tzaddik must guide both of them.<br>Those people who are above are on a high spiritual level. The Tzaddik must show them that ultimately, they know nothing of God, and he must challenge them to consider, “Where is the place of His glory?”<br>Those who are below are on a low spiritual level. The Tzaddik must show them that they can still hope to return to God, because “the whole earth is filled with His glory.”<br>In addition, these two types must be combined. The “son” must partake of something of the “student,” and the “student” must partake of something of the “son.” This is necessary so that both will possess the fear of God.<br>If a person on a high level only experiences his distance from God, he might feel too far to fear God. Therefore, he must be given something of the awareness of the person on a low level: that God’s glory fills the earth — i.e., that God is close to him.<br>And if a person on a low level only experiences how the world is filled with God’s glory, he might lose all sense of self and thus be unable to fear God. Therefore, he must be given something of the awareness of the person on a high level — a measure of distance from God — so that he will continue to be self-aware and he will be capable of fearing God.<br>*<br>Everyone can be a teacher. For instance, when two people discuss religious matters and one inspires the other, he is the teacher to the other. That kind of discussion civilizes the world and fills it with true human beings.<br>The act of teaching also expands the awareness of the teacher. A concept just beyond a person’s comprehension hovers outside his mind. When he acts as a teacher and transfers his wisdom and awareness to someone else, he creates a space in his own mind into which that hovering awareness can enter.<br>Thus, as soon as a teacher reveals one concept, a new awareness enters his mind. This process can occur repeatedly. This obligates him to be careful about what he reveals, because ultimately, he may be open to receiving an awareness of transcendent concepts beyond time — meaning, concepts that time would not suffice to explain. That is something that would leave him in a state of confusion, and so it is something he must avoid.<br>As for the sage and rabbi of the generation, the transcendent awareness that hovers around him is on the level of “length of days and years,” the World to Come, which is “a day that is entirely long,” transcending time. All of the time of this world is nothing compared to even a single moment of the World to Come. There, time is expressed as transcendent states of awareness. Attaining these states constitutes the essential delight of the World to Come: the knowledge of the unknown, the ultimate good hidden from all eyes. When the sage speaks with his students and fills them with his awareness, these transcendent states of awareness enter into him.<br>There are states of transcendent awareness that cannot be put into words. These are called “hands” because, like gesturing hands, they can communicate only hints. They bring these hints down to a level where God’s sovereign providence is revealed.<br>Along with the influx of hints comes an influx of abundance, including monetary wealth.<br>Having income is related to eating, since the principal purpose of work is to obtain food. When the levels of “son” and “student” combine, when a spiritually powerful person eats, he can experience an illumination of God’s will so that he will yearn for God without even knowing what he wants.<br>The Temple (which combined the dynamics of the “son” and the “student”) also brought down monetary blessing. Thus, it contained a huge basin called the “Sea of Solomon,” which is associated with the revelation of God’s sovereign providence.<br>In the days that the Temple existed, we were free of the burden of sin. The daily morning offering atoned for sins of the previous night, and the daily afternoon offering atoned for the sins of the previous day. But now that the Temple has been destroyed, we cannot adequately cleanse ourselves of our sins.<br>In the days of Moses, the sin of the spies<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Numbers 13:1-14:39.</i> foreshadowed the destruction of the Temple. In that instance, Moses begged God to “please forgive the sin of this nation.” God acceded to his request, and that constituted the eventual re-inauguration of the Temple — as commemorated by Chanukah.<br>Similarly, when an individual is successful in his request for forgiveness (on Yom Kippur), that leads to a spiritually successful Chanukah, which corresponds to the re-inauguration of the Temple.<br>It is good for a person’s soul to rise and cling to its place in the upper worlds. That is what happens when a person dies. But that does not constitute his ultimate perfection. The soul attains perfection only when it exists both above and below.<br>In order to achieve that, a person must leave behind a blessing in this world. He does this in the form of sharing his awareness with a son or a student, who remains here below even as this person’s soul rises upward. In that sense, the person still exists in this world.<br>All of the above concepts apply to the well-being of the lungs. When the lungs are in proper balance, they are composed of these levels of “son” and “student.”</small><br><b>Send Us a Compassionate Leader</b><br>“Your compassion is abundant, HaShem.

                "<small><i>Proper Rebuke Elicits a Person’s Spiritual Fragrance / Proper Awareness Shields a Person Against Lust / A Spiritually Powerful Person Causes the Side of Evil to Disgorge Holiness / We Must Seek a Teacher Who Possesses Something of the Power of Prophecy / Prophecy Purifies the Imagination, Making Faith Possible</i><br>Rebuke is a wonderful thing. When a Jew sees that someone else is behaving improperly, he is obligated to correct him.<br>However, not everyone is capable of delivering rebuke properly. In such cases, the rebuke will not help. To the contrary, it will be harmful. A person’s evil deeds and traits exude a foul odor, and improper rebuke intensifies that odor. That weakens the soul of the wrongdoer. Worlds depend on a person’s soul. When his soul weakens, those worlds cease to receive their sustenance.<br>But when a person gives rebuke in a worthy fashion, he grants the soul of the person receiving his rebuke a pleasant fragrance. That fragrance constitutes the soul’s food and sustenance. Such a rebuke corresponds to Moses’ rebuke of the Jewish people after the sin of the golden calf, which granted them a pleasant fragrance.<br>The voice of proper rebuke corresponds to the river that emerged from Eden to water the Garden of Eden (Genesis 2:10). This garden is the realm where pleasant fragrances and the fear of God grow.<br>The voice of proper rebuke corresponds to the melody of messianic times, a fourfold melody that will remake the world. When a person delivers proper rebuke, he draws down threads of kindness. These threads combine to create the seventy-two strings of the musical instrument that will play this fourfold song.<br>A person attains that voice — the ability to deliver proper rebuke — when he prays for God’s compassion. That compassion is associated with an expanded awareness.<br>Until then, at times the Side of Evil diverts the energy of compassion to itself so that God’s compassion to us is diminished. Then, even the little compassion that does remain is degraded and tainted by the dynamic of cruelty.<br>And when proper awareness is diminished, it leads to lust. Conversely, when a person’s awareness is whole, it shields him against lust. (More specifically, there are three areas of awareness, each of which draws down a specific type of compassion and serves as a barrier against lust.)<br>When compassion and the mind are damaged, and the blemish of lust exists, a person cannot pray and plead for compassion. Then prayer enters into the realm of judgment, where the Side of Evil swallows it.<br>This situation can be rectified by a spiritually powerful person who is able to pray purposefully on the level of judgment. When he does so, the Side of Evil attempts to swallow his prayer. However, that prayer gets stuck in its throat and the Side of Evil must disgorge it along with all of the holy awareness, compassion and prayer that it had previously swallowed. Moreover, it must even disgorge its own life force.<br>This is the dynamic that occurs on Rosh HaShanah, the Day of Judgment, when prayer is in the realm of judgment. At that time, we extract life force from the Side of Evil. Then the holy awareness that it had swallowed up is restored to us.<br>Also, when prayer gets stuck in the throat of the Side of Evil, non-Jews convert to Judaism. They had been part of the Side of Evil, which now disgorges them, and they return to holiness.<br>The creation of converts increases God’s glory, which is the source of prophecy.<br>When prophecy spreads, the faculty of imagination is purified.<br>And when the faculty of imagination is purified, true faith is rectified. This is because faith depends on imagination. Faith operates where understanding ceases. One does not know but only imagines — and there one requires faith.<br>A true leader possesses something of the spirit of prophecy beyond that found in the masses. That is what makes him worthy of being a leader. We must seek such a leader, calling out to God to help us find him.<br>Because such a leader possesses this spirit of prophecy, the power of imagination of all those who follow him is strengthened. Thus, their holy faith is also strengthened.<br>Via faith, the world will be renewed in the messianic future. Then the dynamics of lovingkindness will blend together. At that time, when people’s awareness will grow, there will be no damage or cruelty, for their expanded awareness will cause compassion to spread.<br>At that time, the world will not function in accordance with nature, but solely in accordance with wondrous providence.<br>The entire world will partake of the quality of the Land of Israel. The essence of the holiness of the Land of Israel is that God’s providence is always present. In the messianic future, it will be universally clear that God created everything.<br>At present, there is a melody of nature. In the future, there will be a new song of wonders, of providence, of lovingkindness. And we attain that via prayer.<br>This corresponds to the lungs. When the lungs are in proper balance, they possess all of these qualities.</small><br><b>For the Seventh of Adar, the Hilula of Moses</b>",

                "<small><i>Great Tzaddikim Achieved Their Greatness Through Hitbodedut / One Should Turn the Torah He Learns into Prayers</i><br>There is no greater spiritual practice than hitbodedut, in which a person sets aside at least an hour a day to be alone in a room or in a field and speak to God in his own words, employing logic and persuasion, expressing regret and repentance for the past, and pleading with God to allow him to truly serve Him and come close to Him. A person should pray to God for whatever he lacks in serving Him. Even if he cannot say anything, his preparation and his standing before God with the desire to speak are themselves good. A person can even turn his inability to pray into a prayer. And when a person engages in this practice, God will give him the inspiration to say the words that God wishes to hear. A person should accustom himself to engage in this practice every day, and then be carefree the rest of the day.<br>This is a great practice and a wonderful way to come close to God. A number of well-known Tzaddikim reported that they attained their greatness only because of this practice. And it is something that anyone can do.<br>In particular, it is an excellent practice in hitbodedut to turn a teaching of a true Tzaddik into a prayer. Turning such teachings into prayers causes great delight in Heaven.</small><br><b>Pouring Forth Our Speech Before God</b><br>“A prayer for the poor person, when he is wrapped [in distress] and pours forth his speech before HaShem.”",

Their unification in this world is so holy and pure that an upper, Heavenly unification depends on it.<br>But even in this relationship, the husband may experience jealousy. That is due to his love for his wife. Theoretically, that is something positive. However, since the union of this couple occurs in this lower world, his jealousy can result in argument and disharmony.<br>In the time of the Temple, if a husband discovered his wife secluded with another man and suspected her of infidelity, he could take her to the Temple.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> The ceremony involving the <i>sotah</i>, or suspected woman, is detailed in Numbers 5:11-31.</i> There, the Kohen would write verses with God’s Name on a parchment and then immerse the parchment in water, erasing the text. The woman would then drink the water. If she had been unfaithful, she would die. If she had been faithful, the waters would bring her blessings, following which she would be restored to a repaired relationship with her husband.<br>Similarly, when the Jewish people act in an unseemly manner and God, as it were, suspects us of being unfaithful to Him, He subjects us to the same ceremony of the <i>sotah</i>. In this case, the parchment with God’s Name written on it is represented by holy books, and the erasure of God’s Name on the parchment is represented by the loss of those books.<br>Sometimes, the loss of such holy books occurs naturally over the course of history. Besides that, there are hidden Tzaddikim who know the inner aspects of the Torah but who do not express their insights at all, or refrain from writing them down, or write them down and then deliberately burn the manuscript.<br>When great Tzaddikim hide their teachings by burning and destroying them, that causes the destruction of heretical books — which, had they spread throughout the world, would have prevented people from coming close to God. Although the Tzaddikim’s teachings contain Divine Names, the destruction of these teachings is of great benefit to the world, for it makes it possible for us to come closer to God. It removes God’s spirit of jealousy so that the peace between Him and the Jewish people is restored.</small><br><b>The Spirit of Holiness</b><br>You chose us from all of the nations.

                "<small><i>We Can Return to God Through the Godliness in Every Created Thing / A Person Who Cannot Recognize God in Every Creation Must Cling to the Tzaddikim / The World to Come Makes Our Existence Worthwhile</i><br>God created a universe filled with wonders. That is true of our physical world — how much more, then, the other cosmos.<br>He created all of this for the sake of the Jewish people.<br>As for the Jewish people, we were created for the ultimate goal of Heaven and earth: the world of souls, a world that is entirely Shabbat. In that world, people will understand God without any screens or obstacles. There will be complete unity, and, as our sages said, “Everyone will point with his finger [and say], “This is our God, in Whom we hoped” (<i>Taanit</i> 31a; Isaiah 25:9).<br>Everything created in this world contains that ultimate purpose. Every entity has a spiritual beginning and an ultimate purpose. The spiritual beginning marks the level from which it devolved until it turned into a physical entity. And it has an ultimate purpose for which sake it was created. The Jewish people can study, know and contemplate the details of creation — the form of the limbs and the structure of everything — and from that appreciate God’s greatness, and serve Him through that.<br>Every object has a connection to the purpose for which it was created. Through every object, we can reach God and serve Him to attain that purpose — the nexus where the object ends and touches upon the ultimate purpose.<br>Everyone must contemplate this, and thus know and recognize God’s greatness in everything: in every entity’s form and shape, number of limbs, structure, and so forth. We must serve God with that until we reach the ultimate purpose of that entity, which is the level of the Shabbat, the world of souls.<br>People who have expansive minds can do this. But how can lowly people such as ourselves, who are on the level of the feet, attain this knowledge?<br>The answer is that we must yearn deeply for a leader of the generation, a faithful shepherd comparable to Moses, who has the power to illuminate us so that we will reach the goal.<br>It is an extraordinary fact that the promulgation of this ultimate awareness depends on people in this low world. All souls must go through this world in order to attain the ultimate reality. Everything in this world is needed to attain that end.<br>We should yearn and beg God with many tears, asking Him to help us attain this awareness so that we may know Him through everything in this world.<br>In our present state, we do not have “beautiful faces” at all. Therefore, God must have compassion on us and send us a faithful shepherd who can illumine us with awareness so that we will serve Him properly and attain the ultimate goal.<br>We ask God to send us a king and leader, a faithful shepherd, to illumine us. This is related to the Hebrew month of Nisan, which marks the new year for kings. At that time, not only human but angelic, heavenly kings are appointed.<br>The six days of Creation, when God created everything, correspond to the beginning of things. And the seventh day, the Shabbat, is the culmination, the ultimate purpose.<br>The six days themselves are creations. They are like a circle around a central point, which is the Shabbat. Nevertheless, there are differences between these six, between that which was created first and that which was created on the sixth day, closer to the Shabbat.<br>In and of itself, our world is not enough. When our sages state that it would have been better had man not been created (<i>Eruvin</i> 13b), they are referring to this world, which has so much suffering. But in the context of the World to Come, it is better for man to have been created, because then he may attain the ultimate goal. And due to the fact that there is a World to Come, there is even something intrinsically valuable in this world as well, because, as our sages said, “One hour of repentance and good deeds in this world is better than the entire life of the World to Come” (<i>Avot</i> 4:17).</small><br><b>For the Seventh of Adar, the Hilula of Moses</b>",

That enters and blazes through His eyes and creates His providence, as it were.<br>When Jews are far from God, He cannot take pride in us, and the tefilin on His head and arm are damaged. Then God’s Presence cries out, “My head is heavy, My arm is heavy!” (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 46a).<br>But when a Jew comes close to God and he is joined by another Jew, and more and more people want to serve God and come close to Him, God’s pride in the Jewish people increases. That pride manifests itself as His tefilin and His providence. God’s providence is particularly intense and constant upon the Land of Israel. That providence makes the Land holy and gives its atmosphere the property of dispensing wisdom.<br>When a person sees God’s pride in the Jewish people, he attains a beautiful state of mind, which becomes his own set of spiritual tefilin. Such tefilin enter into him and break out through his eyes. Then his own eyes are on the level of the eyes of HaShem. As a result, whatever he looks at attains the level of the Land of Israel.<br>In order to see God’s pride, a person must see the true Tzaddik, a person who brings others to serve God. That Tzaddik himself constitutes God’s pride in His people, since it is through him that all of their closeness to God and His pride in them exist.<br>When Jews gather together with the Tzaddik to hear the word of HaShem — in particular, on Rosh HaShanah — God’s pride is exceptionally great. Then the loveliness of the true Tzaddik is increased, for he himself is God’s pride. Then whoever looks sincerely at him gains access to God’s pride and to the mindfulness associated with tefilin, and his eyes are on the level of the eyes of HaShem. Then whatever he looks at attains the level of the Land of Israel.<br>When someone else, someone who desires the Land of Israel — in particular, if he has already experienced the taste of the Land of Israel — meets an individual who was in the company of the true Tzaddik on Rosh HaShanah, he senses the taste of the Land of Israel, for that individual spreads the atmosphere of the Land of Israel.</small><br><b>The Land of Faith and Wisdom</b><br>“My eyes are always turned to HaShem, for He will extricate my feet from the net.” “I have lifted my eyes to You Who dwell in the heavens.”",

And he thinks that they are overwhelming. But a person only has obstacles that he can deal with. In fact, there are no obstacles at all, because the obstacles themselves contain God.<br>A person’s greatest obstacle is that generated by his own mind, which is divided from God or from the Tzaddik.<br>For instance, he may overcome the practical obstacles that had kept him from traveling to the true Tzaddik. But if his mind remains unpersuaded and he entertains doubts and suspicions about the Tzaddik, that keeps him away from the Tzaddik more than anything else could.<br>In prayer as well a person has to overcome a number of obstacles before he can engage in the act of prayer. But if his heart is wrestling with God, if he is filled with questions and doubts about God, that is the greatest obstacle to prayer.<br>In such a situation, a person must cry out to his Father in Heaven from the depths of his heart. Then God listens to his voice, and that is his salvation.<br>The Baal Shem Tov tells of a king who had a great treasury that he surrounded with a series of concentric walls whose existence was an illusion. A few people who came to gain the treasure turned back immediately. Some broke through one wall but couldn’t breach the second. Some broke more walls but couldn’t break them all. Then the king’s son came and said, “I know that all of these walls are an illusion, that there is no wall at all.” He walked forward confidently and passed through all of them.<br>All of a person’s obstacles, distractions and enticements are walls around the treasury of the fear of Heaven. They are really nothing. The principal factor in overcoming them is a strong heart. Then there are no obstacles, such as concerns about money or the objections raised by one’s wife, children, parents or in-laws. All of these obstacles are nullified before a person whose heart is strong for God, just as the might of the greatest warrior is due only to his eagerness to leap into battle.</small><br><b>Passing by and Leaping over All Obstacles</b><br>“My soul yearns to exhaustion for the courtyards of HaShem.

This may be illustrated by dreaming. When a person dreams, he possesses only the power of imagination and lacks that of intellect. Thus, a quarter-hour can seem to him like seventy years. Conversely, the more expansive a person’s intellect, the smaller time is.<br>Thus, to an intellect that transcends ours, that which we consider to be seventy years is no more than a quarter-hour. And so does there exist intellect upon intellect, until one reaches an intellect so elevated that it does not consider time to be anything at all.<br>We see this exemplified by the Mashiach. He has existed since the beginning of Creation, during which time he has suffered a great deal. Yet when the messianic era will begin, God will tell him, “<i>Today</i> I brought you into being” (Psalms 2:7). At that time, the Mashiach’s mind will be so vast that all of the time that had passed since Creation will literally be as nothing to him — as though he had been born today.<br>The same idea applies to spatiality.

God’s Name is a Simple Oneness.<br>The four letters of God’s Name<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, <i>Y-H-V-H</i>.</i> may be conceptualized as the sight provided by the eye, which can be seen as having four components: three colors (cornea, rim of the iris, and iris) and the black pupil. Thus, the power of sight is drawn from God’s Name.<br>That power of sight is a bright light that corresponds to the Shabbat. The Hebrew word <i>ShaBbaT</i> can be remade as the phrase <i>Shin BaT</i>. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, <i>ShaBbaT</i> (שבת) can be spelled <i>Shin BaT</i> (ש-בת).</i> The letter <i>Shin</i> has three heads (i.e., legs) corresponding to the (ש) three colors of the eye. The <i>bat</i> is short for <i>bat ayin</i>, “pupil of the eye” (i.e., the base of the <i>shin</i>).<br>The sight of the eye corresponds to a single primal element from which descend the four principal elements with which this world was created.<br>A true Tzaddik corresponds to that primal element. Such a Tzaddik is the beauty of the world. When his beauty is revealed, people’s eyes are opened.<br>After that primal element develops into the four basic elements, they go on to develop into a person’s traits. Thus, when a person comes close to such a Tzaddik, he is able to examine his traits because they are drawn from the four elements, which in turn are drawn from the primal element: that Tzaddik.<br>God’s Name is clothed and partnered in the name of the true Tzaddik. Thus, when the Tzaddik’s name is expanded, God’s Name is expanded.<br>When such a Tzaddik is revealed and a person bonds with his beauty, the person’s eyes are opened. Then he can evaluate his traits and he can see the greatness of God.<br>Therefore, the Tzaddikim are called the “eyes of the community,” for through them, people’s eyes are opened. *<br>The Torah starts with the word <i>Bereishit</i> (In the beginning) and ends with “in the eyes of all Israel.”<br>The letters of <i>BeReiShYT</i> (בראשית) may be<i></i> rearranged to form the phrase <i>ROSh BaYiT</i>ראש בית<i>)</i> head of the house). <i>Bereishit</i> is the landlord, the Tzaddik, the beauty of the world. Through him, the eyes of all Israel are opened.<br>The Shabbat is the power of sight that illuminates the Temple. The Shabbat shines its colors — the colors of higher consciousness — into the Temple. The eye itself corresponds to the Temple.<br>In the phrase <i>rosh bayit</i> (head of the house), <i>rosh</i> (head) corresponds to consciousness and <i>bayit</i> (house) is the Temple. *<br>There are two types of light: “bright lights,” which are beneficial, and “fiery lights,” which represent the destruction of the Temple. When the power of the bright lights increases, the fiery lights are subdued, and vice versa. *<br>Weeping removes the light of a person’s eyes, like the sun setting in the west.<br>At that time, “Rachel weeps for her children” (Jeremiah 31:14). “Rachel” represents the Divine Presence. The Divine Presence weeps, as it were, for the suffering of the Jewish people scattered among the gentiles. And the Divine Presence weeps for the destruction of the Temple at the Western Wall.<br>When there is weeping, there are no bright lights. The beauty of the world is concealed.<br>When a person who does not possess the Name of God gains fame, God’s Name is, as it were, diminished. Then unclean names come into the world. The bright lights — the light of the eyes drawn from the Name of God — are distanced and subdued. Then the fiery lights grow stronger, and that causes fires.<br>Our Temple was destroyed in fire. Now that God looks forward to returning to us and rebuilding our Temple, we should not delay its building but assist it.<br>To that end, a person must rise at midnight and mourn over the destruction of the Temple. Perhaps in a previous incarnation, he caused it to be destroyed. Even if not, he might be delaying its rebuilding now, which is also considered as though he caused its destruction. So a person must be careful to rise at midnight and mourn for the Temple. When he does so, God turns the “ashes” from the fiery lights into “beauty.”</small><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Hebrew, the letters of the word <i>AiPheR (אפר</i>, ashes<i>)</i> are rearranged to form the word <i>Pe’ER (</i>פאר, beauty<i>).</i></i><br><b>For the Three Weeks</b><br><b>Lamenting the Absence of the Tzaddikim</b><br>“A voice of lamentation, of bitter weeping, is heard on high.

                "<i>Wisdom Resides in the Land of Israel / The Consciousness of the Rest of the World is Flawed / Those Who Reside in the King’s Palace Give the Honor They Receive to Him / Giving Charity Creates a Vessel to Receive Supernal Pleasantness / The Consciousness of the Rest of the World Receives its Rectification from Supernal Pleasantness / If the Consciousness of the World is Seriously Damaged, it Harms the Supernal Pleasantness and Brings Dispute into the Land of Israel</i><br><small>The essence of consciousness and wisdom resides in the Land of Israel. Because every Jew has a portion in the Land of Israel, every Jew can partake of its consciousness. The consciousness of the Land of Israel is called “pleasantness.”<br>There is also a flawed consciousness, associated with the rest of the world. That receives its energy from the consciousness of the Land of Israel. But it is flawed, because it is linked to a flaw in the revelation of God’s honor. As a result, people are not in alignment with each other, and disputes break out. This consciousness is called “wounding.”<br>That being the case, dispute should exist only in the rest of the world. Why, then, do we see dispute in the Land of Israel as well? The answer is as follows. The consciousness of the rest of the world seeks rectification. It can receive that rectification only from the supernal pleasantness associated with the Land of Israel.<br>God created the world in order to reveal His honor. God brought His honor into the world in ten portions. The vehicle for each portion was one of the Ten Divine Statements with which He created the world.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ten Statements correspond to the verses in the first chapter of Genesis that begin with the words, “And God said...” The first Statement, known as the Concealed Statement, is the first verse itself: “In the beginning, God created the Heaven and the earth.”</i> That honor is revealed by the supernal pleasantness.<br>Only select people who reside in the King’s palace can experience a revelation of God’s honor. When they are given some measure of honor, they do not keep it for themselves, but raise it entirely to God so that His honor will grow. And they know which of the Ten Statements that revelation of honor is associated with.<br>And that rectifies the world.<br>More generally, the essence of God’s honor is revealed by decent human beings. The more such people exist, the more God’s honor is increased.<br>In order to receive God’s supernal pleasantness, which is always flowing, we need a vessel. We create that vessel when we give charity. This opens the generous pathways of the heart and makes the heart into a vessel to receive from the supernal pleasantness — in particular, to receive the “flames of love.”<br>When that happens and the supernal pleasantness — associated with the consciousness of the Land of Israel — finds a vessel here below in which to gather, the flawed consciousness of the rest of the world seeks its rectification by falling upon it.<br>However, if the consciousness of the rest of the world is seriously damaged, it cannot be rectified. Then, to the contrary, it harms the consciousness of the Land of Israel, causing discord and dispute in the Land of Israel.</small><br><b>Our Infinite Gratitude</b><br>“Portions have fallen to me in pleasant places.

Sometimes he is literally a simple person. He does not reveal any Torah and engages in mundane conversation.<br>The essence of life is the Torah. Whoever is separated from the Torah is separated from life. That being the case, how can a person separate himself from Torah even briefly? Yet on the other hand, a person cannot constantly cling to the Torah day and night without pause — not even a brilliant, exalted person. He must occasionally interrupt in order to engage in some business, and so forth.<br>At that time, he is literally a simple person. It is true that “the nullification of Torah is ultimately its maintenance” (<i>Sefer Chassidim</i> 952) — but who wants to separate himself from the Torah for even a short while? This is especially true of a person who loves the Torah and clings to it, and, how much more, someone who feels sweetness in the Torah and creates original insights, and, even more, a brilliant person who attains the hidden treasures of the King. When such a person must separate himself from the Torah, from where does he draw life then?<br>At that time — at the time that the true Tzaddik is a simple person — he draws life from the journey to the Land of Israel.<br>All simple people — be they scholars who are not engaged in learning, or unlearned yet God-fearing people, or people who are even lower than that, such as non-Jews — need to receive life force from the Torah, which is the essence of life. But since they are far from Torah, they need a great, simple person through whom they can receive life force.<br>All of these simple people revive themselves from the concept of the world’s existence prior to the giving of the Torah.<br>At that time, when there was no performance of mitzvot, the world existed solely due to God’s kindness. When the Tzaddik is in his state of simplicity, he receives life from that level.<br>That is the level of the treasury of unearned gifts, from which a person without merits receives. This treasury is not for the wicked — for if it was, the wicked would be better off than the righteous. Rather, this treasury is for the Tzaddik at the time that he is a simple person. At that time, he receives from this treasury of unearned gifts.<br>Before the Torah was given, people involved themselves only in civilizing the world and attaining basic decency. “Great is basic decency, which preceded the Torah by twenty-six generations” (<i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 9:1). Before the giving of the Torah, the world existed solely through unearned kindness.<br>Yet the Torah existed even before we received it, for it is eternal. However, it was hidden.<br>The entire Torah is included in the Ten Commandments. Originally, the Ten Commandments were hidden in the Ten Statements with which the world was created. Thus, the whole Torah was hidden in the civilizing of the world and in all speech, work and deeds.<br>When the Tzaddik is simple and separated from Torah, he receives life from this level.<br>That is the road to the Land of Israel. The essential power of the holiness of the Land of Israel comes via “the power of His deeds that He related to His nation, to give them an inheritance of nations” (Psalms 111:6). As Rashi explains, “God created everything; He took the Land of Israel from the nations and gave it to whomever He pleased” (Rashi on Genesis 1:1). The fundamental strength of the Land of Israel is the Ten Statements, the “power of His deeds,” via which the Jews could go and conquer the Land.<br>This concept can exist in the rest of the world as well. Sometimes Jews come to a place that is very far from the holiness of the Land of Israel. They conquer that place and sanctify it so as to be a Jewish place — that, too, is the level of the Land of Israel. People could accuse the Jews of being thieves, but via the “power of His deeds,” the Ten Statements, we have permission to conquer the entire world and grant it Jewish sanctity.<br>That is basic decency, the proper “<i>way</i> of the world,” the way to the Land of Israel. Basic decency civilizes the world, which was created with Ten Statements. That itself is the pathway to the Land of Israel.<br>And so the great Tzaddik must descend and fall into simplicity for a period of time, because in that way he revives all simple people, since he revives himself with the level of the Torah hidden in the Ten Statements that are enclothed in the world. Simple people then receive life from him.<br>Therefore, when Moses asked to be allowed to enter the Land of Israel, he asked for that as an undeserved gift.<br>It is forbidden to despair. Even a simple person who is unable to learn, or even a person on the lowest level, must strengthen himself with the fear of God and simple devotion according to his level. Then he, too, receives life from the Torah via the great, simple man — the great Tzaddik.<br>There is no despair in the world at all. When a person is in a state of simplicity, he must strengthen himself with the fear of Heaven. He can attain great joy via his simplicity and faith, for he does not need any cleverness. In fact, cleverness is very harmful. A person can stray from one level of cleverness to another until he is trapped in cleverness.<br>A person must beseech God to help him come close to the true Tzaddik. For after a person dies, it will be very hard for him to do so.<br>Right now the Side of Evil is generating confusion in the world, because the Jewish people are very close to the messianic era. They are yearning for God in a way that did not exist in earlier days. Therefore, the Side of Evil has created dispute among the Tzaddikim and set up false leaders, such that no one knows where the truth lies. We must ask God to be worthy of drawing close to the true Tzaddik.</small><br><b>God’s Unlimited Gifts</b><br>“I beseeched HaShem at that time, saying, ‘Lord God, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your mighty hand, for who is like God in Heaven and earth?

The word <i>ADaM</i> has the numerical value of 45. This corresponds to the Divine Name <i>YHVH</i> filled in with the letter <i>aleph</i>, so that it has the numerical value of 45 — in Hebrew, <i>MaH</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Kabbalah, God’s Holy Name <i>YHVH</i> can be “filled in” or “expanded” with the letter <i>aleph</i> as follows: יוד הא ואו הא (<i>YOD HA VAV HA</i>), which has the numerical value of 45. This is the same numerical value as that of the words אדם (<i>ADaM</i>)and מה <i>(MaH</i>, what).</i> “In order” is also associated with wisdom and intelligence.<br>“Not in order,” on the other hand, corresponds to Eve, who represents the female manifestation of God — when it is separated from the male manifestation, as it were. That female manifestation is associated with <i>malkhut</i> (sovereignty) — in particular, to “the sovereignty of the mouth,” the Oral Torah. Sovereignty is related to speech; since “there is no king without a nation,” the people know the king’s will only when he reveals it in his speech.<br>Eve’s life force comes from <i>mah</i> — the intellect, wisdom.<br>When a person is haughty, he cuts himself off from God. It is as if he is a lifeless limb. Then he experiences opposition to his will, and his life becomes a battle.<br>Such a person has separated Eve — <i>malkhut</i> — from the Holy One so that she is not whole, and has taken <i>malkhut</i> for himself, saying, “I will establish my own sovereignty.” That creates a sickness of the heart.<br>A person gains wholeness only when he connects himself to God. Then he receives God’s life force, which is related to His wisdom.<br>In parallel, when <i>mah</i> (Adam) is in alignment with <i>malkhut</i> (Eve) — when the Holy One draws the life force of wisdom to <i>malkhut</i> — then she attains perfection.<br>If a person sees that his life is “not in order,” he should repent and humble himself. Then Eve (<i>malkhut</i>) returns to Adam (<i>mah</i>) and everything becomes “in order.”<br>Then all of a person’s battles and all of the forces that oppose his will are nullified.<br>The principal repentance occurs in the month of Elul, whose days are days of favor. In this month, Moses ascended to receive the Second Tablets and opened a path upon which all Jews could subsequently proceed. With ultimate dedication, Moses connected himself to even the least Jew. For even the lowliest Jew has Godliness. There is Godliness even on the lowest level, even in the ten crowns of uncleanness.<br>The higher Moses went, the more he found God. In the physical realm, a poor person tends to serve God, whereas when he acquires wealth, he tends to forget God. Such forgetting is the equivalent of a person’s eyes being blinded because he comes too close to the Divine light.

This causes the ray of the Mashiach to shine, since <i>MaShIaCh</i> is the speech with which one prays, as in the verse, “He generates speech (<i>MeiSIaCh</i>) in the mute” (Shabbat morning liturgy).</small><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> The words <i>MaShIaCh</i> (משיח Messiah) and MeiSIaCh (משיח generates speech<i>)</i> have the same letters.</i><br><small>As a result of rectifying his covenant and perfecting his prayer, a person is liberated and attains the holiness of the Shabbat, which encompasses the entire world. The holiness of the Shabbat is the ultimate knowledge: the knowledge that we know nothing.<br>On the Shabbat, a person sheds his plague-ridden body, the skin of the Serpent, and puts on Shabbat clothes — a holy body from the Garden of Eden.<br>Then his <i>mazal</i>, the source of his being, is elevated. He gains wealth and his good inclination is strengthened. Depression and sarcasm, which stem from “black bile,” are eradicated by the <i>mazal</i> of wealth and the good inclination, which correspond to the “right side.”<br>Through the “right side,” he can elevate those who fell into evil loves and fears, returning them to holy loves and fears. Their eyes then see wonders. It is as though such a person is creating the world.<br>The light of the eyes also elevates all of the requests and supplications that are prayed in the direction of the holy Temple. The light of the eyes emerges from the Temple and arouses the redemption. It also eradicates the leavening of the evil inclination of the heart, which has been there since his youth, enticing him to question and judge the Torah sages of the generation.<br>Through the “flames of love” — the love one has for God — a person’s heart is enflamed with learning Torah, and the “many waters” of external love and fear cannot extinguish that flame.<br>The Divine Presence users Her wings to cover the blood of Israel (a person’s sins) with love, so that the seed of the wicked — the floodwaters — will not rule over them.<br>God wants to taste the positive mitzvot of a Tzaddik. But those positive mitzvot correspond to the limb of a living animal, which is forbidden to eat until it is ritually slaughtered. The human equivalent of that is shame, which corresponds to “spilled blood,” a form of ritual slaughter. Thus, the Tzaddik must experience shame in order for God to be able to taste his mitzvot.<br>When the Tzaddik’s blood is spilled by shame, he must take care that outer forces will not derive energy from it. His blood needs to be covered — just as the blood of a slaughtered animal must be covered.<br>There are many fallen souls that can rise only when a great Jew’s blood is spilled — whether figuratively or sometimes even literally.

                "<i>When a Man Rectifies the Blemish to the Covenant, if He is Unmarried He Finds His Wife, and if He is Married His Wife is in Accord with His Will / A Person Must Not Eat Unripe Fruit / Fruit that is Picked Before its Time Can Draw the Life Force of the Person Who Eats it / By Reciting the Blessing over Fruit with Concentration and Awe of God, One Can Find Lost Sparks of Holiness in it / Angels Holding Shofars Search for Lost Sparks of Holiness and Blow on Their Shofars When They Find Them / People Lose Sparks of Holiness Because of Their Desires / Even Tzaddikim Who Search for Lost Sparks of Holiness are Sometimes Lost Themselves</i><br><small>In Elul a person should bear in mind the intention to rectify the blemish to the covenant. That rectification illuminates a “path in the sea.”<br>Should a man does not achieve that rectification, if he is unmarried he may find it hard to find his wife. And even if he finds her, she may oppose him and not accept his will.<br>This happens because he turned away from <i>malkhut</i> and did not illumine her. Thus, <i>malkhut</i>, as embodied in the form of a physical wife, has a will that opposes his.<br>A man can rectify this in the month of Elul. Then he can find his wife and she will not oppose his will.<br>Our patriarch Abraham imparted this secret to his servant Eliezer when he sent him to find a wife for Isaac. Abraham said, “If the woman is not willing to go after you (ואם לא תאבה האשה ללכת אחריך<i>,Ve-im Lo toveh ha’ishah Lalekhet Acharekha</i>)” (Genesis 24:8). The initials of the first two and last two words of this verse spell <i>ELUL</i> (אלול) and in the middle are the words <i>toveh ha’ishah</i> (תאבה האשה, the woman is willing). Through<i></i> the mystical intentions of Elul, the woman is willing, since this makes her want him.<br>A person must avoid eating fruit that is not fully ripe. Just as it is forbidden to cut down a tree before its time (Deuteronomy 20:19), one should not pick or eat a fruit before its time.<br>As long as the fruit is on the tree, it has a “pulling” power with which it draws its nourishment and vitality. It loses this power after it fully ripens. If it is picked before its time, that “pulling” power is still present in it, and will draw the life force of the person who eats the fruit. Then that person can lose his soul.<br>However, one who recites the blessing over the fruit with concentration and awe of God can be saved from this. One who is strong in his service of God can even extract more vitality from the unripe fruit and find lost sparks of holiness there.<br>Cooking unripe fruit does not make it suitable to eat. One should allow it to ripen on its own before eating it.<br>In general, a person should be careful about reciting the blessings over food and drink, and especially the blessings over fruit, because fruits contain many lost sparks of holiness that need to be extracted and elevated.<br>There is an angel with many appointees, all of whom hold shofars in their hands. They stand and dig constantly, searching for lost sparks of holiness. As they dig and search, they sound the <i>tekiah</i>-<i>teruahtekiah</i> on their shofars. When they find something, it generates a great noise and much joy.<br>People lose sparks of holiness as a result of their desires. Even the tzaddikim who search for these lost sparks of holiness are sometimes lost themselves.<br>The verse, “The desire of the wicked will be lost” (Psalms 112:10) hints at the activity of the angels searching for lost things. The initial letters of the Hebrew words of this verse, <i>Ta’avat Resha’im Toveid</i> (תאות רשעים תאבד), stand for <i>Tekiah</i>-<i>teRuah</i>-<i>Tekiah (</i>תקיעה תרועה תקיע).<br>The mystical intentions of Elul, which rectify the blemish of the covenant; the prohibition against eating unripe fruit; and the angels holding shofars and searching for lost sparks of holiness, are all one idea.</small><br><b>For the Month of Elul</b><br><b>Gather Your Scattered People</b><br>“I am my Beloved’s and my Beloved is mine, Who shepherds among the lilies.” My Father in Heaven, “my King and my God, I pray to You.”",

                "You who are filled with compassion, have compassion on me. May my hardships not be unimportant to You. “See my affliction and my toil, and forgive all my transgressions,” “for You crushed us in a place of serpents and covered us with the shadow of death.”",
                "“If we forgot the Name of our God and spread our hands out to a foreign god, will God not investigate? He knows the secrets of the heart. For Your sake, we are killed all the day; we are considered as sheep for the slaughter.”",
                "In Your vast compassion, have pity on me and accept my few difficulties, efforts and hardships as I strive to be in accordance with Your will, as though I were wearing myself out and troubling myself properly.",
                "Quickly bring Your compassion to the fore on my behalf, because I am deeply impoverished. Please look at my hardships and not my transgressions. Please turn to my depressed spirit and gaze at my brokenheartedness.",
                "Accept my few difficulties [and my efforts] and troubles in doing Your will as though I had offered sacrifices on Your altar to gain Your favor. For I am flesh and blood and quarried from clay, and my evil inclination pursues me from my birth “as the partridge hunts in the mountains.”",
                "Woe to me because of my evil inclination! Woe to me before my Maker if You do not act for Your sake! Unless You take Your wrath and anger away from me, there is no point in my attempting any deeds.",
                "I will hope in God. I will address His countenance. I will ask Him for a response that will make it possible for me to begin to pray properly, with complete focus, to control my thoughts, particularly when I pray, so that my prayer will not go astray.",
                "May I not experience any extraneous thoughts that are unrelated to my words of prayer. Instead, may my thoughts be connected to my words of prayer with a firm and strong bond. And may You accept my prayer favorably.",
                "“My God, open my lips and my mouth will speak Your praise.” “For You do not desire an offering, or I would give it; You do not wish a burnt-offering. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit. God, You will not despise a broken and crushed heart.”",
                "“He has neither despised nor abhorred the cry of the poor, nor has He hidden His countenance from him; and when he cried out to Him, He listened.”",
                "“May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing before You, HaShem, my Rock and my Redeemer.” Amen."
