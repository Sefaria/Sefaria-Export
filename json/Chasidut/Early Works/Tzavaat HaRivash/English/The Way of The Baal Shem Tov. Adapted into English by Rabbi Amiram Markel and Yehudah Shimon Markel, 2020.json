In the same manner, as long as a person is in this world, he requires a wife to fully serve His Creator and merit the world to come. If he places the primary matter, of serving His Creator, aside, and instead engages in lustful thoughts about his wife, is there any greater folly than this?

Is it not written,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">222</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 106:2</i> “Who can express the mighty acts of <i>HaShem</i>, who can make all His praise be heard?” If so, how could the psalmist state, “I will tell of all Your wonders?”",

Each is allotted a certain amount of time for their praise, according to their stature and importance. Now, all this is when the king is in a good mood. However, if the king is angry, God forbid, they all are afraid to enter and praise him at all.

However, when the beloved son of the king comes to praise the king, he pays no attention to any of this. That is, even if the king is angry, when he sees his beloved son enter, this brings joy and delight to his heart and his anger automatically dissipates. As long as his son is in his presence, the king will certainly not be angry, for this is the nature of a father to a beloved son, as known. This being so, the son pays no attention to any of these considerations. He enters at any time and can praise the king without measure, for he knows that, by doing so, he brings additional joy and delight to his father.",

Because of Avraham. That is, through the power of love and kindness which is signified by Avraham, who is like the son of the king in the analogy.",

One is because the king is his father and king, and thus his obligation to thank and praise him is greater than the king’s servants and ministers, especially since he has no reason to be afraid, as explained above. Secondly, it is only right that he should thank and praise his father to a greater degree, specifically because he has been granted the right to do so without measure, a right which is not granted to any minister or official.

You created the evil inclination and You created the Torah. Through the Torah You gave us the power to conquer the evil inclination and to sweeten him, like a chef who adds spices to the pot. Everything is from You and is Yours, and it is only by Your power that we have the ability to accomplished all this. Even so, You have great delight and pride in our doing so, as if we accomplished it on our own.

            "This is analogous to a son who is beloved to his father, and a guest is due to arrive to test the Torah knowledge of the son. Now, on his own, the son is unable to understand the legal ruling that will be discussed, because of its great profundity and depth. However, because the father loves and adores his son, he cannot not bear to see him suffering in his study of the legal ruling, because of lack of understanding in grappling with the problem. What does the father do? He teaches his son and thereby clarifies the subject to him, showing him the right way to understand it. In the process of doing so, he just about opens the whole depth of the subject to him.",
            "The guest finally arrives and begins to question and test the son on the ruling, in front of his father. The son begins to explain the ruling and the guest asks him questions on his explanation, presenting numerous difficulties. However, he is able to answer all the difficulties appropriately. For every question and difficulty that he is presented, he responds clearly and to the point. His father sees this and is joyous, deriving great pleasure and pride. Even though the son prevailed because his father tutored him, nonetheless, the father derives great satisfaction from it. Now, when the guest sees the great delight of the father, he wants to increase the father’s pleasure and satisfaction. He thus attempts to overpower the son, by posing new difficulties that are stronger and more difficult than his previous questions. The son, however, trusts in what his father taught him, digs deeper into himself and awakens the power of insight to grapple with the difficulties and answer all the questions satisfactorily.",
            "About this, the sages stated,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">246</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, Sukkah 52a</i> “Whoever is greater than his fellow, his evil inclination is also greater.” The sages, of blessed memory, similarly stated,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">247</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, Bava Batra 16a</i> “Satan’s intent is for the sake of Heaven.” The analogue is thus understood, that when <i>HaShem</i>, blessed is He, sees the <i>Tzaddik</i> prevail over his evil inclination, He derives great pleasure from this. The evil inclination comes to overpower him every single day, but he conquers and prevails over it.",
            "About this, our sages, of blessed memory, stated,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">248</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, Megillah 18a</i> “The Holy One, blessed is He, called Yaakov by the name ‘<i>El-אל</i>,’ which is a term of might and strength, as in the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">249</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 17:13</i> “He took away the mighty (<i>Eilei</i>-<i>אילי</i>) of the land.” It is in this respect that He called him “<i>El</i>-<i>אל</i>,” for the righteous <i>Tzaddik</i> is called,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">250</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishnah Avot 4:1</i> “A mighty one who conquers his inclination.” About the future to come, our sages, of blessed memory, stated,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">251</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, Sukkah 52a</i> “The Holy One, blessed is He, will bring the evil inclination and slaughter him in the presence of the righteous and the wicked. To the righteous, the evil inclination will seem like a high mountain, whereas for the wicked, it will seem like a strand of hair. The righteous will cry out and say, ‘How were we able to overcome such a high mountain?’ The wicked will cry out and say, ‘How were we unable to overcome this strand of hair?’” That is, in the future to come, the great strength of the righteous will be recognized and revealed, in that they conquered such a great mountain.",
            "It is possible that in the future to come, all righteous <i>Tzaddikim</i> will be called by the name “<i>El</i>-אל.” This is hinted at in the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">252</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 23:23</i> “At that time, it will be said of Yaakov and Yisroel, ‘What has <i>El</i>-אל wrought?’” As known, the righteous <i>Tzaddik</i> is called by the name Yisroel. Thus, regarding the <i>Tzaddik</i>, it will be said to him, “What has <i>El-</i>אל wrought?” In other words, this is like someone who asks his fellow, “What do you do?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">253</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is like the Yiddish greeting, “Vos machst du,” which literally means, “What do you do?”</i> How are you?” In the same way, it will be said to the <i>Tzaddikim</i>, “What have you, <i>El</i>-אל, wrought?”",
            "Thus, the above-mentioned verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">254</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 48:2</i> “Great is <i>HaShem </i>and much praised, in the city of our God, the mountain of His Holiness,” may be understood as follows:  We must praise and magnify <i>HaShem</i>, blessed is He, for all of the goodness He has bestowed upon us. All the great pride He derives from our service is in the city-<i>Eer</i>-<i>עיר</i>, which is a term of awakening-<i>Hitorerut</i>-<i>התעוררות </i>to “our God.” In other words, it is He, <i>HaShem, </i>our God, who awakens us, and gives us the strength to serve Him and overpower the evil inclination. This is as stated,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">255</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, Sukkah 52b</i> “If the Holy One, blessed is He, would not assist, a person would be incapable of overpowering the evil inclination.” Nevertheless, even though the power to conquer the evil inclination comes from the assistance of <i>HaShem</i>, blessed is He, He nonetheless, derives great pride and pleasure from this and gives us abundant reward, as if we did it all on our own. However, in reality, true service of <i>HaShem</i> must be through our own self-awakening, in that we are a “part of Godliness from Above.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">256</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 31:2</i> This is the meaning of, “The city of our God-<i>Eer Elohei”nu-</i>עיר אלהינ״ו.” That is, “an awakening-<i>Hitorerut</i>-התעוררות of our good inclination, which is the part of Godliness within us.”"

            "It is written,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">257</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 97:5</i> “The mountains melted like wax in the presence of <i>HaShem</i>.” A verse in the next Psalm states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">258</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 98:8</i> “Let the mountains sing for joy together.” How can these two verses coexist? This can be explained as follows: As known, our sages, of blessed memory, stated,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">259</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Midrash Shemot Rabba 15:4</i> “The term mountains-<i>Harim</i>-<i>הרים</i> refers to the forefathers.” They also stated,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">260</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Midrash Bereishit Rabba 47:6</i> “The forefathers are the Divine Chariot-<i>Merkavah</i>.” Now, we need to understand. How is it that the forefathers, who were in the lower world, were the Divine Chariot-<i>Merkavah</i>? However, as known, Avraham is the quality of love, which is the attribute of kindness-<i>Chessed</i>, Yitzchak is the quality of fear-<i>Yirah</i>, which is the attribute of judgment-<i>Din</i> and Yaakov is the quality of mercy, which is attribute of beauty-<i>Tiferet</i>, that mediates between them. Our sages, of blessed memory, stated,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">261</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, Yevamot 79a</i> “There are three signs by which the Jewish people are recognizable: They are merciful, they are bashful, and they perform acts of lovingkindness.” These three qualities are the attributes of our forefathers, in ascending order. That is, the quality of mercy is the attribute of Yaakov, the quality of bashfulness is the attribute of Yitzchak, for a person who fears his fellow is embarrassed before him, and the quality of performing acts of lovingkindness is the attribute of Avraham, which is the attribute of love and kindness.",
            "Now, it states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">262</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ecclesiastes 7:14</i> “God made everything with its opposite.” That is, just as these three qualities exist on the side of holiness, so too, they exist on the side of impurity as well. These are called, “The Fathers of Impurity-<i>Avot HaTumah</i>.”",
            "However, the difference between them is that in holiness, the three are inter-included with each other. For example, a person who loves his friend will also have mercy upon him and if, at times, he is unable to fulfill a commitment that he made to his friend, he will be embarrassed of him. We thus see that these qualities are all inter-included with each other on the side of holiness, in that they are as one. This is because the side of holiness is the side of absolute oneness. In contrast, on the side of impurity the three qualities are separate from each other, as it states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">263</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 92:10</i> “All workers of iniquity shall be dispersed.” For example, such a person will have wrong love for one thing, be fearful of another thing, and have compassion for yet another thing.",
            "Thus, the verse that states, “The mountains melted like wax in the presence of <i>HaShem</i>,” is referring to the mountains of impurity, and this is why the verse does not use the term “together” (as it does in the other verse), since the impure are in a state of separation and disunity, as explained above. The second verse, on the other hand, is referring to the mountains of holiness, who are our forefathers, Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov, and are in a state of absolute unity. It thus states, “Let the mountains sing for joy together.”",
            "The verse, “All workers of iniquity shall be dispersed,” hints at this, because the bad character traits that a person might have, God forbid, are called, “The workers of iniquity,” in that they bring a person to the iniquity itself, which is the actual transgression. These negative character traits are in a state of disunity and do not bond together. It is for this reason that it states, “All workers of iniquity shall be dispersed,” indicating that they are dispersed and not in a state of unity. This is likewise, why the verse states, “workers of iniquity,” rather than “doers of iniquity,” which indicates that even the character traits themselves, which are the “workers that bring about iniquity” rather than the iniquity itself, are in a state of disunity."

On the untrodden path-<i>Orach</i>-<i>אורח</i> it is possible to err and stray from the way, and thus come to a place of danger. This is not the case with the trodden path-<i>Derech</i>-<i>דרך</i>, where there is no possibility of error that might cause one to stray.",
            "These two matters also exist in man. That is, there is the trodden path in the service of <i>HaShem,</i> the Creator, blessed is He, and if a person always travels on this path he will certainly not stray. This is a person who separates himself from all mundane matters and occupies himself exclusively with Torah study and fulfilling the <i>mitzvot</i>, day and night. He speaks little, only as much as necessary and no more.",
            "However, there also is the untrodden path, called <i>Orach</i>-<i>אורח</i>. This refers to a person who sometimes engages in conversation with others, but only for the sake of <i>HaShem</i>, blessed is He. In other words, through his conversation with others, he affects their moral conduct and their love and fear of <i>HaShem</i>, and the like. He may also be a person who knows how to elevate his speech to Holiness above, as known about several individuals. We thus find that it certainly is permissible to engage in such speech. However, there is danger here, for the possibility exists that he could err and deviate from the good path, and come to engage in idle chatter as well, as is customary amongst the masses. Thus, one must pray and implore of <i>HaShem</i>, blessed is He, to help him whenever he goes on such a path-<i>Orach</i>-<i>אורח</i>. He must gird himself in prayer so that he does not come to stumble into sin, God forbid.",
            "This then, explains the verse, “Teach me Your way (<i>Derech</i>-<i>דרך</i>), <i>HaShem</i>,” meaning “Show me and advise me about the trodden path, so that I can travel it on my own.” It then continues, “Lead me on the straightforward path (<i>Orach</i>-<i>אורח</i>),” meaning, “Guide and assist me on the untrodden path on which I may stray. Be my help and support that I should trod upon it in a straightforward manner, rather than a crooked manner. For, without Your help, I could possibly stray, God forbid.”",

However, when it comes to the untrodden path, referred to as <i>Orach</i>-<i>אורח</i>, it states “He will straighten your paths,” meaning that <i>HaShem</i> must go before you, to straighten your path and be your support, so that you will not err and stray."

            "It is a very important principle to know that everything that exists in the world possesses sparks of Holiness. There is nothing devoid of these sparks. Even trees and stones possess them, as well as all the deeds that a person does. Even when a person sins, God forbid, therein are sparks of holiness that fell into impurity with the shattering of the vessel (<i>Shevirah</i>). You might ask, what are the sparks of holiness in sin? The answer is repentance. That is, sin carries within it the potential to repent. When a person repents for his sins, he elevates the sparks of holiness that were imprisoned in the sin and returns them to the Supernal World.

            "The inner meaning of their names are as follows: The angels of the World of Action (<i>Asiyah</i>) are called <i>Ophanim</i>, which means revolving cycles-<i>Galgal,</i> in that they continually revolve in their desire to adhere to their source Above. They correspond to the aspect of the <i>Nefesh</i>-soul, which itself is a term of “addition” and “increase.” For, they constantly desire to draw forth additional influence and vitality from Above.",

            "Man is a microcosm of the world. When he rises from bed each morning, he awakens without fear of <i>HaShem</i> at all. However, through reciting the sacrificial offerings (<i>Korbanot</i>) he becomes purified, as the Zohar states.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">269</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zohar Vol. 3, 120b</i> The sacrificial offerings (<i>Korbanot</i>) correspond to the World of Action (<i>Asiyah</i>) and to the revolving <i>Ophanim</i> angels.

Through the subsequent recital of the verses of song-<i>Psukei d’Zimra</i>, for these verses contain much more passion than the verses of the sacrificial offerings. However, before he can attain a great level of passion (<i>Hitlahavut</i>), he begins without so much passion, and it is for this reason that <i>Hodu</i> was established. This is because <i>Hodu</i> contains a collection of various verses and is not actually part and parcel of the verses of song-<i>Psukei d’Zimra</i>. The reason is so that when he does arrive at the verses of song-<i>Psukei d’Zimra</i>, he will already be in a more heightened state of passion and arousal. He will then have increased vitality, for passion corresponds to the <i>Chayot</i>, the living angels.  When he subsequently arrives at the blessings of the <i>Shema</i>, he will come to have an even greater level of arousal of passion and will come to the level of the fiery-<i>Seraphim</i> angels."
