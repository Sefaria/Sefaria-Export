                "We will explain with Heavenly assistance the statement by the Sages z”l (Shabbat 21b) “They ‎argue about the chanukah lamp: One says that it is permissible to use its light; (the other) one ‎says that it is forbidden to use its light.” (We can explain this) through a parable: A powerful king ‎came to a poor man’s house. Naturally, when a powerful king arrives, his honour and wealth are ‎visible for all to see, and a poor person rejoices in seeing the abundant riches of the king; he has ‎never seen such wealth in all of his days. However, a wise poor man does not rejoice in seeing ‎the great riches of the king, for he knows that from the king’s perspective, wealth is an ‎insignificant matter. Rather his happiness stems from the fact that the king has come to take ‎lodging in his home. So, too, in this matter. When Hashem Yitbarach performs miracles for ‎human beings, one person might rejoice in the good itself, that Hashem Yitbarach performs ‎miracles for him. This is like the poor man who rejoices at seeing the wealth of the king; in a ‎similar vein this individual rejoices in the fact that Hashem acts towards him with kindness. ‎However, another (wiser) individual does not rejoice over the miracles themselves, for he knows ‎that Hashem created all of the worlds and is able to do everything, but his happiness upon ‎experiencing a miracle is that through the miracle he sees that Hashem “clothes ‎Himself”(k‟veyachol) with human beings; that by performing miracles for human beings this ‎individual rejoices in the knowledge that The Powerful King “lodges” and “clothes” Himself in ‎order to come (closer) to human beings. This is the argument (in Shabbat 21b): “One says that it is ‎permissible to use the light,” corresponding to the person who rejoices in G-d’s performance of a ‎miracle for him. This is a happiness that relates to this world, that Hashem acts towards him with ‎kindness. Since this world was given to us to derive benefit there from, therefore he is ‎‎“permitted to use the light.”“ And the other says it is forbidden to use the light,” ‎corresponding to one who rejoices in G-d Himself, that he merits that G-d clothes His Brilliance ‎with human beings. He does not think of himself as having received goodness, rather that ‎Hashem Yitbarach “clothed” Himself with him. Since he does not give importance to (the benefit ‎from this) world at all, only to that which his above this world - and that which is abovet his world ‎is not for our enjoyment, as it is written (Yeshayah 64), “No eye has seen‏ ‏this, G-d, only You” –‎‎  consequently, he‏ ‏believes that “it is forbidden to benefit from‏ ‏the light.”‎"

            "Vayigash": [
                "‎\"And Yehudah approached him and said, 'Please, my master, let your servant speak in my master's ‎ears, and be not angry at your servant, for you are like Pharaoh.'\" (Bereishit 44:18) \"Be not angry\" is ‎incomprehensible; it sounds like he had provoked him to the point of needing to ask, \"Be not ‎angry,\" but in the entire section we find only words of appeasement and pleading…",
                "... It appears, in my humble opinion, that Yehudah intended thus: Yehudah wished to awaken Yosef's ‎mercy, so that his heart would understand and listen to his pleading, but he sensed that this would ‎only come, as our sages say, via 'Words that come from the heart, enter the heart.' This is what he ‎intended, when he drew near to speak.‎ However, this is effective only when one person speaks to another directly; then his friend accepts ‎the sweetness of his words, and truth is recognized. When there is a translator, speech does not ‎make such an impression; this is clear to all who understand. The obstruction here was, \"The ‎translator was between them,\" (ibid. 45:23) for he spoke via a translator.‎ Therefore, Yehudah requested of Yosef to speak personally, without the translator. However, in ‎truth, it is not respectful to speak to the king in one's own tongue, for perhaps the king would not ‎comprehend it. Thus Yehudah declared, \"Please, let your servant speak in my master's ears,\" so ‎that the words would go from mouth to ear without a translator, in Yehudah's own formulation, ‎despite the lack of respect in speaking thus.‎ Therefore, he said, \"Be not angry at your servant\" at this mode of address. \"There is no claim ‎against me [Yehudah], for it is clear to me that you know the seventy languages;\" for the early ‎kings knew the seventy languages. Thus he said, \"for you are like Pharaoh,\" meaning that you are a ‎king, like Pharaoh, and you know seventy languages, and certainly, you will know our language. ‎And so is seen in Sotah 36b, \"Gavriel came and taught [Yosef] 70 languages.\" Pharaoh did not know ‎the holy tongue, but he was degraded for this, for a king should know all tongues.‎"
