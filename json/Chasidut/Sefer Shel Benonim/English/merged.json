            "It has been taught (Niddah, end ch. 3): An oath is administered to him [before birth, warning him]: \"Be righteous and be not wicked; and even if the whole world tells you that you are righteous, regard yourself as if you were wicked.\"", 
            "This requires to be understood, for it contradicts the Mishnaic dictum (Avot, ch. 2), \"And be not wicked in your own estimation.\"", 
            "Furthermore, if a man considers himself to be wicked he will be grieved at heart and depressed, and will not be able to serve G-d joyfully and with a contented heart;", 
            "while if he is not perturbed by this [self-appraisal], it may lead him to irreverence, G-d forbid.", 
            "However, the matter [will be understood after a preliminary discussion].We find in the Gemara five distinct types—a righteous man who prospers, a righteous man who suffers, a wicked man who prospers, a wicked man who suffers, and an intermediate one (Benoni).", 
            "It is there explained that the \"righteous man who prospers\" is the perfect tzaddik; the \"righteous man who suffers\" is the imperfect tzaddik.", 
            "In Raaya Mehemna (Parshat Mishpatim) it is explained that the \"righteous man who suffers\" is one whose evil nature is subservient to his good nature, and so on.", 
            "In the Gemara (end ch. 9, Berachot) it is stated that the righteous are motivated by their good nature,... and the wicked by their evil nature, while the intermediate men are motivated by both, and so on.", 
            "Rabbah declared, \"I, for example, am a Benoni\" Said Abbaye to him, \"Master, you do not make it possible for anyone to live,\" and so on.", 
            "To understand all the aforesaid clearly an explanation is needed,", 
            "as also to under-stand what Job said [Bava Batra, ch. i], \"Lord of the universe, Thou hast created righteous men and Thou hast created wicked men,...\" for it is not preordained whether a man will be righteous or wicked.", 
            "It is also necessary to understand the essential nature of the rank of the Intermediate. Surely that cannot mean one whose deeds are half virtuous and half sinful,", 
            "for if this were so, how could Rabbah err in classifying himself as a Benoni? For it is known that he never ceased studying [the Torah], so much so that the Angel of Death could not overpower him; how, then, could he err to have half of his deeds sinful, G-d forbid?", 
            "Furthermore, [at what stage can a person be considered a Benoni if] when a man commits sins he is deemed completely wicked", 
            "(but when he repents afterward he is deemed completely righteous)?", 
            "Even he who violates a minor prohibition of the Rabbis is called wicked, as it is stated in Yevamot, ch. 2, and in Niddah, ch. I.", 
            "Moreover, even he who has the opportunity to forewarn another against sinning and does not do so is called wicked (ch. 6, Shevuot).", 
            "All the more so he who neglects any positive law which he is able to fulfil, for instance, whoever is able to study Torah and does not, regarding whom our Sages have quoted, \"Because he hath despised the word of the Lord... [that soul] shall be utterly cut off...,\" It is thus plain that such a person is called wicked, more than he who violates a prohibition of the Rabbis.", 
            "If this is so, we must conclude that the Intermediate man (Benoni) is not guilty even of the sin of neglecting to study the Torah. Hence Rabbah could have mistaken himself for a Benoni.", 
            "And as for the general saying that one whose deeds and misdeeds are equally balanced is called Benoni, while he whose virtues outweigh his sins is called a Tzaddik, this is only the figurative use of the term in regard to reward and punishment, because he is judged according to the majority [of his acts] and he is deemed \"righteous\" in his verdict, since he is acquitted in law.", 
            "But concerning the true definition and quality of the distinct levels and ranks, \"Righteous\" and \"Intermediate\" men, our Sages have remarked that the Righteous are motivated [solely] by their good nature, as it is written, \"And my heart is a void within me,\" that is, void of an evil nature, because he [David] had slain it through fasting.", 
            "But whoever has not attained this degree, even though his virtues exceed his sins, cannot at all be reckoned to have ascended to the rank of the Righteous (tzaddik).", 
            "This is why our Sages have declared in the Midrash, \"The Almighty saw that the righteous were few, so He planted them in every generation,...\" [for,] as it is written, \"The tzaddik is the foundation of the world.\"", 
            "The explanation [of the questions raised above] is to be found in the light of what Rabbi Chayim Vital wrote in Sha'ar ha-Kedushah (and in Etz Chayim, Portal 50, ch. 2) that in every Jew, whether righteous or wicked, are two souls, as it is written, \"The neshamot (souls) which I have made,\"", 
            "[alluding to] two souls.", 
            "There is one soul which originates in the kelipah and sitra achra,", 
            "and which is clothed in the blood of a human being, giving life to the body, as is written, \"For the life of the flesh is in the blood.\"", 
            "From it stem all the evil characteristics deriving from the four evil elements which are contained in it.", 
            "These are: anger and pride, which emanate from the element of Fire, the nature of which is to rise upwards;", 
            "the appetite for pleasures— from the element of Water, for water makes to grow all kinds of enjoyment;", 
            "frivolity and scoffing, boasting and idle talk from the element of Air;", 
            "and sloth and melancholy— from the element of Earth.", 
            "From this soul stem also the good characteristics which are to be found in the innate nature of all Israel, such as mercy and benevolence.", 
            "For in the case of Israel, this soul of the kelipah is derived from kelipat nogah, which also contains good,", 
            "as it originates in the esoteric \"Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.\"", 
            "The souls of the nations of the world, however, emanate from the other, unclean kelipot which contain no good whatever, as is written in Etz Chayim, Portal 49, ch. 3,", 
            "that all the good that the nations do, is done from selfish motives. So the Gemara comments on the verse, \"The kindness of the nations is sin,\"— that all the charity and kindness done by the nations of the world is only for their own self-glorification, and so on."

            "The second soul of a Jew is truly a part of G-d above,", 
            "as it is written, \"And He breathed into his nostrils the breath of life,\" and \"Thou didst breathe it [the soul] into me.\" And it is written in the Zohar, \"He who exhales, exhales from within him,\" that is to say, from his inwardness and his innermost, for it is something of his internal and innermost vitality that man emits through exhaling with force.", 
            "So, allegorically speaking, have the souls of Jews risen in the [Divine] thought,",

            "That is to say, just as a child is derived from his father's brain, so— to use an anthropomorphism— the soul of each Israelite is derived from G-d's (blessed be He) thought and wisdom.", 
            "For He is wise— but not through a know-able wisdom, because He and His wisdom are one;", 
            "and as Maimonides says that \"He is the Knowledge and Knower etc.,", 
            "and this is not within the power of any man to comprehend clearly, etc.\" as it is written, \"Canst thou by searching find G-d?\" And it is also written, \"For My thoughts are not your thoughts etc.,\"", 
            "And though there are myriads of different gradations of souls, rank upon rank, ad infinitum,", 
            "as with the superiority of the souls of the Patriarchs and of Moses our Teacher above the souls of our own generations who live in the period preceding the coming of the Messiah, which are as the very soles of the feet compared with the brain and head,", 
            "so in every generation there are the leaders of the Jews, whose souls are in the category of \"head\" and \"brain\" in comparison with those of the masses and the ignorant.", 
            "Likewise [are there distinctions between] nefashot and nefashot, for every soul consists of nefesh, ruach and neshamah.", 
            "Nevertheless, the root of every nefesh, ruach and neshamah, from the highest of all ranks to the lowest that is embodied within the illiterate and the most worthless, all derive, as it were, from the Supreme Mind which is Chochmah Ilaah (Supernal Wisdom).", 
            "[The manner of this descent is] analogous to that of a son who is derived from his father's brain, in that [even] the nails of his feet come into existence from the very same drop of semen,", 
            "by being in the mother's womb for nine months, descending degree by degree, changing continually, until even the nails are formed from it.", 
            "Yet [after all this process] it is still bound and united with a wonderful and essential unity with its original essence and being, which was the drop [as it came] from the father's brain.", 
            "And even now, in the son, the nails receive their nourishment and life from the brain that is in the head.", 
            "As is written in the Gemara (Niddah, ibid.), \"From the white of the father's drop of semen are formed the veins, the bones and the nails.\"", 
            "(And in Etz Chayim, Shaar ha-Chashmal, it is likewise stated, in connection with the esoteric principle of Adam's garments in the Garden of Eden, that they [the garments] were the \"nails\" [derived] from the cognitive faculty of the brain).", 
            "So, as it were, is it actually true of the root of every nefesh, ruach and neshamah in the community of Israel on high: in descending degree by degree, through the descent of the worlds of Atzilut (Emanation), Beriah (Creation), Yetzirah (Formation) and Asiyah (Action) from His blessed Wisdom, as it is written, \"Thou hast made them all with wisdom,\" the nefesh, ruach and neshamah of the ignorant and unworthy come into being.", 
            "Nevertheless they remain bound and united with a wonderful and essential unity with their original essence and entity; namely, the extension of Chochmah Ilaah (Supernal Wisdom),", 
            "inasmuch as the nurture and life of the nefesh, ruach and neshamah of the ignorant are drawn from the nefesh, ruach and neshamah of the saints and sages, the heads of Israel in their generation.", 
            "This explains the comment of our Sages on the verse, \"And to cleave unto Him\"— \"He who cleaves unto a scholar [of the Torah] is deemed by the Torah as if he had become attached to the very Shechinah (Divine Presence).\"", 
            "For, through attachment to the scholars, the nefesh, ruach and neshamah of the ignorant are bound up and united with their original essence and their root in the Supernal Wisdom, He and His wisdom being one, and \"He is the Knowledge etc.,\"", 
            "(As for them who willfully sin and rebel against the sages, the nurture of their nefesh, ruach and neshamah comes from behind the back, as it were, of the nefesh, ruach and neshamah of the scholars).",

            "it is to be understood as meaning that since there is not a nefesh, ruach and neshamah which has not a garment of the nefesh of its father's and mother's essence,",

            "A further explanation of the title \"superior men\" is that their service in the category of \"do good,\" in the fulfillment of the Torah and its commandments, is for the sake of the Above, the ultimate of the highest degrees, and not merely in order to attach themselves to G-d so as to quench the thirst of their [own] soul, which thirsts for G-d, as is written, \"Ho, everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters,\" as is explained elsewhere.",

            "This is the essential aspect of the Shema, the recital of which is enjoined by the Torah, and of the blessings which precede and follow it, which are a Rab-bincal enactment, the latter being the preparation for the fulfillment of the recital of the Shema, as is explained elsewhere.",

            "For in the \"intermediate\" man (benoni) the essence and being of the animal soul from the kelipah in the left part remains entirely undislodged after prayer. For then the burning love of G-d is not in a revealed state in his heart, in the right part,",

            "It is well known that the Patriarchs themselves constitute the \"Chariot.\" For throughout their lives they never for a moment ceased from binding their mind and soul to the Lord of the universe, with the aforementioned absolute surrender to His blessed Unity. Likewise were all the Prophets after them, each according to the station of his soul and the degree of his apprehension, The rank of our teacher Moses, peace to him, surpassed them all, for concerning him it was said, \"The Shechinah speaks out of Moses' throat.\" Something of this [union] the Israelites experienced at Mount Sinai, but they could not endure it, as the Rabbis say, \"At each [Divine] utterance their souls took flight,...\" which is an indication of the extinction of their existence, of which we spoke above. Therefore G-d at once commanded that a Sanctuary be made for Him, with the Holy of Holies for the presence of His Shechinah, which is the revelation of His blessed Unity, as will be explained later.",

Therefore, after contemplating deeply on the subject of this self-nullification, discussed above, according to his capacity, let the person reflect in his heart as follows: \"Inasmuch as my intelligence and the root of my soul are of too limited a capacity to constitute a 'chariot' and abode for His blessed Unity in perfect truth, since my mind cannot at all conceive and apprehend Him with any manner or degree of apprehension in the world, nor even an iota of the apprehension of the Patriarchs and Prophets— if this be so, I shall make for Him a tabernacle and habitation by engaging in the study of the Torah, as my time permits, at appointed times by day and by night, in accordance with the law which was given to each individual in the 'Laws Concerning the Study of the Torah,' and as the Rabbis stated, 'Even one chapter in the morning....' \"", 
            "In this way his heart will be gladdened and he will rejoice and offer praise and thanks for his portion, with a joyous and happy heart, that he has merited to act as host to the Almighty twice daily, to the limit of his available time, and according to the capacity which has been generously bestowed upon him by G-d.",

And through the sacrifices all living creatures were elevated unto G-d through the offering of one beast, all plants through that of one tenth of a measure of fine meal mingled with oil, and so on.

            "Let us elucidate further the term \"to do it.\" Let us also understand, in a very small measure, the purpose of the creation of \"Intermediates\" and the descent of their souls into this world, to be clothed within he animal soul which is derived from the kelipah and sitra achra. Since they will not be able to banish her [the animal soul] throughout their lives, nor to dislodge her from her place in the left part of the heart, so that none of her impure fancies should rise to the brain, inasmuch as the very essence of the animal soul derived from the kelipah remains [in the Intermediates] in her full strength and might as at birth, except that her \"garments\" do not invest their bodies, as discussed above— if so, why have their souls descended into this world to labour in vain, G-d forbid, to wage war throughout their lives against the [evil] nature which they cannot vanquish?",

But the interpretation of the verse certainly is as follows: We have learned that a man must not walk four cubits bareheaded. The reason is that the Shechinah rests on his head; and a wise man's eyes and everything he possesses are 'in his head,' i.e. in Him Who rests and abides above his head; and if his eyes are there, he must know that the Light which shines above his head needs oil; for the body of a man is a wick, and the Light is kindled above it. And King Solomon cried, saying, 'Let there be no lack of oil above thy head.' For the Light on a man's head must have oil, meaning good deeds, and this is the meaning of the phrase, 'The wise man's eyes are in his head.'\" The quotation ends here.", 
            "Now, the meaning of the \"indwelling\" of the Shechinah is the revelation of His blessed Divinity and of the light of the blessed En Sof in anything. That is to say, that such thing merges into the light of G-d, and its reality is completely dissolved in Him; only then does the One G-d abide and manifest Himself in it. But any thing whose reality is not completely nullified in Him, the light of G-d does not abide nor manifest itself therein, even if one be a perfect tzaddik who cleaves to Him with abundant love, since no thought can truly apprehend Him at all. For the truth of \"The Lord is the true G-d\" is His Unity and Oneness— that He is One Alone and there is no reality whatsoever apart from Him. Hence the person who loves [G-d] and [ipso facto] exists [apart] and is not null and void— cannot by his thought apprehend Him at all; and the light of G-d cannot abide and reveal itself in him, except through the fulfillment of the commandments which constitute in reality His blessed will and wisdom without any concealment of Countenance.", 
            "Note: This accords with the comment and explanation which I heard from my teacher, peace to him, on a passage in Etz Chayim stating that the light of the blessed En Sof does not become unified even in the world of Atzilut, unless it clothes itself first in the sefirah of Wisdom— the reason being that the Messed En Sof is the true One Who is One Alone and apart from Whom there is nothing, and this is the level of Wisdom, and so on.", 
            "Therefore, when a person occupies himself in the Torah, his neshamah, which is his divine soul, with her two innermost garments only, namely the power of speech and thought, are absorbed in the Divine light of the blessed En Sof, and are united with it in a perfect union. This constitutes the resting of the Shechinah on his divine soul, as the Rabbis stated, \"Even if one person sedulously occupies himself with the Torah, the Shechinah is with him.\"", 
            "However, in order to draw the light and effulgence of the Shechinah also over his body and animal soul, i.e. on the vital spirit clothed in the physical body, he needs to fulfil the practical commandments which are performed by the body itself. For then the very energy of the body itself which is engaged in this action is absorbed in the Divine light and in His will, and is united with Him in a perfect union. This is the third garment of the divine soul. Thereby also the energy of the vital spirit in the physical body, originating in the kelipat nogah, is transformed from evil to good, and is actually absorbed into holiness like the divine soul itself, since it is this [animal soul] that carries out and performs the act of the commandment, because without it the divine soul could not have been acting through the body at all, for it is spiritual whilst the body is material and coarse. The intermediary linking them is the vital animal soul, which is clothed in the human blood, in the heart and in all the body.", 
            "And although the essence and substance of the animal soul in his heart, namely its evil dispositions, have not yet been absorbed into holiness, nevertheless since they have submitted to holiness and, albeit unwillingly, respond \"Amen\" and agree and are reconciled to perform the commandment, under the preponderance of the divine soul in his brain which rules the heart, and, in the meantime, these [evil dispositions] are in a state of exile or slumber, as it were, as discussed above— therefore, this is no obstacle to the suffusion of the Shechinah over the human body at such time. Thus the energy of the vital soul that is embodied in the performance of the commandment is actually absorbed into the Divine light and is united with it in a perfect union, thereby illuminating the totality of the vital soul throughout the body, and also the physical body itself in a manner of \"Encompassing from above,\" from head to foot. This is what is meant by the phrase, \"The Shechinah rests on his head; the word \"on\" indicates this. Similarly, \"On every [assembly of] ten the Shechinah rests.\"", 
            "Clearly, any such diffusion of the light of the Shechinah, that is the revelation of the light of the blessed En Sof, cannot be termed mutability in Him, G-d forbid, nor multiplicity. Witness the passage in Stair hedrin, where a heretic said to Rabban Gamliel: \"You say that on every assembly often men the Shechinah rests. How many Divine Presences have you, then?\" And he replied to him with an example of the light of the sun which enters through many windows.... The intelligent man will understand."

            "Clearly, the purpose of the Hishtalshelut of the worlds and their descent, degree by degree, is not for the sake of the higher worlds, because for them this is a descent from the light of His blessed Countenance. But the ultimate purpose [of creation] is this lowest world, for such was His blessed will that He shall have satisfaction when the sitra achra is subdued and the darkness is turned to light, so that the Divine light of the blessed En Sof shall shine forth in the place of the darkness and sitra achra throughout this world, all the more strongly and intensely, with the excellence of light emerging from darkness, than its effulgence in the higher worlds, where it shines through \"garments\" and in concealment of the Countenance, which screen and conceal the light of the blessed En Sof, in order that they should not dissolve out of existence.",

            "This culminating fulfillment of the Messianic Era and of the Resurrection of the Dead, which is the revelation of the light of the blessed En Sof in this material world, depends on our actions and service throughout the duration of the galut. For what causes the reward of a commandment is the commandment itself, because by virtue of performing it the person suffuses a flood of light of the blessed En Sof from above downwards, to be clothed in the corporeality of the world, in something that was previously under the dominion of the kelipat nogah, from which it had received its vitality. These are all those things that are [ritually] clean and permissible, wherewith the precept of action is performed, viz., parchment used in the phylacteries and Mezuzah and the scroll of the Torah, as taught by the Rabbis that nothing is fitting for a sacred purpose which is not clean and permissible for consumption; similarly an etrog which is not orlah ;", 
            "Note: For orlah is one of the three completely impure kelipot that can never ascend [into holiness] as explained in Etz Chayim. Similarly the performance of any precept involving a transgression, G-d forbid.",

            "In like manner, the energy of the vital animal soul which is in the organs of the body of the person performing the commandment, is also clothed in this performance, and it rises from the kelipah and is absorbed into the holiness of the precept, which is His blessed will, and is dissolved into the light of the blessed En Sof.", 
            "Likewise in regard to the commandment of Torah study and the recital of Shema and Prayer, and similar precepts, although they do not involve physical action in the strict sense, such as would be dominated by the kelipat nogah. Nevertheless it has been established that meditation cannot take the place of speech, and that a person does not fulfil the commandment until he has uttered [the words] with his lips. And it has been established that the articulation by the lips is deemed as \"action.\" For the divine soul cannot express itself through the lips and mouth and tongue and teeth, which are all corporeal, except through the agency of the vital animal soul, which is clothed in the organs of the physical body. Hence the more strength one puts into his speech, the more of the vital soul's energy does he introduce and invest into those words. This is the meaning of the verse, \"All my bones shall declare... .\" This also is what the Rabbis meant when they said, \"If the Torah reposes in all the 248 organs, it will be preserved; but if not, it will not be preserved.\" For forgetfulness comes from the kelipah of the body and vital animal soul, which are of the kelipat nogah that is sometimes absorbed into holiness, which is accomplished when one weakens their power and transfers all their strength into the holiness of the Torah or Prayer.", 
            "Furthermore, the vital soul's energy which is clothed in the letters of speech in Torah study or Prayer, or the like, or in the precepts of performance, derives its entire growth and vitality from the blood, which is of the kelipat nogah itself, namely, all the foods and drinks which the person has eaten and drunk and which have become blood, having been under its dominion and having drawn their nurtures from it [the kelipat nogah]. But now it is converted from evil to good and is absorbed into holiness, by virtue of the energy of the vital soul that has grown from it, which has now clothed itself in these letters or in this action which constitute the very inwardness of His blessed will, without any concealment of Countenance. And their vitality is also absorbed into the light of the blessed En Sof, which is His blessed will. And with their vitality, the energy of the vital soul is absorbed and elevated. Thereby will ascend also the totality of the kelipat nogah, constituting the general vitality of this material and gross world,", 
            "when the whole neshamah and divine soul of all Israel, which is divided into 600,000 particular offshoots, and each particular soul will fulfil all the 613 commandments of the Torah:—", 
            "The 365 prohibitions, to restrain the 365 blood vessels of the vital soul in the body, so as not to receive nurture or vitality through that sin from one of the three completely unclean kelipot, from which are derived the 365 prohibitions in the Torah together with their offshoots as laid down by the Rabbis; for the vital soul would no longer be able to ascend to G-d if it had been defiled with the impurity of the three unclean kelipot, which can never be elevated but must be completely nullified and annihilated, as is written, \"And I will cause the unclean spirit to pass out of the land\"; and", 
            "The 248 positive precepts, in order to draw the light of the blessed En Sof earthwards, so as to raise up to Him and bind and unite with Him, the totality of the vital soul which is in the 248 organs of the body, with a perfect union, to become truly one, as it was His blessed will that He should have an abode amongst the lowest creatures, and they become a \"vehicle\" (merkavah) for Him, as were the Patriarchs.", 
            "Thus, when the totality of the vital soul of the community of Israel will be a holy merkavah for G-d, then shall the general vitality of this world, now constituting the kelipat nogah, emerge from its impurity and filth and ascend unto holiness to become a merkavah for G-d, through the revelation of His glory, \"And all flesh shall see together,\" and He will shine forth on them with the splendour of His majestic greatness, and the whole world will be filled with the glory of the Lord, and Israel shall behold [it] eye to eye, as at the Giving of the Law, as is written, \"Unto thee it was showed, that thou mightest know, that the Lord, He is G-d; there is nothing else beside Him/' In this way, all three unclean kelipot will be completely destroyed and annihilated, for their present nurture and vitality from holiness comes to them through the medium of the kelipat nogah, which is the intermediary between them.", 
            "It follows, therefore, that the whole fulfillment of the Messianic Era and of the Resurrection of the Dead— which is the revelation of His blessed glory and Divinity, and the banishment of the spirit of impurity from the world— is dependent on the suffusion of His Divinity and of the light of the blessed En Sof over the vital soul of the community of Israel in all its 248 organs, through its fulfillment of all the 248 positive precepts; and on the banishment of the spirit of impurity from it through its observance of all the 365 prohibitions, so that its 365 veins do not derive nurture from it.",

And each one of them contains and is related to the vitality of one part in 600,000 of the totality of the world, which [part] depends on his vital soul for its elevation to G-d through its own [the soul's] elevation, by virtue of the individual's partaking of this world for the needs of his body and vital soul in the service of G-d, viz., eating, drinking, and the like, [his] dwelling and all his utensils.", 
            "Yet these 600,000 particular souls are roots, and each root subdivides into 600,000 sparks, each spark being one neshamah; and so with the nefesh and ruach in each of the four worlds— Atzilut, Beriah, Yetzirah, Asiyah.", 
            "And each spark descended into this world— although it is indeed a profound descent and a state of true exile, for even if one be a perfectly righteous person, serving G-d with fear and a great love of delights, he cannot attain to the degree of attachment to G-d, in fear and love, as before it came down to this gross world, not a fraction of it, and there is no comparison or similarity between them at all, as is clear to every intelligent person, for the body cannot endure,... nevertheless [each spark] descended into this world, to be clothed in a body and vital soul, for the sole purpose of mending them and separating them from the evil of the three impure kelipot, through the observance of the 365 prohibitions and their offshoots, and in order to elevate his vital soul together with its portion that belongs to it of the totality of the world, so as to join and unite them with the light of the blessed En Sof, which the person draws into them through fulfilling all the 248 positive precepts through the agency of the vital soul, the very one that fulfils all the active commandments, as has been explained above. It has also been stated in (Etz Chayim, Portal 26) that the soul itself [neshamah] needs no tikun (mending) at all ... and there is no necessity for it to be embodied in this world ... except in order to bring down the light to mend them ... and this is exactly similar to the esoteric exile of the Shechinah for the purpose of elevating the sparks....", 
            "In the light of the above, one can understand why our Rabbis, of blessed memory, so strongly emphasized the virtue of charity, declaring that \"It balances all the other commandments,\" and throughout the Yerushalmi Talmud it is called simply \"The Commandment,\" for such was the usage of the language to call charity simply \"The Commandment,\" because it is the core of the precepts of action and surpasses them all. For all [precepts] are only intended to elevate the vital soul unto G-d, since it is she [the soul] that performs them and clothes itself in them, thereby being absorbed into the light of the blessed En Sof which is vested in them. Hence you can find no commandment in which the vital soul is clothed to the same extent as in the commandment of charity: for in all [the other] commandments only one faculty of the vital soul is embodied, and then only at the time of the performance of the precept, whilst in the case of charity, which a man gives out of the toil of his hands, surely all the strength of his vital soul is embodied in the execution of his work or occupation by which he earned the money; when he gives it for charity, his whole vital soul ascends to G-d. Even where one does not depend on his toil for a livelihood, nevertheless since with this [charity] money he could have purchased necessities of life, for his vivifying soul, hence he is giving his soul's life to G-d.", 
            "Therefore our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said that it [charity] brings the Redemption nearer. For with one act of charity a person elevates a great part of the vivifying soul, of whose powers and faculties he cannot elevate in the same measure by performing several other active precepts.", 
            "As for the statement of our Rabbis that \"The study of the Torah equals all other commandments combined,\" this is because Torah study is effected through the faculties of speech and thought, which are the innermost garments of the vivifying soul; also the essence and substance of the faculties of ChaBaD (chochmah, binah, da'at) of the kelipat nogah in the vivifying soul are integrated into holiness itself when one occupies oneself in Torah with concentration and intelligence.", 
            "And although the essence and substance of the emotion attributes (middot)— chesed, gevurah, tiferet, and so on— cannot be mastered by Intermediates so as to be converted to holiness, this is because the evil is stronger in the emotion attributes than in the intelligences, by reason of its greater nurture from the holiness of the middot, as is known to those familiar with the Esoteric Discipline.", 
            "Furthermore, and this is the most important aspect of all in the preeminence of Torah study over all other commandments, based on the above-mentioned quotation from the Tikunim, that \"The 248 commandments are the 248 'organs' of the King\": Just as in the case of a human being, by way of example, there is no comparison or similitude between the vitality that is in his 248 organs and the vitality that is in the brain, i.e., the intellect which is subdivided into the three faculties of ChaBaD, exactly analogous, by way of example, yet removed by myriads of distinctions ad infinitum, is the illumination of the light of the blessed En Sof that is clothed in the active precepts, compared with the illumination of the light of the blessed En Sof in the ChaBaD aspects of the wisdom of the Torah, in each man according to his intelligence and mental grasp. And although his apprehension is only in its material aspects, yet the Torah is likened to water, which descends from a high level,... as has been explained above.", 
            "Nevertheless, the Rabbis declared, \"Not learning, but doing is the essential thing.\" It is also written, \"This day to do them.\" And [it has been ruled that] one should interrupt the study of the Torah in order to fulfil an active precept that cannot be performed by others. For, \"This is the whole man,\" and the purpose of his creation and his descent to this world, in order that He have an abode here below especially, to turn darkness into light, so that the glory of the Lord shall fill all of this material world, with the emphasis on material, and \"All flesh shall see it together,\" as has been discussed above.", 
            "On the other hand, when the precept is one that can be performed by others, one does not interrupt the study of the Torah, though the whole Torah is, after all, only an explanation of the active ordinances. The reason is that [the Torah] is, as it were, the ChaBaD of the blessed En Sof, and when a person is engaged in it he draws over himself the light of the blessed En Sof, of an infinitely higher order and splendour than the illumination and influence obtained through the commandments, which are \"The organs of the King.\" This is what Rav Sheshet [meant when he] said, \"Rejoice, O my soul! For thee did I learn Scripture; for thee did I learn Mishnah,\" as is explained elsewhere at length.", 
            "This influence and illumination which man, by means of his occupation with the Torah, draws from the reflected light of the blessed En Sof and causes to shine on his soul and on the souls of all Israel, which is the Shechinah, Keneset Israel, the fount of all the souls of Israel, as will be explained later— is termed \"keriah\" (\"calling\"); hence kore baTorah [\"Calling by means of the Torah\"]. This means that through one's occupation with the Torah one calls to the Holy One, blessed be He, to come to him, to use an anthropomorphism, like a person calling to his companion to come to him, or like a child calling his father to come and join him, so that he should not be separated from him and remain alone, G-d forbid. This is the meaning of the text, \"The Lord is nigh to all that call unto Him; to all that call unto Him in truth,\" and \" 'Truth' applies only to the Torah.\" The meaning is thus rendered in the sense of calling to the Holy One, blessed be He, specifically through the Torah. It is different, however, when one does not call Him through occupation in the Torah, but merely cries: \"Father! Father!\" as the prophet laments over him: \"And none calls by Thy name,...\" as is explained elsewhere. The intelligent person should ponder on this in order to inculcate into himself a great reverence at the time of his occupation with the Torah, as has been previously explained (ch. 23)."

        [
            "In the light of all that has been said above, one will clearly understand the decision of the Halachah, that has been laid down in the Talmud and Codes that meditation is not valid in lieu of verbal articulation, so that if one has recited the Shema only in his mind and heart, even with the full force of his concentration (kavanah), he has not fulfilled his obligation, and he is required to recite it again [orally]. Similarly with grace after meals, which is ordained by the Torah, and with other benedictions ordained by the Rabbis, and with prayer. On the other hand, if he has uttered them with his lips but did not intend with his heart, he has fulfilled his obligation ex post facto, and he is not required to repeat them, except for the first verse of the Shema and the first benediction of the Amidah* Thus it is stated (at the beginning of ch. II of Berachot) : \"Up to here the commandment of intention (kavanah) applies; from here, on comes, the commandment of recitation,\" and so on.", 
            "The reason is that the neshamah needs no tikun (mending) for herself by means of the commandments, but has only to draw forth light to perfect the vivifying soul and body by means of the letters of speech which the nefesh pronounces with the aid of the five organs of verbal articulation. Similarly with the active commandments which the nefesh performs with the [aid of the] other bodily organs.", 
            "Nevertheless, it has been said that \"Prayer or other benediction [recited] without kavanah is like a body without a neshamah\" This means that, just as in all creatures in this world, possessing a body and a soul, namely the nefesh of all living, and the ruach of all human flesh, and the neshamah of all that has the spirit of life in its nostrils among all living creatures, all of which G-d animates and brings into existence ex nihilo, constantly, by the light and vitality which He imbues into them, for also the material body, and even the very inanimate stones and earth, have within them light and vitality from His blessed Self, so that they do not revert to naught and nothingness as they were before— there is, nevertheless, no comparison or similarity whatever between the quality of the light and vitality that illumine the body, and the quality of the light and vitality that illumine the neshamah, which is the soul of all living.", 
            "To be sure, in both there is an identical light, in terms of concealment of the Countenance, and [in terms of] the identical garments wherein the light hides, conceals, and clothes itself, for both [body and soul] are of this world wherein the light and vitality [issuing] from the breath of His blessed mouth is equally concealed in a general way, by virtue of the concealment of the Countenance and graded descent, in the progressive lowering of the worlds, by means of numerous and profound tzimtzumim (contractions) until [the light] has clothed itself in the kelipat nogah, in order to animate the totality of this material world, that is, all things which are permissible and clean in this world; and from it and through it, all things that are impure receive their sustenance, for it is the mediating agent, as it were, as has been explained above.", 
            "Nevertheless, the illumination, i.e., the flow of vitality wherewith G-d illumines and animates by way of this garment, is not the same for all of them in the manner of contraction and expansion.", 
            "For in the corporeal body and in the actually inanimate object, like stones and earth, the illumination is one of greatest contraction which has no parallel,, where the vitality is so minute as not to have even the power of vegetation. In plants the illumination is not so greatly contracted. In general, all things are subdivided into four grades— mineral, vegetable, animal and man (\"speaker\")— corresponding with the four letters of the blessed Name [Tetragrammaton], from which they receive their influence.", 
            "And just as the illumination and flow of vitality in the inanimate and vegetable bear no comparison or parallel with the illumination and flow of vitality which is clothed in animals and man, although in all there is one equal light in the category of concealed Countenance, which is clothed in the same garment in all of them, namely, the garment of nogah,— so, too, there is no comparison or parallel between the illumination and flow of the light of the blessed En Sof— the inwardness of His blessed will, without concealment of the Countenance and without any garment whatever— which irradiates and pervades the active precepts; likewise in the case of precepts that depend on verbal articulation and utterance of the lips without kavanah, which [articulation] is regarded as real action, as mentioned above, by comparison with the illumination and flow of the light of the blessed En Sof which irradiates and pervades the kavanah of the active precepts that a person intends, whilst engaged in performing them, to cleave to Him, blessed be He, through fulfilling His will, inasmuch as He and His will are one and the same. Similarly in the case of kavanah in prayer, the recital of Shema with its benedictions, and all other benedictions, wherein through his intention (kavanah) he attaches his thought and intellect to Him, may He be blessed.", 
            "Not that an attachment (devekut) of the human thought and intellect to Him, blessed be He, is intrinsically superior to the attachment through the performance of the active precepts in actual practice, as will be explained further on. Rather it is also His blessed will that one should cleave to Him with one's intelligence, thought and intention in the active commandments, and with intention during the recital of Shema, prayer and other benedictions. And the illumination of this Supreme Will (Ratzon Elyon) which irradiates and pervades this kavanah is infinitely greater and more sublime than the illumination of the Supreme Will which irradiates and pervades the performance of the commandments themselves in action and speech but without kavanah. It is comparable to the superiority of the light of the soul over the body, which is a vessel and garb for the soul, as the body of the commandment itself is a vessel and garb for its kavanah.", 
            "And although in both of them, in the commandment and in its kavanah, there is the same Will which is perfectly simple, without any change or multiplicity, G-d forbid, which is united with His blessed Essence and Being in perfect unity, nevertheless the illumination is not the same in respect of contraction and extension, and", 
            "Note: It is also so explained in Etz Chayim, that the kavanah of the commandments and of Torah study is in the category of \"light\" while the commandments themselves are grades and categories of \"vessels\" that constitute tzimtzum of the light, for through the contraction of the light the vessels came into being, as is known to those who are familiar with the Esoteric Discipline.", 
            "it, too, is differentiated into four grades. For the \"body\" of the commandments themselves constitute two grades, namely, the commandments involving real action and those which are performed verbally and mentally, such as the study of the Torah, reciting the Shema, praying, saying Grace after meals, and other benedictions. The kavanah of the commandments [i.e. the intention] to cleave to His blessed Self, being like the soul to the body [of the commandments], is likewise subdivided into two grades, corresponding to the two categories of soul which are present in corporeal bodies, namely in animals and in man [respectively].", 
            "In the case of a person who is intelligent enough to know G-d and to reflect on His blessed greatness, and to beget out of his understanding a lofty fear in his brain and a love of G-d in the right part of his heart, so that his soul will thirst for G-d, [seeking] to cleave unto Him through the fulfillment of the Torah and commandments, which are an extension and reflection of the light of the blessed En Sof onto his soul thereby to cleave to Him; and with this intention he studies [the Torah] and performs the commandments, and likewise with this intention he prays and recites the blessings— then this kavanah is, by way of simile, like the soul of a human being, who possesses intelligence and freedom of choice and speaks from knowledge.", 
            "But he whose intelligence is too limited to know and reflect on the greatness of the blessed En Sof so as to beget out of this understanding a conscious love in his heart, and also awe in his mind, and dread of G-d in his heart, yet he recalls and awakens the natural love that is hidden in his heart, bringing it out of the hidden recesses of the heart into the conscious mind, at least, so that his will which is in his mind and which is latent also in his heart should approve, and favour, with complete 'willingness and truthful sincerity, that he suffer martyrdom in actual fact for the Unity of G-d, in order to attach to Him his divine soul and her garments and unite them with His Unity and Oneness, namely, the Supernal Will that is clothed in Torah study and in the performance of the commandments, as explained above; and in this [natural love] is contained also fear [wherewith] to accept His reign and not rebel against Him, G-d forbid— and with this kavanah he turns away from evil and does good, and studies and prays and recites benedictions, following only the plain meaning of the words without conscious fear and love in his heart and mind— this kavanah is, by way of the simile, like the soul of a living creature that has no intelligence and freedom of will, whose middot, namely its fear of harmful things and its love of pleasing things, are only natural to it, and do not originate in its understanding and knowledge. So, by way of example, are the natural love and fear which are latent in the heart of every Jew, since they are our heritage from our Patriarchs and like a natural instinct in our souls, as has been mentioned above."

            "It is also for this reason that the angels are called chayyot (beasts) and behemot (cattle), as is written, \"And the face of a lion on the right side ... and the face of an ox on the left side,...\" for they have no freedom of choice, and their fear and love are their natural instincts, as stated in Raaya Mehemna on Parshat Pinchas. Therefore the quality of tzaddikim is superior to theirs, for the abode of the souls of the righteous is in the world of Beriah, whereas the abode of the angels is in the world of Yetzirah.", 
            "Note: This refers to ordinary angels, but there are higher angels in the world of Beriah, whose service is with intelligent fear and love, as is explained in Ra'aya Mehemna, ibid., that there are two kinds of holy chayyot, instinctive and intelligent, as also explained in Etz Chayim.", 
            "The difference between them is that in the world of Yetzirah only the middot of the blessed En Sof shine forth, namely the love of Him, and the dread and fear of Him,... as is stated (in the Tikunim and in Etz Chayim) that the six Sefirot .nest in [the world of] Yetzirah. Therefore it is the constant service of the angels, resting neither by day nor by night, to stand in fear and dread,... these being the whole camp of Gabriel on the left; while the service of the camp of Michael is with love. ... But in the world of Beriah shine forth the chochmah, binah and da'at of the blessed En Sof which are the source of the Middot and their \"mother\" and root, as stated in the Tikunim that ima ilaa (\"Supernal Mother\") nests in the three Sefirot, in the \"[Divine] Throne\" which is the world of Beriah. Therefore this is the abode of the souls of the righteous who serve G-d with fear and love, which are derived from the understanding and knowledge of the greatness of the blessed En Sof. For this love is called re'uta delibba (\"heart's desire\"), as has already been mentioned. And from this \"heart's desire\" is produced a garment for the soul in the world of Beriah which constitutes the Higher Garden of Eden, as will be explained later, and as is written in the Zohar on [Parshat] Vayakhel.", 
            "But this applies specifically to neshamot , which [possess] a greatcognition, as it were, of the blessed En Sof. As for the category of ruach of the righteous, as also all other souls of Israelites who have served G-d with the fear and love that are latent in the heart of all Jews, these do not ascend thither, except on the Sabbath and the New Moon by means of the pillar that rises from the Lower to the Higher Garden of Eden, i.e. the world of Beriah which is called the Higher Garden of Eden, wherein to take pleasure in G-d and derive enjoyment from the splendour of the Shechinah. For the intellect of a created being can have no enjoyment or pleasure except in what it conceives, understands, knows and apprehends, with its intellect and apprehension, what is possible for it to understand and grasp of the light of the blessed En Sof, by virtue of His blessed wisdom and understanding which shine forth in the world of Beriah.", 
            "As for the reason that these souls merit to ascend higher than the angels, even though their service has been with no more than natural fear and love, it is that through their fear and love the sitra achra which was clothed in their body was subdued, both in the realm of \"depart from evil\"— by subjugating and breaking the passions, and in the realm of \"do good,\" as discussed earlier. For they had the freedom to choose evil, G-d forbid, yet they chose the good in order to subdue the sitra achra, thereby elevating the glory of the Holy One, blessed be He,... as the excellence of light, ... discussed above.", 
            "However, all this is concerned with the abode of the souls and their station, but their Torah and service are actually absorbed into the Ten Sefirot which are a category of G-dliness and with which the light of the blessed En Sof unites itself in perfect unison; that is to say, in the Ten Sefirot of Beriah— through intelligent fear and love, and in the Ten Sefirot of Yetzirah— through natural fear and love. In them are clothed the Ten Sefirot of Atzilut (Emanation) and are completely united with them, while the Ten Sefirot of Atzilut are absolutely united with their Emanator, the blessed En Sof. The souls, on the other hand, are not absorbed into the G-dliness of the Ten Sefirot, but are stationed in the hechalot (palaces) and abodes of Beriah or Yetzirah, enjoying the effulgence of the Shechinah, the light of the blessed En Sof, which is united with the Ten Sefirot of Beriah or Yetzirah, it being the glow of their very Torah and service (see Zohar, Vayakhel, p. 210), for \"the reward of a commandment is the commandment itself.\"", 
            "The world of Atzilut, however, is beyond the intelligence, comprehension and understanding of a created intellect, because the chochmah, binah and da'at of the blessed En Sof are united with it therein in perfect unity, a profound and wonderful unity which infinitely excels, in degree and form, that which is found in the world of Beriah; for in the latter they descended to give light by means of tzimtzum, so that created intellects should be able to receive from them ChaBaD (chochmah, binah, da'at), to know G-d and to understand and apprehend something of the light of the blessed En Sof, to the extent possible for created intellects which are limited and finite, without their being dissolved in their existence and ceasing completely to exist as created beings, only to revert to their source and root, namely, G-dliness itself.", 
            "It is this tzimtzum that is the cause of the glow of ChaBaD of the blessed En Sof illuminating the souls in the world of Beriah. It is different in [the world of] Atzilut, where they [ChaBaD] are not subject to the same extent of tzimtzum; consequently it is impossible for created intellects to apprehend them. That is why no thought of the [created intellects] can apprehend anything there. Hence it is the abode of the great tzaddikim, whose service supremely transcends even the quality of fear and love which are derived from the understanding and knowledge of His blessed greatness, just as the world of Atzilut is far beyond the understanding and knowledge of a created intellect. Indeed, their service has been truly in the nature of a \"vehicle\" to the blessed En Sof, being nullified to Him in existence and absorbed in His blessed light, they and everything they possessed, through the fulfillment of the Torah and commandments, in the way which has been said of the Patriarchs that they personally constituted the Chariot, because throughout their lives this was their service.", 
            "But as for him whose soul's root is too small to contain such perfect service, so as to be nullified and absorbed in His blessed light by constant service, but only at such intervals and times which are propitious on high, viz. during the prayer of the Amidah which is in Atzilut, especially when making the genuflexions, for genuflexion characterises Atzilut (as explained in Peri Etz Chayim on the prayer of the Inauguration of the Sabbath), since it symbolises self-nullification in His blessed light to be accounted as nothing at all before Him— in such a case, therefore, the principal abode of his soul is in the world of Beriah (and only occasionally, at propitious times, does his soul ascend to Atzilut, by virtue of the \"feminine waters,\" as is known to those familiar with the Esoteric Discipline).", 
            "\"The reward of a commandment is the commandment itself\" means that from the reward we know its essence and rank. But we do not concern ourselves with esoteric matters, which are [related to] the great tzaddikim who are in the category of a \"vehicle.\" Our concern is with matters that are \"revealed to us,\" to which every man should aspire: To know with certainty the essence and quality of Divine Service, with a conscious fear and love in one's heart, stemming from understanding and knowledge of the greatness of the blessed En Sof, which has its place in the Ten Sefirot of Beriah; and of service with the natural fear and love in the mind, [which is] in the Ten Sefirot of Yetzirah. But a service without the inspiration of fear and love even in the mind, in a conscious state, that is to say, without arousing the natural love which is hidden in the heart and bringing it out of the concealment and recesses of the heart into the consciousness of the mind and the latency of the heart at any rate, but it remains hidden in the heart as at birth, as it was prior to the service— such a service remains below, in the world of \"separateness,\" called the externality of the worlds, having no power to rise and be absorbed in His blessed Unity, in the Ten Holy Sefirot, as is written in the Tikunim that \"Without fear and love it cannot soar upwards nor can it ascend and stand before G-d.\"", 
            "This is so even if the service is not strictly \"Not for its own sake,\" that is, for some ulterior motive, Heaven forfend. It also applies to the service which is described as \"Their fear toward Me has become [like] a trained human precept,\" that is to say, it is a matter of habit to which the person has become accustomed since infancy, having been habituated and trained by his. father and teacher to fear G-d and to serve Him, but he does not really do it for its own sake. For [performance] truly for its own sake cannot be without arousing at least the innate fear and love and bringing them out from the concealment of the heart into the consciousness of the mind and the latency of the heart, at any rate. For just as a person does nothing for his companion in carrying out the latter's will, unless he loves him or fears him, so one cannot truly act for His blessed Name, just to carry out His will, without recalling and arousing any love or fear for Him in his mind and thought and the latency of his heart, at least.", 
            "Nor is love alone called \"service\" without at least the lower fear (yirah tattaah), which is latent in every Jewish heart, as will be later amplified.", 
            "However, when a person is engaged [in service] truly not for its own sake, but for some personal motive, with a view to his own glorification, as, for example, in order to become a scholar, and the like, then that motive, which originates in the kelipat nogah, clothes itself in his Torah, and the Torah is temporarily in a state of exile in the kelipah, until he repents, since \"[Repentance] brings healing to the world.\" For with his return to G-d, his Torah also returns with him. Therefore the Rabbis of blessed memory declared, \"A man should always occupy himself [with Torah and precepts, even if not for its own sake], for from motives of self-interest he will come [to study and observe] for its own sake\"— [this they state] with certainty, for ultimately he is bound to do repentance, whether in this incarnation or in another, \"Because none is rejected by Him.\"", 
            "On the other hand, if a person acts without any particular motivation, neither \"For its own sake\" nor for selfish reasons, then it is not contingent upon repentance, but as soon as he, once again, learns this subject \"For its own sake,' then even that which he had learned without any particular intent, conjoins and attaches itself with this study and ascends on high, since it had not yet been invested with any kelipot nogah. Therefore \"A man should always occupy himself....\"",

            "However, as long as he has not re-studied that subject \"For its own sake,\" his study does not ascend even into the Ten Sefirot which shine in the worlds of Yetzirah and Asiyah. For the Sefirot are a category of G-dliness, and in them is clothed and united the light of the blessed En Sof itself, and \"Without fear and love it cannot rise and stand before G-d,\" as is written in the Tikunim. But his study ascends into the hechalot and abodes which are the externalities of the worlds, wherein the angels stand. Thus Rabbi Chayim Vital, of blessed memory, writes in \"The Gate of Prophecy,\" ch. 2, that from Torah studied without kavanah angels are created in the world of Yetzirah, whilst from commandments performed without kavanah, angels are created in the world of Asiyah— and all angels are possessed of matter and form.",

            "[The reason Torah requires kavanah to ascend on high] albeit the Torah and the Holy One, blessed be He, are altogether One, for He and His will are One [is as follows.] Although the Holy One, blessed be He, fills all worlds alike, nevertheless the worlds are not all of equal rank. The difference is due to the recipients in two respects: Firstly, in that the higher worlds receive a radiance infinitely greater than the lower; and, secondly, in that they receive it without as many \"garments\" and \"screens\" as the lower. And this world is the lowest world in both aspects, for the radiance that is in it is greatly contracted unto the utmost limit; hence it is corporeal and material. And even this [contracted radiance] comes in many \"garments\" and \"screens\" until it is clothed in the kelipat nogah, to animate all clean things in this world, including the vivifying, articulate soul in man. [Consider,] therefore, [this animal soul] as it utters words of Torah and prayer without kavanah. These are holy letters, of course, and the kelipat nogah in the vivifying soul constitutes no separating curtain in any degree concealing and covering His blessed Holiness clothed in them, as it conceals and covers His blessed Holiness in the vivifying soul when it speaks idle words, or as in the vivifying soul of any of the other living creatures that are clean. And though there is no place that is void of Him, yet He is the \"Most hidden One of all the hidden,\" and is called the \"Hidden G-d.\" So too, the radiance and extension of vitality from Him, may He be blessed, is hidden in the many dense \"garments\" and \"screens\" until it is clothed and concealed in the garment of nogah. This is not, however, the case with the holy letters in the words of Torah and Prayer, wherein, oh the contrary, the kelipat nogah is converted to good and is absorbed into this Holiness, as is discussed above. Nevertheless the glow of His blessed Holiness that is in them is in a state of tzimtzum to the utmost limit, since the voice and speech are material.", 
            "But in the case of prayer with kavanah and Torah with kavanah \"For its own sake,\" the kavanah is clothed in the letters of the speech because it is their source and root, since by reason and cause of it he speaks these letters. Therefore it elevates them to its level in the Ten Sefirot of Yetzirah or Beriah, according to whether the kavanah is inspired by intelligent or natural fear and love,... as has been discussed above. There the light of the blessed En Sof, namely, the blessed Higher Will which is clothed in the letters of the Torah which he studies and in their kavanah, or in the prayer and its kavanah, or in the commandment and its kavanah, shines forth and is revealed with a great and infinite brightness that cannot shine forth and be revealed at all in any manner or form as long as the letters and the commandment are still in this material world, until the era of the end of days, when the world will be uplifted from its materiality, \"And the glory of the Lord will be revealed,...\" as has been previously discussed at length.",

And although the soul of the person who occupies himself in the Torah and in the commandment does not derive from Atzilut, nevertheless the Higher Will that is clothed in this commandment and which is identical with the very halachah or word of the Torah in which he is occupied, is G-dliness and light of the blessed En Sof, the Emanator, for He and His will are One, and by His blessed will He has caused His attributes to emanate from Him yet they are united with Him, may He be blessed. By the revelation of His will, which becomes manifest through this occupation with the Torah and the particular commandment they [the attributes] coalesce into one another and the Gevurot are sweetened by Chasidim at this propitious moment.", 
            "In the light of the above it will be clearly understood why fear and love are figuratively called \"wings,\" as is written: \"And with twain did he fly,\" (and as Rabbi Chayim Vital, of blessed memory, explained in Shaar ha-Yichudim, ch. n), that the wings are to a bird what arms are to a man.... And in Tikunim it is explained that they who occupy themselves with Torah and commandments in fear and love are called \"children\"; otherwise they are called \"fledglings\" that cannot fly.", 
            "Note: In Tikun 45 it is written that the [figure of a] bird represents Metatron. His head is the letter yod, and the body is the letter vav and the two wings are the two [letters] hai, and so forth. This refers to the world of Yetzirah which is identified with Metatron, wherein are the \"bodies\" of the halachot of the Mishnah; his head symbolises the intellectual aspects, the chochmah, binah, da'at (ChaBaD), that is the inwardness of the halachot, their esoteric meaning and their reasons; whilst the two wings— fear and love— refer to the higher hai, which is love, and the lower hai, ivhich is the lower fear fyirah tattaahj, namely, the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven and the dread of G-d, like the awe one feels in the presence of a king,.for example; for this is an external and exposed fear, unlike the higher fear (yirah ilaah), which is a feeling of shame, which is of \"The hidden things belonging to the Lord our G-d\" and it is found in the Higher Wisdom (chochmah ilaah), symbolising the letter yod of the blessed Name [Tetragrammaton], as is explained in Ra'aya Mehemna.", 
            "For just as the wings of a bird are not the essential parts of it, and its vitality does not depend on them at all— as we have learned, that \"If its wings have been removed, it is kasher\" (ritually clean), the essential parts being its head and entire body, while the wings merely serve the head and body, enabling it to fly with their aid— so, by way of example, are the Torah and commandments the essential aspect of the Higher Union through the manifestation of the Higher Will that is revealed through them, while the fear and love raise them to that place where the Will, the light of the blessed En Sof, and the union (Yichud), are revealed, namely, the worlds of Yetzirah and Beriah.", 
            "Note: Or even in [the world of] Asiyah, in the ten Sefirot of holiness, the abode of the active commandments and also of [the study of] Holy Writ. But in the case of the Mishnah, the Yichud and light of the blessed En Sof are revealed in [the world of] Yetzirah; and, in the case of Talmud, in [the world of] Beriah. This means that when one studies Holy Writ, the Yichud and light of the blessed En Sof are diffused from Atzilut to Asiyah; and in [the study of] Mishnah [they reach] to Yetzirah only; and in [the case of] Talmud— to Beriah only. For they are all in Atzilut. As for Kabbalah, it is not diffused at all from Atzilut to Beriah, Yetzirah and Asiyah, as is explained in Peri Etz Chayim.", 
            "And although fear and love also form part of the 613 commandments, nevertheless they are called \"wings,\" for the consummation of love is the service out of love, and love without service is a \"love of delights\" delighting in G-d, which is of the nature of the world to come and the receiving of reward, as it is written, \"This day— to do them,\" \"and tomorrow\" [in the world to come] — to receive one's reward. But he who has not attained this dimension of savouring the nature of the world to come, but whose soul still yearns and thirsts for G-d and goes out to Him all day, yet he does not quench his thirst with the water of the Torah that is in front of him— such a man is like one who stands in a river and cries: \"Water! Water to drink!\" Thus the prophet laments over such a man: \"Ho, every one that thirsteth, go ye to the waters.\" For in its simple meaning the verse makes no sense: Surely, he who is thirsty and longs to learn will study of his own accord; why, then, does the prophet need to rebuke him \"Ho?\" This is explained at length elsewhere."
        ], 
        [
            "One must, however, constantly bear in mind the beginning of the service and its core and root. By this is meant that, although fear is the root of \"Depart from evil\" and love— of \"Do good,\" nevertheless it is not sufficient to awaken the love alone to do good, but one must at least first arouse the innate fear which lies hidden in the heart of every Jew not to rebel against the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, as has been stated above, so that this [fear] shall manifest itself in his heart or, at least, his mind. This means that he should at least contemplate in his thought on the greatness of the blessed En Sof, and on His Kingship, which extends to all worlds, both higher and lower, and that \"He fills all worlds and encompasses all worlds,\" as is written: \"Do I not fill heaven and earth?\" Yet He leaves both the higher and lower [worlds] and uniquely bestows His Kingdom upon His people Israel, in general, and upon him in particular, as, indeed, a man is obliged to say: \"For my sake was the world created.\" And on his part, he accepts His Kingdom upon himself, that He be King over him, to serve Him and do His will in all kinds of servile work.", 
            "\"And, behold, G-d stands over him,\" and \"The whole world is full of His glory,\" and He looks upon him and \"Searches his reins and heart\" [to see] if he is serving Him as is fitting. Therefore he must serve in His presence with awe and fear like one standing before the king.", 
            "One must meditate profoundly and at length on this thought according to the capacity of apprehension of his brain and thought and according to the time available to him, before he occupies himself with Torah or a commandment, such as prior to putting on his Tallit or phylacteries.", 
            "He should also reflect how the light of the blessed En Sof, which encompasses all worlds and pervades all worlds, which is identical with the Higher Will, is clothed in the letters and wisdom of the Torah and in the tzitzit (Fringes) and the phylacteries, and through his study or donning these latter he draws over himself His blessed light, that is, over \"The portion of G-dliness from above'' which is within his body, that it may be absorbed and nullified in His blessed light. Specifically, in the case of the phylacteries, [he should intend] that the attributes of wisdom and understanding which are in his divine soul may be nullified and absorbed into the attributes of wisdom and understanding of the blessed En Sof, which are clothed, in particular, in the chapters of קדש and והיה כי יביאך . That is to say, that he should use his wisdom and understanding that are in his soul, only for G-d alone. Similarly that the attribute of da'at that is in his soul, which includes both chesed (kindness) and gevurah (sternness), i.e., fear and love, in his heart, be nullified and absorbed into the attribute of the Higher Knowledge, which contains chesed and gevurah which is clothed in the chapters of שׁמע and והיה אם שׁמוע . This is what is written in the Shulchan Aruch: \"That he make his heart and brain subservient to Him....\"", 
            "And whilst putting on the tzitzit he should bear in mind, what is written in the Zohar, namely, to draw over himself His blessed Kingdom, which is the Kingdom over all worlds,... to bestow it particularly upon us through this commandment. And this corresponds to the subject of: \"Thou shalt surely set a king over thee.\"", 
            "In such a case, even though after all this [contemplation] no fear or dread descends upon him in a manifest manner in his heart, nevertheless since he accepts upon himself the Kingdom of Heaven and draws fear of Him, blessed be He, over himself in his conscious thought and rational volition, and this submission is beyond doubt a sincere one— for it is the nature of all Jewish souls not to rebel against the blessed Holy King— then the Torah he studies or the commandment he performs because of this submission and because of this inspired fear in his mind, are termed \"perfect service,\" like all service [performed] by a slave to his master or to his king.", 
            "On the other hand, if one studies and performs the commandment with love alone, in order to cleave to Him through His Torah or commandments, it is not termed \"Service of a servant,\" which is what the Torah demands, vizi, \"And ye shall serve the Lord your G-d,...\" and \"Him shall ye serve,...\" as explained in the Zohar (Parshat Behar): \"Just like the ox on which one first places a yoke in order to make it useful to the world ... so too must a human being first of all submit to the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven ... and if this submission is not found in him, holiness cannot rest on him....\" (See also Ra'aya Mehemna, ibid., 111b) that every man must be of two categories and levels, namely, the category of a servant and that of a son. And although there is a son who is also a servant, it is not possible to attain to this degree without the prerequisite of yirah ilaah, as is known to the initiated.", 
            "Furthermore, even in the case of him who in his mind and thought feels no fear or shame on account of the poor capacity of his soul, originating in the lower degrees of the Ten Sefirot of Asiyah, nevertheless since he is intent in his service to serve the King, it is a complete service, for fear and service are accounted as two commandments of the total of 613, and they do not deter each other. But as a matter of fact, he also fulfils the commandment of fear in that he introduces the fear into his thought, for at this hour and moment, at any rate, there rests on him the fear of Heaven, at least like the fear in the presence of an ordinary mortal, even not a king, who is watching him, when he would restrain himself from doing anything unbecoming in the other's eyes. This is termed fear, as Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai said to his disciples: \"May it be G-d's will that the fear of Heaven be upon you like the fear of a human being ... for you know that when a person commits a sin, he says [to himself], 'May no-one see me.'...\" However, such fear is termed yirah tattaah (\"lower fear\") and yirat tattaah (\"fear of sin\") which precedes wisdom, while the higher fear is the fear of shame.... For there are two kinds of fear....", 
            "Without any fear at all, however, it does not soar on high through love alone, just as a bird cannot fly with one wing, for fear and love are the two wings (as has been explained in the Tikunim). Similarly, fear alone is but one wing, and one's service cannot ascend on high with it, although it is termed the \"Service of a servant,\" for there must also be the filial quality, in order to awaken, at least, the natural love that is hidden in his heart, to become conscious of it in his mind at any rate, to be aware of his love of the One G-d in his thought and desire to cleave to Him, may He be blessed. This should be his kavanah when occupying himself with the Torah or the particular commandment, that his divine soul as well as his vivifying soul, together with their \"garments,\" shall cleave to Him, as has been explained above.", 
            "Yet in fact the Rabbis, of blessed memory, have said that a man should never separate himself from the community. Therefore he should intend to unite and attach to Him, blessed be He, the fount of his divine soul and the fount of the souls of all Israel, being the spirit of His blessed mouth, called by the name Shechinah, because it dwells and clothes itself in all worlds, animating them and giving them existence, and is that which imbues him with the power of speech to utter the words of Torah, or with the power of action to perform the particular commandment.", 
            "This union is attained through the drawing forth of the light of the blessed En Sof here below by means of occupation in the Torah and the commandments wherein [the light of the En Sof] is clothed. And he should be intent on drawing His blessed light over the fount of his soul and of the souls of all Israel to unite them. The meaning of this union will be discussed at length later on, note there. This is the meaning of \"For the sake of the Union of the Holy One, blessed be He, with His Shechinah, in the name of all Israel.\"", 
            "Note: Thereby the Gevurot will, of themselves, also be sweetened by the Chasadim through the coalescence of the Middot and their union by means of the revelation of the blessed Higher Will which is revealed on high through the impulsion from below, namely, its revelation here below in the occupation in the Torah and commandment which are His blessed will. Thus it is written in Idra Rabba and in Mishnat Chassidim, tractate Arich Anpin, ch. 4, that the 613 commandments of the Torah are derived from the \"whiteness\" of Arich Anpin, which is the Higher Will, the source of the Chasadim.*", 
            "And although in order that this kavanah should be sincere in his heart, so that his heart should truly desire this Yichud Elyon (Higher Union), there needs to be in his heart the \"great love\" (אהבה רבה ) for G-d alone, to do what is gratifying only to Him and not [even] for the purpose of satiating his own soul which thirsts for. G-d, but he must be \"Like a son who strives for the sake of his father and mother, whom he loves more than his own body and soul,...\" (as explained above in the name of Ra'aya Mehemna), nevertheless every man should habituate himself to this kavanah. For though it may not be in his heart in perfect and complete truth, so that he should long for it with all his heart, nevertheless his heart does genuinely desire it to some small extent, because of the natural love in every Jewish heart to do whatever is the blessed Higher Will. And this union is his true desire, namely the Higher Union in Atzilut, which is produced by the impulsion from below, through the union of the divine soul and its absorption into the light of G-d which is clothed in the Torah and commandments in which it occupies itself so that they become One in reality, as has been explained above. For by reason of this, are also united the source of Torah and commandments, i.e., the Holy One, blessed be He, with the source of his divine soul which is called Shechinah. These are the two categories of \"filling all worlds\" and of \"encompassing all worlds,\" as is explained elsewhere at length.", 
            "But the union of the soul with, and its absorption into, the light of G-d, making them one, this is what every member of Israel desires in very truth, utterly, with all his heart and all his soul, because of the natural love that is hidden in every Jewish heart to cleave to G-d and not, under any circumstances, to be parted or sundered or separated, G-d forbid, from His blessed Unity and Oneness, even at the cost of his very life. And occupation in the Torah and commandments and prayer is also a matter of actual surrender of the soul, as when it leaves the body at the end of seventy years, for it no longer thinks of bodily needs, but its thought is united with, and clothed in, the letters of the Torah and prayer, which are the word and thought of the blessed G-d, and they truly become one. This is [also] the whole occupation of the souls in the Garden of Eden, as is stated in the Gemara and in the Zohar, except that there they find delight in their apprehension of, and absorption into, the light of G-d.", 
            "This is why it was ordained to recite at the beginning of the morning blessings before the prayer: \"O my G-d, the soul which Thou gavest me is pure ... Thou didst breathe it into me ... and Thou wilt take it from me....\" Meaning: Inasmuch as Thou didst breathe it into me and Thou wilt take it from me, I therefore as of now hand it over and return it to Thee to unite it with Thy Oneness, as is written: \"Unto Thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul,\" that is, through the binding of my thought with Thy thought, and of my speech with Thy speech, by means of the letters of the Torah and of prayer; and, especially, when one speaks to G-d in the second person, as \"Blessed art Thou,\" and the like.", 
            "With this preparedness to surrender his soul to G-d, he should begin [to recite] the morning benedictions: \"Blessed art Thou....\" Similarly, with this preparedness he should also begin to learn a regular course of study immediately after prayer. So, also in the course of the day, such preparation is necessary at least before he begins to study, as is known that the essential preparation [of intent] \"for its own sake,\" where it is sine qua non, is before the beginning of study in the case of Intermediates. This is the same as in the case of [writing] a bill of divorce or a scroll of the Torah, requiring sine qua non \"for their own sake,\" and it is sufficient if at the commencement of writing he says: \"I am now about to write for the sacred purpose of the scroll of the Law,\" or [in the case of a bill of divorce] \"For him and for her... ,\" However, when he studies for a number of consecutive hours he should reflect on the preparedness referred to above, at least at hourly intervals. For in each hour there is a different flow from the higher worlds to animate those who dwell here below, while the flow of vitality of the previous hour returns to its source (in accordance with the esoteric principle of the \"Advance and Retreat\" in Sefer Yetzirah) together with all the Torah and good deeds of those who dwell here below [performed within that hour]. For in each hour of the twelve hours of the day, there rules one of the twelve combinations of the blessed Tetragrammaton, whilst the combinations of the name A-D-N-Y rule at night, as is known.", 
            "Now, all his intent in the surrender of his soul to G-d through Torah and prayer, to elevate the spark of G-dliness therein back to its source, should be solely for the purpose of bringing gratification before Him, may He be blessed, as, for example, the joy of a king when his only son returns to him, being released from captivity or imprisonment, as has been mentioned above.", 
            "This kavanah is genuinely and truly sincere in every Jewish soul at every season and every hour, by virtue of the natural love which is a heritage bequeathed to us from our ancestors. Nevertheless one needs to establish set periods for reflecting on the greatness of G-d in order to attain intelligent fear and love, and with all that, perhaps one may succeed, as has been stated previously."
        ], 
        [
            "In the light of what has already been said on the subject of the lower kind of fear, one will clearly understand the Talmudic comment on the verse: \"And now, O Israel, what doth the Lord thy G-d require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy G-d.\" [The Gemara asks:] \"Is fear, then, such a small thing?\" [And the Gemara replies:] \"Yes, in the case of Moses it was a small thing,\" and so forth. At first glance the answer is incomprehensible, for it is written: \"What doth the Lord require of thee?\" [not of Moses].", 
            "The explanation, however, is as follows: Each and every soul of the house of Israel contains within it something of the quality of our teacher Moses, peace unto him, for he is one of the \"seven shepherds\" who cause vitality and G-dliness to flow to the community of Jewish souls, for which reason they are called \"shepherds.\" Our teacher, Moses, peace unto him, is the sum of them all, and he is called \"the faithful shepherd.\" This means that he brings down the quality of da'at (knowledge) to the community of Israel that they may know the Lord, each according to the capacity of his soul and its root above, and its nurture from the root of the soul of our teacher Moses, peace unto him, which is rooted in the Da'at Elyon (Higher Knowledge) of the Ten Sefirot of Atzilut, which are united with their blessed Emanator, for He and His Knowledge are One, and He is the Knowledge....", 
            "In addition and beyond this [general influence to the community as a whole] there descend, in every generation, sparks from the soul of our teacher Moses, peace unto him, and they clothe themselves in the body and soul of the sages of that generation, the \"eyes\" of the congregation, to impart knowledge to the people that they may know the greatness of G-d and serve Him with heart and soul. For the service of the heart is according to the dart (knowledge) as is written: \"Know thou the G-d of thy father, and serve Him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind.\" Bat regarding the future [Messianic Era] it is written: \"And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know Me....\"", 
            "However, the essence of knowledge is not the knowing alone, that people should know the greatness of G-d from authors and books; but the essential thing is to immerse one's mind deeply into the the greatness of G-d and fix one's thought on G-d with all the strength and vigour of the heart and mind, until his thought shall be bound to G-d with a strong and mighty bond, as it is bound to a material thing that he sees with his physical eyes and concentrates his thought on it. For it is known that da'at connotes union, as in the phrase \"And Adam yada (knew) Eve....\"", 
            "This capacity and this quality of attaching one's \"knowledge\" to G-d is present in every soul of the House of Israel by virtue of its nurture from the soul of our teacher Moses, peace unto him. Only, since the soul has clothed itself in the body, it needs a great and mighty exertion, doubled and redoubled:— First is the wearying of the flesh, the crushing of the body and its submission, so that it shall not obscure the light of the soul, as has been mentioned above in the name of the Zohar, that \"A body into which the light of the soul does not penetrate should be crushed,\" which is accomplished by means of penitential reflections from the depths of the heart, as is explained there. Next is the exertion of the soul, that the service shall not be burdensome to it, to exert its thought to delve into and reflect upon the greatness of G-d for a long and uninterrupted period.", 
            "The measure of this [period] is not the same for every soul. There is the naturally refined soul which, immediately it considers the greatness of G-d, attains a fear and dread of G-d. As is written in the Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim, sec. I, that \"When a man reflects that the great King, the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, with Whose glory the whole world is full, stands over him and sees his actions, he will immediately be overcome with fear....\" There is a soul that is of lowly nature and origin, coming from the lower gradations of the Ten Sefirot of Asiyah, which cannot discover G-dliness by contemplation except with difficulty and forcefulness, especially if it had been contaminated by the sin of youth, for the sins interpose,... (as is explained in Sefer Chasidim, ch. 35). ", 
            "Nevertheless, by dint of forceful effort, when his thought greatly exerts itself with much vigour and toil and intense concentration, immersing in [contemplation of] the greatness of G-d for a considerable time, there will certainly come to him, at any rate, the lower fear referred to above, and as the Rabbis, of blessed memory, have said: [\"If a man says] 'I have laboured and I have found'— believe him.\" It is also written: \"If thou seekest her as silver and searchest for her as for hidden treasures: Then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord.\" This means, in the manner of .a'man seeking a hidden treasure or the wealth buried in the depths of the earth, for which he digs with tireless toil, so must one delve with unflagging energy in order to bring to light the treasure of the fear of Heaven, which lies buried and concealed in the understanding of the heart of every Jewish individual, this being of a quality and level transcending the limitations of time, and this is the natural, hidden fear referred to above. ", 
            "However, in order that it should be translated into action, in the sense of \"fear of sin,\" namely, to turn away from evil in deed, word and thought, one needs to bring it to light from the hidden depths of the understanding of the heart where it transcends rime, and to place it within the realm of the actual thought that is in the brain. [This means] immersing his thought in it for a lengthy period of time until its activity shall emerge from the potential into the actual, namely, turning away from evil and doing good in thought, speech and act because of G-d, Who looks and sees, hears arid listens and perceives all his deeds and searches his reins and heart. As the Rabbis, of blessed memory, said: \"Reflect upon three things, and thou wilt not come within the power of sin: The Eye sees, and the Ear hears....\" And although He has no bodily likeness, yet, on the contrary, everything is revealed and known to Him infinitely more than, for example, through the medium of physical sight or hearing. It is, by way of illustration, like a man who knows and feels within himself all that is happening to and being experienced by each and all of his 248 organs, such as cold and heat, feeling the heat even in his toe-nails, for example, as when he is scorched by fire; so also their essence and substance and all that is done to them, he knows and senses in his brain. Corresponding to this knowledge, by way of example, the Holy One, blessed be He, knows all that befalls all created beings, both higher and lower, because they all receive their flow of life from Him, may He be blessed, as is written: \"For all things come of Thee.\" And this is the meaning of what we say: \"Verily also nothing that is formed is withheld from Thee.\" And as Maimonides has said (and this has been accepted by the scholars of the Kabbalah, as Rabbi Moses Cordovero writes in Pardess), that \"Knowing Himself, as it were, He knows all created things that exist by virtue of His true existence....\"", 
            "Nevertheless this parallel is only an appeal to the ear. In truth, however, the analogy bears no similarity whatever to the object of the comparison. For the human soul, even the rational and the divine, is affected by the accidents of the body and its pain, by reason of its being actually clothed within the vivifying soul which is clothed in the body itself.", 
            "The Holy One, blessed be He, however, is not, Heaven forbid, affected by the accidents of the world and its changes, nor by the world itself, for they do not affect any change in Him, G-d forbid. In order to help us perceive this well with our intelligence, the Scholars of Truth have already treated of it at length in their books. But all Jews are \"Believers descended from believers,\" without human intellectual speculation whatever, and they declare: \"Thou wast the same ere the world was created,\" and so forth, as has been explained above in ch. 20.", 
            "Now, therefore, each individual Jew, whoever he may be, when he ponders upon this for some considerable time each day— how the Holy One, blessed be He, is truly omnipresent in the higher and lower [worlds], and in reality fills the heavens and the earth, and that the whole world is truly full of His glory, and that He looks and regards and searches his reins and his heart and all his actions and words, and counts his every step— then fear will be implanted in his heart throughout the day; and when he again meditates on this, even with a superficial reflection, at any time or moment, he will turn away from evil and do good, in thought, speech and deed, so as not to rebel, G-d forbid, in the sight of His glory whereof the whole world is full. This is in accord with the instruction of Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai to his disciples, quoted above.", 
            "This, then, is what the verse means: \"But to fear the Lord thy G-d, to walk in all His ways.\" For this is the fear that leads to the fulfillment of His blessed commandments through turning away from evil and doing good. This is the \"lower fear\" which has been discussed earlier. As it applies to \"Moses,\" that is to say, in relation to the quality of da'at that is in each divine Jewish soul, this is a minor thing, as has been stated above. (For da'at is [the faculty] which binds the hidden understanding of the heart with that which is actually revealed in thought, as is known to those who are familiar with the Esoteric Discipline).", 
            "In addition to this, one should remember that, as in the case of a mortal king, the essence of fear [of him] relates to his inner nature and vitality and not to his body— for when he is asleep, there is no fear of him— and, surely, his inner character and vitality are not perceived by physical eyes but only by the vision of the mind, through the physical eyes beholding his stature and robes, and making the beholder aware of the vitality that is clothed in them. If this be so, he must likewise truly fear G-d when gazing with his physical eyes at the heavens and earth and ail their host wherein is clothed the light of the blessed En Sof that animates them.", 
            "Note: And it is also seen with the glance of the eye that they are nullified to His blessed light by the fact that they \"prostrate\" themselves every day towards the west at the time of their setting. As the Rabbis, of blessed memory, commented on the verse: \"And the host of heaven worship Thee\" that the Shechinah abides in the west, so that their daily orbit westwards is a kind of prostration and self-nullification. Even he who has never seen the king and does not recognise him at all, nevertheless when he enters the royal court and sees many honourable princes prostrating themselves before one man. there falls on him a fear and awe.", 
            "And although many garments are involved in this investment, there is no difference or distinction at all in the fear of a mortal king, whether he be naked or robed in one or in many garments.", 
            "The essential thing, however, is the [mental] training to habituate one's mind and thought continuously, that it ever remain fixed in his heart and mind, that everything one sees with one's eyes— the heavens and earth and all that is therein— constitutes the outer garments of the King, the Holy One, blessed be He. In this way he will constantly be aware of their inwardness and vitality. This is also implicit in the word emunah (\"faith\"), which is a term indicating \"training,\" to which a man habituates himself, like a craftsman who trains his hands, and so forth.", 
            "There should also be a constant remembrance of the dictum of the Rabbis, of blessed memory, \"Acceptance of the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven,\" which parallels the injunction \"Thou shalt surely set a king over thee,\" as has been explained elsewhere, and so on. For the Holy One, blessed be He, forgoes the higher and lower worlds and uniquely bestows His Kingdom upon us,... and we accept it.... And this is the significance of the obeisances in the prayer of the Eighteen Benedictions, following the verbal acceptance of the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven in the recital of the Shema, whereby one accepts it once again in actual deed, with a [positive] act, and so forth, as is explained elsewhere."

            "Concerning this yirah tattaah (\"lower fear\"), which is directed toward the fulfillment of His commandments, in both areas of \"Depart from evil and do good,\" it was said, \"Where there is no fear [of G-d], there is no wisdom.\" It comprises a quality of \"smallness\" and a quality of \"greatness.\" The latter being the quality of fear that has its origin in contemplation on the greatness of G-d— that He fills all worlds, and from the earth to the heavens is a distance of 500 years,... and the distance from one heaven to the next,... the feet of the \"Chayyot\" measure up to them all,... and similarly on the evolvement of all the worlds, one above the other to the topmost heights— nevertheless this fear is called an \"external\" and \"inferior\" fear, because it is derived from the worlds which are \"garments\" of the King, the Holy One, blessed be He, Who conceals and hides and clothes Himself in them, to animate them and give them existence, that they may exist ex nihilo,.. . yet [this fear] is the gate and entrance to the fulfillment of the Torah and commandments.", 
            "As for the yirah ilaah (\"higher fear\"), however, a fear stemming from a sense of shame, an inner fear that derives from the inward aspects of G-dliness within the worlds, it was said concerning it that \"Where there is no wisdom, there is no fear,\" for חכמה is [made up of the letters] כ\"ח מ\"ה , and \"Chochmah comes from ayin\" (Nothing), and \"Who is wise? He who sees that which is born.\" That is to say, he sees how everything originates and comes into being ex nihilo by means of the word of G-d and the breath of His blessed mouth. As is written: \"And all their host by the breath of His mouth.\" Therefore, the heavens and the earth and all their host are truly nullified in reality, within the word of G-d and the breath of His mouth, and are accounted as nothing at all, as nought and nothingness indeed, just as the light and brightness of the sun are nullified within the body of the sun itself. And let not man regard himself as an exception to this principle, for also his body and nefesh and ruach and neshamah are nullified in reality in the word of G-d, Whose blessed word is united with His thought,... as has been explained above at length (chs. 20 and 21), taking as an example the human soul, one utterance of whose speech and thought are veritably as nothing.... This is what is meant by the verse: 'Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom.\"", 
            "However, one cannot attain to this fear and wisdom except in the fulfillment of the Torah and commandments through the lower, external fear. And this is what is meant by the statement: \"Where there is no fear, there is no wisdom.\"", 
            "Now, in love, too, there are two grades — ahavah rabbah (\"great love\") and ahavat olam (\"eternal love\"). \"Great love\" is an ecstatic love, and it is \"A fiery flame that rises of itself.\" It comes from above in a manner of a \"gift\" to him who is perfect in fear, as is known from the saying of the Rabbis, of blessed memory: \"The way of a man is to search for a woman.\" For love is called \"man\" or \"male,\" as is written: \"He hath remembered His loving kindness\"; whilst a woman [symbolises] \"fear of G-d,\" as is known. Without the prerequisite of fear, it is impossible to attain to this \"great love,\" for this love originates from the realm of Atzilut, wherein are ho sundering or separateness, G-d forbid.", 
            "Ahavat olam, however, is that which comes from the understanding and knowledge of the greatness of G-d, the blessed En Sof, Who fills all worlds and encompasses all worlds and before Whom everything is accounted as nothing at all, like the nullity of one utterance within the intelligent soul while it still remains in its thought or in the desire of the heart, as has been explained earlier. For as a result of such contemplation, the attribute of love that is in the soul will be divested of its garments, i.e., it will not clothe itself in anything of pleasure or enjoyment, whether physical or spiritual, to love it, and will not desire anything whatever in the world other than G-d alone, the Source of the vitality of all enjoyments, for they are all nullified in reality and are accounted as nothing at all, compared with Him, there being no manner of comparison or similitude between them, G-d forbid, just as there is no comparison between that which is absolutely nought and nothing— and everlasting life. As is written: \"Whom have I in heaven [but Thee]? And there is nothing upon earth that I desire with Thee. My flesh and my heart yearn, O Rock of my heart... ,\" And as will be explained later.", 
            "Also he, whose soul's quality of love is not clothed at all in any physical or spiritual enjoyment, is able to kindle his soul as with burning coals and an intense fire and a flame that strives heavenwards through the contemplation referred to above, as will be enlarged upon later.", 
            "This quality of love sometimes precedes fear, according to the quality of the da'at which fathers it, as is known. (For da'at incorporates both chasadim and gevurot, which are love and fear; and sometimes the chasadim descend and manifest themselves first.) Therefore it is possible for a wicked and a sinful person to repent by virtue of the love that is born in his heart at the time he remembers the Lord his G-d. At any rate, fear, too, is included therein [in the love], as a matter of course, except that it is in a stage of \"minuteness\" and \"concealment,\" namely, the fear of sin, of rebelling against Him, G-d forbid, while the love is in a revealed state in his heart and mind. However, such a case is but an accidental and spontaneous occurrence, or an \"emergency prescription\" through G-d's particular providence as the occasion requires, as happened with Rabbi Eliezer ben Durdaya.", 
            "However, the order of service, which is determined by and depends on man's choice, is to begin with the fulfillment of the Torah and commandments through the \"lower\" fear in its state of \"minuteness\" at least, to depart from evil and do good, so as to illuminate his divine soul with the light of the Torah and its commandments, whereupon the light of love will also shine forth upon it (for the word ואהבת— \"And thou shalt love\"— has a numerical value twice that of אור— \"light\"— as is known to those who are familiar with the Esoteric Discipline)."

        [
            "Each of the said two grades of love— the \"great love\" and the \"eternal love\"— is subdivided into many shades and gradations without limit, in each individual according to his capacity. As is written in the holy Zohar on the verse: \"Her husband is known in the gates,\" that \"This refers to the Holy One, blessed be He, Who makes Himself known and attaches Himself to every one according to the extent which one measures in one's heart....\" Therefore fear and love are called \"The secret things known to the Lord our G-d,\" while the Torah and commandments are those things which are \"Revealed to us and to our children to do....\" For we have all one Torah and one law, in so far as the fulfillment of all the Torah and commandments in actual performance is concerned. It is otherwise with fear and love, which vary according to the knowledge of G-d in the mind and heart, as has been mentioned above.", 
            "Yet there is one love which incorporates something of all the distinctions and gradations of both \"great love\" and \"eternal love,\" and equally belongs in every Jewish soul, as our inheritance from our Patriarchs. And that is what the Zohar says on the verse: \"[Thou art] my soul; I desire Thee in the night,.. .\" that \"One should love the Holy One, blessed be He, with a love of the soul and the spirit, as these are attached to the body, and the body loves them,\" and so forth. This is the interpretation of the verse: \"My soul, I desire Thee,\" which means \"Since Thou, O Lord, art my true soul and life, therefore do I desire Thee,\" That is to say, \"I long and yearn for Thee like a man who craves the life of his soul, and when he is weak and exhausted he longs and yearns for his soul to revive in him; and also when he goes to sleep he longs and yearns for his soul to be restored to him when he awakens from his sleep. So do I long and yearn to draw the light of the blessed En Sof, the Life of true life, within me through occupation in the Torah when I awaken during the night from my sleep;\" for the Torah and the Holy One, blessed be He, are one and the same. So the Zohar says, ibid., \"Out of love for the Holy One, blessed be He, a man should rise each night and exert himself in His service until the morning....\"", 
            "A great and more intense love than that — one which is likewise concealed in every soul of Israel as an inheritance from our ancestors— is that which is defined in Ra'aya Mehemna: \"Like a son who strives for the sake of his father and mother, whom he loves even more than his own body, soul and spirit,...\" for \"have we not all one Father?\"", 
            "And although [one may ask], who is the man and where is he, who dares presume in his heart to approach and attain even a thousandth part of the degree of love of \"The Faithful Shepherd\" [Moses]? Nevertheless a minute portion and particle of his great goodness and light illumines the community of Israel in each generation, as is stated in the Tikunim that \"An emanation from him is present in every generation\", \"To illumine them,\" and so forth. Only, this glow is in a manner of great occultation and concealment in the souls of ail Israel. But to bring forth this hidden love from its delitescence and concealment to [a state of] revelation, to be manifest in his heart and mind, this is \"Not beyond reach nor is it afar off, but the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart.\" That is to say, it should be habitual on his tongue and voice to arouse the intention of his heart and mind, so as to immerse his thought in the Life of life, the blessed En Sof, for He is literally our true Father and the Source of our life, and to awaken our love for Him like the love of a son for his father. And when he accustoms himself to this continually, habit will become nature.", 
            "Even if it appears to him at first sight that this is an illusion, he need not be concerned, because it is intrinsically the absolute truth by virtue of the \"hidden love.\" But the purpose of its emergence into the open is in order to translate it into action, namely, the occupation in the Torah and commandments which he studies and performs as a result of it, with the intention to bring gratification before Him, may He be blessed, like a son serving his father.", 
            "Concerning this it was said that \"A good thought is united by the Holy One, blessed be He, to a deed,\" providing the \"wings\" to soar upwards, as explained earlier. As for the \"gratification,\" it is akin, by way of the illustration used earlier, to the joy of a king whose son returns to him after liberation from captivity; or from the fact that it has been made possible for Him to have a habitation down here, as already mentioned.", 
            "But even in regard to the above-mentioned [love, in the] category of \"My soul, I desire Thee,\" the thing is very nigh to be brought out of [its] concealment into the open through constant practice, with mouth and heart in full accord.", 
            "However, even if he cannot bring it into a revealed state in his heart, nevertheless he can occupy himself in the Torah and commandments \"for their own sake\" through portraying the idea of this love in the contemplation of his mind, and \"A good thought is united by the Holy One, blessed be He....\"", 
            "The said two distinctions of love— though they are an inheritance unto us from our Patriarchs, and like a natural instinct in our souls, and so, too, is the fear that is contained in them, which is the fear of being sundered, G-d forbid, from the Source of our life and our true Father, blessed be He— are, nevertheless, not termed \"natural\" fear and love unless they be in the mind and thought alone and in the latency of the heart. Then their station is in the Ten Sefaot of Yetzirah whither they bring up with them the Torah and commandments of which they have been the inspiration and cause.", 
            "But when they are in a manifest state in the heart, they are called in the Zohar re'uta d'libba (\"heart's desire\") and they are stationed in the Ten Sefirot of Beriah, whither they bring up with them the Torah and commandments which have been induced by them. For their emergence from the latency and concealment of the heart into a state of \"revelation\" comes through the faculty of da at, i.e. through a powerful fixation of the mind and an intense concentration— touching the depth of the heart preeminently and continuously— on the blessed En Sof, as to how He is our very life and our blessed true Father. And it is well known, what is written in the Tikunim, that \"There in the world of Beriah nests the 'Supernal Mother,'\" which is the contemplation of the light of the blessed En Sof the Giver of life, which is in accordance with the teaching of Elijah: \"Binah is the heart, and with it does the heart understand.\"", 
            "Furthermore, these two distinctions of love, that have been referred to above, contain a quality of love which is greater and more sublime than the intelligent fear and love, the love termed above as Ahavat Olam (\"eternal love\").", 
            "Nonetheless a person must strain his intellect to apprehend and attain also the distinction of \"eternal love\" referred to above, which stems from understanding and knowledge of the greatness of G-d, in order thereby to fan the blaze of the fiery love, with glowing coals and an intense fire and a name that rises heavenwards, so that \"not even many waters can extinguish it..., nor rivers quench it....\" For there is a superiority and excellence in the quality of love burning like fiery coals and an intense flame,... which comes from the understanding and knowledge of the greatness of the blessed En Sof over the two distinctions of love referred to above, when they are not like fiery coals and a blaze,... similar to the superiority and excellence of gold over silver, and so forth, as will be explained later.", 
            "Besides, this is the whole man and his raison d'etre, that one may know the glory of the Lord and the majestic splendour of His greatness, each according to the limit of his capacity, as is written in Ra'aya Mehemna, Parshat Bo: \"In order that they may know Him,\" and so forth, and as is known."

            "There is yet another direct road open to man, namely, to occupy himself with the Torah and commandments for their own sake through the attribute of our Patriarch Jacob, peace unto him, this being the attribute of mercy. It is first to arouse in his mind great compassion before G-d for the Divine spark which animates his soul that has descended from its Source, the Life of life, the blessed En Sof, Who pervades all worlds and transcends all worlds and in comparison with Whom everything is accounted as nothing. Yet it [this spark] has been clothed in a \"serpent's skin\" which is far removed from the light of the King's countenance, at the greatest possible distance, since this world is the nadir of the coarse kelipot....",

This is the esoteric doctrine of the \"Exile of the Shechinah\" Concerning this it is written: \"And let him return unto the Lord, and have mercy upon Him,\" arousing great compassion towards G-d Who dwells among us, as is written: \"Who dwelleth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.\"",

So, too, are coupled thought with thought, act with act, the latter referring to the active observance of commandments and, in particular, the act of charity and loving-kindness.

In this sense the Zohar commented on the verse: \"That they bring Me an offering.\" (For the expression לי [\"to Me\"] has the same meaning as אותי [\"Me\"]; and hence the text should have read \"Me and an offering,\" except that both are one and the same.

But immediately he does so desire, and he accepts and draws upon himself His blessed G-dliness and declares: \"The Lord is our G-d, the Lord is One.\" then surely is his soul spontaneously absorbed into His blessed Unity, for \"Spirit evokes spirit, and draws forth spirit.\" This is a form of \"Exodus from Egypt.\" Therefore it was ordained that the paragraph concerning the Exodus from Egypt be read specifically during the recital of the Shema, although it is a commandment by itself, and not appertaining to the commandment of the recital of the Shema, as is stated in the Talmud and Codes; for they are actually the same thing.

This constitutes an exceedingly contracted illumination, and it is considered as virtually nothing at all compared with the quality of the limitless and infinite illumination, and there is no reference or relationship between them, as the term \"reference\" is understood in values, where the figure 1 has a relevancy with the number 1,000,000, for it is one millionth part of it; but as regards a thing which is in the realm of infinity, there is no number that can be considered relative to it, for a billion or trillion do not attain the relevancy of the figure I in comparison with a billion or trillion, but is veritably accounted as nothing.", 
            "So, indeed, is the quality of the contracted illumination which informs the higher and lower worlds, acting in them and animating them— compared with the quality of the hidden and concealed light that is of an infinite order and does not clothe itself or exercise its influence in the worlds, to animate them in a revealed manner, but it \"encompasses\" them from above and is called sovev kol almin (the \"Encompasser of all Worlds\"). The meaning of this is not that it encircles and encompasses from above spatially, G-d forbid, for in spiritual matters the category of space is in no way applicable. But the meaning is that it \"Encircles and encompasses from above\" insofar as the so-called \"revealed\" influence is concerned, for influence which is in the category of \"revelation\" in the worlds, is referred to as \"investiture\", being \"clothed\" within the worlds, for the influence that they receive is clothed and comprehended by them; whereas the influence which does not come within the category of \"revelation,\" but remains in occultation and concealment and is not apprehended by the worlds, is not described as being \"invested\" but as \"encircling and encompassing.\" Therefore, since the worlds belong in the order of the finite and limited, it follows that only an extremely minute and contracted reflection of the flow of the light of the blessed En Sof clothes and reveals itself in them in a revealed form, and this, only to animate them in a finite and limited state. But the principal light without contraction to such an extent, is called makif (\"encircler\") and sovev (\"encompasser\"), since its influence is not revealed within them, inasmuch as they belong in the order of the finite and the limited.", 
            "To illustrate this point, consider this material world. Even though \"The whole world is full of His glory,\" namely, the light of the blessed En Sof, as is written: \"Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord,\" nevertheless only a very small vitality, of the category of inanimate and vegetable worlds, is clothed therein in the form of \"revealed\" influence, while all the light of the blessed En Sof is termed as \"encompassing\" it, even though it actually pervades it, since its influence is no more revealed in it, but is active in it in a hidden and concealed manner; and any influence of a concealed nature is referred to as \"Encircling from above,\" for the \"hidden world\" is on a higher plane than the \"revealed world.\"", 
            "Let us make it more intelligible by means of an example. When a man forms an image in his mind of something that he has seen or sees— although the entire body and essence of that thing, both its exterior and interior and its very core, are completely mirrored in his mind and thought, for he has seen it or is seeing it in its entirety— this is expressed by saying that his mind encompasses that object completely, and that thing is enveloped by his mind and thought. But it is not encompassed in actual fact, only in the imagination of the man's thought and mind.", 
            "The Holy One, blessed be He, however, of Whom it is written: \"For My thoughts are not your thoughts,...\" surely His Thought and Mind knowing all created things, encompass each and every created being from its beginning to its end and its inside and very core, all in actual reality.", 
            "For example, in the case of the orb of this earth, His blessed knowledge encompasses the entire, diameter of the globe of the earth, together with all that is in it and its deepest interior to its lowest depths, all in actual reality. For this knowledge constitutes the vitality of the whole spherical thickness of the Earth and its creation ex nihilo. However, it would not have come into being as it now is, as a finite and limited thing, with an exceedingly minute vitality sufficient for the categories of inorganic matter and vegetation, were it not for the many powerful contractions which have condensed the light and vitality that is clothed in the orb of the earth, so as to animate it and sustain it in its finite and limited status and in the categories of inorganic and vegetable matter alone.", 
            "But His blessed knowledge which is united with His essence and being— for \"He is the Knowledge, the Knower, and the Known, and knowing Himself, as it were, He knows all created things, but not with a knowledge that is external to Himself, like the knowledge of a human being, for all of them [the created things] are derived from His blessed Reality, and this thing is not within the power of human beings to comprehend clearly,\" and so forth—", 
            "Note: As Maimonides, of blessed memory, has written— and the scholars of Kabbalah subscribed to his views— as is stated in Pardess of Rabbi Moshe Cordovero, of blessed memory. This also accords with the Kabbalah of our Master Rabbi Isaac Luria, of blessed memory, in the mystery of tzimtzum and the clothing of the lights in vessels, as has been mentioned previously in ch. 2.", 
            "— this knowledge, since it is of an infinite order, is not described as clothing itself in the orb of the earth, which is finite and limited, but as encircling and encompassing it, although this knowledge embraces its entire thickness and interior in actual reality, thus giving it existence ex nihilo, as is explained elsewhere."

            "Even though the particular aspects of the nature of the occultation and concealment of the light of the blessed En Sof in the descent of the worlds— until this material world was created— are too numerous to and are of many diverse kinds, as is known to those who have tasted of the Tree of Life, yet in general there are three levels of powerful and comprehensive \"contractions,\" giving rise to three comprehensive worlds, each category consisting of myriads upon myriads of particulars. These are the worlds of Beriah, Yetzirah and Asiyah, for the world of Atzilut is G-dliness itself.",

For the minute portion of light which clothes itself in the world of Beriah is still in a category of infinity in relation to the world of Yetzirah, and is unable to clothe itself in the latter except through a contraction and occulation. So, too, from Yetzirah to Asiyah .", 
            "(An elaborate explanation of these three \"contractions,\" in order to make them more accessible to our poor intellect is given elsewhere. )", 
            "The purpose of all the \"contractions\" is the creation of the material human body and the subjugation of the sitra achra, to bring about the preeminence of light supplanting darkness— when a person elevates his divine soul and his vivifying soul together with their garments and all the powers of the body, to G-d alone, as has been discussed earlier at length, for this is the purpose of the descent of the worlds.", 
            "To quote [again] \"As water mirrors the reflection ot a face\": As the Holy One, blessed be He, has, as it were, laid down and set aside, figuratively speaking, His great infinite light, and has stored it away and concealed it by means of three different kinds of \"contractions\"— and all this because of His love for lowly man, in order to raise him up to G-d, for \"Love impels the flesh,\" how much more, and an infinite number of times more, is it fitting that a man also should relinquish and set aside all he possesses, both spiritually and physically, and renounce everything in order to cleave to Him, may He be blessed, with attachment, desire and longing, without any hindrance, within or without, neither of body nor soul, nor money, nor wife and children.", 
            "Thereby will be understood the true reason and meaning of the Rabbinical enactment, ordaining the recitations of the blessings of the Shema: two preceding it.... For it would appear, at first glance, that they have no connection whatever with the recital of the Shema, as \"Rashba\" and other codifiers have stated. Why, then, were they termed \"Blessings of the Shema?\" And why were they ordained to to be recited specifically before it?", 
            "But the reason is that the essence of the recital of the Shema is to fulfil the injunction \"With all thine heart,...\" to wit, \"With both thy natures,...\" that is to say, to overcome anything that deters from the love of G-d. For \"thine heart\" alludes to the wife and children, to whom a man's heart is, by his very nature, bound. So have the Rabbis, of blessed memory, commented on the verses: \"For He spake, and it came to pass,\" that this refers to the wife; \"He commanded, and it stood fast,\" that this refers to the children; and by \"Thy soul and thy might\" is understood, literally, your life and sustenance— renouncing everything for the love of G-d.", 
            "But how can physical man attain to this level? It is, therefore, to this end that the blessing of yotzer or was introduced first, for [in this blessing] there is said and repeated at length the account and order of the angels \"standing at the world's summit\" in order to proclaim the greatness of the Holy One, blessed be He— how all of them are nullified in His blessed light and \"Pronounce in fear,...\" \"and sanctify, . . .\" and \"Declare in fear, 'Holy,'...\" meaning that He is apart from them, and He does not clothe Himself in diem in a \"revealed\" state, but \"The whole earth is full of His glory,\" namely, the community of Israel above and Israel below, as has been explained earlier.",

            "Then follows the second blessing, \"With an everlasting love hast Thou loved us, O Lord, our G-d.\" That is to say, that He set aside all the supernal, holy hosts and caused His Shechinah to dwell upon us, so that He be called \"Our G-d,\" in the same sense that He is called \"The G-d of Abraham,\" as explained earlier. This is because \"love impels the flesh.\" Therefore it is called ahavat olam (\"worldly love\"), for this is the so-called \"contraction\" of His great and infinite light, taking on the garb of finitude, which is called olam (\"world\"), for the sake of the love of His people Israel, in order to bring them near to Him, that they might be absorbed into His blessed Unity and Oneness.", 
            "This is also the meaning of \"With great and exceeding pity [hast Thou pitied us],\" namely, exceeding the nearness of G-d towards all the hosts above; \"... and us hast Thou chosen from every people and tongue,\" which refers to the material body which, in its corporeal aspects, is similar to the bodies of the gentiles of the world; \"And Thou hast brought us near... to give thanks,...\"— the interpretation of \"thanks\" will be given elsewhere;\"... and proclaim Thy Unity,.. .\"— to be absorbed into His blessed Unity, as has been explained above.",

And thou shalt speak of them....\" As is explained in Etz Chayim that the union of \"osculation\" is essentially the union of ChaBaD with ChaBaD, that is, concentration in the Torah; while the mouth, as the outlet of the breath and its emergence into a revealed state, represents the category of speech engaged in words of the Torah,",

And this is the essence of man's kavanah in his service: to draw the light of the blessed En Sof down below.

            "There is, however, yet another distinction of love which excels them all, as gold is superior to silver, and this is a love like fiery coals from the distinction of the \"Supernal Gevurot\" from Binah ilaah (\"Supernal Understanding\"). This is when, through contemplation on the greatness of the blessed En Sof, before Whom everything is truly accounted as nought, the soul is kindled and flares up towards the glory of the splendour of His greatness, in order to gaze on the glory of the King, like glowing coals of a mighty flame which surges upwards, striving to be parted from the wick and the wood on which it has taken hold. This is brought on by the preponderance of the element of Divine fire that is in the divine soul. In consequence of this it develops a thirst, as is written: \"My soul thirsteth for Thee\"; next it attains the distinction of \"love-sickness\"; and then it reaches a state of very rapture of the soul (כלות הנפש ) as is written: \"Yea, my soul is enraptured.\"",

The service of the Levites was to raise the voice of melody and thanksgiving, with song and music, with tunefulness and harmony, in a manner of \"advance and retreat\" which is the distinction of the intense love resembling the flame that flashes out of the lightning, as is mentioned in the Gemara (Chagigah, ch. II).",

Is not the whole world full of His glory? And surely there is no place void of Him.", 
            "The [clue to the] understanding cf this is to be found in the text: \"From my flesh I see G-d.\" The analogy is from the soul of a human being which pervades all the 248 organs of the body, fiom head to foot, yet its principal habitation and abode is in his brain, whence it is diffused throughout all the organs, each of which receives from it vitality and power appropriate to it, according to its composition and character: the eye for seeing, the ear for hearing, the mouth for speaking, and the feet for walking— as we clearly sense that in the brain one is conscious of everything that is affected in the 248 organs and everything that is experienced by them.", 
            "Now, the variation in the acquisition of powers and vitality by the orgaris of the body from the soul, is not due to the [soul's] essence and being, for this would make its core and essence divisible into 248 diverse parts, vested in 248 loci according to the various forms and locations of the organs of the body. If this were so, it would follow that its essence and core are fashioned in a material design, in a likeness and form resembling the shape of the body, Heaven forfend! Rather, it is entirely a single and simple spiritual entity, which, by its intrinsic essence, is divested of any corporeal shape and of any category and dimension of space, size, or physical limitation. It is, therefore, impertinent to say, in relation to its core and essence, that it is located in the brain of the head more than it is in the feet, since its core and essence are not subject to the dimensions and categories of physical limitation. But there are contained in it, in its intrinsic essence, 613 kinds of powers and vitalities to be actualised and to emerge from concealment in order to animate the 248 organs and 365 veins of the body, through their embodiment in the vivifying soul, which also possesses the corresponding 248 and 365 powers and vitalities.",

Therefore they first receive the power and vitality appropriate to them acccording to their disposition and character, namely, ChaBaD (chochmah, binah, da'at) and the faculty of thought, and all that pertains to the brains; and not only this, but also the sum-total of all the streams of vitality flowing to the other organs is also contained and is clothed in the brain that is in the head. It is there that the core and root of the said manifest flow of the light and vitality of the whole soul are to be found. From there a radiation is diffused to all the other organs, each of which receives the power and vitality appropriate to it in accordance with its disposition and character: the faculty of sight reveals itself in the eye, and the faculty of hearing manifests itself in the ear, and so forth. But all the powers flow from the brain, as is known, for therein is located the principal dwelling-place of the whole soul, in its manifest aspect, since the sum-total of the vitality that is diffused from it is revealed there. Only, the [individual] powers of the said general vitality shine forth and are radiated from there into all the organs of the body, much in the same manner as light radiates from the sun and penetrates rooms within rooms.

And in each world there are creatures without limit or end, myriads upon myriads of various grades of angels and souls,... and so, too, is the abundance of the worlds without end or limit, one higher than the other....", 
            "Now, the core and essence of the blessed En Sof is the same in the higher and lower worlds, as in the example with the soul given above, and as is written in the Tikunim that \"He is the Hidden One of all the hidden.\" This is to be understood that even in the higher, hidden worlds He is hidden and concealed within them, just as He is hidden and concealed in the lower, for no thought can apprehend Him at all even in the higher worlds. Thus as He is to be found there, so is He found in the very lowest.", 
            "The difference between the higher and lower worlds is with regard to the stream of vitality which the blessed En Sof causes to flow and illumine in a category of \"revelation out of concealment\" (which is one of the reasons why the influence and stream of this vitality is figuratively called \"light\"), thereby animating the worlds and the creatures therein. For the higher worlds receive, in a somewhat more \"revealed\" form, than do the lower; and all creatures therein receive each according to its capacity and nature, which is the nature and the form of the particular flow with which the blessed En Sof imbues and illumines it.",

Yet they contain light and vitality which constantly give them existence ex nihilo, that they shall not revert and become nothing and nought as they had been. This light comes from the blessed En Sof, except that it is clothed in many garments, as is written in Etz Chayim, that the light and vitality of the physical orb of Earth, which is seen by mortal eyes, is derived from Malchut d'Malchut d'Asiyah and in it is contained Malchut d'Yetzirah, and so on, so that in all of them are contained the Ten Sefirot of Atzilut which are united with their Emanator, the blessed En Sof."

From this source there extends to each individual thing the particular light and vitality suitable for it, and it [the light] dwells and is clothed in them, thereby animating them. Therefore it is figuratively called \"mother of the children,\" and \"community of Israel,\" for from this source have emanated the souls of Atzilut and have been created the souls of Beriah, and so forth, all of them being derived only from the extension of the vitality and light from this source which is called \"Shechinah\" resembling the radiation of light from the sun.",

And as has previously been explained, the light of the blessed En Sof is clothed in and united with the Supernal Wisdom, and He, may He be blessed, and His wisdom are One, only that it has descended by means of obscuring gradations, from grade to grade, with the descent of the worlds, until it has clothed itself in material things, namely, the 613 commandments of the Torah.",

Therefore thence also originates the Talmud, which is also a category of ChaBaD, for the Talmud consists of the reasons and interpretations of the halachot in clearly defined terms. These reasons and interpretations are a category of ChaBaD, while the halachot themselves derive from the middot of the blessed En Sof, namely, kindness, justice, mercy,... from which originate permission and prohibition, license and restriction, liability and blamelessness, as is explained in the Tikunitri.",

Thence, too, comes the Mishnah that we possess, which comprises the legal decisions that are likewise derived from ChaBaD of the blessed En Sof. Only that the categories of ChaBaD, that is, the reasons and interpretations of the halachot, are clothed and hidden within the laws themselves and are not in a revealed form, while the elements of the halachot [themselves], which are in a revealed form, are the very reflection of the attributes of the blessed En Sof in their revealed form.

They comprise, in general, two extensions— right and left— acting either with forbearance from the aspect of kindness, that is to say, to permit a thing to ascend to G-d, or acting forbiddingly. ... And all this is according to the Chochmah Ilaah d'Atzilut (\"Higher Wisdom of Emanation\"); in which Binah and Da'at are contained, and they are united with the blessed En Sof, for in all of them are clothed ChaBaD of Atzilut with which the light of the blessed En Sof is united in a perfect union.",

            "At the time the First Temple stood, in which the Ark and Tables [of the Decalogue] were housed in the Holy of Holies, the Shechinah, i.e. Malchut d'Atzilut, that is, the aspect of the \"revealed\" light of the blessed En Sof, dwelled there and was clothed in the Ten Commandments, far higher and stronger, and with a greater and mightier revelation, than its revelation in the shrines of the Holy of Holies above in the upper worlds. For the Ten Commandments are the \"All-embracing principles of the whole Torah,\" which comes from the Higher Wisdom, that is far higher than the world of manifestation. In order to engrave them on material tablets of stone it (the Shechinah) did not descend degree by degree, parallel to the order of descent of the worlds down to this material world. For this material world functions through the garment of material nature, while the Tables [of the Decalogue] are \"The work of G-d, and the writing is the writing of G-d,\" beyond the nature of this material world which is derived from the effulgence of the Shechinah in the shrine of the Holy of Holies of Asiyah (\"Action\"), whence issues light and vitality to the world of Asiyah, in which this our world also is contained.", 
            "But the category of the Higher Wisdom of Atzilut, consisting of the totality of the Torah as it is epitomized in the Decalogue, has clothed itself in Malchut of Atzilut and of Beriah alone, and they alone, united as they are with the light of the blessed En Sof that is within them, are referred to as the \"Shechinah\" which rested in the Holy of Holies of the First Temple, through its clothing itself in the Ten Commandments, which were engraved in the Tables [reposing] in the Ark, by miraculous means and by the work of the Living G-d (this being the \"hidden\" world which nests in the world of Beriah as is known to those familiar with the Esoteric Discipline).", 
            "As for the Second Temple, in which did not repose the Ark and Tables [of the Decalogue], our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said that the Shechinah did not abide there. This refers to the category of the Shechinah which used to abide in the First Temple— which was not of the ordinary descent of the worlds. But in the Second Temple it abided according to the order of gradual descent, of Malchut d'Atzilut vested in Malchut d'Beriah and the latter in Malchut d'Yetzirah, and the latter in the shrine of the Holy of Holies of Asiyah which in turn was clothed in the Holy of Holies of the Temple here below. In it rested the Shechinah, i.e. Malchut d'Yetzirah which was clothed in the Holy of Holies of Asiyah.", 
            "Therefore no man was permitted to enter there, except the High Priest on the Day of Atonement. However, since the Temple was destroyed, there remains to the blessed Holy One but \"The four cubits of Halachah alone.\" Hence each individual who sits by himself and occupies himself in the Torah, the Shechinah is with him, as is stated in the first chapter of Berachot. The phrase \"The Shechinah is with him\" means in the order of the gradual descent and investment of Malchut d'Atzilut in Malchut d'Beriah, and Yetzirah and Asiyah. For the 613 commandments of the Torah are by and large active precepts, as are also those which are fulfilled by word and thought, such as Torah study and Grace after meals and the recital of the Shema and Prayer, for it has been ruled that contemplation has not the validity of speech, and one has not fulfilled one's obligation by contemplation and kavanah alone, until he gives utterance with his lips; and it has been ruled that the motion of the lips is considered an \"action.\"", 
            "The 613 commandments of the Torah, together with the seven commandments of our Rabbis, combine to total the numerical equivalent of כתר (\"crown\") which is the blessed Ratzon Elyon (the \"Supernal Will\"), which is clothed in His blessed Wisdom, and they are united with the light of the blessed En Sof in a perfect union. \"The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth,\" which refers to the Oral Law that is derived from the Higher Wisdom, as is written in the Zohar, \"The Father [chochmah] begat the daughter [i.e. Malchut, the Oral Law].\"", 
            "And this is what the Yenuka meant when he said that \"The Supernal light that is kindled on one's head, namely, the Shechinah, requires oil,\" that is, to be clothed in wisdom, which is called \"oil from the holy anointing,\" as is explained in the Zohar, that \"these are the good deeds,\" namely, the 613 commandments, which derive from His blessed wisdom. Thereby the light of the Shechinah can cling to the wick, i.e. the vivifying soul in the body, which is metaphorically called a \"wick.\" For just as in the case of a material candle, the light shines by virtue of the annihilation and burning of the wick turning to fire, so does the light of the Shechinah rest on the divine soul as a result of the annihilation of the animal soul and its transformation \"From darkness to light and from bitterness to sweetness\" in the case of the righteous, or at least through the destruction of its garments, which are thought, speech and action, and their transformation from the darkness of the kelipot to the Divine light of the blessed En Sof, which is clothed and united in the thought, speech and action of the 613 commandments of the Torah, in the case of benonim. For as a result of the transformation of the animal soul, originating from the kelipat nogah, [a transformation] from darkness to light, and so forth, there is brought about toe so-called \"ascent of the feminine waters\" to draw the light of the Shechinah, i.e. the category of the \"revealed\" light of the blessed En Sof— over one's divine soul [principally dwelling] in the brain of the head. Thereby will also be clearly understood the text \"For the Lord Thy G-d is a consuming fire\" as is explained elsewhere.",
