The miracle of Purim was allowed to be written, for it was “the end of all miracles” (Yoma 29a) paralleling the attribute of Yesod-Malchut, which is “the end of the body” (Tikkunei Zohar 17a). And it was the preparatory step for the miracle of Chanukah, which is the only one of the miracles that were not allowed to be written that was [nonetheless] established for all generations. This is because the miracles that were not allowed to be written down have yet to be revealed in their full manifestation, and it is impossible to establish every one of them for all generations. But the miracle of Chanukah is the sum total of all the miracles throughout the period of exile, which cannot be written down, and it was established eternally. And it is only through the light of a candle, which is the light of revealing the holiness of the Yesod [foundation] in the outermost realms, in manifest reality, that also shines its light inward into all manners of confusion. And once this became clear through means other than [written] words of Torah, it continues to be revealed through the specifics of all the myriad forces throughout the entire duration of exile..."
