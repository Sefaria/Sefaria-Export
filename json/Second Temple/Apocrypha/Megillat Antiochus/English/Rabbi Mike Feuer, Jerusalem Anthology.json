        "They searched for some pure olive oil in order to light its lamps, but they could not find any except for a single flask which was sealed with the signet-ring of the high priest. They knew that this was pure and that there was in it about one day’s burning. ",
        "But the God of Heaven Who made His Name dwell there placed a blessing on it, and they lit from it for eight days. ",
        "Therefore the Hasmoneans swore this oath, and they and all the children of Israel took upon themselves this binding vow ",
        "to observe these eight days as a time of celebration and ceremony like the days of the festivals which are inscribed in the Torah– to light lamps on them to indicate forever that their God effected deliverance for them from Heaven. ",
        "On them one must not mourn, nor may one decree a fast, except that which one had already vowed."
