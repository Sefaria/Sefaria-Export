            "And it came to pass, after the triumph of Alexandros the Makedonian, son ",
            "of Philippos, who first reigned in Hellas, who came out of the land of Khettiim, had defeated Dareios king of the Persians and the Medes:",
            "And He fought a lot of battles, and took almost all the strong holds, and slew almost all the kings of the earth,",
            "And went through to the ends of the earth, and took spoils of many nations,",
            "insomuch that the earth was quiet before him; whereupon he was exalted and his heart was lifted up.",
            "And he gathered a mighty strong host and ruled over countries, and nations, and kings, who became tributaries unto him.",
            "And after these things he fell sick, and perceived that he should die.",
            "Wherefore he called his servants, such as were honourable, and had been brought up with him from his youth, and parted his kingdom among them, while he was yet alive.",
            " So Alexander reigned twelve years, and then died. ",
            "And his servants bare rule every one in his place. And after his death they all put crowns upon themselves;",
            "so did their sons after them many years: and evils were multiplied in the earth.",
            "And there came out of them a wicked root, Antiochus surnamed Epiphanes, son of Antiochus the king, who had been an hostage at Rome, ",
            "and he reigned in the hundred and thirty and seventh year of the kingdom of the Greeks.",
            "In those days went there out of Israel wicked men, who persuaded many, saying,",
            "“Let us go and make a covenant with the heathen that are round about us: for since we departed from them we have had much sorrow.” ",
            "So this device pleased them well. Then certain of the people were so forward herein, that they went to the king, who gave them a license to do after the ordinances of the heathen,",
            "whereupon they built a place of exercise at Jerusalem according to the customs of the heathen and made themselves uncircumcised, and forsook the holy covenant, and joined themselves to the heathen, and were sold to do mischief.",
            "Now when the kingdom was established before Antiochus, he thought to reign over Egypt that he might have the dominion of two realms.",
            "Wherefore he entered into Egypt with a great multitude, with chariots, and elephants, and horsemen, and a great navy,",
            "and made war against Ptolemee king of Egypt: but Ptolemee was afraid of him, and fled; and many were wounded to death.",
            "Thus they got the strong cities in the land of Egypt and he took the spoils thereof.",
            "And after that Antiochus had smitten Egypt, he returned again in the hundred forty and third year, and went up against Israel and Jerusalem with a great multitude,",
            "And entered proudly into the sanctuary, and took away the golden altar, and the candlestick of light, and all the vessels thereof, And the table of the shewbread, and the pouring vessels, and the vials, and the censers of gold, and the veil, and the crown, and the golden ornaments that were before the temple, all which he pulled off.",
            "He took also the silver and the gold, and the precious vessels: also he took the hidden treasures which he found.",
            "And when he had taken all away, he went into his own land, having made a great massacre, and spoken very proudly.",
            "Therefore there was a great mourning in Israel, in every place where they were,",
            "so that the princes and elders mourned, the virgins and young men were made feeble, and the beauty of women was changed.",
            "Every bridegroom took up lamentation, and she that sat in the marriage chamber was in heaviness,",
            "and the land also was moved for the inhabitants thereof, and all the house of Jacob was covered with confusion.",
            "And after two years fully expired the king sent his chief collector of tribute unto the cities of Juda, who came unto Jerusalem with a great multitude,",
            "And spake peaceable words unto them, but all was deceit:",
            "for when they had given him credence, he fell suddenly upon the city, and smote it very sore, and destroyed much people of Israel.",
            "And when he had taken the spoils of the city, he set it on fire, and pulled down the houses and walls thereof on every side.",
            "But the women and children took they captive, and possessed the cattle.",
            "Then builded they the city of David with a great and strong wall, and with mighty towers, and made it a strong hold for them.",
            "And they put therein a sinful nation, wicked men, and fortified themselves therein. They stored it also with armour and victuals, and when they had gathered together the spoils of Jerusalem, they laid them up there,",
            "and so they became a sore snare: For it was a place to lie in wait against the sanctuary, and an evil adversary to Israel.",
            "Thus they shed innocent blood on every side of the sanctuary, and defiled it:  Insomuch that the inhabitants of Jerusalem fled because of them: whereupon the city was made an habitation of strangers, and became strange to those that were born in her; and her own children left her.",
            "Her sanctuary was laid waste like a wilderness, her feasts were turned into mourning, her sabbaths into reproach her honour into contempt.",
            "As had been her glory, so was her dishonour increased,",
            "and her excellency was turned into mourning.",
            "Moreover king Antiochus wrote to his whole kingdom, that all should be one people,",
            "And every one should leave his laws: so all the heathen agreed according to the commandment of the king.",
            "Yea, many also of the Israelites consented to his religion, and sacrificed unto idols, and profaned the sabbath.",
            "For the king had sent letters by messengers unto Jerusalem and the cities of Juda that they should follow the strange laws of the land,",
            "And forbid burnt offerings, and sacrifice, and drink offerings, in the temple; and that they should profane the sabbaths and festival days:",
            "And pollute the sanctuary and holy people: Set up altars, and groves, and chapels of idols, and sacrifice swine’s flesh, and unclean beasts:",
            "That they should also leave their children uncircumcised, and make their souls abominable with all manner of uncleanness and profanation: To the end they might forget the law, and change all the ordinances.",
            "And whosoever would not do according to the commandment of the king, he said, he should die.",
            "In the selfsame manner wrote he to his whole kingdom, and appointed overseers over all the people, commanding the cities of Juda to sacrifice, city by city.",
            "Then many of the people were gathered unto them, to wit every one that forsook the law; and so they committed evils in the land;",
            "And drove the Israelites into secret places, even wheresoever they could flee for succour.",
            "Now the fifteenth day of the month Casleu, in the hundred forty and fifth year, they set up the abomination of desolation upon the altar, and builded idol altars throughout the cities of Juda on every side;",
            "And burnt incense at the doors of their houses, and in the streets. And when they had rent in pieces the books of the law which they found, they burnt them with fire.",
            "And whosoever was found with any the book of the testament, or if any committed to the law, the king’s commandment was, that they should put him to death.",
            "Thus did they by their authority unto the Israelites every month, to as many as were found in the cities.",
            "Now the five and twentieth day of the month they did sacrifice upon the idol altar, which was upon the altar of God.",
            "At which time according to the commandment they put to death certain women, that had caused their children to be circumcised.",
            "And they hanged the infants about their necks, and rifled their houses, and slew them that had circumcised them.",
            "Howbeit many in Israel were fully resolved and confirmed in themselves not to eat any unclean thing.",
            "Wherefore the rather to die, that they might not be defiled with meats, and that they might not profane the holy covenant: so then they died",
            "And there was very great wrath upon Israel."

            "In those days arose Mattathias the son of John, the son of Simeon, a priest of the sons of Joarib, from Jerusalem, and dwelt in Modin.",
            " And he had five sons, Joannan, called Caddis: ",
            "Simon; called Thassi: Judas, who was called Maccabeus:",
            "Eleazar, called Avaran: and Jonathan, whose surname was Apphus.",
            "And when he saw the blasphemies that were committed in Juda and Jerusalem,",
            "He said, Woe is me! wherefore was I born to see this misery of my people, and of the holy city, and to dwell there, when it was delivered into the hand of the enemy, and the sanctuary into the hand of strangers?",
            "Her temple is become as a man without glory.",
            "Her glorious vessels are carried away into captivity, her infants are slain in the streets, her young men with the sword of the enemy.",

            "Then Mattathias and his sons rent their clothes, and put on sackcloth, and mourned very sore.",
            "In the mean while the king’s officers, such as compelled the people to revolt, came into the city Modin, to make them sacrifice.",
            "And when many of Israel came unto them, Mattathias also and his sons came together.",
            "Then answered the king’s officers, and said to Mattathias on this wise, ",
            "Thou art a ruler, and an honourable and great man in this city, and strengthened with sons and brethren: Now therefore come thou first, and fulfil the king’s commandment, like as all the heathen have done, yea, and the men of Juda also, and such as remain at Jerusalem:",
            "so shalt thou and thy house be in the number of the king’s friends, and thou and thy children shall be honoured with silver and gold, and many rewards.",
            "Then Mattathias answered and spake with a loud voice,",
            "Though all the nations that are under the king’s dominion obey him, and fall away every one from the religion of their fathers, and give consent to his commandments:",
            "Yet will I and my sons and my brethren walk in the covenant of our fathers.",

            "Now when he had left speaking these words, there came one of the Jews in the sight of all to sacrifice on the altar which was at Modin, according to the king’s commandment.",
            "Which thing when Mattathias saw, he was inflamed with zeal, and his reins trembled, neither could he forbear to shew his anger according to judgment:",
            "wherefore he ran, and slew him upon the altar. Also the king’s commissioner, who compelled men to sacrifice, he killed at that time, and the altar he pulled down.",
            "Thus dealt he zealously for the law of God like as Phinees did unto Zambri the son of Salom.",
            "And Mattathias cried throughout the city with a loud voice, saying, Whosoever is zealous of the law, and maintaineth the covenant, let him follow me.",
            "So he and his sons fled into the mountains, and left all that ever they had in the city.",
            "Then many that sought after justice and judgment went down into the wilderness,",
            "to dwell there: Both they, and their children, and their wives; and their cattle; because afflictions increased sore upon them.",

            "were gone down into the secret places in the wilderness, They pursued after them a great number,",
            "and having overtaken them, they camped against them, and made war against them on the sabbath day. And they said unto them,",
            "Let that which ye have done hitherto suffice; come forth, and do according to the commandment of the king, and ye shall live.",
            "But they said, We will not come forth, neither will we do the king’s commandment, to profane the sabbath day",

            "And one of them said to another, If we all do as our brethren have done, and fight not for our lives and laws against the heathen, they will now quickly root us out of the earth.",
            "At that time therefore they decreed, saying, Whosoever shall come to make battle with us on the sabbath day, we will fight against him; neither will we die all, as our brethren that were murdered in the secret places.",

            "Also all they that fled for persecution joined themselves unto them, and were a stay unto them. So they joined their forces, and smote sinful men in their anger, and wicked men in their wrath: but the rest fled to the heathen for succour.",

            "Nevertheless, when he saw that the money of his treasures failed and that the tributes in the country were small, because of the dissension and plague, which he had brought upon the land in taking away the laws which had been of old time;",
            "He feared that he should not be able to bear the charges any longer, nor to have such gifts to give so liberally as he did before: for he had abounded above the kings that were before him. Wherefore, being greatly perplexed in his mind,",
            "he determined to go into Persia, there to take the tributes of the countries, and to gather much money.",

            "They said one to another, Let us restore the decayed fortune of our people, and let us fight for our people and the sanctuary.",
            "Then was the congregation gathered together, that they might be ready for battle, and that they might pray, and ask mercy and compassion.",
            "Now Jerusalem lay void as a wilderness, there was none of her children that went in or out: the sanctuary also was trodden down, ",
            "and aliens kept the strong hold; the heathen had their habitation in that place; and joy was taken from Jacob, and the pipe with the harp ceased.",
            "Wherefore the Israelites assembled themselves together, and came to Maspha, over against Jerusalem; for in Maspha was the place where they prayed aforetime in Israel.",
            "Then they fasted that day, and put on sackcloth, and cast ashes upon their heads, and rent their clothes, ",
            "And laid open the book of the law, wherein the heathen had sought to paint the likeness of their images. ",
            "They brought also the priests’ garments, and the firstfruits, and the tithes: and the Nazarites they stirred up, who had accomplished their days.",
            "Then cried they with a loud voice toward heaven, saying, What shall we do with these, and whither shall we carry them away?",
            "For thy sanctuary is trodden down and profaned, and thy priests are in heaviness, and brought low.",
            "And lo, the heathen are assembled together against us to destroy us: what things they imagine against us, thou knowest. ",
            "How shall we be able to stand against them, except thou, O God, be our help?",
            "Then sounded they with trumpets, and cried with a loud voice.",
            "And after this Judas ordained captains over the people, even captains over thousands, and over hundreds, and over fifties, and over tens. But as for such as were building houses, or had betrothed wives, or were planting vineyards, or were fearful, those he commanded that they should return, every man to his own house, according to the law.",
            "So the camp removed, and pitched upon the south side of Emmaus.",
            "And Judas said, arm yourselves, and be valiant men,",
            "and see that ye be in readiness against the morning, that ye may fight with these nations, that are assembled together against us to destroy us and our sanctuary: ",
            "For it is better for us to die in battle, than to behold the calamities of our people and our sanctuary.",

            "Wherefore Simon called his two eldest sons, Judas and John, and said unto them,",
            "I, and my brethren, and my father’s house, have ever from my youth unto this day fought against the enemies of Israel; and things have prospered so well in our hands, that we have delivered Israel oftentimes.",
            "But now I am old, and ye, by God’s mercy, are of a sufficient age: be ye instead of me and my brother, and go and fight for our nation, and the help from heaven be with you.",
            "So he chose out of the country twenty thousand men of war with horsemen, who went out against Cendebeus, and rested that night at Modin.",
            "And when as they rose in the morning, and went into the plain, behold, a mighty great host both of footmen and horsemen came against them: howbeit there was a water brook betwixt them.",
            "So he and his people pitched over against them: and when he saw that the people were afraid to go over the water brook, he went first over himself, and then the men seeing him passed through after him.",
            "That done, he divided his men, and set the horsemen in the midst of the footmen: for the enemies’ horsemen were very many.",
            "Then sounded they with the holy trumpets: whereupon Cendebeus and his host were put to flight, so that many of them were slain, and the remnant gat them to the strong hold.",
            "At that time was Judas John’s brother wounded; but John still followed after them, until he came to Cedron, which Cendebeus had built.",
            "So they fled even unto the towers in the fields of Azotus; wherefore he burned it with fire: so that there were slain of them about two thousand men. Afterward he returned into the land of Judea in peace.",
            "Moreover in the plain of Jericho was Ptolemeus the son of Abubus made captain, and he had abundance of silver and gold: For he was the high priest’s son in law.",
            "Wherefore his heart being lifted up, he thought to get the country to himself, and thereupon consulted deceitfully against Simon and his sons to destroy them.",
            "Now Simon was visiting the cities that were in the country, and taking care for the good ordering of them;",
            "at which time he came down himself to Jericho with his sons, Mattathias and Judas, in the hundred threescore and seventeenth year, in the eleventh month, called Sabat:",
            "Where the son of Abubus receiving them deceitfully into a little hold, called Docus, which he had built, made them a great banquet: howbeit he had hid men there.",
            "So when Simon and his sons had drunk largely, Ptolemee and his men rose up, and took their weapons, and came upon Simon into the banqueting place, and slew him, and his two sons, and certain of his servants.",
            "In which doing he committed a great treachery, and recompensed evil for good.",
            "Then Ptolemee wrote these things, and sent to the king, that he should send him an host to aid him, and he would deliver him the country and cities.",
            "He sent others also to Gazera to kill John: and unto the tribunes he sent letters to come unto him, that he might give them silver, and gold, and rewards.",
            "And others he sent to take Jerusalem, and the mountain of the temple.",
            "Now one had run afore to Gazera and told John",
            "that his father and brethren were slain, and, quoth he, Ptolemee hath sent to slay thee also.",
            "Hereof when he heard, he was sore astonished: so he laid hands on them that were come to destroy him, and slew them; for he knew that they sought to make him away.",
            "As concerning the rest of the acts of John, and his wars, and worthy deeds which he did, and the building of the walls which he made, and his doings, Behold, these are written in the chronicles of his priesthood, from the time he was made high priest after his father."
