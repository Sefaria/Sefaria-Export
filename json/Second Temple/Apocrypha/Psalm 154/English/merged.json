        "With a loud voice glorify God, in the congregation of the many proclaim His majesty.",
        "In the multitude of the upright glorify His name, and with the faithful recount His greatness.",
        "Bind your souls to the good ones, and to the pure ones to glorify the Most High.",
        "Form an assembly to proclaim His salvation, and be not lax in making known His might and His majesty to all simple folk.",
        "For to make known the glory of the LORD is Wisdom given.",
        "And for recounting His many deeds She was revealed to men.",
        "To make known to the simple folk His might, and to explain to senseless folk His greatness.",
        "Those far from Her gates, those who stray from Her portals.",
        "For the Most High is the Lord of Jacob, and His majesty is over all His works.",
        "And a man who glorifies the Most High, He accepts as one who brings a meal-offering.",
        "As one who offers he-goats and bullocks; as one who fattens the altar with many burnt offerings; as with a sweet-smelling fragrance from the hand of the righteous.",
        "From the gates of the righteous Her voice is heard, and from the assembly of the pious Her song.",
        "When they eat with satiety She is cited, and when they drink in a community together.",
        "Their meditation is on the Law of the Most High, their words on making known His might.",
        "How far from the wicked is Her word, from all haughty men to know Her.",
        "Behold the eyes of the LORD are compassionate over the good ones.",
        "And upon those who glorify Him He increases His mercy; from an evil time will He deliver their soul.",
        "Bless the LORD, who redeems the humble from the hand of adversaries, and He delivers the perfect from the power of the wicked.",
        "Who establishes a horn out of Jacob, and a judge of peoples out of Israel.",
        "He who desires his habitation in Zion, choose Jerusalem forever."
