            "ON MATING WITH THE PRELIMINARY STUDIES (DE CONGRESSU QUAERENDAE ERUDITIONIS GRATIA) <br>ANALYTICAL INTRODUCTION",
            "The subject of this treatise is Gen. 16:1–6 with some omissions.",
            "1. Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, was not bearing to him, and she had a handmaiden, an Egyptian, named Hagar.",
            "2. And Sarai said to Abram: “Behold the Lord hath shut me out from bearing. Go in therefore unto my handmaiden that I may have children from her.” And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.",
            "3. And Sarai the wife of Abram, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, took Hagar, the Egyptian, her handmaid, and gave her to Abram her husband as a wife.",
            "4. And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived, and she saw that she was with child, and her mistress was dishonoured before her.",
            "5. And Sarai said to Abram, “I am wronged at thy hands. I have given my handmaiden to thy bosom. But seeing that she was with child, I was dishonoured before her. The Lord judge between thee and me.”",
            "6. And Abram said to Sarai, “Behold thy handmaid is in thy hands. Do with her as is pleasing to thee.” And Sarai afflicted her.",
            "This treatise, though it has little of the eloquence and spirituality which brighten most of the others, has a special interest of its own. Nowhere else in Philo nor, so far as I know, in any other Greek writer do we find so full a treatment of the Stoic doctrine, that the accepted school course or Encyclia was the proper preparation for philosophy. Apart from this there are many remarks on the value of the different subjects and the relations of teacher and pupil, which are both sensible and acute, however fantastical we may think their allegorical setting.",
            "Philo begins by pointing out that while Virtue or Wisdom which are represented by Sarah is never barren, she is at this stage in the story Sarai (Σάρα not Σάρρα), that is wisdom in the individual, who is as yet incapable of begetting by her. Stress therefore is to be laid on “she was not bearing for him” (1–12), and when in Sarah’s own words this limitation is not mentioned, we must ascribe it to the delicacy of feeling which true wisdom shews for others (13). The immature soul must therefore resort to the handmaid, the Encyclia, and the list of these is given with some remarks on the educational value of each (14–19). The first thing we note about the handmaid of the story is her race. She is an Egyptian, of the body that is, and the Encyclia depend on the senses in a way in which the higher philosophy does not (20–21). Secondly her name—Hagar, means a sojourner, and the relation of the sojourner to the full citizen expresses that of the Encyclia to philosophy (22–23).",
            "The thought that Abraham, the soul which learns by teaching, needs Hagar, naturally leads to the consideration of the case of Jacob, the soul which progresses through practice. He has two wives and two concubines, and the functions of these four are described in a long and difficult allegory (24–33). On the other hand Isaac has but one wife and no concubine. Thus again he appears in his regular part as the “self-taught,” the “gifted by nature,” for such a soul has not the need of the extraneous aids which the other two require (34–38). Thence we pass to remarks on other cases of wives and concubines, a short one on Manasseh (39–43), and a more elaborate one on Nahor, Abraham’s brother (44–53). Finally comes the thought that the bad also has a wife in the mind, which bears vice, and a concubine in the body, which bears passion. This is founded on the notice of Esau’s son’s concubine and passes into a denunciation of the Esau-mind itself, as the nature which represents both hardness and fiction (54–62).",
            "“He hearkened to the voice of Sarah.” This raises the thought how little real attention there is in the people who attend lectures and the like, how little memory even if they attend, and how little practice even if they remember (63–68). But further, the phrase “listened to her voice,” instead of “listened to her,” suggests the natural attitude of the Abraham-mind, as against the Jacob-mind which “practises” and thus thinks more of personal example than of what is said (69–70).",
            "“Sarai the <i>wife</i> of Abram took Hagar and <i>gave</i> her to Abram.” Virtue (or philosophy) is actively willing to give to the immature soul its preparation through the Encyclia (71, 72), while on the other hand the seemingly unnecessary repetition of the word “wife” shews the stress which philosophy justly lays on her status. She is always the wife and the other only the handmaid (73). Philo illustrates this from his personal experience. He tells how he delighted as a youth in literature, mathematics and music, yet always recognized that they were but stepping-stones to the higher study of ethics, which teaches us to control the lower nature, and how thus he avoided the error of those who treat these inferior studies as an occupation for life (74–80).",
            "Abraham had “dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan” when he took Hagar. Even for the Encyclia the soul is not at first fit. Childhood, in which we are dominated by bodily things, and early boyhood, in which we learn the difference between right and wrong, are both too early. While Egypt signifies the body and its passions, Canaan stands for vice, and it is only after we have passed some time in the stage in which vice is possible that we have the ability for these solid studies (81–88). But the number ten is not to be pressed. It is just the perfect number (89), and Philo takes the opportunity to descant on the prominence of it in the Pentateuch. Noah as tenth from Adam (90); Abraham as tenth combatant against the nine kings, a number which signifies hostility (91–93); the offering of tithes on various occasions, followed by the familiar insistence on the duty to offer of everything mental as well as bodily (94–106); the passover in which the lamb is killed on the tenth day (106); the Atonement and the proclamation of the Jubilee also on that day (107–108). Other examples follow, most of which, as for instance the account of the presents with which Isaac wooed Rebecca, and the ten curtains of the tabernacle, whose four colours represented the four elements, digress into morals and fancies drawn from the content of these passages, quite apart from the Ten interest (109–119). He concludes with the remarks that after all these examples were unnecessary, since the Ten Commandments in themselves are enough to prove his point (120).",
            "After reiterating the necessity of postponing school instruction to a suitable age, Philo proceeds to the words “He went in unto her.” This indicates the right attitude of the scholar to the teacher (121–122), but the teacher also will often do well to make the advances, as Leah did to Jacob (122–123), though again Knowledge may sometimes veil her face to try the sincerity of her pupils, as Tamar did before she gave herself to Judah (124–125). So too the word συνέλαβε, “she conceived” (lit. “she took”), has in Greek no mark of the gender, and thus in our allegory we may interpret that the “taking” is mutual (126).",
            "Contrasted with this right view of the relation of the two is the arrogance of many teachers who think that the progress of their gifted pupils is due to themselves (127). When knowledge takes this attitude it may be described by the phrase “to have in the womb,” used of Hagar’s pregnancy, whereas Rebecca was said to “receive in the womb,” for the “receive” and “have” represent respectively reverent humility and self-conceit (128–130). He finds “received” used in the story of Moses’ birth and this leads to an eulogy of Moses and the tribe of Levi (131–134). Somewhat loosely connected with this is a short interpretation of a law by which the man who struck a woman and caused a premature birth was punished by a fine or death, according as the child born dead was fully formed or not. To destroy the fruits of another’s mind is always a crime, but a greater when the idea is fully formed, than when it is not (135–138).",
            "“When she saw that she was pregnant.” Philo is confident that the first “she” is Sarah because philosophy sees into the nature of the “arts” which make up the Encyclia better than the arts see themselves. He gives the accepted definitions of “art” and “knowledge” and likens their relation to each other to that of sense to mind (139–145). Then follows a remarkable illustration of this, shewing that at the back of geometry lie the definitions of point, line and the like, which come from philosophy, and similarly that though the <i>grammaticus</i> may expound literature, he must go to philosophy for the nature of the parts of speech and the logic of sentences (146–150).",
            "Philosophy rightly resents the ignoring of her claims which is represented in the words “I was dishonoured before her,” and to her complaints the true student will answer with Abraham’s words: “She is in thy hands,” and leave the lower knowledge to the treatment expressed in “and she afflicted or ill-treated her,” always remembering however that by this word (ἐκάκωσε) only admonishing or correcting is meant (151–157).",
            "What form the admonishing would take Philo does not discuss, but passes off into a justification of his giving this meaning to ἐκάκωσεν and this takes up the rest of the treatise. Consideration of the demoralizing effects of luxury shews that affliction if regulated by law is beneficial (158–160), and the use of the unleavened bread, called in Deuteronomy bread of affliction, and of bitter herbs at the Paschal Feast agree with this, for feasts are things of joy and the ordinance must mean that chastening toil is a joy to the earnest soul (161–162). So too at the end of the story of the bitter water of Marah we read that at Marah God gave Israel laws—the law of justice (163). The same text says that at Marah God tried Israel, tried them that is with the test of toil to which so many succumb (164–165). Yet again the waters of Marah became sweet, that is the toil is sweetened by the love of toil (166). The lesson of the unleavened bread at the Passover is confirmed by the unleavened shewbread and the prohibition of leaven in the sacrifices (167–169). So when we find in Deuteronomy “He afflicted thee and made thee weak with hunger” coupled with “He fed thee with Manna”—the word of God—we understand that the affliction is one of discipline and the famine a dearth of passion and vice (170–174). So too when Isaac blesses Jacob, even slavery is part of the blessing, and in Proverbs “the Lord chastens whom He loves” (175–177). Philo concludes the argument with what he thinks a clinching proof, that if the law speaks of “ill-treating or afflicting with evil,” it implies that afflicting may exist without evil (178–179).",
            "The last section reiterates the necessity of giving the passage an allegorical sense, and implies, if it does not actually say so, that on the literal view the story would be nothing more than an unworthy record of women’s jealousies."

                "[2] Now Sarah’s name is, by interpretation, “sovereignty of me,” and the wisdom in me, the self-control in me, the individual righteousness and each of the other virtues whose place is confined to the “me,” are a sovereignty over me only. That sovereignty rules and dominates me, who have willed to render obedience to it, in virtue of its natural queenship.",
                "[3] This ruling power Moses represents as at once barren and exceedingly prolific, since he acknowledges that from her sprang the most populous of nations. A startling paradox, yet true. For indeed virtue is barren as regards all that is bad, but shews herself a fruitful mother of the good; a motherhood which needs no midwifery, for she bears before the midwife comes.",
                "[4] Animals and plants bear the fruit proper to them only after considerable intervals, once or twice at most in the year, the number being determined for each by nature and adjusted to the seasons of the year. But virtue has no such intervals. She bears ceaselessly, successively, from moment to moment, and her offspring are no infants, but honest words, innocent purposes and laudable acts."
            ],
            [
                "[5] But as wealth which one cannot use does not profit the owner, so the motherhood of virtue profits not if the offspring be not profitable for ourselves. Some she judges quite worthy to share her life, but others she thinks have not yet reached the age to submit to her admirable and chaste and sober domesticity. Such she allows to celebrate the preliminaries of marriage, and holds out hopes of consummating the full rite in the future.",
                "[6] So Sarah, the virtue which rules my soul, was a mother, but not a mother for me. For young as I was I could not yet receive her offspring, wisdom, justice, piety, because of the multitude of bastard children whom vain imaginations had borne to me. The nurture of these, the constant supervision, the ceaseless anxiety, compelled me to take little thought of the genuine, the truly free-born.",
                "[7] It is well then to pray that virtue may not only bear (she does that in abundance without our prayers), but also may bear for ourselves, that we, by sharing in what she sows and genders, may enjoy happiness. For in ordinary course she bears for God only, thankfully rendering the first-fruits of the blessings bestowed upon her to Him who, as Moses says, opens the womb which yet loses not its virginity (Gen. 29:31).",
                "[8] In confirmation of this we read that the candlestick, that is the original pattern of the later copy, gives light from one part only, that is the part where it looks towards God. For being seventh in position, and placed between the six branches, divided as they are into triplets which guard it on either side, it sends its rays upwards towards the Existent, as though feeling that its light were too bright for human sight to look upon it (Ex. 25:37, 31)."
            ],
            [
                "[9] This is why Moses does not say that Sarah did not bear, but only that she did not bear for some particular person. For we are not capable as yet of receiving the impregnation of virtue unless we have first mated with her handmaiden, and the handmaiden of wisdom is the culture gained by the primary learning of the school course.",
                "[10] For, just as in houses we have outer doors in front of the chamber doors, and in cities suburbs through which we can pass to the inner part, so the school course precedes virtue; the one is a road which leads to the other.",
                "[11] Now we must understand that great themes need great introductions; and the greatest of all themes is virtue, for it deals with the greatest of materials, that is the whole life of man. Naturally, then, virtue will employ no minor kind of introduction, but grammar, geometry, astronomy, rhetoric, music, and all the other branches of intellectual study. These are symbolized by Hagar, the handmaid of Sarah, as I shall proceed to shew.",
                "[12] For Sarah, we are told, said to Abraham: “Behold, the Lord has shut me out from bearing. Go in unto my handmaid, that thou mayest beget children from her.” In the present discussion, we must eliminate all bodily unions or intercourse which has pleasure as its object. What is meant is a mating of mind with virtue. Mind desires to have children by virtue, and, if it cannot do so at once, is instructed to espouse virtue’s handmaid, the lower instruction."
            ],
            [
                "[13] Now we may well feel profound admiration for the discretion shewn by Wisdom. She refrains from reproaching us with our backwardness or complete impotence in generation, though, as the text truly stated, it was through our unfitness that she was not bearing, and not because she grudged us offspring. Thus she says, “The Lord has shut me out from bearing,” and does not go on to add, “for you.” She does not wish to seem to upbraid and reproach others for their misfortune.",
                "[14] “Go in, then,” she says, “to my handmaid, the lower instruction given by the lower branches of school lore, that first you may have children by her,” for afterwards you will be able to avail yourself of the mistress’s company to beget children of higher birth.",
                "[15] For grammar teaches us to study literature in the poets and historians, and will thus produce intelligence and wealth of knowledge. It will teach us also to despise the vain delusions of our empty imagination by shewing us the calamities which heroes and demi-gods who are celebrated in such literature are said to have undergone.",
                "[16] Music will charm away the unrhythmic by its rhythm, the inharmonious by its harmony, the unmelodious and tuneless by its melody, and thus reduce discord to concord. Geometry will sow in the soul that loves to learn the seeds of equality and proportion, and by the charm of its logical continuity will raise from those seeds a zeal for justice.",
                "[17] Rhetoric, sharpening the mind to the observation of facts, and training and welding thought to expression, will make the man a true master of words and thoughts, thus taking into its charge the peculiar and special gift which nature has not bestowed on any other living creature.",
                "[18] Dialectic, the sister and twin, as some have said, of Rhetoric, distinguishes true argument from false, and convicts the plausibilities of sophistry, and thus will heal that great plague of the soul, deceit.",
                "It is profitable then to take these and the like for our associates and for the field of our preliminary studies. For perhaps indeed it may be with us, as it has been with many, that through the vassals we shall come to the knowledge of the royal virtues.",
                "[19] Observe too that our body is not nourished in the earlier stages with solid and costly foods. The simple and milky foods of infancy come first. Just so you may consider that the school subjects and the lore which belongs to each of them stand ready to nourish the childhood of the soul, while the virtues are grown-up food, suited for those who are really men."

            [
                "[20] The primary characteristic marks of the lower education are represented by two symbols giving its race and its name. In race it is Egypt, but its name is Hagar, which is by interpretation “sojourning.” The votary of the school studies, the friend of wide learning, must necessarily be associated with the earthly and Egyptian body; since he needs eyes to see and read, ears to listen and hear, and the other senses to unveil the several objects of sense.",
                "[21] For the thing judged cannot be apprehended without one to judge it, and it is sense which judges the sensible, and therefore without sense it is always impossible to obtain accurate knowledge of any of the phenomena in the sensible world which form the staple of philosophy. Sense being the bodily part of the soul is riveted to the vessel of the soul as a whole, and this soul-vessel is symbolically called Egypt.",
                "This, [22] then, is one of the marks of the handmaid of virtue, namely that of race. Let us now consider the nature of the other mark, that of name. The lower education is in the position of a sojourner. For knowledge and wisdom and every virtue are native born, indigenous, citizens in the truest sense, and in this they are absolutely alone; but the other kinds of training, which win second or third or last prizes, are on the border-line between foreigners and citizens. For they belong to neither kind in its pure form, and yet in virtue of a certain degree of partnership they touch both.",
                "[23] The sojourner in so far as he is staying in the city is on a par with the citizens, in so far as it is not his home, on a par with foreigners. In the same way, I should say, adopted children, in so far as they inherit from their adopters, rank with the family; in so far as they are not their actual children, with outsiders. Sarah, virtue, bears, we shall find, the same relation to Hagar, education, as the mistress to the servant-maid, or the lawful wife to the concubine, and so naturally the mind which aspires to study and to gain knowledge, the mind we call Abraham, will have Sarah, virtue, for his wife, and Hagar, the whole range of school culture, for his concubine.",

                "but, anyone whose mind is set on enduring to the end the weary contest in which virtue is the prize, who practises continually for that end, and is unflagging in self-discipline, will take to him two lawful wives and as handmaids to them two concubines.",
                "[25] And to each of them is given a different nature and appearance. Thus one of the lawful wives is a movement, sound, healthy and peaceful, and to express her history Moses names her Leah or “smooth.” The other is like a whetstone. Her name is Rachel, and on that whetstone the mind which loves effort and exercise sharpens its edge. Her name means “vision of profanation,” not because her way of seeing is profane, but on the contrary, because she judges the visible world of sense to be not holy but profane, compared with the pure and undefiled nature of the invisible world of mind.",
                "[26] For since our soul is twofold, with one part reasoning and the other unreasoning, each has its own virtue or excellence, the reasoning Leah, the unreasoning Rachel.",
                "[27] The virtue we call Rachel, acting through the senses and the other parts of our unreasoning nature, trains us to despise all that should be held of little account, reputation and wealth and pleasure, which the vulgar mass of ordinary men who accept the verdict of dishonest hearsay and the equally dishonest court of the other senses, judge worthy of their admiration and their efforts.",
                "[28] Leah teaches us to avoid the rough and uneven path, impassable to virtue-loving souls, and to walk smoothly along the level highway where there are no stumbling-blocks or aught that can make the foot to slip.",
                "[29] Necessarily then Leah will have for her handmaid the faculty of expression by means of the vocal organs, and on the side of thought the art of devising clever arguments whose easy persuasiveness is a means of deception, while Rachel has for her’s the necessary means of sustenance, eating and drinking.",
                "[30] Moses has given us, as the names of these two handmaidens, Zilpah and Bilhah (Gen. 30:3, 9). Zilpah by interpretation is “a walking mouth,” which signifies the power of expressing thought in language and directing the course of an exposition, while Bilhah is “swallowing,” the first and most necessary support of mortal animals. For our bodies are anchored on swallowing, and the cables of life are fastened on to it as their base.",
                "[31] With all these aforesaid faculties the Man of Practice mates, with one pair as free-born legitimate wives, with the other pair as slaves and concubines. For he desires the smooth, the Leah movement, which will produce health in the body, noble living and justice in the soul. He loves Rachel when he wrestles with the passions and when he goes into training to gain self-control, and takes his stand to oppose all the objects of sense. For help may take two forms.",
                "[32] It may act by giving us enjoyment of the good, the way of peace, or by opposing and removing ill, the way of war. So it is Leah through whom it comes to pass that he reaps the higher and dominant blessings, Rachel through whom he wins what we may call the spoils of war. Such is his life with the legitimate wives.",
                "[33] But the Practiser needs also Bilhah, “swallowing,” though only as the slave and concubine, for without food and the life which food sustains we cannot have the good life either, since the less good must always serve as foundation for the better. He needs Zilpah too, the gift of language giving expression to the course of an exposition, that the element of words and thoughts may make its twofold contribution to the perfecting process, through the fountain of thought in the mind and the outflow through the tongue and lips."

                "[34] Now Abraham and Jacob, as the Holy Scriptures tell us, became the husbands of several women, concubines as well as legitimate wives, but Isaac had neither more wives than one nor any concubine at all, but his lawful wife is the one who shares his home throughout.",
                "[35] Why is this? It is because the virtue that comes through teaching, which Abraham pursues, needs the fruits of several studies, both those born in wedlock, which deal with wisdom, and the base-born, those of the preliminary lore of the schools. It is the same with the virtue which is perfected through practice, which Jacob seems to have made his aim. For many and different are the truths in which practice finds its exercising ground, truths which both lead and follow, hasten to meet it and lag behind, and entail sometimes greater, sometimes less labour.",
                "[36] But the self-learnt kind, of which Isaac is a member, that joy which is the best of the good emotions, is endowed with a simple nature free from mixture and alloy, and wants neither the practice nor the teaching which entails the need of the concubine as well as the legitimate forms of knowledge. When God rains down from heaven the good of which the self is a teacher and learner both, it is impossible that that self should still live in concubinage with the slavish arts, as though desiring to be the father of bastard thoughts and conclusions. He who has obtained this prize is enrolled as the husband of the queen and mistress virtue. Her name in the Greek means “constancy”; in the Hebrew it is Rebecca.",

                "[38] for he has ready beside him in their fulness the gifts of God, conveyed by the breath of God’s higher graces, but he wishes and prays that these may remain with him constantly. And therefore I think his Benefactor, willing that His graces once received should stay for ever with him, gives him Constancy for his spouse."

                "[40] The man who is reminded must necessarily have forgotten what he remembered before. So the holy word names memory Ephraim, which by interpretation is “fruit-bearing,” while reminding or reminiscence is called in the Hebrew Manasseh, that is “from forgetfulness.”",

                "[171] Who then is so impious as to suppose that God is an afflictor, or evil-entreater, and that He sends famine, death in its most miserable form, on those who cannot live without food? For God is good and the cause of what is good, the benefactor, the saviour, the nourisher, the enricher, the bountiful giver, and He has expelled evil-mindedness from the holy boundaries. For so He banished those cumberers of the earth, both Adam and Eve, from Paradise.",
                "[172] Let us not, then, be misled by the actual words, but look at the allegorical meaning that lies beneath them, and say that “afflicted” is equivalent to “disciplined and admonished and chastened,” and that “subjected to famine” does not mean that He brought about a dearth of food and drink, but a dearth of pleasures and desires and fears and grief and wrongdoings, and in general all the works of the vices or the passions.",
                "[173] And this is confirmed by the words that follow, “He fed thee with the manna.” He who provided the food that costs no toil or suffering, the food which without the cares and pains of men came not from the earth in the common way, but was sent, a wonder and a marvel from heaven for the benefit of those who should use it—can we rightly speak of Him as the author of famine and affliction? Should we not on the contrary call Him the author of thriving and prosperity and secure and ordered living?",
                "[174] But the multitude, the common herd, who have never tasted of wisdom, the one true food of us all, think that those who feed on the divine words live in misery and suffering, and little know that their days are spent in continued well-being and gladness."

                "[175] Thus so profitable a thing is affliction of one sort, that even its most humiliating form, slavery, is reckoned a great blessing. Such slavery we read of in the holy scriptures as invoked by a father on his son, by the most excellent Isaac on the foolish Esau. There is a place where he says,",
                "[176] “Thou shalt live on thy sword and shalt be a slave to thy brother” (Gen. 27:40). He judges it most profitable for him who chooses war instead of peace, who by reason of his inward tumult and rebellion is armed as it were with the weapons of war, that he should become a subject and a slave and obey all the orders that the lover of self-control may impose.",
                "[177] Therefore, I think, did one of Moses’ disciples, who is named a man of peace, which is in our ancestral tongue Solomon, say as follows: “My son, despise not the discipline of God, nor faint when thou art rebuked by Him, for whom the Lord loveth He rebukes and scourges every son whom He receiveth” (Prov. 3:11, 12). So we see that reproaching and admonition are counted so excellent a thing, that they turn our acknowledgment of God into kinship with Him, for what relation can be closer than that of a father to a son, or a son to a father?",
                "[178] But lest the series of argument following argument should seem tedious and prolix, I will add but one proof, and that the clearest, to those here given, to shew that affliction or ill-usage of a kind is a work of virtue. There is a law in the following terms: “Ye shall not evil-entreat any widow or orphan, but if ye evil-entreat them with evil” (Ex. 22:22). What does he mean? Is it that one can be evil-entreated by some other thing than evil? For if evil-treatments are the work of evil and nothing else, it is superfluous to add what is a matter of agreement and will be admitted even without any further words.",
                "[179] No doubt he means to say, “I know that one may be rebuked by virtue and disciplined by wisdom, and therefore I do not hold all afflicting or evil-entreating to be blameworthy.” When it is the work of justice and the power of the law which chastens by reproof I am filled with admiration. When it is the work of folly and vice and therefore harmful, I turn away from it and call it by the evil names that are its due.",
                "[180] When, then, you hear of Hagar as afflicted or evil-entreated by Sarah, do not suppose that you have here one of the usual accompaniments of women’s jealousy. It is not women that are spoken of here; it is minds—on the one hand the mind which exercises itself in the preliminary learning, on the other, the mind which strives to win the palm of virtue and ceases not till it is won."

            "§ 11. <i>Astronomy</i>, Astronomy of an elementary kind was regularly included among the Encyclia, but is not named by Philo in his other lists of the subjects, doubtless because, as often in other writers, it is regarded as a branch of geometry. <i>Cf</i>. Quintilian, i. 10. 46 “quid quod se eadem geometria tollit ad rationem usque mundi? in qua siderum certos constitutosque cursus numeris docet.”",
            "§ 15. <i>The calamities … undergone</i>. This thought of the ethical value of history and poetry (epic and tragic) has already been brought out in <i>De Sac.</i> 78 f. See also <i>De Abr.</i> 23.",
            "§ 18. <i>Sister and twin</i>. Though ὡς εἶπόν τινες indicates that this is a definite quotation from some writer or writers, the close relation of dialectic to rhetoric, though much discussed by the Stoics (see <i>S.V.F.</i> i. 75, ii. 294), is not described by this phrase in any source known to us. Aristotle speaks of rhetoric as being (1) ἀντίστροφον (counterpart), (2) παραφυές (offshoot), (3) μόριον (part), (4) ὁμοίωμα (copy), of rhetoric (Aristot. <i>Rhet</i>. i. 1. 1, i. 2. 7).",
            "§ 29. <i>On the side of thought … deception</i>. It seems to me almost incredible that Leah’s handmaid, oratory or rhetoric, should on the side of ideas be limited to sophistical rhetoric, though one might understand this sort being admitted with the other, as indeed we find in <i>De Agr.</i> 13. Below in § 33 there is no such disparagement. I am strongly inclined to suspect a lacuna such as ἡ λογική <i>sc</i>. δύναμις &lt;τῆς διανοίας, οὐχ&gt; ἡ κτλ. Or for τῆς διανοίας we might conjecture τῶν πραγμάτων (facts), in which case ἡ λογική would still agree with εὕρεσις.",
            "§ 53. <i>Battles of argument</i>. Elsewhere in Philo this word and γνωσιμαχία seem to be used generally for contention, without any particular meaning attaching to γνωσι-. Here, however, in combination with συλλαβομαχοῦντες, it seems necessary to give the γνωσι- a more definite meaning, such as “of argument” or “as to knowledge.”",
            "§ 54. <i>The fount of human life. Cf</i>. <i>S. V.F</i>. i. 205 ἦθός ἐστι πηγὴ βίου, ἀφʼ ἧς αἱ κατὰ μέρος πράξεις ῥέονσι.",
            "<i>Ibid</i>. &lt;ἀστάς&gt;. That ἀστάς has been lost, as suggested in the footnote, seems to me very probable, though possibly a better form of the sentence, preserving the first ἤ of all MSS., and the ἤ before δόγματα of some, would be παλλακὰς μέντοι ἢ ἀστάς, δόξας ἢ δόγματα. It is true that no Biblical example of the ἀστή of the wicked man is given, but in § 59 her existence as the mother of κακία, while the παλλακή is the mother of πάθος, is assumed. If we make this insertion, the conjunction of δόξα (= παλλακή) with δόγμα (= ἀστή) gets a clear meaning. As it stands, this conjunction, which is not recorded elsewhere, is otiose. But in <i>De Sac.</i> 5 we have them contrasted, the καλὸν δόγμα, Abel, with the ἄτοπος δόξα, Cain, and in general δόγμα, though, as in this case, it may be bad, is associated with principles and convictions arrived at by reason in contrast to unreasoning δόξα. That the former should produce vicious principles (κακία) and the latter fleeting passion is quite in keeping.",
            "§ 77. <i>Doting on poetry … musical colours</i>. Clem. Al. (<i>Strom</i>, i. p. 332) reproduces these words as κατεγήρασαν οἱ μὲν αὐτῶν ἐν μουσικῇ, οἱ δὲ ἐν γεωμετρίᾳ, ἄλλοι δὲ ἐν γραμματικῇ, οἱ πλεῖστοι δὲ ἐν ῥητορικῇ. Hence Mangey strangely thought that γραμμαῖς should be corrected to γραμματικῇ, though in his translation he retains it as “delincationibus.” But Philo’s ποιήμασι gives Clement’s γραμματικῇ, as his γραμμαῖς gives γεωμετρίᾳ. γραμμαῖς cannot mean “drawing,” as Yonge certainly and Mangey presumably supposed. It is a regular term for geometrical figures, and γραμμικαὶ ἀποδείξεις for geometrical proofs (Quintilian i. 10. 38.) Mangey translates χρωμάτων κράσεσι by “temperaturis colorum,” which leaves it doubtful whether he thought, as Yonge did, that it meant painting. There can be no reasonable doubt that it refers to the χρώματα of music. Though Aristotle laid stress on γραφική as a means of education, it never appears among the Encyclia. On the other hand the χρώματα, as shown in § 76, are an important element in music. Aristides Quintilianus (p. 18) gives this explanation of the name: χρῶμα, τὸ διὰ ἡμιτονίων συντεινόμενον· ὡς γὰρ τὸ μεταξὺ λευκοῦ καὶ μέλανος χρῶμα καλεῖται, οὕτω τὸ διὰ μέσων ἀμφοῖν θεωρούμενον χρῶμα καλεῖται. This suggests that κράσεις χρωμάτων may mean blendings which constitute χρώματα rather than blendings of them, but I leave this to the experts.",
            "§ 79. <i>For philosophy</i>, etc. For this Stoic definition <i>cf</i>. <i>S. V.F</i>. ii. 36 τὴν φιλοσοφίαν φασὶν ἐπιτήδευσιν εἶναι σοφίας, τὴν δὲ σοφίαν ἐπιστήμην θείων τε καὶ ἀνθρωπίνων πραγμάτων. Cicero gives it in a form nearer to Philo, <i>De Off</i>. ii. 5 “nec quicquam aliud est philosophia … praeter studium sapientiae. Sapientia autem est, ut a veteribus philosophis definitum est, rerum divinarum et humanarum causarumque, quibus eae res continentur, scientia.”",
            "§ 107. περινοίᾳ λογισμοῦ πεποιθυίας. The translation given assumes (1) that πεποιθυίας (of a soul trusting) is not co-ordinate with the other participles, (2) that γενητοῦ agrees with λογισμοῦ; neither of which seems likely, though grammatically possible. Moreover, Philo would probably have written τοῦ πεποιθέναι instead of πεποιθυίας. Wendland conjectured περὶ πάντα λογισμῷ μεμαθηκυίας. This seems very arbitrary. Cohn suggested περινοίᾳ καὶ λογισμῷ πεπονθυίας. But if this means “experiencing through reasoning the nothingness of creation,” it does not seem to me Greek. I suggest as slightly better to transfer περ. λογ. πεπ. and read ἱκετευούσης θεὸν ψυχῆς περινοίᾳ λογισμοῦ &lt;οὐ&gt; πεποιθυίας καὶ τὴν ταπεινότητα καὶ οὐδενείαν τοῦ γενητοῦ καὶ τὰς ἐν ἅπασι τοῖς καλοῖς ὑπερβολὰς καὶ ἀκρότητας τοῦ ἀγενήτου δεδιδαγμένης. This will make good sense and run smoothly, and it seems more likely that Philo thinks that human sagacity (περίνοια) or even human reason proves worthless in this supreme abasement, than that it is the agent by which the soul is schooled to humiliate itself, as Cohn’s and Wendland’s suggestions imply. Textually the loss of οὐ after λογισμοῦ is negligible and the departure from the MSS., apart from the slight change of -αν to -ᾳ, lies in the transference of the three difficult words. I shall not be surprised however if it does not give general satisfaction.",
            "§ 133. <i>The founder of this tribe</i>. Wendland gives as reference for the saying “God alone must I honour” Ex. 20:3, <i>i.e</i>. the First Commandment, and therefore presumably took the γενάρχης to be Moses. But the reference is, I think, to the Blessing of Levi (Deut. 33:9) “who saith to his father and his mother I have not seen thee, and his brothers he knew not and his sons he disclaimed.” In <i>Leg. All</i>. ii. 51 Philo has made a very similar use of this text (though there the father and the mother are mind and body), inferring from it that the Levi-mind rejects all such things for the sake of having God as his portion, in accordance with the words of Deut. 10:9, which he again quotes here. And the same interpretation of Deut. 33:9 is given in <i>De Fug.</i> 89, where Levi is called ὁ ἀρχηγέτης τοῦ θιάσου τούτου.",
            "§ 141. <i>A system of conceptions</i>, etc. For this Stoic definition <i>cf</i>. <i>S. V.F</i>. i. 73, ii. 93 f. Sometimes in a longer form, συγγεγυμνασμένων καὶ ἐπὶ τέλος εὔχρηστον τῷ βίῳ λαμβανόντων (ἐχόντων) τὴν ἀναφόραν, where the masculine λαμβανόντων shews that συγγ. also is masculine and that not the conceptions but the things conceived of are coordinated. As ἐγγεγυμνασμένων appears in some examples (see <i>S.V.F.</i> i. 73), Wendland is perhaps somewhat rash in altering to συγγ. If ἐγγ. is retained, translate “exercised upon.”",
            "<i>Ibid</i>. For the definition of ἐπιστήμη, given in practically the same words as here, see <i>S.V.F.</i> i. 68.",
            "§ 148. <i>Elucidation of the … poets and historians</i>. This definition with minor variations was the accepted one. In the grammar of Dionysius Thrax, which furnished the model for the later grammarians, both Greek and Latin, it appears in the form ἐμπειρία τῶν παρὰ ποιηταῖς τε καὶ συγγραφεῦσι ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ πολὺ λεγομένων. The definition brings out the important fact that γραμματική originally suggested literary study rather than what we call grammar.",
            "§ 149. The only terms in this list which either need explanation or have not had it on <i>De Agr.</i> 140, 141 are ἀποφαντόν and περιεκτικόν. From Diog. Laert. vii. 65 it appears that ἀποφαντόν which I have rendered by “declaratory” = ἀξίωμα, <i>i.e</i>. a statement which must be either true or false, which cannot be said of the forms of speech (ἐρώτημα, etc.) which follow. While D. L. himself defines ἀξίωμα as πρᾶγμα αὐτοτελές ἀποφαντὸν ὅσον ἐφʼ ἑαυτῷ, he has confused his interpreters by quoting Chrysippus: ἀξίωμά ἐστι τὸ ἀποφαντὸν ἢ καταφαντὸν ὅσον ἐφʼ ἑαυτῷ, οἷον Ἡμέρα ἐστί, Δίων περιπατεῖ. This has led Hicks to translate ἀποφαντόν “capable of being denied,” as opposed to καταφαντόν. But this is surely to confuse ἀποφαντός from ἀποφαίνω with ἀποφατικός from ἀπόφημι. Liddell &amp; Scott both in the earlier and in the recent edition make the confusion worse, as while giving ἀποφ. as = “asserting,” they say under καταφ. “to be affirmed, opposed to ἀποφαντός.” I feel no doubt that ἀποφ. is “affirming” or “capable of being affirmed,” and I should explain the καταφαντόν of Chrysippus as a synonym, which some preferred, unless indeed he means that ἀποφ. is used of such sentences as ἡμέρα ἑστί, and καταφ. of such as Δίων περιπατεῖ. Also it might easily be a gloss.",
            "It should be added that as to ἀποφαντικός, sometimes used for the indicative mood, the examples shew that no doubt is possible, and ἀποφαντικός can hardly be separated from ἀποφαντός.",
            "As for περιεκτικόν, it is most probably a mistake for προστακτικόν (imperative), which appears in D. L.’s list. At any rate if it is genuine, it must have some meaning unknown to us. The only sense in which we meet the word is for a place in which a number of things or persons are collected, <i>e.g</i>. ἀμπελών, παρθενών. Stephanus, indeed, has a statement, which L. &amp; S. have copied, that περιεκτικὸν ῥῆμα is a verb in the middle voice, but no authority is given. And both these meanings are impossible in a list which contains different forms of sentences.",
            "§ 155. “<i>In thy hands</i>.” I suspect that Philo suggests in this section that the Greek of the text quoted may mean not only “The handmaid is in thy hands (or power),” but <i>also</i> “Thy handmaid is in the hands.” <i>It must</i> be remembered that when he gives two alternative meanings for a passage, he does not think, as we should, that one <i>must</i> be the right one. To his mind they may both be intended. If we suppose that he is here commenting on “Thy handmaid is in the hands,” the argument will become much clearer. The supposition will involve reading here ἐν ταῖς χερσί for ἐν ταῖς χερσί σου, but there is not much difficulty in this. A scribe failing to see the point might very naturally add σου.",
            "§ 159. <i>Unrebuked</i>. Or “whose licence is unchecked.” Mangey suspected ἀνεπίπληκτος in this sense, and perhaps it more generally means “not liable to rebuke,” “blameless.” But see Plato, <i>Legg</i>. 695 B, where it is applied to the undisciplined boyhood of Cyrus’s sons, who left to women and eunuchs became οἵους ἦν εἰκὸς αὐτοὺς γενέσθαι τροφῇ ἀνεπιπλήκτῳ τραφέντας. So too in manhood they are τρυφῆς μεστοὶ καὶ ἀνεπιπληξίας.",
            "<i>Ibid</i>. ὑπαργύρους καὶ ὑποχρύσους. These adjectives, which Mangey translated by “aureos et argenteos,” ignoring the ὑπο-, are at first sight very difficult. All the evidence in the dictionaries hitherto given goes to prove that the prefix indicates not that the silver or gold conceals some other metal, but that it is covered or concealed by it. Thus while ὑπάργυρος may suggest a base coin, because the silver is coated with gold, ὑπόχρυσος would only suggest gold concealed by some baser metal. An article, however, by A. Körte in <i>Hermes</i>, 1929, pp. 262 f., to which Dr. Rouse called my attention, brings considerable evidence from inscriptions of the third century, as well as a line from Menander, 170 ff. (ὑπόχρυσος δακτύλιός τις οὑτοσί, αὐτὸς σιδηροῦς), to shew that ὑποχ. is used of iron rings or the like gilded over. Körte does not deal with ὑπάργυρος, but the same principle will apply. He connects the prefix with the common use of ὑπο- in adjectives, particularly in medical language, to indicate “somewhat,” <i>e.g</i>. ὑπόλευκος “whitish.” While he translates ὑπόχρυσος “gilded,” it need not be inferred, I think, that the word in itself means this. Rather the two words are opposed to ὁλόχρυσος, ὁλάργυρος, and indicate that the gold and silver are not the predominant, or at least not the sole elements. But since, as a matter of fact, the admixture of gold or silver would regularly take the form of a coating, “veneered” or “plated” may stand.",
            "§ 160. <i>Admonition</i>. I do not think that Philo can have written νουθεσίαν. Apart from the absurdity pointed out in the footnote, the ὥστε demands something inferred from the text, which has stated that those who live without κάκωσις forsake God. The inference must be that those who are under κάκωσις cleave to Him. I think Philo must have written εὐσέβειαν or θεοσέβειαν, which by some blunder was changed to νουθεσίαν as νομοθεσίαν to ἐκκλησίαν in § 120.",
            "§ 171. <i>Eve</i>. Here again one can only suppose a similar blunder, possibly assisted by the similarity of ΚΑΙΕΥΑΝ to ΚΑΙΝ. Though Wendland retains the MS. text, it seems to me incredible that Philo should have thought that Cain was expelled from Paradise. At any rate, even if Philo wrote Cain, he meant to write Eve."
