            "ON THE BIRTH OF ABEL AND THE SACRIFICES OFFERED BY HIM AND BY HIS BROTHER CAIN (DE SACRIFICIIS ABELIS ET CAINI) <br>ANALYTICAL INTRODUCTION",
            "The main theme of this treatise is the interpretation of Gen. 4:2–4.",
            "<i>v.</i> 2 I. (1–10). He added to this that she brought forth his brother Abel.",
            "II. (11–49). And Abel became a shepherd of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the land.",
            "<i>v.</i> 3 III. (50–87). And it came to pass after some days that Cain brought of the fruits of the earth as a sacrifice to the Lord.",
            "<i>v.</i> 4 IV. (88-end). And Abel brought also himself of the first-born of his sheep and of their fats.",
            "In I. Philo principally meditates on the word “added,” the subject of which he assumes to be God. He holds that addition always implies a removal of something and thus the birth of the Abel attitude of mind, which refers all things to God, implies the removal of the opposite Cain attitude. His thought then passes (5) to the phrase used of the patriarchs “he was added to his people.” He makes comparisons in this respect between Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, thought of as the three who learn respectively by teaching, nature, and practice, and finally contrasts them (8) with Moses, who is not “added” but translated to God’s presence.",
            "The treatment of II. opens (11) with a discussion as to why Abel the younger is mentioned in <i>v.</i> 2 before his elder brother, the answer being that vice is older in point of time, but virtue in point of worth. This is illustrated (15) from experience of life, for the philosophical calm comes later than the passions of youth, then (17) from the story of Jacob and Esau, and finally (19) by the law of Deut. 21:15–17, that the first-born who is the child of the hated wife (<i>i.e.</i> Virtue) is not to be disinherited in favour of the younger child of the beloved wife (<i>i.e.</i> Vice). This leads Philo on to the elaborate allegory (20–44) of the two, as courtesan and chaste woman, pressing their claims upon the mind. Virtue’s harangue, beginning 28, which contains what is probably the most formidable catalogue of bad qualities ever drawn up (32), includes an impassioned eulogy of toil (35–41) and ends with some loosely connected thoughts (43–44) on the inferior value of the secular learning. Her pleading prevails with the mind (45), which becomes what Abel was—a shepherd, and thus we resume the real consideration of the text. The true shepherd controls the unreasoning, but not vicious, faculties (46) and the greatness of the calling is illustrated from various verses in the Pentateuch (48–51). We should here expect some similar interpretation of Cain’s occupation, but Philo dismisses this with the remark that he has treated it in an earlier book (51).",
            "III. The charges brought against Cain in <i>v.</i> 3 are (<i>a</i>) that he offered only “after some days,” (<i>b</i>) that he offered of the fruits, but not of the first-fruits. The first naturally leads to a homily (53) on the duty of ready service. The causes of tardiness are discussed and rebuked by appropriate texts (54–57), and an example of ready thankfulness is found (59) in the story of Abraham, when he bids Sarah <i>hasten</i> to prepare a meal for the angelic visitors of Gen. 18. Two side thoughts are suggested by this story, (1) an interpretation of the three measures of meal (59), (2) of the phrase “buried cakes” (<i>i.e.</i>, cakes baked in the ashes (60) which Philo explains as the duty of reticence about sacred truths; and as this phrase is also used of the dough brought out of Egypt, we are led on to some thoughts about the symbolism of the passover (60–63). We return (64) to the duty of avoiding delay, and Philo dwells on the timelessness of God’s actions, which we should imitate in our worship (64–68). This is contrasted (69) with Pharaoh’s postponement of Moses’ prayers on his behalf, which again is compared with the human tendency to seek help in misfortune from earthly remedies rather than from God (70–71).",
            "The second charge brought against the Cain spirit necessitates an examination of what “first-fruits” are. They must be first in “value,” <i>i.e.</i> virtues (73), but the ἀπαρχή or “first offering” of these is rather an εὐχαριστητικὸς λόγος or body of pious meditation. At this point (74–75) Philo, remembering that in Lev. 2:14 the offering is to be “new, roasted, sliced, pounded,” passes on to an examination of these four, which are treated with much richness of thought. The substance of our meditation must be fresh inspired thoughts (76–79) which will supersede the old-world learning of the schools, dear as that is to Philo (78). It must be hardened by the fire of close reasoning (80–81). It must be “sliced” or divided by careful analysis and classification of the thoughts under their proper headings (82–85), and finally it must be “pounded,” <i>i.e.</i> made part of ourselves by the discipline of repeated meditation (85–87).",
            "IV. The introduction of the subject of Abel’s offering of the first-born of his sheep is immediately followed by a quotation of the directions with regard to the offering of the first-born in Exod. 13:11–13, and the sections 90–117 are almost entirely short homilies on the different parts of this passage. Thus (<i>a</i>) the time of the offering is put at the entrance to Canaan, the “wavering reasoning” from which God means us to escape (90); (<i>b</i>) we have then an apologetic discussion of the words “God sware,” showing that such expressions are a concession to the human tendency to anthropomorphism (91–96); (<i>c</i>) by reading an “if” into the words “and shall give thee,” he draws his favourite moral that we can only give what God has given (97); (<i>d</i>) dwelling on the words “thou shalt set apart” or “separate,” he argues that the ideas of God which we offer to Him must be kept apart from lower and profane conceptions of Him (98–101); (<i>e</i>) “the males to the Lord” means that while the male offspring of the soul are the virtues, those of the “beasts” or senses are such as are kept under control of the mind (102–106); (<i>f</i>) we have an illustrative digression on the similar command in Numb. 15:19–20, to make offering from the “mixture,” <i>i.e.</i> our compound being, and a contrast with the offerings of perfection, in which there is no setting apart (107–112); (<i>g</i>) on the last verse of Exod. 13:11–13, “all that openeth the womb of the ass, thou shalt exchange it for a sheep, but if thou dost not exchange it, thou shalt redeem it,” we are told that the ass is labour, the sheep progress, and that labour, at least in the case of things indifferent, is futile, unless it brings progress, and if futile must be “redeemed,” <i>i.e.</i> set free (112–116).",
            "At this point the word “redeemed” seems to lead Philo to a different line of thought. What is meant by the saying that the Levites were a ransom or redemption for the first-born? Levi—‘sanctified Reason,’ Israel’s first-born, is accepted by God before Reuben, Jacob’s first-born, ‘natural ability’ (118–121). But it means also that the wise are the ransom for the fools. This was shown in God’s willingness to spare Sodom for the sake of ten righteous, and we see it in the saving influence of good men in a commonwealth, and so in the commonwealth of the individual virtuous thoughts redeem the evil (121–126). This last explains the saying that the cities of the Levites are “ransomed for ever,” for this ransom of the soul is a perpetual process (127). This again leads on to a discussion why these cities were assigned as a refuge for the homicide. The Levite like the homicide is a fugitive—from natural ties (129). He too has slain—wicked doctrines as in Exod. 32. (130), and he represents the merciful side of God’s legislative power, as the homicide does the punitive, for he slew “whom the Lord delivered into his hand” (131–133). Finally, when the sanctification of the Levite is assigned to the day when God smote Egypt, we are taught that since that smiting is perpetual, the sanctification is also perpetual (134–135).",
            "We return for a moment to Abel and his offering of the fat, but pass at once to a comment on the fact that neither heart nor brain, the seat of the dominant principle, appear in the sacrificial ritual. Only when this mind of ours has been purged of its tendency to lapses will it be admitted as a proper part of the ὁλοκαύτωμα or “whole burnt offering” (136-end).",
            "There are two special points in connexion with the text which require mention.",
            "The first is that we have for this treatise and that of <i>Quis Rer. Div. Her.</i> the valuable help of a papyrus discovered in Upper Egypt in 1889. Not only is this papyrus considerably older than the other MSS. to which it is most akin, but the analysis given by Cohn goes far to justify his opinion that it presents on the whole a better text.",
            "The other is the history of the sections 21–32, which do not appear in this place in Mangey’s edition nor in Yonge’s translation. These sections containing the allegory of the two women had been incorporated in an otherwise spurious treatise, <i>De Mercede Meretricis.</i> In consequence the archetype of the MSS. from which Turnebus made his edition of 1552 omitted them here, and this was followed in subsequent editions. That their proper place is in this treatise is shown not only by their presence in other MSS., but also by the evidence that Ambrose, whose treatise on Cain and Abel draws largely from Philo, evidently had these sections before him."

            [
                "[1] And He added to this that she brought forth Abel his brother (Gen. 4:2). The addition of one thing implies the removal of some other, as in the case of arithmetical quantities or of our successive inward thoughts.",
                "[2] If we must say that Abel was added we must suppose that Cain was taken away. In case these unfamiliar terms may cause perplexity to many, I will attempt to give as clear an account as I can of the underlying philosophical thought. It is a fact that there are two opposite and contending views of life, one which ascribes all things to the mind as our master, whether we are using our reason or our senses, in motion or at rest, the other which follows God, whose handiwork it believes itself to be. The first of these views is figured by Cain who is called Possession, because he thinks he possesses all things, the other by Abel, whose name means “one who refers (all things) to God.”",
                "[3] Now both these views or conceptions lie in the womb of the single soul. But when they are brought to the birth they must needs be separated, for enemies cannot live together for ever. Thus so long as the soul had not brought forth the God-loving principle in Abel, the self-loving principle in Cain made her his dwelling. But when she bore the principle which acknowledges the Cause, she abandoned that which looks to the mind with its fancied wisdom."
            ],
            [
                "[4] This will be shown still more clearly by the oracle which was given to Rebecca or Patience (Gen. 25:21 ff.). She had conceived the two contending natures of good and evil and considered earnestly, as wisdom bade her, the character of both, when she perceived them leaping and as in a skirmish preluding the war that should be between them. And therefore she besought God to show her what had befallen her, and how it might be remedied. He answered her question thus: “two nations are in thy womb.” That was what had befallen her—to bear both good and evil. But again “two peoples shall be separated from thy womb.” This is the remedy, that good and evil be separated and set apart from each other and no longer have the same habitation.",
                "[5] So then when God added the good conviction Abel to the soul, he took away the foolish opinion Cain. So too, when Abraham left this mortal life, “he is added to the people of God” (Gen. 25:8), in that he inherited incorruption and became equal to the angels, for angels—those unbodied and blessed souls—are the host and people of God. In the same way again the Practiser Jacob, we read, is added to something better, when he left the worse (Gen. 49:33).",
                "[6] Once more there is Isaac to whom was granted the higher gift of self-learnt knowledge. He too abandoned all such bodily elements as had been interwoven with the soul, and is added and allotted to another company; but not this time, with the others, to a people, but to a ‘race’ or ‘genus,’ as Moses says (Gen. 35:29). For genus is one, that which is above all, but people is a name for many.",
                "[7] Those who have advanced to perfection as pupils under a teacher have their place among many others; for those who learn by hearing and instruction are no small number, and these he calls a people. But those who have dispensed with the instruction of men and have become apt pupils of God receive the free unlaboured knowledge and are translated into the genus of the imperishable and fully perfect. Theirs is a happier lot than the lot of the people, and in this sacred band Isaac stands confessed as a chorister."
            ],
            [
                "[8] A further thought of the same nature is revealed to us.… There are still others, whom God has advanced even higher, and has trained them to soar above species and genus alike and stationed them beside himself. Such is Moses to whom He says “stand here with Me” (Deut. 5:31). And so when Moses was about to die we do not hear of him “leaving” or “being added” like those others. No room in him for adding or taking away. But through the ‘Word’ of the Supreme Cause he is translated (Deut. 34:5),  even through that Word by which also the whole universe was formed. Thus you may learn that God prizes the Wise Man as the world, for that same Word, by which He made the universe, is that by which He draws the perfect man from things earthly to Himself.",
                "[9] And even when He sent him as a loan to the earthly sphere and suffered him to dwell therein, He gifted him with no ordinary excellence, such as that which kings and rulers have, wherewith to hold sway and sovereignty over the passions of the soul, but He appointed him as god, placing all the bodily region and the mind which rules it in subjection and slavery to him. “I give thee,” He says, “as god to Pharaoh” (Exod. 7:1); but God is not susceptible of addition or diminution, being fully and unchangeably himself.",
                "[10] And therefore we are told that no man knows his grave (Deut. 34:6). For who has powers such that he could perceive the passing of a perfect soul to Him that “IS”? Nay I judge that the soul itself which is passing thus does not know of its change to better things, for at that hour it is filled with the spirit of God. For God does not consult with those whom He blesses as to the gifts He means to bestow. His wont is to extend His loving-kindness unstinted to those who have no thought of them.",
                "Such is the meaning of the words that God added to the mind the birth of the perfect good. The good is holiness and the name of holiness is Abel."
            ],
            [
                "[11] “And Abel became a shepherd of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground” (Gen. 4:2). Why is it that while he showed us Cain as older than Abel, he has now changed the order and mentions the younger first, when he comes to speak of their choice of occupations? For the probability was that the elder proceeded to his husbandry first, and the younger at a later time to his charge of the flock.",
                "[12] But Moses sets no value on probabilities and plausibilities, but follows after truth in its purity. And when he comes alone to God apart from all, he frankly says that he has no gift of speech (by which he means that he has no desire for eloquence or persuasiveness), and this he says has been his condition from a few days ago when God first began to talk with him as His servant (Exod. 4:10).",
                "[13] Those who have fallen into the surge and stormy sea of life must needs float on, not holding firmly to any strong support which knowledge gives, but trailed along by the flotsam of the probable and the plausible. But for the servant of God it is meet to hold fast to truth and spurn the fabulous inventions of eloquence, which are but baseless guesswork.",
                "[14] What then is the special truth which here he brings before us? Surely that in point of time vice is senior to virtue, but that in point of value and honour the reverse is the case. And therefore when the birth of each is brought before us, Cain may have the precedence. When we make a comparison of the occupations of the two, Abel should take the lead.",
                "[15] For when the life of man begins, from the very cradle till the time when the age of maturity brings the great change and quenches the fiery furnace of the passions, folly, incontinence, injustice, fear, cowardice, and all the kindred maladies of soul are his inseparable companions, and each of them is fostered and increased by nurses and tutors and by the fact that the rules and customs which impress and exercise their authority upon him expel piety and set up in its stead that superstition which is the sister of impiety.",
                "[16] But when the prime is past, and the throbbing fever of the passions is abated, as though the storm winds had dropped, there begins in the man a late and hard-won calm. Virtue has lulled to rest the worst enemy of the soul, that commotion whose waves of passion follow each other in swift succession, and in that firm support of virtue he stands secure.",
                "Thus vice will carry off the honour of precedence in time, virtue the precedence in repute and honour and good name. And to this truth we have a faithful witness in the legislator himself.",
                "[17] For he shows us Esau, who is named after his folly, as elder in point of age, but it is to the younger brother named from his discipline and practice of things excellent, even Jacob, that he awards the prize of precedence. Yet Jacob will not judge himself worthy to accept this prize until, as in some contest of the arena, his adversary has surrendered in exhaustion and yielded up the victor’s crown to him who has waged war without parley or quarter against the passions. For Esau ‘sold,’ we read, the ‘birthright to Jacob’ (Gen. 25:33),",
                "[18] in full admission that as the flute and lyre and the other instruments of music belong only to the musician, so all that is supreme in value, and all to which virtue gives its place of honour, belong not to any of the wicked, but to the lover of wisdom only."
            ],
            [
                "[19] Again the same lesson is taught in a law which Moses enacts, a law both excellent and profitable. It runs thus. “If a man have two wives, one loved and the other hated, and each bear a son to him, and the son of her that is hated is the first-born, it shall be that on the day on which he allots his goods to his sons he shall not be able to give the right of the first-born to the son of her whom he loves, and set aside the first-born, the son of her whom he hates, but he shall acknowledge the first-born, the son of her whom he hates, to give him a double portion of all that he has gotten; for he is the beginning of his children, and to him belong the rights of the first-born” (Deut. 21:15–17).",
                "[20] Mark well then, my soul, and understand who is she that is hated, and who is her son, and thou wilt straightway perceive that to this last alone and to none other belong the honours of the elder. For each of us is mated with two wives, who hate and loathe each other, and they fill the house of the soul with their jealous contentions. And one of these we love, because we find her winning and gentle, and we think her our nearest and dearest. Her name is pleasure. The other we hate; we think her rough, ungentle, crabbed and our bitter enemy. Her name is virtue.",
                "[21] So Pleasure comes languishing in the guise of a harlot or courtesan. Her gait has the looseness which her extravagant wantonness and luxury has bred; the lascivious roll of her eyes is a bait to entice the souls of the young; her look speaks of boldness and shamelessness; her neck is held high; she assumes a stature which Nature has not given her; she grins and giggles; her hair is dressed in curious and elaborate plaits; under her eyes are pencil lines; her eyebrows are smothered in paint; she revels perpetually in the warmth of the bath; her flush is artificial; her costly raiment is broidered lavishly with flowers; bracelets and necklaces and every other feminine ornament wrought of gold and jewels hang round her; her breath is laden with fragrant scents; a strumpet of the streets, she takes the market-place for her home; devoid of true beauty, she pursues the false.",
                "[22] In her train come a sample of her closest friends, villainy, recklessness, faithlessness, flattery, imposture, deceit, falsehood, perjury, impiety, injustice, profligacy; and taking her stand in their midst, like the leader of a chorus, she speaks thus to the Mind. “See here,” she says, “I have coffers containing all human blessings—such as belong to the gods are in heaven—and outside these coffers you will find no good thing. These I will open,",
                "[23] if you will dwell with me, and give you unceasing and unstinted use and enjoyment of all that is therein. But first I wish to recount to you the multitude of joys within my store, so that if you assent it may be with willingness and gladness, and if you turn from them it will not be through ignorance that you refuse. With me you will find freedom from the sense of restraint, from the fear of punishment, from the stress of business, from the discipline of labour; you will find colours all and sundry, sweet modulations of melodious sounds, costly kinds of food and drink, abundant varieties of delicious perfumes, amours without ceasing, frolics unregulated, chamberings unrestricted, language unrepressed, deeds uncensored, life without care, sleep soft and sweet, satiety ever unfilled.",
                "[24] If then you are willing to pass your time with me, I will be your cateress and give you from them all what accords with your wishes. I will join you in considering what food and drink would charm your palate, what sight would please your eyes, what sound your ears, what perfume your nostrils. And of all that you desire nothing shall fail, for you shall find fresh sweets ever springing up to replace and more than replace those which are consumed.",
                "[25] For in the treasure-houses I have spoken of are evergreen plants, which bloom and bear fruit in constant succession, so that the fullness of the fresh fruit, each in their season, ever pursues and overtakes those that have already ripened. These plants never once have known the ravages of civil or foreign war, but from the day that earth took them to her bosom, she cherishes them like a kindly nurse. She makes their roots dive deep and fast below like foundations, she extends the growth above the ground till it soars to heaven. She brings forth branches, which imitate and answer to the hands and feet of living creatures. She causes leaves to bloom like hair, at once to shelter and adorn, and then at the last she gives the fruit, the crowning purpose of the whole process.”",
                "[26] When the other heard this, standing as she was, hidden from sight, yet within earshot, she feared lest the Mind should unawares be made captive and enslaved, and carried away by this wealth of gifts and promises. She feared too lest he should yield to the spell of that countenance so well and cunningly dressed to deceive, for by her talismans and witchcrafts the sorceress was pricking him, and working in him the itch of desire. So suddenly coming forward she appeared with all the marks of a free-born citizen, a firm tread, a serene countenance, her person and her modesty alike without false colouring, her moral nature free from guile, her conduct from stain, her will from craft, her speech from falsehood, reflecting faithfully the honesty of her thoughts. Her carriage was unaffected, her movements quiet, her clothing plain, her adornment that of good sense and virtue, which is more precious than gold.",
                "[27] And in her company came piety, holiness, truth, justice, religion, fidelity to oaths and bonds, righteousness, equity, fellow-feeling, self-control, temperance, orderliness, continence, meekness, frugality, contentment, modesty, a quiet temper, courage, nobility of spirit, good judgement, foresight, good sense, attentiveness, desire for amendment, cheerfulness, kindness, gentleness, mildness, humanity, high-mindedness, blessedness, goodness. The daylight will fail me while I recount the names of the specific virtues.",
                "[28] Ranged on each side with her in their midst they formed her body-guard. She assuming her wonted mien thus began.",
                "“I see yonder Pleasure, that lewd dealer in magic and inventor of fables, tricked out as for the stage, importunately seeking parley with you, and as it is my nature to hate evil, I feared lest being off your guard you should be deceived and consent to the worst of ills as though they were the highest good. Therefore, that you may not through sheer ignorance put from you aught that is to your advantage and purchase for yourself unwelcome misfortune, I judged it well to proclaim to you, before it was too late, the full truth of all that attaches to this woman.",
                "[29] Know then that the finery with which she is bedizened is all borrowed. For of such things as make for true beauty she brings nothing—nothing that comes from herself and is indeed her own. But she has habited herself with a false and spurious comeliness, which is mere nets and snares to take you as her prey, and these, if you are wise, you will see in time and thus make her hunting of none effect. The sight of her is sweetness to your eyes, her voice like music ringing in your ears, but to the soul, the most precious of possessions, her nature is to work mischief through these and all other avenues.",
                "Of what she has to give, she set before you in full such things as were bound to be pleasant hearing, but the innumerable others which do not make for ease and comfort, in malice prepense she hid from you, expecting that none would accept them lightly. But these too I will strip bare and set before you, and will not follow Pleasure’s way, to lay before you only what in me is attractive, and slur over and conceal what involves discomfort. Rather all such things as of themselves offer joy and delight I will pass in silence, for I know that they will speak for themselves in the language of facts, but all that spells pain and hardship I will set out in plain terms, without figure of speech, and show them openly, so that the nature of each may be clearly visible, even to those who see but dimly. For what of mine seems most to partake of ill shall be found by those who make trial thereof to be more beautiful and precious than the greatest goods which Pleasure has to give.",
                "[30] But before I begin to speak of me and mine, I will bring to your mind as much as I can of what she left unsaid.",
                "[31] For she told you of her treasured stores, of colours, sounds, scents, flavours, and all varieties, of the faculties born of touch and all forms of sense, and she heightened this sweetness with the seductiveness of her discourse.

                "[126] As then in a city good men are the surest warrant of permanence, so in the commonwealth of the individual composed of soul and body, the strongest force to ensure stability belongs to those aspirations of the reason to wisdom and knowledge, which the lawgiver in his parable calls on grounds already stated “ransom” and “firstborn.”",
                "[127] And thus too he speaks of the cities of the Levites as “ransomed for ever” (Lev. 25:32), because the worshipper of God has reaped eternal freedom, and, while in the continuous flux of the soul change succeeds change, healing also succeeds healing in him. For the saying that the cities may be redeemed not once for all, but for ever, suggests the thought that for the worshipper with perpetual change goes perpetual liberation. The one is incidental to mortal nature, the other stands firm through the grace of the Benefactor, who is that worshipper’s portion and possession."
            ],
            [
                "[128] And here we may turn to another matter, which deserves more than a passing consideration. Why did he throw open the cities of the Levites to the fugitives from vengeance and deem fit that there the holiest should live side by side with men reckoned unholy, namely those who had committed involuntary homicide? The first answer is one that follows from what has been already said. We showed that the good are a ransom for the bad, and therefore it is with good reason that the sinners come to the consecrated to get purification.",
                "Secondly, as they whom the Levites receive are exiles, so too the Levites themselves are virtually exiles.",
                "[129] For as the homicides are expelled from the home of their nativity, so too the Levites have left children, parents, brothers, their nearest and dearest, to win an undying portion in place of that which perishes. The two differ in that the flight of these is not of their own desire, but for an involuntary deed, while those have fled of their own free will in loving quest of the highest. Again, the homicides find their refuge in the Levites, the Levites in Him who is ruler of all. The former in their imperfection think to have for their allotted province the holy word, the latter to have the God to whom they have been consecrated.",
                "[130] And, once more, they who slew involuntarily were granted the right of living in the same cities as the Levites, because these too were privileged as a reward for slaying in a righteous cause. We find that when the soul fell and honoured the god of Egypt, the body, as gold, with an honour which was not its due, the holy thoughts with one accord of their own motion rushed to the defence in arms. These arms were the proofs and arguments which knowledge gives. And they set before them as their captain and leader the high priest and prophet and friend of God, Moses. They waged war to the death for true religion, and held not their hands till they had made an end of all the false doctrines of their enemies (Exod. 32:26–28). And thus it is natural that Levite and homicide should dwell together, for their deeds though not the same are alike."
            ],
            [
                "[131] There is another interpretation current of this matter, though not for vulgar knowledge. It may be entrusted to the hearing of the elders: younger ears may well be sealed against it. It is this. Amongst all the highest powers that attach to God, there is one excelled by none, the legislative. For He Himself is the lawgiver and the fountain of laws, and on Him depend all particular lawgivers. This legislative power is such as to be divided into two parts, one for rewarding those who do well, the other for the punishment of evil-doers.",
                "[132] Of the first of these divisions the Levite is the minister. For he undertakes all the rites that belong to that perfect priesthood, by which mortality is commended to and recognized by God, whether it be through burnt-offering or peace-offering or repentance of sins. But of the second division, whose function is to punish, they who shed blood involuntarily have thereby become the ministers.",
                "[133] To this Moses testifies in the words “he did it not of intention, but God delivered him into his hands” (Exod. 21:13). The slayer’s hands we see were used as instruments, but He who worked invisibly by these was another, even the Invisible One. It is well then that the two should dwell together who are the ministers of the two forms of law-giving, the Levite serving that which bestows reward, the involuntary slayer that which executes vengeance.",
                "[134] When we read “on the day that I smote all the first-born in Egypt, I sanctified to myself all the first-born in Israel” (Numb. 3:13), we must not suppose that at that time only when Egypt was dealt that mighty blow by the destruction of her first-born did the first-born of Israel become holy.",
                "[135] No, the lesson is that in the past, in the present, in the future, that hallowing may be for ever repeated in the soul. When the most dominant elements of blind passion are destroyed then comes the sanctification of the elder and precious offspring of Israel who has the clear vision of God. For the exodus of evil works the entrance of virtue, and the opposite is true also. When good withdraws, the evil that is biding its time takes its place. Hardly has Jacob gone out (Gen. 27:30) when Esau is with our mind, which is open to all that come. He thinks to efface the image of virtue and impress in its stead, if he can, the stamp of vice. Yet he shall not be able to accomplish his purpose. The wise man will ward off the blow before it fall, and Esau shall wake to find himself tripped, supplanted, and his inheritance passed to the other."

                "[136] But Abel offers the firstlings not only from the first-born, but from the fat, showing that the gladness and richness of the soul, all that protects and gives joy, should be set apart for God.",
                "I note that also in the ordering of the sacrifices the worshipper is bidden to bring from the victims these three first, the fat, the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver (Lev. 3:3 ff.). Of these I will speak separately. But nowhere is there a word of the brain or the heart, which we should have supposed would be offered before all, seeing that also in the Lawgiver’s words it is acknowledged that the ruling principle resides in one or other of these.",
                "[137] Yet perhaps it was in true piety and after careful thought that he excluded them from the altar of God, because this ruling principle from moment to moment is subject to many changes either way, to good and bad. And thus it is ever assuming different impressions: sometimes that of a coin pure and approved by the test, sometimes of one that is base and adulterated.",
                "[138] This region then which admits both contending elements, the noble and the shameful, which is familiar with both, and honours both alike, seemed no less unholy than holy to the lawgiver, and therefore he dismissed it from the altar of God. For the shameful is profane, and the profane is surely unholy.",
                "[139] It is this profaneness which has excluded the ruling principle. But if that should undergo purgation, then, when all the parts have been cleansed, there shall be given to the sacrificial fire a whole offering free from stain and pollution. For this is the law of burnt-offerings, that nothing save the excrement and hide which are the tokens of bodily weakness, not of wickedness, should be left to created being, but the rest, which show a soul wholly complete in all its parts, should be given in their entirety as a burnt-offering to God."

            "APPENDIX TO THE SACRIFICES OF ABEL AND CAIN",
            "§§ 5–7. In these sections we have a suggestion of the idea, to which Philo frequently recurs, of the “educational trinity,” stated by Aristotle in the form παιδείᾳ δεῖν τριῶν, φύσεως, διδασκαλίας, ἀσκήσεως. Philo takes as the typical examples of these three, Isaac, Abraham and Jacob, see particularly <i>De Abr.</i> 52 ff., where Isaac is ὁ αὐτομαθοῦς ἐπιστήμης ἀξιωθείς, Abraham represents οἱ μαθήσει καὶ διδασκαλίᾳ προκόψαντες (in <i>De Abr.</i> he is called the σύμβολον διδασκαλικῆς ἀρετῆς), while Jacob as usual is the ἀσκητής.",
            "§ 9. Ex. 7:1. Philo’s treatment of this text here is worth comparing with his other explanations. In <i>Leg. All.</i> i. 40 the mind is the god of the unreasoning element, <i>cf.</i> <i>De Mut. Nom.</i> 19. In <i>De Migr. Abr.</i> 84, the inspired mind is addressed as god, while in <i>Quod Det.</i> 161 the fact that the wise man is called the “god” of the fool is used as an illustration of the difference between reality and “opinion”; for even the wise man cannot be God in reality. To argue, therefore, as he does here, that an attribute which is inconsistent with God must also be inconsistent with Moses is to give the text a meaning which he shrinks from elsewhere.",
            "§ 10. <i>Such is the meaning</i>, etc. The translation assumes that Philo here sums up the general result of the first ten sections which have been a homily on Gen. 4:2. It would be possible, however, to take it in closer connexion with the immediately preceding sentences, “even so it is when God adds,” etc.",
            "§ 12. Ex. 4:10. The LXX. has οὐκ ἱκανός (some MSS. εὔλογός) εἰμι πρὸ τῆς χθές, οὐδὲ πρὸ τῆς τρίτης ἡμέρας, οὐδὲ ἀφʼ οὗ ἤρξω λαλεῖν τῷ θεράποντί σου. Our R.V. has “neither heretofore nor since thou hast spoken,” <i>i.e.</i> neither at the earlier nor the later date, and presumably this was the meaning of the LXX. Philo, however, by ignoring the second οὐδέ takes it to convey the idea that Moses’ contempt of τὸ εὔλογον only begins with his converse with God.",
            "His use of εὔλογος here and in other quotations of the text shows clearly that he actually had that reading.",
            "§ 13. <i>The fabulous inventions</i>, etc. Lit. “the conjectural and insecure myth-making of eloquence (or ‘the eloquent’)”, or, taking εὐλόγων εἰκαστικήν together, “which guesses at probabilities” (ὁ ψευδῶν εἰκαστικός, <i>De Cher.</i> 116, is in favour of this). Philo often uses εὔλογος in the ordinary sense of “reasonably probable,” but at other times, influenced perhaps by Ex. 4:10, in the double sense of (<i>a</i>) fine language, (<i>b</i>) merely probable as opposed to certain. It is impossible in translation to reproduce this double sense. The best modern equivalent would be “rhetorical,” were it not for the risk of confusion with the ancient technical use of “rhetoric” which is so common in Philo. There is a very similar phrasing in <i>Quod Det.</i> 38.",
            "§§ 15–16. The thought of these sections is developed more fully in <i>Quis Rer. Div. Her.</i> 293–299, where four periods are indicated: (1) early childhood; (2) boyhood, the dangers of which are described in words very similar to our passage; (3) the stage in which the healing influences of philosophy are brought to bear upon the passions; (4) when the soul definitely turns away from sin to wisdom. He does not mean here that passion ordinarily ceases with youth, but that, in the case of the converted, conversion does not usually come till youth is past.",
            "§ 17. <i>Named after his folly.</i> This is very far-fetched even for Philo. He interpreted the name of Esau from the Hebrew as (1) a thing made (ποίημα); (2) an oak or tree. In <i>De Cong.</i> 61 he says that the first signifies a fiction (πλάσμα) and the life of folly is of the nature of fiction, and that the second signifies a stubborn nature which takes folly for its counsellor.",
            "§§ 21–33. On the reasons why these sections were omitted in earlier editions of the treatise see Anal. Introd. p. 93. This curious parable, which particularly in the list of nearly 150 vices goes far beyond anything else to be found in Philo, is obviously based on the famous fable of Xenophon, <i>Mem.</i> ii. I, there ascribed to Prodicus, in which Vice and Virtue plead with Hercules when he stands at the crossways of life. There are several definite reminiscences of this. It is also no doubt directly aimed at the doctrines of Epicurus.",
            "§ 21. <i>Her eyebrows are smothered in paint.</i> Greek ladies sometimes painted their eyebrows with a preparation of soot (ἄσβολος) or of antimony (στίμμι), see <i>Dict, of Ant. s.v.</i>“fucus.”",
            "[ἐγκεκαλυμμένη τὰς ὀφρῦς. Philo perhaps wrote ἐγκεκολαμμένη. There is ground for the belief that ὀφρυκολάπτης may have been as familiar to Philo as δρυκολάπτης to Aristophanes (<i>Birds</i> 480, 979) or δρυοκολάπτης to Aristotle. A pair of tweezers is the ordinary implement for “eyebrowshaping” (as it is called in Bond Street), but a razor is sometimes used, at all events in Germany. ‘Carve’ or ‘chisel’ is the <i>secondary</i> meaning of κολάπτω, ‘I peck.’—G. H. W.]",
            "§§ 35–41. This eulogy of πόνος is based on the similar one put into the mouth of Virtue in the Prodicean fable.",
            "§ 37. <i>Severe harmony.</i> An adaptation of the Platonic idea of virtue as a harmony of the soul together with the Stoic view that moral evil is a relaxation of its τόνος (tension, muscular vigour).",
            "<i>Higher forms of art.</i> The Stoics said (<i>e.g.</i> Stob. <i>Eel.</i> ii. 6. 4) that virtue was a τέχνη περὶ ὅλον τὸν βίον and also (<i>ibid.</i>) that the chief virtues were both ἐπιστῆμαι and τέχναι. To judge from <i>De Cong.</i> 142 Philo would hardly have admitted the latter statement.",
            "§ 45. <i>After hearing this.</i> These words show that the literary device of making Virtue discourse has been maintained up to this point, though not very skilfully in the last three sections. To put these O.T. illustrations into the mouth of the woman described in 26 is hardly appropriate.",
            "§ 50. <i>Worldling.</i> Lit. “man of superfluity.” Philo explains the epithet in several places. Jethro is the vanity which deals with the varying customs, unsanctioned by nature, and thus serves to deceive the true life (<i>De Agr.</i> 43); or the seeming wise who perpetually changes according to the groundless opinions of men (<i>De Ebr.</i> 37); or jeers at things equal and necessary to life and glorifies the inequalities of superfluous wealth (<i>De Mut. Nom.</i> 103). “Worldling” seems to the translator to combine these ideas better than any other word.",
            "§ 51. <i>Earlier books.</i> No such passage in the earlier books survives. But in <i>De Agr.</i> 21 ff. a “tiller of the soil” is explained as one who lives to satisfy the wants of the body.",
            "§ 57. <i>Now the covenant</i>, etc. The argument seems to be: The covenant means God’s gifts, God’s gifts are perfect; virtue is perfect; therefore virtue is God’s gift, and not man’s merit.",
            "§ 62. <i>Lesser mysteries.</i> See on <i>De Cher.</i> 49. The Passover represents the first stage of initiation in which the soul is escaping from the Egypt of passion and entering upon its life of practice. This is a lower stage than the “mysteries” described in 59–60. where the soul gains a perception of God.",
            "§ 63. <i>She must grip … sandals.</i> The idea perhaps is that as the soul and body are bound together, the former must keep a tight hold of the latter. It thus corresponds to a foot which fits tightly into the sandal and does not allow it to slip.",
            "§ 68. <i>Self-extension.</i> For the Stoic conception of “tension” (τόνος) including both expansion and condensation see Zeller, <i>Stoics</i> (Eng. trans.), p. 140.",
            "§ 80. <i>It has the vigour.</i> In εὐτόνως we have again an allusion to the favourite Stoic idea of “tension” (see on 37). Here, however, the πάθη are conceived of as having their own τόνος, which is relaxed or weakened by the τόνος of reason. The same idea is no doubt present in the ἐκλύεται of 81.",
            "§ 82. <i>Reason.</i> To preserve the continuity of the argument, this word has been retained in this and the following sections. But clearly Philo drifts away from the faculty of reason to its expression in definite thoughts and words.",
            "§ 120. <i>Natural ability.</i> Reuben is several times taken as the type of εὐφυΐα. But it is strange to find this quality, which is elsewhere associated with φύσις and τὸ αὐτομαθές (Isaac) rather than with ἄσκησις (Jacob), taken here as the source of labour and progress of Jacob, and contrasted with the “inspired contemplation” of Israel.",
            "§ 122. <i>The number sacred to education.</i> Philo seems to associate the “perfect” number ten (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) with education, partly at least because he found in Lev. 27:32 that “every tenth which comes under the rod shall be holy” and he was convinced that the rod was παιδεία (<i>De Cong.</i> 94). Also he seems to have argued that the μέση παιδεία was the minimum which God would accept, and that therefore the “ten” of Gen. 18:32, must refer to that. This view is developed in <i>De Mut.</i> 226 ff.",
            "§ 123. <i>Due to the physician’s neglect.</i> This translation involves giving a very unnatural meaning to παρά with the acc. So far as the use of παρά goes, it would be better to take it “through the indifference (of the relatives) caused by them” (<i>i.e.</i> the physicians whose non-attendance leads the relatives to think that things are going well). But this rendering is very harsh and unnatural. The Papyrus has for παρʼ αὐτούς the unintelligible ανη ουτως which may perhaps conceal some illegible phrase = “apparent,” which the MSS. tried to patch up.",
            "§ 136. <i>The brain or the heart.</i> The Stoics for the most part decided on the heart. For Chrysippus’s arguments see Arnim, <i>Stoic. Vet. Frag.</i> ii. 885 ff.; Zeller, <i>Stoics</i> (Eng. Trans.), p. 214. The opponents could appeal to Plato, who located τὸ λογιστικόν in the head.",
            "<i>Also in the lawgiver’s words.</i> Philo could find plenty of examples of “heart” <i>e.g.</i> Deut. 5:29. For “brain” or “head” he may have relied on Gen. 3:15 LXX.",
            "§ 137. <i>Nothing save the excrement and hide.</i> Philo’s memory has played him false. There is no such exception ordered with regard to the ὁλοκαύτωμα. He is perhaps thinking of the directions about the “sin offering” in Lev. 4:11, where, however, the hide and excrement are only mentioned with the head, legs, etc., to show that the whole animal must be burnt."
