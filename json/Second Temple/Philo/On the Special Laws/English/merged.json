                "THE SPECIAL LAWS (DE SPECIALIBUS LEGIBUS) <br>INTRODUCTION TO <i>DE SPECIALIBUS LEGIBUS</i>, I",
                "This treatise opens with a discussion of circumcision and its hygienic value (1–7), followed by its allegorical interpretation as signifying the excision of voluptuousness and conceit (8–11). The treatment of the First Commandment which follows (12–20) is much on the lines of that in <i>De Dec</i>., as also is that of the Second (21–31) with the addition that it interprets “idols” symbolically also, as representing the vain things, such as wealth, which humanity worships.",
                "In 32–35 the proof of God’s existence, and in 36–50 the value of meditation on the Divine nature, inscrutable though it is, are set forth. While proselytes are to be welcomed, apostates must be put to death without mercy, as in the story of Phinehas (51–57). The prohibition of divination and like practices, for which the prophetic gift is the divinely-assigned substitute, concludes what he has to say about the laws which inculcate a proper conception of God (58–65). The rest of the treatise down to 298 is concerned with regulations of worship.",
                "These begin with the Temple itself; the reasons that there is but one (66–70), a general description of it (71–75), its revenues (76–78); then the priests and Levites, the bodily qualifications required of them (79–81), their dress (82–83), and that of the high priest with the spiritual lessons symbolized by it (84–97), their abstinence from intoxicants while officiating (98–100), rules about their marriage, including some special rules applying only to the high priest (101–111), restrictions as to contact with dead bodies (112–116), and use of the sacrificial meats (117–130).",
                "The revenues of the priests consist partly of tithes, including the ransom of the first-born (131–144), and the portions of the sacrifices allotted to them (145–155), similarly the revenues of the Levites or temple-attendants include the tithes as well as their forty-eight cities (156–161).",
                "The animals allowed for sacrifices are doves, pigeons, sheep, goats, and oxen, all of which must be flawless (162–167). The various offerings follow as prescribed, daily or on the Sabbath (168–176), on the new moons (177–179), on the other feasts (180–189). There is also required on each occasion a he-goat as a sin-offering (190–193). These sacrifices may be classified as (<i>a</i>) whole-burnt-offerings, (<i>b</i>) “preservation” (or “peace”) offerings, (<i>c</i>) sin-offerings (194–197). The first class, whose motive is the honouring of God, is described in detail with full explanation of its symbolism (198–211). So, too, the second, which is a prayer for human betterment, with some reflections on the significance of the parts of the victim (212–223), and on a subdivision of them called “praise-offering” (224–225). The third, the sin-offering, which asks for pardon of the past, varies with the class of person offering it and whether the sin is voluntary or involuntary (226–246). Finally, we have an account of the special case of the Nazirite or “great” vow in which the offering of the Self partakes of the nature of all the three described above (247–254). In all these the offering has been given by laymen, but the priests also must make their oblation of fine flour (255–256).",
                "What is required of the worshipper himself? Purity of soul (257–260), also of the body, but the method used of sprinkling with hyssop dipped in water poured on the ashes of a heifer is really a symbol of soul-purification (261–272). The same is shown by the superiority assigned to the altar of incense as against that on which animals are immolated (273–279), and by the prohibition of bringing the harlot’s hire into the temple (280–284), and the high qualities required in the altar of the worshipper’s soul are shown by the fire maintained on the altar (285–288), and the order that salt should always and honey and leaven never be used in the oblation (289–295). The next point, that the lamp on the sacred candlestick is to be kept alight all night as a thank-offering for the blessings of sleep seems somewhat irrelevant (296–298).",
                "The spiritual lessons given above are all conveyed in the form of symbolical ritual. We pass on to the exhortations to virtue given in Deuteronomy (299–318). This leads him on to <i>ibid</i>. 23:18, which he understands to be directed against “mysteries” as opposed to open preaching of righteousness (319–323), and then to <i>ibid</i>. 1–3, where various classes are excluded from the congregation (324–326).",
                "A long allegory concludes the treatise. The five classes which he finds there symbolized are (<i>a</i>) the deniers of the Platonic Forms or Ideas (327–329), (<i>b</i>) atheists (330), (<i>c</i>) polytheists (331–332), (<i>d</i>) those who honour the human mind (333–336), or (<i>e</i>) human senses (337–343), rather than God, to whom the true disciple of Moses looks (344–345).",

                    "THE SPECIAL LAWS BOOK I <br><small>On The Special Laws Which Fall Under The Two Heads Of The Ten Commandments, One Of Which Is Directed Against The Acknowledgement Of Other Sovereign Gods Save The One, And The Other Against Giving Honours To The Works Of Men’s Hands </small><br>[1] The Ten Words, as they are called, the main heads under which are summarized the Special Laws, have been explained in detail in the preceding treatise. We have now, as the sequence of our dissertation  requires, to examine the particular ordinances. I will begin with that which is an object of ridicule among many people.",
                    "[2] Now the practice which is thus ridiculed, namely the circumcision of the genital organs, is very zealously observed by many other nations, particularly by the Egyptians, a race regarded as pre-eminent for its populousness, its antiquity and its attachment to philosophy. ",
                    "[3] And therefore it would be well for the detractors to desist from childish mockery and to inquire in a wiser and more serious spirit into the causes to which the persistence of this custom is due, instead of dismissing the matter prematurely and impugning the good sense of great nations. Such persons might naturally reflect that all these thousands in every generation undergo the operation and suffer severe pains in mutilating the bodies of themselves and their nearest and dearest, and that there are many circumstances which urge the retention and performance of a custom introduced by the men of old. The principal reasons are four in number.",
                    "[4] One is that it secures exemption from the severe and almost incurable malady of the prepuce called anthrax or carbuncle, so named, I believe, from the slow fire  which it sets up and to which those who retain the foreskin are more susceptible.",
                    "[5] Secondly, it promotes the cleanliness of the whole body as befits the consecrated order, and therefore the Egyptians carry the practice to a further extreme and have the bodies of their priests shaved. For some substances which need to be cleared away collect and secrete themselves both in the hair and the foreskin.",
                    "[6] Thirdly, it assimilates  the circumcised member to the heart. For as both are framed to serve for generation, thought being generated by the spirit force in the heart,  living creatures by the reproductive organ, the earliest men  held that the unseen and superior element to which the concepts of the mind owe their existence should have assimilated to it the visible and apparent, the natural parent of the things perceived by sense.",
                    "[7] The fourth and most vital reason is its adaptation to give fertility of offspring, for we are told that it causes the semen to travel aright without being scattered or dropped into the folds of the foreskin, and therefore the circumcised nations appear to be the most prolific and populous."
                ],
                [
                    "[8] These are the explanations handed down to us from the old-time studies of divinely gifted men who made deep research into the writings of Moses. To these I would add that I consider circumcision to be a symbol of two things most necessary to our well-being.",
                    "[9] One is the excision of pleasures which bewitch the mind. For since among the love-lures of pleasure the palm is held by the mating of man and woman, the legislators thought good to dock the organ which ministers to such intercourse, thus making circumcision the figure of the excision of excessive  and superfluous pleasure, not only of one pleasure but of all the other pleasures signified by one, and that the most imperious.",
                    "[10] The other reason is that a man should know himself and banish from the soul the grievous malady of conceit. For there are some who have prided themselves on their power of fashioning as with a sculptor’s cunning the fairest of creatures, man, and in their braggart pride assumed godship, closing their eyes to the Cause of all that comes into being, though they might find in their familiars a corrective for their delusion.",
                    "[11] For in their midst are many men incapable of begetting and many women barren, whose matings are ineffective and who grow old childless. The evil belief, therefore, needs to be excised from the mind with any others that are not loyal to God.",
                    "So much for these matters.",
                    "[12] We must now turn to the particular laws, taking those first with which it is well to begin, namely those the subject of which is the sole sovereignty of God."
                ],
                [
                    "[13] Some have supposed that the sun and moon and the other stars were gods with absolute powers and ascribed to them the causation of all events. But Moses held that the universe was created and is in a sense the greatest of commonwealths, having magistrates and subjects; for magistrates, all the heavenly bodies, fixed or wandering; for subjects, such beings as exist below the moon, in the air or on the earth.",
                    "[14] The said magistrates, however, in his view have not unconditional powers, but are lieutenants of the one Father of All, and it is by copying the example of His government exercised according to law and justice over all created beings that they acquit themselves aright; but those who do not descry the Charioteer mounted above attribute the causation of all the events in the universe to the team that draw the chariot as though they were sole agents.",
                    "[15] From this ignorance our most holy lawgiver would convert them to knowledge with these words: “Do not when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars and all the ordered host of heaven go astray and worship them.”  Well indeed and aptly does he call the acceptance of the heavenly bodies as gods a going astray or wandering.",
                    "[16] For those who see the sun with its advances and retreats producing the yearly seasons in which the animals and plants and fruits are brought at fixed periods of time from their birth to maturity, and the moon as handmaid and successor to the sun taking over at night the care and supervision of all that he had charge of by day, and the other stars in accordance with their sympathetic affinity to things on earth acting and working in a thousand ways for the preservation of the All, have wandered infinitely far in supposing that they alone are gods.",
                    "[17] But if they had been at pains to walk in that road where there is no straying, they would at once have perceived that just as sense is the servitor of mind, so too all the beings perceived by sense are the ministers of Him who is perceived by the mind. It is enough for them if they gain the second place.",
                    "[18] For it is quite ridiculous to deny that if the mind in us, so exceedingly small and invisible, is yet the ruler of the organs of sense, the mind of the universe, so transcendently great and perfect, must be the King of kings who are seen by Him though He is not seen by them.",
                    "[19] So all the gods which sense descries in Heaven must not be supposed to possess absolute power but to have received the rank of subordinate rulers, naturally liable to correction, though in virtue of their excellence never destined to undergo it.",
                    "[20] Therefore carrying our thoughts beyond all the realm of visible existence let us proceed to give honour to the Immaterial, the Invisible, the Apprehended by the understanding alone, who is not only God of gods, whether perceived by sense or by mind, but also the Maker of all. And if anyone renders the worship due to the Eternal, the Creator, to a created being and one later in time, he must stand recorded as infatuated and guilty of impiety in the highest degree."
                ],
                [
                    "[21] There are some who put gold and silver in the hands of sculptors as though they were competent to fashion gods; and the sculptors taking the crude material and furthermore using mortal form for their model, to crown the absurdity shape gods, as they are supposed to be. And after erecting and establishing temples they have built altars and in their honour hold sacrifices and processions with other religious rites and ceremonies conducted with the most elaborate care, and the vain shew is treated by priests and priestesses with the utmost possible solemnity.",
                    "[22] Such idolaters are warned by the Ruler of All in these words: “Ye shall not make with Me gods of silver and gold,” and the lesson conveyed is little less than a direct command,  “Neither shall ye make gods the work of your hands from any other material if you are prevented from using the best,” for silver and gold hold first place among the sculptor’s materials.",
                    "[23] But apart from the literal prohibition, He seems to me to suggest another thought of great value for the promotion of morality,  and to condemn strongly the money-lovers who procure gold and silver coins from every side and treasure their hoard like a divine image in a sanctuary, believing it to be a source of blessing and happiness of every kind.",
                    "[24] And further, all the needy who are possessed by that grievous malady, the desire for money, though they have no wealth of their own on which they may bestow worship as its due, pay awe-struck homage to that of their neighbours, and come at early dawn to the houses of those who have abundance of it as though they were the grandest temples, there to make their prayers and beg for blessing from the masters as though they were gods.",
                    "[25] To such he says elsewhere “Ye shall not follow idols and ye shall not make molten gods,”  thus teaching them in a figure that it is not fitting to assign divine honours to wealth. For it is the nature of the far-famed materials of wealth, gold and silver, to melt,  and they are followed by the multitude who think that what “blind”  wealth has to give is the sole or the chief source of happiness.",
                    "[26] It is these that he calls “idols,” like to shadows and phantoms, with nothing firm or strong to which they can cling. They are borne along like a restless wind, subject to every kind of change and alteration. And of this we have a clear proof. Sometimes they suddenly light on one who has never owned them ere now: then again, when he thinks that they are firmly grasped, they spring away. And indeed when they are present, the apparition is like idols or images seen through mirrors, deceiving and bewitching the sense and seeming to subsist when they have no abiding substance.",
                    "[27] And why need we prove that human riches or human vanity, which empty-headed thinking paints in such bright colours, are unstable? For we know that some  assert that all other living creatures and plants which are born and perish are in a constant and ceaseless state of flux, though our perception of the effluence is indistinct, because the swiftness of its course always defeats the efforts of the eyesight to observe it with exactness."
                ],
                [
                    "[28] But not only wealth and glory and the like are idols and unsubstantial shadows, but also all those personages, which the myth-makers have invented and spread delusion therewith, building up their false imaginations into a stronghold to menace the truth, and staging as by machinery  new gods, in order that the eternal and really existing God might be consigned to oblivion. And to promote the seductiveness they have fitted the falsehood into melody, metre and rhythm,  thinking to cajole their audience thereby.",
                    "[29] Further, too, they have brought in sculpture and painting to co-operate in the deception, in order that with the colours and shapes and artistic qualities wrought by their fine workmanship they may enthrall the spectators and so beguile the two leading senses, sight and hearing—sight through lifeless shapes of beauty, hearing through the charm of poetry and music—and thus make the soul unsteady and unsettled and seize it for their prey.",
                    "[30] Therefore knowing that vanity had attained high power and was championed by the greater part of the human race, not under compulsion but of their own free will, and fearing lest the devotees of piety, true and incorruptible, might be swept away as by a torrent, he stamped upon their minds as with a seal deep imprints of holiness, so that no fusion or smoothing in the course of years should ever blur their distinctness. This lesson he continually repeats, sometimes saying that God is one and the Framer and Maker of all things, sometimes that He is Lord of created beings, because stability and fixity and lordship are by nature vested in Him alone.",
                    "[31] We are told, too, that “those who cling to the God that IS all live.”  Is not this the thrice-happy and thrice-blessed life, to cling lovingly to the service of the most ancient Cause of all and to reject the thought of serving the menials and the door-keepers rather than the King? This true life stands inscribed on the tables of nature as deathless and agelong, and the writing that records it must endure with the universe to all eternity."
                ],
                [
                    "[32] Doubtless hard to unriddle and hard to apprehend is the Father and Ruler of all, but that is no reason why we should shrink from searching for Him. But in such searching two principal questions arise which demand the consideration of the genuine philosopher. One is whether the Deity exists, a question necessitated by those who practise atheism, the worst form of wickedness, the other is what the Deity is in essence. Now to answer the first question does not need much labour, but the second is not only difficult but perhaps impossible to solve. Still, both must be examined.",
                    "[33] We see then that any piece of work always involves the knowledge of a workman. Who can look upon statutes or painting without thinking at once of a sculptor or painter? Who can see clothes or ships or houses without getting the idea of a weaver and a shipwright and a house-builder? And when one enters a well-ordered city in which the arrangements for civil life are very admirably managed, what else will he suppose but that this city is directed by good rulers?",
                    "[34] So then he who comes to the truly Great City, this world, and beholds hills and plains teeming with animals and plants, the rivers, spring-fed or winter torrents, streaming along, the seas with their expanses, the air with its happily tempered phases, the yearly seasons passing into each other,  and then the sun and moon ruling the day and night, and the other heavenly bodies fixed or planetary and the whole firmament revolving in rhythmic order, must he not naturally or rather necessarily gain the conception of the Maker and Father and Ruler also?",
                    "[35] For none of the works of human art is self-made, and the highest art and knowledge is shewn in this universe, so that surely it has been wrought by one of excellent knowledge and absolute perfection. In this way we have gained the conception of the existence of God."
                ],
                [
                    "[36] As for the divine essence, though in fact it is hard to track and hard to apprehend, it still calls for all the inquiry possible. For nothing is better than to search for the true God, even if the discovery of Him eludes human capacity, since the very wish to learn, if earnestly entertained, produces untold joys and pleasures.",
                    "[37] We have the testimony of those who have not taken a mere sip of philosophy but have feasted more abundantly on its reasonings and conclusions. For with them the reason soars away from earth into the heights, travels through the upper air and accompanies the revolutions of the sun and moon and the whole heaven and in its desire to see all that is there finds its powers of sight blurred, for so pure and vast is the radiance that pours therefrom that the soul’s eye is dizzied by the flashing of the rays.",
                    "[38] Yet it does not therefore faintheartedly give up the task, but with purpose unsubdued presses onwards to such contemplation as is possible, like the athlete who strives for the second prize since he has been disappointed of the first. Now second to the true vision stands conjecture and theorizing and all that can be brought into the category of reasonable probability.",
                    "[39] So then just as, though we do not know and cannot with certainty determine what each of the stars is in the purity of its essence, we eagerly persist in the search because our natural love of learning makes us delight in what seems probable,",
                    "[40] so too, though the clear vision of God as He really is is denied us, we ought not to relinquish the quest. For the very seeking, even without finding, is felicity in itself, just as no one blames the eyes of the body because when unable to see the sun itself they see the emanation of its rays as it reaches the earth, which is but the extremity of the brightness which the beams of the sun give forth."
                ],
                [
                    "[41] It was this which Moses the sacred guide, most dearly beloved of God, had before his eyes when he besought God with the words, “Reveal Thyself to me.”  In these words we may almost hear plainly the inspired cry “This universe has been my teacher, to bring me to the knowledge that Thou art and dost subsist. As Thy son, it has told me of its Father, as Thy work of its contriver. But what Thou art in Thy essence I desire to understand, yet find in no part of the All any to guide me to this knowledge.",
                    "[42] Therefore I pray and beseech Thee to accept the supplication of a suppliant, a lover of God, one whose mind is set to serve Thee alone; for as knowledge of the light does not come by any other source but what itself supplies, so too Thou alone canst tell me of Thyself. Wherefore I crave pardon if, for lack of a teacher, I venture to appeal to Thee in my desire to learn of Thee.” He replies,",
                    "[43] “Thy zeal I approve as praiseworthy, but the request cannot fitly be granted to any that are brought into being by creation. I freely bestow what is in accordance with the recipient; for not all that I can give with ease is within man’s power to take, and therefore to him that is worthy of My grace I extend all the boons which he is capable of receiving.",
                    "[44] But the apprehension of Me is something more than human nature, yea even the whole heaven and universe will be able to contain. Know thyself, then, and do not be led away by impulses and desires beyond thy capacity, nor let yearning for the unattainable uplift and carry thee off thy feet, for of the obtainable nothing shall be denied thee.”",
                    "[45] When Moses heard this, he addressed to Him a second petition and said, “I bow before Thy admonitions, that I never could have received the vision of Thee clearly manifested, but I beseech Thee that I may at least see the glory that surrounds Thee, and by Thy glory I understand the powers that keep guard around Thee, of whom I would fain gain apprehension, for though hitherto that has escaped me, the thought of it creates in me a mighty longing to have knowledge of them.”",
                    "[46] To this He answers, “The powers which thou seekest to know are discerned not by sight but by mind even as I, Whose they are, am discerned by mind and not by sight, and when I say ‘they are discerned by mind’ I speak not of those  which are now actually apprehended by mind but mean that if these other powers could be apprehended it would not be by sense but by mind at its purest.",
                    "[47] But while in their essence they are beyond your apprehension, they nevertheless present to your sight a sort of impress and copy of their active working. You men have for your use seals which when brought into contact with wax or similar material stamp on them any number of impressions while they themselves are not docked in any part thereby but remain as they were. Such you must conceive My powers to be, supplying quality and shape to things which lack either and yet changing or lessening nothing of their eternal nature.",
                    "[48] Some among you call them not inaptly ‘forms’ or ‘ideas,’  since they bring form into everything that is, giving order to the disordered, limit to the unlimited, bounds to the unbounded, shape to the shapeless, and in general changing the worse to something better. Do not,",
                    "[49] then, hope to be ever able to apprehend Me or any of My powers in Our essence. But I readily and with right goodwill will admit you to a share of what is attainable. That means that I bid you come and contemplate the universe and its contents, a spectacle apprehended not by the eye of the body but by the unsleeping eyes of the mind. ",
                    "[50] Only let there be the constant and profound longing for wisdom which fills its scholars and disciples with verities glorious in their exceeding loveliness.” When Moses heard this, he did not cease from his desire but kept the yearning for the invisible aflame in his heart."

                    "[51] All of like sort to him, all who spurn idle fables and embrace truth in its purity, whether they have been such from the first or through conversion to the better side have reached that higher state, obtain His  approval, the former because they were not false to the nobility of their birth, the latter because their judgement led them to make the passage to piety. These last he calls “proselytes,” or newly-joined, because they have joined the new and godly commonwealth. ",
                    "[52] Thus, while giving equal rank to all in-comers with all the privileges which he gives to the native-born, he exhorts the old nobility to honour them not only with marks of respect but with special friendship and with more than ordinary goodwill.  And surely there is good reason for this; they have left, he says, their country, their kinsfolk and their friends for the sake of virtue and religion. Let them not be denied another citizenship or other ties of family and friendship, and let them find places of shelter standing ready for refugees to the camp of piety. For the most effectual love-charm, the chain which binds indissolubly the goodwill which makes us one is to honour the one God.",
                    "[53] Yet he counsels them that they must not, presuming on the equal privilege and equal rank which He grants them because they have denounced the vain imaginings of their fathers and ancestors, deal in idle talk or revile with an unbridled tongue the gods whom others acknowledge,  lest they on their part be moved to utter profane words against Him Who truly IS. For they know not the difference, and since the falsehood has been taught to them as truth from childhood and has grown up with them, they will go astray.",

Thus they are compelled perforce to steal and instead of a single indictment, if indeed it is an offence to feed off the master’s viands, a second is provided, namely, stealing, with the result that the enjoyment of the consecrated meats appears to fall to thieves instead of to those who live a blameless life, which is the height of absurdity.",

We find the laws carrying the principle to a further extent by commanding that first-fruits should be paid not only from possessions of every kind but also from their own souls and bodies. For children are separable parts of their parents, or rather to speak more truly, inseparable parts, joined to them by kinship of blood, by the thoughts and memories of ancestors, invisible presences still alive among their descendants, by the love-ties of the affection which unites them, by the indissoluble bonds of nature. ",

                    "[182] He considered, that is, that the seven days of the feast bore the same relation to the equinox which falls in the seventh month  as the new moon does to the month. Thus he assigned the same sanctity both to the beginning of each month considered singly and to the seven days of the feast, which being of the same number as the new moons represented them collectively.",
                    "[183] In the middle of the spring comes the corn harvest. At this season thank-offerings are brought for the lowlands because they have borne fruit in full and the summer crops are being gathered in. This feast, which is universally observed, is called the feast of first-products, a name which expresses the facts, because the first specimens of the produce, the sample oblations, are then consecrated.",
                    "[184] The sacrifices ordered on this occasion are two calves, one ram and seven lambs, these ten as victims to be entirely consumed by fire, and also two lambs to be eaten by the priests. These last he calls preservation-offerings because mankind has had its food preserved from many vicissitudes of every kind. For that food is commonly subject to destructive forces, sometimes rain-storms, sometimes droughts, or numberless other violent changes in nature, sometimes again from human activities through the invasions of enemies who attempt to lay waste the land of their neighbours.",
                    "[185] Naturally, therefore, the thank-offerings for preservation are brought to Him Who has scattered all the forces which threatened mischief. They are also brought in the form of loaves which the worshippers carry to the altar and after holding them with outstretched arms up to heaven distribute to the priests together with the flesh of the preservation-offering to regale them in a way well worthy of their sacred office.",
                    "[186] When the third special season has come in the seventh month at the autumnal equinox there is held at its outset the sacred-month-day called trumpet day, of which I have spoken above.  On the tenth day is the fast,  which is carefully observed not only by the zealous for piety and holiness but also by those who never act religiously in the rest of their life. For all stand in awe, overcome by the sanctity of the day, and for the moment the worse vie with the better in self-denial and virtue.",
                    "[187] The high dignity of this day has two aspects, one as a festival, the other as a time of purification and escape from sins, for which indemnity is granted by the bounties of the gracious God Who has given to repentance the same honour as to innocence from sin. Treating it as a festival day, he made the sacrifices of the same number as those of the sacred-month-days, namely a calf and a ram and seven lambs, thus blending the one with the seven and putting the completion in a line with the beginning. For to seven belongs the completion of actions, to one their beginning.",
                    "[188] Treating it as a purification, he added three more and bade them bring two kids and a ram, ordering that the last-named should be consumed entirely by fire and that a lot should be cast for the kids. The one on whom the lot fell was to be sacrificed to God, the other was to be sent out into a trackless and desolate wilderness bearing on its back the curses which had lain upon the transgressors who have now been purified by conversion to the better life and through their new obedience have washed away their old disobedience to the law.",
                    "[189] On the fifteenth day of this month at the full moon is held the feast of tabernacles, as it is called, and on this the supply of sacrificial offerings is on a larger scale, for during seven days there are sacrificed seventy calves, fourteen rams and ninety-eight lambs. All these animals are consumed entirely by fire. It is also commanded that the eighth day is to be observed as holy. This last must be treated in detail when the subject of the feasts as a whole comes up for discussion.  The number of offerings brought are the same as on the sacred-month-days.",

But these burnt-offerings are accompanied on each day of a feast by the sacrifice of a kid called the sin-offering offered for the remission of sins, its flesh being put aside to be eaten by the priests. ",
                    "[191] What is the reason for this addition? Is it that a feast is a season of joy, and the true joy in which there is no illusion is wisdom firmly established in the soul, and the wisdom that is stable cannot be acquired without applying medicine to the sin and surgery to the passions? For it would be a strange inconsistency if, while each of the victims consumed in the burnt-offering is only dedicated when found to be free from mischief and blemish, the mind of the worshipper should not be purified in every way and washed clean and fair by the ablutions and lustrations, which the right reason of nature pours into the souls of those who love God through ears that are sound in health and free from corruption.",
                    "[192] But besides this something else may be justly said. These festal occasions of relaxation and cessation from work have often ere now opened up countless avenues to transgressions. For strong drink and gross eating accompanied by wine-bibbing, while they awaken the insatiable lusts of the belly, inflame also the lusts seated below it, and as they stream along and overflow on every side they create a torrent of evils innumerable, because they have the immunity of the feast for their headquarters and refuge from retribution.",
                    "[193] All this the lawgiver observed and therefore did not permit his people to conduct their festivities like other nations, but first he bade them in the very hour of their joy make themselves pure by curbing the appetites for pleasure. Then he summoned them to the sanctuary to take their part in hymns and prayers and sacrifices, that the place and the spectacles there presented and the words there spoken, working through the lordliest of the senses, sight and hearing, may make them enamoured of continence and piety. Last of all by the sin-offering he warned them against continuing in sin, for he who asks for absolution of the sins he has committed is not so lost a wretch as to embark on other new offences at the very time when he asks for remission of the old."

                    "[194] After having discoursed to this extent on these subjects he begins to classify the kinds of sacrifices. He divides them into three principal classes which he calls respectively the whole-burnt-offering, the preservation-offering and the sin-offering. To each of these he adds the adornment of suitable ritual, in which he succeeds admirably in combining decorum with reverence.",
                    "[195] His classification is quite excellent and perfectly fits the facts to which it shews a logical sequence. For if anyone cares to examine closely the motives which led men of the earliest times to resort to sacrifices as a medium of prayer and thanksgiving, he will find that two hold the highest place. One is the rendering of honour to God for the sake of Him only and with no other motive, a thing both necessary and excellent. The other is the signal benefit which the worshipper receives, and this is twofold, on one side directed to obtaining a share in blessings, on the other to release from evils.",
                    "[196] To the God-ward motive which has Him alone in view he assigned the whole-burnt-offering, for, whole and complete in itself as it is, it fits in well with the same qualities in the motive which carries with it no element of mortal self-interest; but where human interests were concerned, since the idea admitted of division, the lawgiver also made a division, and appointed what he called a preservation-offering to correspond to the aspiration for participation in blessings, while he assigned the sin-offering for avoidance of evils.",
                    "[197] Thus very properly there are three offerings for three objects, the whole-burnt-offering having no other in view but God Himself alone Whom it is good to honour, the other two having ourselves in view, the preservation-offering for the safe preserving and bettering of human affairs, the sin-offering for the healing of the trespasses which the soul has committed."

Secondly, the giver must wash his hands and lay them on the head of the victim,",
                    "[199] and after this one priest must take and slay it while another priest holds a vial below and after catching some of the blood goes all round the altar and sprinkles it thereon. The victim after being flayed must be divided into parts complete in themselves, while the belly and feet are washed, and then the whole must be given over to the sacred fire of the altar. Thus the one in it has become many and the many one. ",
                    "[200] These are the contents of the ordinance taken literally. But another meaning also is indicated of the mystical character which symbols convey; words in their plain sense are symbols of things latent and obscure.",
                    "In the first place the victim of the whole-burnt-offering is a male because the male is more complete, more dominant than the female, closer akin to causal activity, for the female is incomplete and in subjection and belongs to the category of the passive rather than the active.",
                    "[201] So too with the two ingredients which constitute our life-principle, the rational and the irrational; the rational which belongs to mind and reason is of the masculine gender, the irrational, the province of sense, is of the feminine. Mind belongs to a genus wholly superior to sense as man is to woman; unblemished and purged, as perfect virtue purges, it is itself the most religious of sacrifices and its whole being is highly pleasing to God.",
                    "[202] In the laying of hands on the head of the animal we find the clearest possible type of blameless actions and of a life saddled with nothing that leads to censure but in harmony with the laws and statutes of nature.",
                    "[203] For the law desires, first, that the mind of the worshipper should be sanctified by exercise in good and profitable thoughts and judgements; secondly, that his life should be a consistent course of the best actions, so that as he lays his hands on the victim, he can boldly and with a pure conscience speak in this wise:",

None have they maimed or wounded, no deed of outrage or violence have they wrought. They have done no service of any other kind at all which might incur arraignment or censure, but have made themselves humble ministers of things excellent and profitable, such as are held in honour in the sight of wisdom and law and wise and law-abiding men.”"

The soul which honours the Existent having the Existent Himself only in view, ought to honour Him not irrationally nor ignorantly, but with knowledge and reason. And when we reason about Him we recognize in Him partition and division into each of the Divine powers and excellences. For God is good, He is the maker and begetter of the universe and His providence is over what He has begotten; He is a saviour and a benefactor, and has the plenitude of all blessedness and all happiness.

Such parts are heaven and sun and moon and the planets and fixed stars; then again earth and the living creatures or plants thereon, then the sea and rivers, whether spring-fed or winter courses, and all they contain: then the air and its phases, for winter and summer, spring and autumn, those seasons which recur annually and are so highly beneficial to our life, are different conditions in the air which changes for the preservation of sublunar things.",

We must now consider in its turn the preservation-offering.  In this case it is a matter of indifference whether the victim is male or female. When it has been slain these three, the fat, the lobe  of the liver and the two kidneys, are set apart for the altar, while the rest serves as a feast to be enjoyed by the person who has offered the sacrifice.",
                    "[213] But why these parts of the inwards are consecrated must be carefully considered, not neglecting the following point. In the course of my reflections I have often pondered deeply on this question also; what could be the reason why the law, when setting apart the lobe of the liver and the kidneys and the fat as a tribute reserved from the animals sacrificed, did not include either the heart or the brains, since the dominant principle resides in one or other of them. ",
                    "[214] And I expect the same question will present itself to not a few of those who read the holy scriptures with their understanding rather than with their eyes. If such persons after examination find a more convincing reason, they will benefit both themselves and me; if not I beg them to consider whether that which has commended itself to my mind will stand the test. It is as follows. The dominant principle is the only part of us which admits and retains folly and injustice and cowardice and the other vices, and the home of this principle is one or other of the two just mentioned,",
                    "[215] namely, the brain and the heart. The holy word, therefore, thought good that the altar of God, by which is given absolution and complete remission of all sins and transgressions, should not be approached by the container in which mind had its lair when it came forth to tread the pathless wilds of injustice and impiety, turning away from the road which leads to virtue and noble conduct. For it would be foolish to have the sacrifices working remembrance instead of oblivion of sin. This seems to me the reason why neither of the parts which hold the pre-eminence, the brain or the heart, is brought to the altar.",
                    "[216] As for the parts which are actually prescribed, appropriate reasons can be given for the choice. The fat is the richest part and acts as a protection to the inwards, serving as a covering and a source of richness to them and benefiting them by the softness of its contact. The kidneys are chosen because of their relation to the testicles and generative organs; situated beside them they give them neighbourly assistance, and co-operate in promoting the easy passage of nature’s seed unimpeded by any of the adjacent parts. For the kidneys themselves are blood-coloured receptacles in which the moist off-scouring of the excrement is secreted, and contiguous to them are the testicles which create the stream of the semen. The lobe is a sample tribute from the most important of the inwards, the liver, by which the food is converted into blood and then being sluiced into the heart, is conveyed through the veins for the conservation of the whole body.",
                    "[217] For the orifice of the stomach being adjacent to the gullet receives the food which has been first bitten off by the teeth and afterwards masticated, and by its action prepares it for the stomach itself. This receives it from the orifice and performs the second office to which it has been appointed by nature, by turning it into juice. And from the stomach there are two pipe-shaped channels extending to the liver and draining the food into the receptacles which lie at intervals therein.",
                    "[218] Now the liver has two properties: it acts both as a sifter and a creator of blood. As a sifter it secretes all the hard and callous stuff into the adjacent bile-vessel, while in its other capacity by means of the heat which it contains it turns the pure liquid which has been strained off into blood full of life-giving powers, then presses this blood into the heart, whence, as we have said, it is sluiced into the veins, and coursing through the whole body becomes its sustenance.",
                    "[219] There is another point to be added to these statements. The liver has been made so as to lie high  and be exceedingly smooth, and in virtue of its smoothness it plays the part of a mirror of the utmost brightness. In consequence when the mind withdrawing from its daytime cares, with the body paralyzed in sleep and the obstruction of every sense removed, begins to turn itself about and concentrate upon the pure observation of its concepts, it looks into the liver as into a mirror where it gains a lucid view of all that mind can perceive and, while its gaze travels round the images to see whether they contain any ugly defect, it eschews all such and selects their opposites, and so, well satisfied  with all the visions presented to it, prophesies future events through the medium of dreams."

One is, that all the meats of the sacred table must be eaten without undue delay, care being taken that they should not deteriorate through lapse of time. It is the nature of stale flesh to decay rapidly, even though seasoned with spices as preservatives.",
                    "[221] Another reason is, that the sacrificial meals should not be hoarded, but be free and open to all who have need, for they are now the property not of him by whom but of Him to Whom the victim has been sacrificed, He the benefactor, the bountiful, Who has made the convivial company of those who carry out the sacrifices partners of the altar whose board they share. And He bids them not think of themselves as the entertainers, for they are the stewards of the good cheer, not the hosts. The Host is He to Whom the material provided for the feast has come to belong, and this must not be stowed away out of sight, and niggardliness, the vice of the slave, preferred to kindliness, the virtue of gentle birth.",
                    "[222] The final reason is, that the preservation-offering is in fact made in behalf of two, namely soul and body, to each of which he assigned one day for feasting on the flesh. For it was meet that an equal space of time should be appointed for those elements of our nature which are capable of being preserved, so that on the first day as we eat we obtain a reminder of the soul’s preservation, on the morrow of the body’s good health.",

We must next examine the third kind of sacrifice which bears the name of sin-offering.  Here we have several divisions, both according to the persons concerned and the kinds of victims. As to persons, the high priest is distinguished from the whole nation and the rulers  as a class from the men of the common people. As to victims, they may be a male calf, a he-goat, a she-goat or ewe-lamb.",
                    "[227] Another distinction made is one which is most essential between voluntary and involuntary sins. For those who have acknowledged their sin are changing their way for the better, and while they reproach themselves for their errors are seeking a blameless life as their new goal.",
                    "[228] The sins, then, of the high priest and those of the whole nation are purged with an animal of the same value; in both cases it is directed that a male calf should be brought. For the sins of the ruler one of less value is ordered, though this too is a male, namely a he-goat; for the sins of the commoner, one still more inferior in kind, a female offering instead of a male, that is, a she-goat.",
                    "[229] For it was proper that in matters of sacrifice the ruler should fare better than the commoner and the nation than the ruler, since the whole should always be superior to the part; also that the high priest should be adjudged the same precedence as the nation in their purification and supplication for forgiveness of wrongdoings from the merciful power of God. But the equality of honour which the high priest enjoys is evidently not so much on his own account as because he is the servant of the nation also, giving thanks in common for all through the holiest of prayers and the purest of sacrifices.",
                    "[230] Deeply and wonderfully impressive is the form of command in this matter. “If the high priest,” it says, “sins involuntarily,” and then adds, “so that the people sin,” words which almost amount to a plain statement from which we may learn that the true high priest who is not falsely so-called is immune from sin, and if ever he slips, it will be something imposed on him not because of what he does himself, but because of some lapse common to the nation. And that lapse is not incurable but admits easily of healing treatment.",
                    "[231] So when the calf has been slaughtered he bids the priest to sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times over against the veil at the inner shrine, beyond the first veil, at the place where the most sacred chattels have been set, and then anoint and smear the four horns of the altar of incense, corresponding to its four sides, and pour the rest of the blood at the foot of the altar in the open air.",

The same rules are laid down by law in the case where the sin lies with the whole nation.",

First, to do honour to the givers of the sacrifice, for the dignity of the guests reflects glory on their entertainers; secondly, to secure them firmly in the belief that the graciousness of God extends to those who feel remorse for their sin. For He would never have called His servitors and ministers to share the hospitality of such a table if full pardon had not been given. Thirdly, because none of the priests is permitted to perform the rites if he is not wholly sound, for the slightest blemish causes him to be thrust from office. ",

For a similar reason the flesh of the sin-offering is consumed in a single day, showing that in sin we should procrastinate and be slow and dilatory in approaching it, but when the achievement of righteousness is our goal, act with speed and promptitude.",

This connecting link between them is called the Great Vow. ",
                    "[248] I must explain why it has acquired this name. When people have paid first-fruits of every part of their property, in wheat, barley, oil, wine and their finest orchard-fruits and also in the first-born males of their livestock, consecrated in the case of the clean species and valued at an adequate compensation in the case of the unclean, as they have no more material resources with which to give a pledge of their piety, they dedicate and consecrate themselves, thus shewing an amazing sanctification and a surpassing devotion to God. And therefore it is fitly called the Great Vow, for his own self is the greatest possession which anyone has, and this self he forgoes and puts himself outside it.",

First, he must not take any strong drink nor anything “which he makes from the grape” nor drink any other intoxicant to the overthrow of his reason, but hold himself to be serving as priest during that time. For indeed such priests as are performing the rites have to quench their thirst with water and are forbidden intoxicants.",
                    "[250] Secondly, he must not shave the hairs of his head, thus giving a clear symbol to the eye that he does not debase the sterling coinage of his vow. Thirdly, he must keep his body pure and undefiled to the extent of abstaining from contact with parents or brothers after death, thus letting his kindly affection and fellow-feeling with the closest and dearest yield to piety that victory which it is both honourable and profitable that it should always win."

The part, therefore, which his zeal prompted him to take was one which can be removed without causing either pain or mutilation. He cut off the hairs of his head, which are to the body like the superfluous branches in the vegetation of a tree,  and gave them to the fire in which the flesh of the preservation-offering is cooked, a fitting proceeding to secure that at least some part of the votary’s self which cannot be lawfully brought to the altar should be merged in and share the nature of sacrifice  by serving as fuel to a holy flame."

It is anxious not that the victims should be without flaw but that those who offer them should not suffer from any corroding passion.",

By most people it is taken from the sea, by others from the rivers, and by others it is drawn in ewers from the wells.  But Moses first provided ashes, the remnants of the sacred fire, obtained in a manner which will be explained shortly. Some of these, he says, are to be taken and thrown into a vessel and afterwards have water poured upon them. Then the priests are to dip branches of hyssop in the mixture and sprinkle with it those who are being purged.",
                    "[263] The reason for this may be aptly stated as follows. Moses would have those who come to serve Him that IS first know themselves and of what substance these selves are made. For how should he who has no knowledge of himself be able to apprehend the power of God which is above all and transcends all?",
                    "[264] Now the substance of which our body consists is earth and water, and of this he reminds us in the rite of purging. For he holds that the most profitable form of purification is just this, that a man should know himself and the nature of the elements of which he is composed, ashes and water, so little worthy of esteem.",
                    "[265] For if he recognizes this, he will straightway turn away from the insidious enemy, self-conceit, and abasing his pride become well-pleasing to God and claim the aid of His gracious power Who hates arrogance.

Out of us you were framed when you came into being and into us you will be resolved again when you have to die. For nothing is so made as to disappear into non-existence.

Then the high priest is to take of the blood and sprinkle it seven times over everything in front of the sanctuary, then burn it wholly to ashes with the skin and flesh and blood and the belly filled with its ordure. When the flame is dying down, he is to cast right into the middle these three things, cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet wool. Then if it is quite extinguished, a clean man is to collect the ashes and deposit them outside the city in a clean place. ",

The mind is cleansed by wisdom and the truths of wisdom’s teaching which guide its steps to the contemplation of the universe and all that is therein, and by the sacred company of the other virtues and by the practice of them shewn in noble and highly praiseworthy actions.",

                    "[274] For one of these was built of stones picked up and left unhewn, and it was set in the open air beside the avenues to the sanctuary and was to be used for blood-offerings.

                    "[276] And therefore the altar of incense receives special honour, not only in the costliness of its material, its construction and its situation, but by taking every day the earlier place in subserving the thanksgiving which men render to God.

When you should hide your face in shame for the sins you have committed, you make an open show of the outward signs of your iniquity and, priding yourself on them, assign a share to God. You bring Him the first-fruits of unholiness and have not reflected that the law does not admit of lawlessness nor sunlight of darkness.

                    "[281] But if the gifts of one who has played the harlot are unholy, surely more unholy still are the gifts of the soul which has committed whoredom, which has thrown itself away into ignominy and the lowest depths of outrageous conduct, into wine-bibbing and gluttony, into the love of money, of reputation, of pleasure, and numberless other forms of passion and soul-sickness and vice. What length of time can purge away the stains of these? None, to my knowledge.",

As to (1), in Deut. 13:6–11, which I take to be more to the point than <i>ibid</i>. 12–17 (enjoining the destruction of an apostate city), which Heinemann cites, the E.V. merely says, “thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.” Philo would indeed find in the LXX, instead of “thou shalt surely kill him,” “thou shalt surely report it” (ἀναγγέλλων ἀναγγελεῖς), which sounds more judicial. But in § 316 this is interpreted to mean that the report is to be sent round to summon the lovers of piety to assist in the execution. In Deut. 17:4–7 a careful inquiry is to be made when such a call is reported, and two or three witnesses are required. Heinemann thinks that Philo is not referring to these passages at all, but is merely extracting a general law from the case of Phinehas. I do not think this can be right, so far as Deut. 13 is concerned, as in § 316 he formally expounds that passage. As for Deut. 17, Philo if faced with it might reply that it does not suggest a formal trial, but that the self-constituted executioners before taking action must assure themselves that the charge is true, and that what he says here does not deny that.",
                "As to (2), Goodenough (pp. 36 ff.) argues that the Acts (<i>e.g</i>. Stephen’s execution and the attempts to stone Paul) shews that the Jews did sometimes inflict capital punishment without direct permission from the Roman government. He also cites 3 Maccabees 7:10–15, which gives an account of a decree of Ptolemy Philopator empowering the Jews in Alexandria to put transgressors against the law to death (E.V. somewhat inaccurately “without warrant or special commission”) (Greek ἄνευ πάσης βασιλικῆς ἐξουσίας ἢ ἐπισκέψεως). All this may be true, but hardly meets the case. Stephen was tried by the Sanhedrin; and the persons for whose execution Paul voted, Acts 26:10, were presumably legally tried. And the Decree, even if historical, need not mean more than that Jewish constituted authorities might condemn independently of the king. But Philo’s words, “Jury, council or any kind of magistrate at all,” must surely include Jewish as well as Roman courts. That he should be seriously encouraging his fellow-Jews in Alexandria, where we know that the Jews had independent jurisdiction, to put apostates to death without any legal trial, seems to me almost impossible. But was it perhaps otherwise in other cities of the Dispersion, where the Jews had no such privileges and knew that the ordinary courts would not take cognizance of apostasy or heresy? Paul’s experiences at Iconium and Lystra possibly lend themselves to such a view. It is to Jews so circumstanced that this section is addressed if it has any practical bearing. Otherwise it must be regarded as a rhetorical way of saying that apostasy is so hateful a crime that to avenge it on the spot is not only pardonable but a duty.",
                "§ 58. The connexion of this section, which comes in so oddly as it stands, would become much clearer, if we might suppose that some words had been lost at the end, as “such practices Moses absolutely forbids.” In this case a new paragraph would begin with ἔνιοι δέ, linked with the preceding by the antithesis of the two bondages, but introducing the new subject of indirectly idolatrous practices. What he means by the “like principle” would then become quite clear. It may be noted that in Lev. 19 the prohibition of printing marks comes in directly after and is followed shortly by denunciation of divination and the like.",
                "§§ 59 ff. Goodenough, pp. 37 f., observes that Philo ignores the passages in Leviticus which prescribe the death-penalty for some kinds of divination and only alludes to Deut. 17 where we have no punishment prescribed but expulsion from the commonwealth and that only indirectly. In this he sees a reflection of the fact that public opinion would not have tolerated stoning such persons, while the Roman government always discouraged and in A.D. 16 expelled them from Italy. But he fails to note that Deut. provided Philo with a far more specific list of the forms of μαντική, on which he enlarges in the following section, and also that it leads on to the promise of the true divination, which is described in § 65.",
                "§ 67. <i>Only one temple</i>. Cohn and Heinemann note that Josephus also gives the same reason for the one temple (<i>Contra Apion</i>. ii. 193, <i>Ant</i>. iv. 200). It does not follow that Josephus is dependent on Philo. The argument of the oneness of God, which Josephus supplements with the oneness of the Hebrew race, was an obvious argument against the attempts to build other temples like that of Leontopolis in the Dispersion.",
                "§§ 71 f. The temple here described is of course Herod’s temple (18 or 19 B.C.), elaborately described by Josephus, <i>Wars</i> v. and <i>Ant</i>. xv. Philo (Mangey ii. 646, an extract from <i>De Providentia</i>) speaks of something which he saw at Ascalon, when he visited that city in the course of a journey to “the temple of his fathers to pray and sacrifice.” The passage does not in the least suggest that this was his only visit to Jerusalem, and he may have gone there often, though I cannot find authority for Edersheim’s statement that he acted as envoy to carry the tributes (see § 78). But whether he went there once or oftener, there is not much sign of personal observation in his description of the building itself, which is very slight compared with Josephus’s. Heinemann (<i>Bildung</i>, p. 16) notes an inaccuracy, viz. that the sanctuary stood in the “very middle,” whereas the part in front was much larger than the part behind. However, that the description should be slight is natural enough. He is expounding the laws of the Pentateuch and these did not provide for the building which would be needed when the nation was settled in Palestine, as he himself observes in <i>Mos</i>. ii. 72, 73, but only for a portable sanctuary. This last with its furniture was fully described in <i>Mos</i>. ii. 74–108, and the omission of any such description here may be due to a feeling that this one part of the law had been definitely suspended.",
                "§ 79. (The consecration of the Levites.) The idea that the Levites received consecration as a reward for slaughtering the idolaters is supposed to have been obtained by Philo from Ex. 32:29, “consecrate yourselves to the Lord,” where the Hebrew phrase is literally “fill your hands,” which the LXX translates literally, but in the indicative, “ye have filled your hands.” In Ex. 28:41 (37) the same Hebrew phrase evidently meaning “consecrate” or “install” <i>is</i> translated in LXX by “thou shalt fill their hands.” See Driver on both passages. In the other eight passages, however, cited by Driver from the Pentateuch, where the same phrase is used in the Hebrew, the LXX has a different verb, τελειόω with or without χεῖρας. It seems to me rather doubtful whether Philo would have seen consecration in the words “ye have filled your hands every man against his son,” etc., and more likely that he found it rather in the words that follow, “that a blessing should be given you.”",
                "§ 80. <i>Redundant … excrescence</i>. The E.V. in Lev. 21:18 has “anything superfluous,” which <i>prima facie</i> would seem to be represented here by κατὰ πλεονασμὸν περιττεύσαντος. But in the LXX the word in the list of defects corresponding to the Hebrew translated as “superfluous” is ὠτότμητος, “with a split ear.” Is this one of the few cases where Philo seems somehow to have known the Hebrew? Heinemann does not notice the point.",
                "§ 83. εὐχάς = <i>votive offerings</i>. If the word is genuine here, this must surely be the sense, as what requires an unhampered rapidity must be a concrete object. The word seems to be used in the LXX in this sense, Deut. 12:6, 17, 26, but I cannot find that it is so used elsewhere by Philo or other authors. Stephanus only quotes it from inscriptions and L. &amp; S. (revised) do not mention it at all. I have left the text as Cohn prints it, pending further knowledge as to what is exactly meant by the? appended to R’s εὐχὰς, or what the Armenian, which is extant for this part, has to say.",
                "§ 90. (φῶς ἡλίου as R, or as Cohn φῶς, ἡλίου ἥλιος?) Cohn’s principal objection to the reading of what he considers the best authority, R, is that ἡλίου ἀνέλαμψεν is an inadmissible hiatus. I do not know how far this argument is valid. Cohn nowhere, so far as I know, formulates his doctrine of hiatus. On p. 197 of the article in <i>Hermes</i>, 1908, he gives examples of corrigenda, and amongst them is γάμον οὕτως for γάμου οὕτως, and γάμων ἁγνήν for γάμου ἅγνης. I do not understand how on these principles his own ἡλίου ἥλιος is to stand. It is no doubt an objection to R’s reading that it does not account for the φῶς ἥλιος or φῶς ἥλιος δʼ of the other MSS. Could not this be met by φῶς ἥλιός τʼ? Mangey has ἥλιος διανέλαμψε, to which Cohn objects that there is no such word, <i>i.e</i>. it is not found in the dictionaries. This is no argument at all, see on <i>Mos</i>. i. 172. Words compounded with διά and ἀνά are fairly common, and the διά would have some point here.",
                "§ 96. ἱερωμένον. Cohn, who printed ἱερώμενον (present of ἱεράομαι), later declared for the MSS. ἱερωμένον (perfect participle of ἱερόω), and this is followed in the translation. But except for the MSS., ἱερώμενον = “acting as priest,” makes equally good sense.",
                "§ 103. <i>Scars and prints</i>. Cohn quotes Seneca, <i>De Ira</i>, i. 16. 7, <i>S. V. F.</i> i. 215 “Nam ut dicit Zenon, in sapientis quoque animo, etiam cum vulnus sanatum est, cicatrix manet. Sentiet itaque suspiciones quasdam et umbras affectuum, ipsis quidem carebit.” This is not quite the same. The figure of the scarred soul was familiar to Philo from <i>Gorgias</i> 524 E.",
                "§ 146. The thought here, though differing in detail, bears in mind <i>Timaeus</i> 69 E, where the mortal soul is placed in the thorax, with its nobler part = θυμός divided by the midriff from the baser = ἐπιθυμία. The θυμός is settled nearer the head, in order that it may be under the control of the reason and join with it in restraining the lusts. The sequel in Plato is definitely quoted in § 149, where see footnote.",
                "§ 172. διʼ ἣν αἰτίαν … Cohn suggests completing this passage thus: διʼ ἣν αἰτίαν τοῦτο προστέτακται αὐτίκα λεκτέον· ἐαρινῇ μὲν κτλ. That is, ἣν stands for τίνα or ἥντινα and introduces an indirect question. This is no doubt common in Greek and may be in Philo, though I have not noticed an example: ii. 251 is not as it stands parallel. On the other hand, it may be pure relative, and introduce something of which the preceding statement is the cause. So above, § 124, and ii. 51.",
                "§ 180. <i>At the beginning of the year</i>. Though the Jewish sacred year began with Nisan in the spring, the civil year continued to begin with Tishri in the autumn. See article “Time” in Hastings’ Biblical Dictionary, and <i>cf</i>. Jos. <i>Ant</i>. i. 81. Heinemann, however, says that Philo knows nothing of this, and is merely following the Macedonian calendar introduced into Egypt. He certainly seems to take it for granted, ii. 153, that the month of the autumnal equinox is the “first in the sun’s revolution.” He must, however, have known that in Ex. 23:16 and elsewhere in the Law, the Feast of Tabernacles is said to occur at the “going out (ἔξοδος) of the year.”",
                "§ 208. <i>Fullness and Want</i>, etc. That with Heracleitus κόρος = ἐκπύρωσις and χρησμοσύνη = διακόσμησις is also stated by Hippolytus (quoted in Zeller, <i>Pres. Phil</i>. ii. p. 46, note 1), καλεῖ δὲ αὐτὸ (<i>sc</i>. τὸ πῦρ) χρησμοσύνην καὶ κόρον. χρησμοσύνη δέ ἐστιν ἡ διακόσμησις κατʼ αὐτόν, ἡ δὲ ἐκπύρωσις κόρος. The thought is perhaps the same in Diog. Laert. ix. 8 (of Heracleitus), “that what tends to γένεσις is called war and strife, what tends to ἐκπύρωσις is agreement and peace.”",
                "§ 242. <i>Thirdly because … thrust from office</i>. The thought lying behind this somewhat illogical sentence may be this. In § 117 he has said that all priests, whether suffering from defects or not, were entitled to eat the sacred meats, and therefore it might be thought that the defective are included in “every male priest”; <i>cf</i>. Lev. 6:29. But in <i>v</i>. 26 we have “the priest that offers it shall eat of it,” and as the defective cannot offer the sacrifice “every male priest” must be taken to mean “such as are qualified by freedom of defect.”",
                "§ 273. (Footnote <i>a</i>.) It must be remembered of course that the temple which Hecataeus mentioned is Zerubbabel’s temple, not Herod’s, which Philo saw. But it may be presumed that in a matter like this the third temple would reproduce the second, about the details of which I understand that little is known.",
                "§ 291. (Wasps bred from horses.) So Plutarch (<i>Cleomenes, ad fin</i>.) mentions the idea that bees are bred from the carcasses of oxen, wasps from horses, beetles from donkeys, and serpents from men.",
                "§ 318. <i>What is pleasing to nature</i>, etc. Philo, I suspect, substituted the Stoic “nature” for “before the Lord thy God,” because he sees in καλόν and ἀρεστόν Stoic phraseology. The Stoic identification of τὸ καλόν with the Good is of course one of their leading doctrines, but ἀρεστόν was also a term applied to τὸ ἀγαθόν and ἀρετή, <i>cf.</i> <i>S. V. F.</i> iii. 208 τὴν δʼ ἀρετὴν πολλοῖς ὀνόμασι προσαγορεύουσι. ἀγαθόν τε γὰρ λέγουσιν αὐτὴν ὅτι ἄγει ἡμᾶς ἐπὶ τὸν ὀρθὸν βίον· καὶ ἀρεστὸν ὅτι δοκιμαστόν ἐστιν ἀνυπόπτως. So also <i>ibid</i>. 88.",
                "§ 321. λόγων ποτίμων. This phrase, which occurs again in ii. 62 and several times in other treatises, is no doubt a reminiscence of <i>Phaedrus</i> (243 D), which has also been clearly, though rather loosely, quoted in the preceding section. In <i>Quod Omn. Prob</i>. 13 the same two passages from the <i>Phaedrus</i> are brought together in the same sentence. The connexion of πότιμοι λόγοι with Plato is brought out most clearly in <i>Leg. All</i>. ii. 32, where, as in Plato, they serve to wash away the briny taste (τὸ ἁλμυρόν).",
                "§ 322. (Footnote 1.) I have adopted Cohn’s reading from R with the alteration of πνευμάτων into αὐρῶν. But the fact that the sense which lies behind R’s nonsensical διανέμοντες αὐτῶν is easily recovered does not, I think, make the reading of A and H unworthy of consideration. Their wording τὰς … ἀέρος εὐκρασίας ἀνέμων τε corresponds with the parallel in <i>De Praem</i>. 41 ἀέρος καὶ πνευμάτων εὐκρασίας, while none of the other parallels corresponds with the form postulated by R.",
                "§§ 327–end. (Errors attacked in these sections.) It seems to me, subject to correction by others more expert in such matters, that Philo in these allegorical interpretations is not alluding to particular schools, but to ways of thinking in general. The theory of Ideas, which he here rather unexpectedly adopts as an essential part of the true creed, was, I think, denied by the Stoics (<i>S. V. F.</i> i. 65), and in the full Platonic sense by Aristotle, but did any school of Philo’s time hold it? The atheistical argument in § 330 that God has been invented to deter men more effectually from evil-doing is developed at length in an iambic poem (to which Mr. Angus has called my attention), attributed to the tyrant Critias, and quoted by Sext. Emp. ix. 54. But this again does not belong to a particular school. The Stoics sometimes identified νοῦς and θεός (see on iii. 1), and Heinemann, (<i>Bildung</i>, p. 176) quotes Sen. <i>Ep</i>. xxxi. 11, where the “animus rectus bonus” is said to be “deus in humano corpore hospitans.” But this surely belongs to a region of thought different from Philo’s description of the practical achievements of mind. The votaries of sense may at first sight suggest the Epicureans, who held that sensations are always true, though our judgements about them are fallible (Zeller, <i>Stoics and Epicureans</i>, Eng. trans. p. 402), but that again is different from Philo’s disquisition on the practical value of the senses. (Heinemann, <i>loc. cit</i>. says that the doctrine of the divinity of αἴσθησις was ascribed to Diogenes, but I have been unable to trace the reference.)",
                "My feeling is that by his fourth and fifth class Philo is simply speaking of the οἴησις which, as he constantly says, leads men to ascribe to themselves what belongs to God, and the division into mind and sense, a very reasonable division since human self-confidence divides itself between the two, is merely made to fit in with Ammon and Moab, which, on philological grounds, he identifies with the two.",
                "§ 333. <i>Fourth and fifth class also</i>. Heinemann suggests with considerable probability that in <i>De Mut</i>. 205 τεθλασμένοι γὰρ τὰ γεννητικὰ τῆς διανοίας ἢ καὶ τελείως ἀποκοπέντες οἱ τὸν ἴδιον νοῦν καὶ τὴν αἴσθησιν ἀποσεμνύνοντες ὡς μόνα τῶν κατʼ ἀνθρώπους αἴτια πραγμάτων, we should read ἀποκοπέντες &lt;ἢ&gt; οἱ, thus bringing into the allegory as here Deut. 23:3, as well as the two preceding verses. The only objection to this is that it leaves the τεθλασμένοι and ἀποκοπέντες without any theological interpretation corresponding to the other classes. Possibly this might be met by inserting &lt;οἱ ἄθεοι ἢ&gt; instead of merely &lt;ἢ&gt;."

                "The Third Commandment (1–38).",
                "While swearing at all is to be deprecated, since the simple word should be enough, to swear by parents or heaven and the like is better than using God’s name (1–5), which many do recklessly (6–8). When swearing is necessary the oath must be performed, if it can be lawfully (9). To call God to witness a falsehood is impious (10–11). Criminal or vindictive oaths, however, should not be performed (12–17). Philo then condemns the arrogant swearing of the extravagant rich and contrasts them with others who though rich live simply (18–23). He discusses vows and particularly the rule by which widows, unlike virgins and wives, cannot cancel a vow (24–25). This is susceptible of an allegorical interpretation (28–31). This is interrupted by 26–27, which returns to the subject of perjury and the penalties for the perjuror and his accomplices. The Pentateuchal regulations for assessing votive offerings are then discussed, when the votary offers (<i>a</i>) himself (32–34), (<i>b</i>) an animal (35–36), (<i>c</i>) a house (37–38).",
                "The Fourth Commandment (39–222).",
                "Philo begins with a sketch of the way in which he proposes to treat the subject (39), followed by some remarks on the sacred number Seven (41), and a list of the ten feasts (41).",
                "The first feast is the feast of every day. This conception, that the ideal life of the true philosopher is one continuous feast, is worked out with much eloquence (42–49). For its scriptural foundation see note on § 45.",
                "The second feast, the Sabbath itself, after some further remarks on the mystical properties of Seven (56–59), is set forth partly as a necessary respite from toil (60), but still more as a time for exercising the soul in contrast to the body (61–64). The prohibition of fire (65), and the extension of the rest to servants (65–68), and to cattle (69–70) are noted. With the Sabbath we may associate other institutions which bear witness to the sanctity of Seven: (<i>a</i>) the cancellation of debts in the seventh year (71–73), and this leads to a denunciation of lending money on interest in general (74–78); (<i>b</i>) liberation of slaves in the same year, which provides an occasion for the lesson of treating slaves humanely (79–85); (<i>c</i>) the same lesson that consideration should be shewn not only by masters to servants, but by rulers to subjects is taught by the “sabbatical year,” which leaves the land fallow in the seventh year (86–103), and also by throwing the fields open encourages generosity to the poor (104–109); (<i>d</i>) the same applies to the fiftieth year, in which estates return to the original owners (110–115), with special regulations about houses (116–121) and debtors and purchased slaves (122–123). This is followed by some general remarks (for the connexion see note on § 124) about the laws of inheritance (124–132), and the right of primogeniture (133–139).",
                "The third feast is the New Moon, and some observations on the place of the moon in the system of things is subjoined (140–144). Fourth is the Passover, a feast in which each layman acts as priest, interpreted by Philo as the “Crossing” from the passions to wisdom (145–149). Fifth is “Unleavened Bread,” and reasons are given for the time at which it occurs and the nature of the food enjoined (150–161). Sixth, the offering of the “Sheaf,” is combined with the two just mentioned. Philo takes this first offering of the harvest in the double aspect of a thank-offering, (<i>a</i>) for the whole world (162–167), and (<i>b</i>) for Israel, acknowledging how much the harvest owes to nature rather than man (168–175).",
                "Seventh is the Feast of Weeks or Pentecost (179–187). Eighth is the opening of the sacred month, or Feast of Trumpets (188–192). Ninth the Fast or Day of Atonement (193–203). Tenth the Feast of Tabernacles (204–214). All these are accompanied by a number of reflections on their origin and significance. Besides these there is the rite of offering the “Basket,” for which no date can be fixed (215–222).",

But the commandment also enjoins respect to age in general (237–238), and also the duty of parents to avoid undue indulgence (239–241).",
                "The treatise concludes with declaring death to be the appropriate punishment for disobedience, to the Fifth (242–248), the Fourth (249–251), the Third (252–254), the Second and First (255–256). The rewards for obedience, except the Fifth, for which a definite reward is mentioned, are to be found in the thought that virtue is its own reward (257–262).",

And we have described such among the particular enactments of the law as may be properly classed under either head. Let us now discuss the three next in the list, again subjoining those of the special ordinances which belong to them.",
                    "[2] The first of the three forbids us to take God’s name in vain: the good man’s word, it means, should be an oath, firm, unswerving, utterly free from falsehood, securely planted on truth. And if indeed occasion should force us to swear, the oath should be by a father and mother, their good health and welfare if they are alive, their memory if they are dead. For parents are copies and likenesses of the divine power, since they have brought the non-existent into existence. In the laws we read of one of our first founders, ",

                    "[4] Those persons too deserve praise whose unwillingness, tardiness and shrinking, if they are ever forced to swear, raise qualms not only in the spectators but even in those who are administering the oath: such people are in the habit of saying “Yes, by ——” or “No, by ——”  and add nothing more, and by thus breaking off suggest  the clear sense of an oath without actually making it.",
                    "[5] But also a person may add to his “Yes” or “No” if he wish, not indeed the highest and most venerable and primal cause, but earth, sun, stars, heaven, the whole universe.  For these are worthy of highest respect, since they have precedence in time over our place in creation, and also will remain for ever untouched by age according to the purpose of Him Who made them."

Instead, with unwashed hands,  as the phrase goes, they make a foul brew of everything, as though Nature’s gift of a tongue justified them in using it without restraint or bridle for unlawful purposes,",
                    "[7] whereas that most excellent of instruments which gives clear expression to voice and words, those great benefactors of human life and creators  of a sense of fellowship, should have been employed to the full by them to ascribe honour and majesty and blessedness to the Cause Which has created all things.",

                    "[131] So while he avoided appointing the parents in undisguised terms as heirs to the property of their dead children, lest by assigning to them an acquisition of so undesirable a kind he should seem to be casting a slur upon their mourning or reminding them of their misfortunes, he adopted another way of conveying the ownership to them, a simple specific for a great mischief.",
                    "[132] What was this way? He declares the father’s brothers to be the heirs of their nephews, a privilege doubtless given to the uncle for the sake of the father, unless anyone is foolish enough to suppose that a person who honours A for the sake of B is deliberately dishonouring B. Is it the case that those who pay court to the acquaintances of their friends are neglecting those friends? Is it not rather the truth that their affectionate care for all that might honour these acquaintances  shews regard for the friends also? On the same principle the law, when it nominates the father’s brother to share in the inheritance because of his relationship to the father, much more nominates the father, not in actual words it is true for reasons already stated, but with a force more recognizable than words, leaving no doubt of the intention of the lawgiver.",
                    "[133] The eldest son does not share equally with his juniors, but is adjudged a double portion,  one reason being that his parents who before were but man and wife, owe to the first-born the fact that they have later become father and mother. Another is that it is their first-born who began to use these names in addressing his parents.  The third reason is the most important, that what was before their birth a house of barren stock has become fruitful for the preservation of the human race, a preservation which is sown in marriage and fructified in the birth of children, starting with the eldest.",
                    "[134]This was the reason, I suppose, that the first-born sons of the enemies who had shewn themselves so merciless in action, were cut off in wholesale massacre in a single night, as the Holy Scriptures tell us, while the first-born of our nation were dedicated by consecration as a thank-offering to God. For it was just that on the enemy should fall the weight of a blow for which no consolation was possible, namely, the destruction of their foremost rank, while God Who wrought the salvation was honoured by the dedication as first-fruits of those who headed the line of children.",
                    "[135] But there are some who after marrying and begetting children unlearn in their later days what they knew of self-restraint and are wrecked on the reef of incontinence. Seized with a mad passion for other women, they maltreat those who hitherto belonged to them and behave to the children they have begotten by them as though they were uncles rather than fathers, copy the unrighteousness shewn by stepmothers to the first family and altogether devote themselves and all they have to the second wives and their children, overcome by the vilest of passions, voluptuousness. Such lusts the law would not have hesitated to bridle if it were possible, and prevent them from frisking and plunging still more.",
                    "[136] But since it is difficult, or rather impossible, to heal the frenzy goaded into savagery, it left the father to his fate as one in the grip of an incurable disease but did not disregard the son of the wife who was wronged through his passion for another, but bade him take the double portion in the distribution between the brothers. ",
                    "[137] There are several reasons for this. In the first place, it punishes the culprit by forcing him to give good treatment to the person to whom he intended to give the reverse and renders him incapable of carrying out his ill-judged judgement. This it effects by conferring benefits on the person who was likely to suffer loss at his hands, and by taking upon itself the parental position which had been abandoned by the natural father in so far as the eldest child was concerned.",
                    "[138] Secondly, it shews mercy and pity for the victims of injustice whom it relieves of a very grievous trouble by enabling them to share in the boon thus bestowed. For naturally we may suppose that the gratification felt by the son at obtaining the double portion is shared by the mother, encouraged as she is by the humanity of the law which refuses to allow her and her family to lie entirely at the mercy of her enemies.",
                    "[139] And there was a third reason. Being gifted with a power to judge justly, it reflected that the father had bestowed his bounties generously on the children of the beloved wife because of his affection for her, but left the children of the hated wife entirely out of consideration owing to his hostility to their mother, so that the former even in his lifetime inherited more than their equal share, and the latter might expect at his death to find themselves robbed of the whole patrimony. And therefore it decreed that the son of the discarded wife should have the eldest son’s privilege of the double share, in order to equalize the partition between both families.  Enough on these matters."

                [
                    "[140] Following the order stated above, we record the third type of feast which we will proceed to explain. This is the New Moon, or beginning of the lunar month,  namely the period between one conjunction and the next, the length of which has been accurately calculated in the astronomical schools. The new moon holds its place among the feasts for many reasons. First, because it is the beginning of the month, and the beginning, both in number and in time, deserves honour. Secondly, because when it arrives, nothing in heaven is left without light, for while at the conjunction, when the moon is lost to sight under the sun, the side which faces earth is darkened, when the new month begins it resumes its natural brightness.",
                    "[141] The third reason is, that the stronger or more powerful element at that time supplies the help which is needed to the smaller and weaker. For it is just then that the sun begins to illumine the moon with the light which we perceive and the moon reveals its own beauty to the eye. And this is surely an obvious lesson inculcating kindness and humanity and bidding men never grudge their own good things, but imitating the blessed and happy beings in heaven banish jealousy from the confines of the soul, producing what they have for all to see, treat it as common property, and give freely to the deserving.",
                    "[142] The fourth reason is, that the moon traverses the zodiac in a shorter fixed period than any other heavenly body. For it accomplishes that revolution in the span of a single month, and therefore the conclusion of its circuit, when the moon ends its course at the starting-point at which it began, is honoured by the law, which declares that day a feast, again to teach us an admirable lesson, that in the conduct of life we should make the ends correspond with the beginnings. And this will be effected if we keep our primitive appetites under the control of reason and do not permit them to rebel and riot like cattle that have no herdsman.",
                    "[143] As for the services that the moon renders to everything on earth, there is no need to dilate upon them. The proofs are perfectly clear. As the moon increases, the rivers and fountains rise, and again diminish as it diminishes. Its phases cause the seas to withdraw and dwindle at the ebbtide, then suddenly rush back with the returning flood, and the air to undergo all manner of changes as the sky becomes clear or cloudy and alters in other ways. The fruits, both of the sown crops and orchard-trees, grow to their maturity according to the revolutions of the moon, which fosters and ripens everything that grows with the dewy and very gentle breezes which it brings.",
                    "[144] But, as I have said, this is not the time to dwell at length on the praises of the moon and record and catalogue the services which it renders to living creatures and everything on earth. It is for these or similar reasons that the New Moon is honoured and obtains its place among the feasts."

                [
                    "[145] After the New Moon comes the fourth feast, called the Crossing-feast,  which the Hebrews in their native tongue call Pascha. In this festival many myriads of victims from noon till eventide  are offered by the whole people, old and young alike, raised for that particular day to the dignity of the priesthood.  For at other times the priests according to the ordinance of the law carry out both the public sacrifices and those offered by private individuals. But on this occasion the whole nation performs the sacred rites and acts as priest with pure hands and complete immunity.",
                    "[146] The reason for this is as follows: the festival is a reminder and thank-offering for that great migration from Egypt which was made by more than two millions  of men and women in obedience to the oracles vouchsafed to them. Now at that time they had left a land brimful of inhumanity which made a practice of expelling strangers, and what was worst of all, assigned divine honours to irrational creatures, not merely domesticated animals, but even wild beasts. So exceedingly joyful were they that in their vast enthusiasm and impatient eagerness, they naturally enough sacrificed without waiting for their priest.  This practice which on that occasion was the result of a spontaneous and instinctive emotion, was sanctioned by the law once in every year to remind them of their duty of thanksgiving. These are the facts as discovered by the study of ancient history.",
                    "[147] But to those who are accustomed to turn literal facts into allegory, the Crossing-festival suggests the purification of the soul. They say that the lover of wisdom is occupied solely in crossing from the body and the passions, each of which overwhelms him like a torrent, unless the rushing current be dammed and held back by the principles of virtue.",
                    "[148] On this day every dwelling-house is invested with the outward semblance and dignity of a temple. The victim is then slaughtered and dressed for the festal meal which befits the occasion. The guests assembled for the banquet have been cleansed by purificatory lustrations, and are there not as in other festive gatherings, to indulge the belly with wine and viands, but to fulfil with prayers and hymns the custom handed down by their fathers.",
                    "[149] The day on which this national festivity occurs may very properly be noted. It is the 14th of the month, a number formed of the sum of two sevens, thus bringing out the fact that seven never fails to appear in anything worthy of honour but everywhere takes the lead in conferring prestige and dignity."
                ],
                [
                    "[150] With the Crossing-feast he combines one in which the food consumed is of a different and unfamiliar kind, namely, unleavened bread, which also gives its name to the feast.  This may be regarded from two points of view, one peculiar to the nation, referring to the migration just mentioned, the other universal, following the lead of nature, and in agreement with the general cosmic order. To show that this affirmation is absolutely true, will require some examination. This month comes seventh in order and number as judged by the cycle of the sun, but in importance it is first, and therefore is described as first in the sacred books. ",
                    "[151] The reason for this I believe to be as follows. In the spring equinox we have a kind of likeness and portraiture of that first epoch in which this world was created. The elements were then separated and placed in harmonious order with reference to themselves and each other. The heaven was adorned with sun and moon and the rhythmic movements and circlings of the other stars, both fixed and planetary. So too the earth was adorned with every manner of plants, and the uplands and lowlands, wherever the soil had depth and goodness, became luxuriant and verdant.",
                    "[152] So every year God reminds us of the creation of the world by setting before our eyes the spring when everything blooms and flowers. And therefore there is good reason for describing it in the laws as the first month because in a sense it is an image of the primal origin reproduced from it like the imprint from an archetypal seal.",
                    "[153] But the month of the autumnal equinox, though first in order as measured by the course of the sun, is not called first in the law, because at that time all the fruits have been gathered in and the trees are shedding their leaves and all the bloom which the spring brought in its prime already scorched by the heat of the summer sun is wilting under the dry currents of air.",
                    "[154] And so to give the name of “first” to a month in which both uplands and lowlands are sterilized and unfruitful seemed to him altogether unsuitable and incongruous. For things which come first and head the list should be associated with all the fairest and most desirable things which are the sources of birth and increase to animals and fruits and plants, not with the processes of destruction and the dark thoughts which it suggests.",
                    "[155] The feast begins at the middle of the month, on the fifteenth day, when the moon is full, a day purposely chosen because then there is no darkness, but everything is continuously lighted up as the sun shines from morning to evening and the moon from evening to morning and while the stars give place to each other no shadow is cast upon their brightness. ",
                    "[156] Again, the feast is held for seven days to mark the precedence and honour which the number holds in the universe, indicating that nothing which tends to cheerfulness and public mirth and thankfulness to God should fail to be accompanied with memories of the sacred seven which He intended to be the source and fountain to men of all good things.",
                    "[157] Two days out of the seven, the first and the last, are declared holy. In this way he gave a natural precedence to the beginning and the end; but he also wished to create a harmony as on a musical instrument between the intermediates and the extremes. Perhaps too he wished to harmonize the feast with a past which adjoins the first day and a future which adjoins the last. These two, the first and the last, have each the other’s properties in addition to their own. The first is the beginning of the feast and the end of the preceding past, the seventh is the end of the feast and the beginning of the coming future. Thus, as I have said before,  the whole life of the man of worth may be regarded as equivalent to a feast held by one who has expelled grief and fear and desire and the other passions and distempers of the soul.",
                    "[158] The bread is unleavened either because our forefathers, when under divine guidance they were starting on their migration, were so intensely hurried that they brought the lumps of dough unleavened,  or else because at that season, namely, the springtime, when the feast is held, the fruit of the corn has not reached its perfection, for the fields are in the ear stage and not yet mature for harvest. It was the imperfection of this fruit which belonged to the future, though it was to reach its perfection very shortly, that he considered might be paralleled by the unleavened food, which is also imperfect, and serves to remind us of the comforting hope that nature, possessing as she does a superabundant wealth of things needful, is already preparing her yearly gifts to the human race.",
                    "[159] Another suggestion made by the interpreters of the holy scriptures is that food, when unleavened, is a gift of nature, when leavened is a work of art. For men in their eagerness to temper the barely necessary with the pleasant, have learned through practice to soften by art what nature has made hard.",
                    "[160] Since, then, the spring-time feast, as I have laid down, is a reminder of the creation of the world, and its earliest inhabitants, children of earth in the first or second generation, must have used the gifts of the universe in their unperverted state before pleasure had got the mastery, he ordained for use on this occasion the food most fully in accordance with the season. He wished every year to rekindle the embers of the serious and ascetic mode of faring, and to employ the leisure of a festal assembly to confer admiration and honour on the old-time life of frugality and economy, and as far as possible to assimilate our present-day life to that of the distant past.",
                    "[161] These statements are especially guaranteed by the exposure of the twelve loaves corresponding in number to the tribes, on the holy table.  They are all unleavened, the clearest possible example of a food free from admixture, in the preparation of which art for the sake of pleasure has no place, but only nature, providing nothing save what is indispensable for its use. So much for this."
                ],
                [
                    "[162] But within the feast there is another feast following directly after the first day. This is called the “Sheaf,”  a name given to it from the ceremony which consists in bringing to the altar a sheaf as a first-fruit, both of the land which has been given to the nation to dwell in and of the whole earth, so that it serves that purpose both to the nation in particular and for the whole human race in general.",
                    "[163] The reason of this is  that the Jewish nation is to the whole inhabited world what the priest is to the State. For the holy office in very truth belongs to the nation because it carries out all the rites of purification and both in body and soul obeys the injunctions of the divine laws, which restrict the pleasures of the belly and the parts below it and the horde … setting reason to guide the irrational senses, and also check and rein in the wild and extravagant impulses of the soul, sometimes through gentler remonstrances and philosophical admonitions, sometimes through severer and more forcible condemnations and the fear of punishment which they hold over it as a deterrent.",
                    "[164] But not only is the legislation in a sense a lesson on the sacred office, not only does a life led in conformity with the laws necessarily confer priesthood or rather high priesthood in the judgement of truth, but there is another point of special importance. There is no bound or limit to the number of deities, male and female, honoured in different cities, the vain inventions of the tribe of poets and of the great multitude of men to whom the quest for truth is a task of difficulty and beyond their powers of research. Yet instead of all peoples having the same gods, we find different nations venerating and honouring different gods. The gods of the foreigner they do not regard as gods at all. They treat their acceptance by the others as a jest and a laughing-stock and denounce the extreme folly of those who honour them and the failure to think soundly shewn thereby.",
                    "[165] But if He exists Whom all Greeks and barbarians unanimously acknowledge,  the supreme Father of gods and men and the Maker of the whole universe, whose nature is invisible and inscrutable not only by the eye, but by the mind, yet is a matter into which every student of astronomical science  and other philosophy desires to make research and leaves nothing untried which would help him to discern it and do it service—then it was the duty of all men to cleave to Him and not introduce new gods staged as by machinery  to receive the same honours.",
                    "[166] When they went wrong in what was the most vital matter of all, it is the literal truth that the error which the rest committed was corrected by the Jewish nation which passed over all created objects because they were created and naturally liable to destruction and chose the service only of the Uncreated and Eternal, first because of its excellence, secondly because it is profitable to dedicate and attach ourselves to the elder rather than to the younger, to the ruler rather than to the subject, to the maker rather than to the thing created.",
                    "[167] And therefore it astonishes me to see that some people venture to accuse of inhumanity the nation which has shewn so profound a sense of fellowship and goodwill to all men everywhere, by using its prayers and festivals and first-fruit offerings as a means of supplication for the human race in general and of making its homage to the truly existent God in the name of those who have evaded the service which it was their duty to give, as well as of itself.",
                    "[168] So much for this feast as a thanksgiving for the whole human race. But the nation in particular also gives thanks for many reasons. First, because they do not continue for ever wandering broadcast over islands and continents and occupying the homelands of others as strangers and vagrants, open to the reproach of waiting to seize the goods of others. Nor have they just borrowed a section of this great country for lack of means to purchase,  but have acquired the land and cities for their own property, a heritage in which they live as long established citizens and therefore offer first-fruits from it as a sacred duty.",
                    "[169] Secondly, the land which has fallen to their lot is not derelict nor indifferent soil, but good land, well fitted for breeding domestic animals and bearing fruits in vast abundance. For in it there is no poverty of soil and even such parts as seem to be stony or stubborn are intersected by soft veins of very great depth, the richness of which adapts them for producing life.",
                    "[170] But besides this it was no uninhabited land which they received, but one which contained a populous nation and great cities filled with stalwart citizens. Yet these cities have been stripped of their inhabitants and the whole nation, except for a small fraction, has disappeared, partly through wars, partly through heaven-sent visitations, a consequence of their strange and monstrous practices of iniquity and all their heinous acts of impiety aimed at the subversion of the statutes of nature. Thus should those who took their place as inhabitants gain instruction from the evil fate of others and learn from their history the lesson that if they emulate deeds of vice  they will suffer the same doom, but if they pay honour to a life of virtue they will possess the heritage appointed to them and be ranked not as settlers but as native-born.",
                    "[171] We have shewn, then, that the Sheaf was an offering both of the nation’s own land and of the whole earth, given in thanks for the fertility and abundance which the nation and the whole human race desired to enjoy. But we must not fail to note that there are many things of great advantage represented by the offering. First, that we remember God, and what thing more perfectly good can we find than this? Secondly, that we make a requital, as is most fully due, to Him Who is the true cause of the good harvest.",
                    "[172] For the results due to the husbandman’s art are few or as good as nothing, furrows drawn, a plant dug or ringed around, a trench deepened, excessive overgrowth lopped, or other similar operations. But what we owe to nature is all indispensable and useful, a soil of great fruitfulness, fields irrigated by fountains or rivers, spring-fed or winter torrents, and watered by seasonable rains, happily tempered states of the air which sends us the breath of its truly life-giving breezes, numberless varieties of crops and plants. For which of these has man for its inventor or parent?",
                    "[173] No, it is nature, their parent, who has not grudged to man a share in the goods which are her very own, but judging him to be the chiefest of mortal animals because he has obtained a portion of reason and good sense, chose him as the worthiest and invited him to share what was hers to give. For all this it is meet and right that the hospitality of God should be praised and revered, God Who provides for His guests the whole earth as a truly hospitable home ever filled not merely with necessaries, but with the means of luxurious living.",
                    "[174] Further, we learn not to neglect benefactors, for he who is grateful to God, Who needs nothing and is His own fullness,  will thus become accustomed to be grateful to men whose needs are numberless.",
                    "[175] The sheaf thus offered is of barley, shewing that the use of the inferior grains is not open to censure. It would be irreverent to give first-fruits of them all, as most of them are made to give pleasure rather than to be used as necessaries, and equally unlawful to enjoy and partake of any form of food for which thanks had not been offered in the proper and rightful manner. And therefore the law ordained  that the first-fruit offerings should be made of barley, a species of grain regarded as holding the second place in value as food. For wheat holds the first place and as the first-fruit of this has greater distinction, the law postponed it to a more suitable season in the future. It does not anticipate matters, but puts it in storage for the time being, so that the various thank-offerings may be adjusted to their appointed dates as they recur."

                [
                    "[176] The festival of the Sheaf, which has all these grounds of precedence,  indicated in the law, is also in fact anticipatory of another greater feast. For it is from it that the fiftieth day is reckoned, by counting seven sevens, which are then crowned with the sacred number by the monad,  which is an incorporeal image of God, Whom it resembles because it also stands alone. This is the primary excellence exhibited by fifty, but there is another which should be mentioned.",
                    "[177] One reason among others which makes its nature so marvellous and admirable is that it is formed by what the mathematicians tell us is the most elemental and venerable of existing things,  namely, the right-angled triangle. In length its sides are 5, 3, 4, of which the sum is twelve, the pattern of the zodiac cycle, the duplication of the highly prolific six, which is the starting-point of perfection since it is the sum of the factors which produce it through multiplication. But we find that the sides when raised to the second power, <i>i.e</i>. 3 × 3 + 4 × 4 + 5 × 5, make 50, so that we must say that 50 is superior to 12 in the same degree as the second power is superior to the first.",
                    "[178] And if the lesser of these is represented by the most excellent of the heavenly spheres, the zodiac, the greater, namely 50, must be the pattern of some quite superior form of existence. But a discussion of this would be out of place at this point. It is quite enough for the present to call attention to the difference, so as to avoid treating a prominent fact as of secondary importance.",
                    "[179] The feast which is held when the number 50 is reached has acquired the title of “first-products.”  On it it is the custom to bring two leavened loaves of wheaten bread for a sample offering of that kind of grain as the best form of food. One explanation of the name, “Feast of First-products,” is that the first produce of the young wheat and the earliest fruit to appear is brought as a sample offering before the year’s harvest comes to be used by men.",
                    "[180] It is no doubt just and a religious duty that those who have received freely a generous supply of sustenance so necessary and wholesome and also palatable in the highest degree should not enjoy or taste it at all until they have brought a sample offering to the Donor, not indeed as a gift, for all things and possessions and gifts are His, but as a token, however small, by which they show a disposition of thankfulness and loyalty to Him Who, while He needs no favours, sends the showers of His favours in never-failing constancy.",
                    "[181] Another reason for the name may be that wheaten grain is pre-eminent as the first and best product, all the other sown crops ranking in the second class in comparison; for as an archon in a city or a pilot in a ship are said to be the first because they regulate the course of the city or the ship, as the case may be, so wheaten grain has received the compound name of “first-product” because it is the best of all the cereals, which it would not be,  unless it were also the food used by the best of living creatures.",
                    "[182] The loaves are leavened in spite of the prohibition  against bringing leaven to the altar, not to produce any contradiction in the ordinances, but to ensure that so to speak there shall be a single kind, both for receiving and giving. By receiving I mean the thanksgiving of the offerers, by giving the immediate return without any delay to the offerers of what they bring, though not for their own use.",
                    "[183] For food that has once been consecrated will be used by those who have the right and authority, and that right belongs to those who act as priests who through the beneficence of the law have the right to partake of any thing brought to the altar which is not consumed by the undying fire—a privilege granted either as a payment for officiating or as a prize for the contests which they endure in the cause of piety, or a sacred allotment in lieu of land, in the apportionment of which they had not received their proper share like the other tribes.",
                    "[184] But leaven is also a symbol for two other things: in one way it stands for food in its most complete and perfect form, such that in our daily usage none is found to be superior or more nourishing, and as wheat-meal is superior to that of the other seed crops, its excellence demands that the offering made in recognition of it should be of the same high quality.",
                    "[185] The other point is more symbolical. Everything that is leavened rises, and joy is the rational elevation or rising of the soul.  And there is nothing that exists which more naturally gives a man joy than the possession in generous abundance of necessaries. Such rightly call forth gladness and thanksgiving in those who by the leavened loaves give outward expression to the invisible sense of well-being in their hearts.",
                    "[186] The offering takes the form of loaves instead of wheaten meal,  because when the wheat has come there is nothing still missing in the way of appetizing food. For we are told that of all the seed crops, wheat is the last to spring up and be ready for harvesting.",
                    "[187] And these thank-offerings of the best kind are two in number for the two kinds of time, the past and the future; for the past, because our days have been spent in abundance, free from the experience of the evils of want and famine; for the future, because we have laid by and prepared resources to meet it, and are full of bright hopes while we dispense and bring out for daily use the gifts of God as they are needed by the rules of good economy. "

It has a twofold significance, partly to the nation in particular, partly to all mankind in general. In the former sense it is a reminder of a mighty and marvellous event which came to pass when the oracles of the law were given from above.",
                    "[189] For then the sound of the trumpet pealed from heaven and reached, we may suppose, the ends of the universe, so that the event might strike terror even into those who were far from the spot and dwelling well nigh at the extremities of the earth, who would come to the natural conclusion that such mighty signs portended mighty consequences. And indeed what could men receive mightier or more profitable than the general laws which came from the mouth of God, not like the particular laws, through an interpreter?",
                    "[190] This is a significance peculiar to the nation. What follows is common to all mankind. The trumpet is the instrument used in war, both to sound the advance against the enemy when the moment comes for engaging battle and also for recalling the troops when they have to separate and return to their respective camps. And there is another war not of human agency when nature is at strife in herself, when her parts make onslaught one on another and her law-abiding sense of equality is vanquished by the greed for inequality.",
                    "[191] Both these wars work destruction on the face of the earth. The enemy cut down the fruit-trees, ravage the country, set fire to the foodstuffs and the ripening ears of corn in the open fields, while the forces of nature use drought, rainstorms, violent moisture-laden winds, scorching sun-rays, intense cold accompanied by snow, with the regular harmonious alternations of the yearly seasons turned into disharmony, a state of things in my opinion due to the impiety which does not gain a gradual hold but comes rushing with the force of a torrent among those whom these things befall.",
                    "[192] And therefore the law instituted this feast figured by that instrument of war the trumpet, which gives it its name, to be as a thank-offering to God the peace-maker and peace-keeper, Who destroys faction both in cities and in the various parts of the universe and creates plenty and fertility and abundance of other good things and leaves the havoc of fruits without a single spark to be rekindled."

                    "[193] The next feast held after the “Trumpets” is the Fast.  Perhaps some of the perversely minded who are not ashamed to censure things excellent will say, What sort of a feast is this in which there are no gatherings to eat and drink, no company of entertainers or entertained, no copious supply of strong drink nor tables sumptuously furnished, nor a generous display of all the accompaniments of a public banquet, nor again the merriment and revelry with frolic and drollery, nor dancing to the sound of flute and harp and timbrels and cymbals, and the other instruments of the debilitated and invertebrate kind of music which through the channel of the ears awaken the unruly lusts?",
                    "[194] For it is in these and through these that men, in their ignorance of what true merriment is, consider that the merriment of a feast is to be found. This the clear-seeing eyes of Moses the ever wise discerned and therefore he called the fast a feast, the greatest of the feasts, in his native tongue a Sabbath of Sabbaths,  or as the Greeks would say, a seven of sevens, a holier than the holy. He gave it this name for many reasons.",
                    "[195] First, because of the self-restraint which it entails; always and everywhere indeed he exhorted them to shew this in all the affairs of life, in controlling the tongue and the belly and the organs below the belly, but on this occasion especially he bids them do honour to it by dedicating thereto a particular day. To one who has learnt to disregard food and drink which are absolutely necessary, are there any among the superfluities of life which he can fail to despise, things which exist to promote not so much preservation and permanence of life as pleasure with all its powers of mischief?",
                    "[196] Secondly, because the holy-day is entirely devoted to prayers and supplications, and men from morn to eve employ their leisure in nothing else but offering petitions of humble entreaty in which they seek earnestly to propitiate God and ask for remission of their sins, voluntary and involuntary, and entertain bright hopes looking not to their own merits but to the gracious nature of Him Who sets pardon before chastisement.",
                    "[197] Thirdly, because of the time at which the celebration of the fast occurs, namely, that when all the annual fruits of the earth have been gathered in. To eat and drink of these without delay would, he held, shew gluttony, but to fast and refrain from taking them as food shews the perfect piety which teaches the mind not to put trust in what stands ready prepared before us as though it were the source of health and life. For often its presence proves injurious and its absence beneficial.",
                    "[198] Those who abstain from food and drink after the ingathering of the fruits cry aloud to us with their souls, and though their voices utter no sound, their language could hardly be plainer. They say, “We have gladly received and are storing the boons of nature, yet we do not ascribe our preservation to any corruptible thing, but to God the Parent and Father and Saviour of the world and all that is therein, Who has the power and the right  to nourish and sustain us by means of these or without these.",
                    "[199] See, for example, how the many thousands of our forefathers as they traversed the trackless and all-barren desert, were for forty years, the life of a generation, nourished by Him as in a land of richest and most fertile soil; how He opened fountains unknown before to give them abundance of drink for their use; how He rained food from heaven, neither more nor less than what sufficed for each day, that they might consume what they needed without hoarding, nor barter for the prospect of soulless stores  their hopes of His goodness, but taking little thought of the bounties received rather reverence and worship the bountiful Giver and honour Him with the hymns and benedictions that are His due.”",
                    "[200] By order of the law the fast is held on the tenth day. Why on the tenth? As has been shewn in our detailed discussion of that number,  it is called by the learned the all-perfect, and embraces all the progressions, arithmetical, harmonic and geometrical, and further the harmonies, the fourth, the fifth, the octave and the double octave, representing respectively the ratios 4:3, 3:2, 2:1 and 4:1, and it also contains the ratio of 9:8, so that it sums up fully and perfectly the leading truths of musical science, and for this reason it has received its name of the all-perfect.",
                    "[201] In ordaining that this privation of food and drink should be based on the full and perfect number 10, he intended to prescribe the best possible form of nourishment for the best part of us. He did not wish anyone to suppose that as their instructor in the mysteries he was advocating starvation, the most intolerable of sufferings, but only a brief stoppage in the influx which passes into the receptacles of the body.",
                    "[202] For this would ensure that the stream from the fountain of reason should flow pure and crystal-clear with smooth course into the soul, because the constantly repeated administrations of food which submerge the body sweep the reason away as well, whereas if they are checked, that same reason stoutly fortified can in pursuit of all that is worth seeing and hearing make its way without stumbling as upon a dry firm causeway.",
                    "[203] Besides, it was meet and right when everything has shewn abundance as they would have it, and they enjoy a full and perfect measure of goodness, that amid this prosperity and lavish supply of boons, they should by abstaining from food and drink remind themselves of what it is to want, and offer prayers and supplications, on the one hand to ask that they may never really experience the lack of necessities, on the other to express their thankfulness because in such wealth of blessings they remember the ills they have been spared. Enough on this matter."

The first is, that we should honour equality and hate inequality, for the former is the source and fountain of justice, the latter of injustice. The former is akin to open sunlight, the latter to darkness. The second moral is, that after all the fruits are made perfect, it is our duty to thank God Who brought them to perfection and is the source of all good things.",
                    "[205] For autumn, or after-fruitage, is, as also the name clearly implies, the season after the ripe fruit has been gathered in, when the sown crops and the fruit-trees have paid their annual toll and bounden tribute, and the land has richly provided all that it yields for the sustenance of the various kinds of animals without number, both tame and wild, sustenance not only to be enjoyed on the spot and for the moment, but also in the future, through the foresight of nature, the friend of all that lives.",
                    "[206] Further, the people are commanded, during the time of the feast, to dwell in tents.  The reason of this may be that the labour of the husbandmen no longer requires that they should live in the open air, as nothing is now left unprotected but all the fruits are stored in silos or similar places to escape the damage which often ensues through the blazing sunshine or storms of rain.",
                    "[207] For when the crops which feed us are standing in the open field, you can only watch and guard the food so necessary to you, by coming out and not shutting yourself up like a woman who never stirs outside her quarters. And if while you remain in the open air you encounter extreme cold or heat, you have the thick growth of the trees waiting to shade you, and sheltered under them you can easily escape injury from either source. But when all the fruits are being gathered in, come in yourself also to seek a more weatherproof mode of life and hope for rest in place of the toils which you endured when labouring on the land.",
                    "Another reason may be, that it should remind us of the long journeyings of our forefathers in the depths of the desert, when at every halting-place they spent many a year in tents.",
                    "[208] And indeed it is well in wealth to remember your poverty, in distinction your insignificance, in high offices your position as a commoner, in peace your dangers in war, on land the storms on sea, in cities the life of loneliness. For there is no pleasure greater than in high prosperity to call to mind old misfortunes.",
                    "[209] But besides giving pleasure, it is a considerable help in the practice of virtue. For people who having had both good and ill before their eyes have rejected the ill and are enjoying the good, necessarily fall into a grateful frame of mind and are urged to piety by the fear of a change to the reverse, and also therefore in thankfulness for their present blessings they honour God with songs and words of praise and beseech Him and propitiate Him with supplications that they may never repeat the experience of such evils.",
                    "[210] Again, the beginning of this feast comes on the fifteenth day of the month for the same reason as was given when we were speaking  of the season of spring,  namely that the glorious light which nature gives should fill the universe not only by day but also by night, because on that day the sun and moon rise in succession to each other with no interval between their shining, which is not divided by any borderland of darkness.",

For it is the last in the year and forms its conclusion.",
                    "[212] Perhaps also the number eight, the first cubic number, was assigned to the feast for the following reason: it is the beginning of the higher category of solids, marking where we pass from the unsubstantial and bring to its conclusion the category of the conceptual which rises to the solid in the scale of ascending powers. ",
                    "[213] And indeed the autumn festival, being as I have said a sort of complement  and conclusion of all the feasts in the year, seems to have more stability and fixity, because the people have now received their returns from the land and are no longer perplexed and terrified by doubts as to its fertility or barrenness. For the anxious thoughts of the husbandman are never settled till the crops are gathered in, so numberless are the men and animals from whom they are liable to suffer harm.",
                    "[214] All this long exposition is due to my regard for the sacred seventh day, and my wish to shew that all the yearly feasts prove to be as it were the children of that number which stands as a mother … scenes of folly and joy … and because the festal assemblies and the cheerful life which they afford bring delights that are free from all anxiety and dejection, and spread exhilaration both in the body and in the soul, in the body by the comfortable way of living, in the soul by the study of philosophy."

For it does not affect the nation as a united whole like each of the others, nor do we find any victim being brought or led to the altar and then sacrificed and given over to be consumed by the sacred and unquenchable fire, nor is there any specified number of days during which the feast is to last."

Meanwhile he recites this beautiful and admirable canticle, or if he does not remember it, he listens with all attention while the priest repeats it.",

Their descendants suffered wrongs without number from the inhabitants, and when no further assistance from men appeared forthcoming, became suppliants of God and sought refuge in His help.",

They have done the same for the soul by means of letters  and arithmetic and geometry and music and philosophy as a whole which lifts on high the mind lodged within the mortal body and escorts it to the very heaven and shews it the blessed and happy beings that dwell therein, and creates in it an eager longing for the unswerving ever-harmonious order which they never forsake because they obey their captain and marshal.",

For in the first place, persons subject to instruction and admonition are in fact wanting in sense, and want of sense is only cured by fear. Secondly, it would not be suitable to include in the enactments of a lawgiver an instruction on the duty of filial affection, for nature has implanted this as an imperative instinct from the very cradle in the souls of those who are thus united by kinship. ",

It would surely be ridiculous to introduce such practices and give to the indispensable accompaniments the punishments or honours which should be given to the responsible persons.

The ruler put him in custody, but when the divine pronouncement had been given out that he should be stoned, he surrendered him to those who had first seen him  to be done to death. For the prohibition against lighting a fire on the seventh day, the reason for which I have stated earlier,  applies equally, I presume, to collecting the means for kindling fire."

F</i>. iii. 349–366, there is no other which lays down the principle so explicitly as this. The Stoic mind concentrates itself on the thought that only the wise are truly free and only the foolish or wicked truly slaves, and does not concern itself with the actual institution of slavery. That the rights of humanity do not extend to the unreasoning animals appears in Cic. <i>De Fin</i>. iii. 67 (quoting Chrysippus) “cetera nata esse hominum causa et deorum … ut bestiis homines uti ad utilitatem suam possint sine iniuria.”",

The tribe-names were more fluid, thus we know that Claudius sanctioned a proposal to name a tribe in his honour,” Bell, <i>Camb. Mod. Hist</i>. x. p. 295. The evidence for this statement (from Papyri?) is not given, nor is it stated whether it applies equally to the πολίτευμα of the Jews.

                "§ 125. ἡ προεστῶσα ἀρχὴ κτλ. In making this statement, and indeed in the whole section, Philo has no biblical authority and is simply giving what he considers to be just, based apparently on Attic (or Alexandrian?) law. In Attic law the archon (who seems to be alluded to in ἡ προεστῶσα ἀρχή) had the general duty of caring for orphans and heiresses. See Lipsius, <i>Att. Recht</i>. p. 58, though this seems to mean only the obligation to see that the legitimate ἐπίτροποι performed their duty (<i>ibid</i>. p. 525).

It seems to me that Philo could reasonably find an acknowledgement of the claims of primogeniture in v. 17, “for he is the beginning of his children (LXX) and to him belong the rights of the first-born (πρωτοτοκεῖα).” That is to say, what the law forbids in this passage is that the repudiation of the mother, who in Philo’s view is not only hated but discarded (ἀπηλλαγμένη § 139), should be allowed to cancel the acknowledged rights of her son.",
                "There is more to be said for Heinemann’s contention that the arguments in §§ 132–139 imply that what was stated as a general law in § 133 only obtained in the particular case here discussed. The third reason in particular (§ 139) might be taken to mean that the duplication of the portion of the first-born was a compensation for the wrongs he had already suffered. But this is not necessarily so. Philo may mean, as indeed he implies in the last sentence, that the law wishes to protect the just rights of both families and shews its intention by asserting the special right of the first-born.",
                "§ 145. <i>The Crossing-feast</i>. I have not found in any authority which I have seen any light thrown on Philo’s departure from the ordinary explanation of Passover. Josephus, <i>Ant</i>. ii. 313 explains πάσχα as meaning ὑπερβασία (so also later Aquila; see Driver on Ex. xii. 13). It must be remembered that the point is disguised in the LXX, which translates the noun <i>pésah</i> in 12:21 and 27 by πάσχα, but the verb <i>pâsah</i> in <i>vv</i>. 13 and 27 by σκεπάω and ἐσκέπασε, in <i>v</i>. 23 by παρελεύσεται. That Philo was not alone in his opinion is shewn by his statement that others allegorized in the same way, for such an allegory could only be founded on the “crossing” interpretation. That he believed διάβασις to be the correct translation appears in <i>De Mig</i>. 25 τὸ πάσχα, τὸ δέ ἐστιν ἑρμηνευθὲν διάβασις.",

See Ex. 12:6, Lev. 23:5, Num. 9:3, where the R.V. has “at even,” (margin) Hebrew “between the two evenings.” The LXX translates this in Ex. and Num. by πρὸς ἑσπέραν, but in Leviticus by ἀνάμεσον τῶν ἑσπερινῶν. “For this the traditional interpretation adopted by the Pharisees and Talmudists was that the ‘first’ evening was when the heat of the sun begins to decrease, about 3 P.M., and that the second evening began with sunset” (Driver on Ex. xii. 6), Philo’s interpretation is in accordance with another opinion quoted by Driver, “that the sacrifice if offered before noon was not valid.”",

The Hebrew “on the morrow after the Sabbath,” translated by the LXX in Lev. 23:11 by ἐπαύριον τῆς πρώτης though in <i>v</i>. 15 by ἐπαύριον τῶν σαββάτων, is said to have been diversely interpreted by the Pharisees and Sadducees (see Thackeray on Jos. <i>Ant</i>. iii. 250). The Pharisees, with whom Josephus as well as Philo agrees, understood it to mean the second day of Unleavened Bread. The Sadducees held it to be on the day after the Sabbath, which necessarily occurred at some time in the festal week.",

Nicetas ἀπὸ γὰρ ἐκείνης τῆς ἡμέρας πεντηκοστὴ ἀριθμεῖται ἑπτὰ ἑβδομάδες ἱερὸν ἀριθμὸν ἐπισφραγιζομένης μονάδος. Nicetas’s text is followed by Mangey with the correction of ἑβδομάδες to -δων. Nicetas’s ἀπὸ is clearly right (see Lev. 23:15, for reckoning Pentecost from the Sheaf) and the question between his τῆς ἡμέρας … ἀριθμεῖται … and M’s ἡμέρα … καταριθμεῖται is unimportant, but his ἑβδομάδες is impossible; Cohn’s correction to ἑβδομάσι agrees, as he says, with the parallel in <i>De Dec</i>. 160, whereas Mangey’s ἑβδομάδων will make the sacred number 49 instead of 50. Cohn’s correction of ἐφʼ αἷς to ἀφέσεως seems to me much more doubtful. In <i>De Cong</i>. 109 which he cites, and a similar passage in <i>De Mut</i>. 228, an allegory is founded on the connexion of “release” with the Jubile of the fiftieth year. Here we are talking of a different feast which, except for the number 50, has no connexion with the Jubile, and there is no further allusion to the idea of release. The corruption of ἑβδόμη ἑβδομὰς ἐφʼ αἷς in M may have arisen (1) by an assimilation of ἑβδομάδες to the singular verb καταριθμεῖται, (2) by a variation of construction between a relative clause and a genitive absolute.",

Each of the “good emotional states” (εὐπάθειαι) is distinguished from the corresponding πάθος by being εὔλογος. Thus εὐλάβεια (“cautiousness”) is opposed to φόβος as being εὔλογος ἔκκλισις, Diog. Laert. vii. 116.",

I have not found the compound παραύξησις (-άνω) in Plato or Nicomachus meaning “to raise to a higher power.” But the uncompounded verb or noun is common in this sense. So in <i>Rep</i>. 528 B the square is the δευτέρα αὔξη and the cube the τρίτη αὔξησις. In 587 D κατὰ δύναμιν καὶ τρίτην αὔξην seems to mean “by squaring and cubing.” In Nicomachus xi. 15, 9 being thrice 3 by another 3 αὔξεται ἐπʼ ἀλλὸ διάτημα and becomes 27.",

Translate “impressing them on the minds of the children both in the earlier and in the riper stage of youth.” This will make good sense, giving <i>three</i> stages of parental instruction—early childhood, boyhood, and later adolescence. But I lack authority for the antithesis implied between νεάζειν and ἀκμάζειν, and also while λογισμός = “reasoning faculty” or “mind” is quite common in Philo, I have not found it in the plural.",
                "Another difficulty felt by Cohn, that οἱ μὲν just above has no following δὲ, which leads him to suggest that the end of the sentence has been lost, does not seem to be weighty. Philo begins no doubt with thinking of the parents as μέν and the children as δέ, but that he should forget to express the latter formally does not seem unlike him.",
                "§ 232. (The disobedient son.) In Deut. 21 the incorrigible son is brought before the “elders,” after which (LXX) he is denounced to the “men of the city,” who thereupon stone him. Nothing is said of any right of either the “elders” or the “men of the city” to examine the accusation, but the account savours more of a judicial proceeding than Philo’s words suggest. And Heinemann (<i>ad loc</i>. and <i>Bildung</i>, pp. 251) and Goodenough, p. 69 ff., may be right in tracing here the influence of the Roman <i>patria potestas</i>, as also in the doctrine of parental δεσποτεία in the next sentence.",
                "§ 239. <i>Secondly, it would not he suitable … by kinship</i>. Heinemann aptly quotes Seneca, <i>De Beneficiis</i>, iv. 17 “quomodo nulla lex amare parentes … iubet (supervacuum est enim, in quod imus, impelli).”",
                "§ 244. (Penalty for striking a parent.) Heinemann quotes Seneca, <i>Controv</i>. ix. 4 “qui patrem pulsaverit manus ei praecidantur,” which he calls a Roman law and also declares it to come from the Twelve Tables. Goodenough, accepting the first part of this, bases on it an argument that the εὐπάρυφοι of § 244 are definitely Roman officials. Such a law is certainly not found among any of the fragments of the Twelve Tables known to us, but there is no reason to think that it is a Roman law at all. Seneca’s words are no evidence. The laws which form the basis of the several <i>controversiae</i> need not have and do not claim to have any foundation in fact. In this particular case the theme is as follows: The law is supposed to be as stated above. A “tyrant” has commanded two sons to strike their father. One commits suicide rather than do so; the other obeys the command. When the tyrant has fallen or in one version has been killed by the same son, the son is charged under this law and arguments are adduced by the debaters for and against exacting the penalty. The same law with practically the same theme is noted by a scholiast as used by the Greek rhetor Syrianus (Walz, <i>Rhet. Graeci</i>, iv. 467), and, with different themes attached, in the Declamations ascribed to Quintilian 358, 362, 372. Another of Seneca’s <i>Controv</i>. (viii. 2) starts with a law that amputation of the hands is the penalty for sacrilege. Whether these imaginary laws prescribing the mutilation of the offending member (<i>cf</i>. Deut. 25:11, 12, and iii. 175, below) are based on some old tradition, or are the product of the inventiveness of the rhetoricians, it is impossible to say. The only code known to us which assigns this punishment for striking a father is the Babylonian code of Hammurabi (about 2000 B.C.), and this is hardly likely to have influenced either the rhetor or Philo. The common assumption in the schools that such legislation existed or had existed somewhere would be enough to make him embark without further inquiry on a demonstration of its injustice.",
                "§ 259. <i>Each of the other virtues is its own reward</i>. The sentiment is of course implicit in the common Stoic aphorism that virtue is αὐτὴ διʼ αὑτὴν αἱρετός and αὐταρκὴς πρὸς εὐδαιμονίαν. The most exact parallel quoted is <i>S. V. F.</i> iii. 45, from Servius, “Stoici dicunt virtutem esse pro praemio si nulla sint praemia.”"

                "This treatise opens with an impassioned lamentation over the public business and troubles, which have debarred Philo in the past from his beloved studies, and an expression of his thankfulness that he now has some respite (1–5).",
                "The Sixth (LXX) Commandment. We begin with some general thoughts on the need of continence even in marriage, and the gravity of the crime of adultery (7–11). Intercourse with a mother is mentioned with horror, and Philo traces to this practice the troubles rife among the Persians (12–19). But the law condemns no less marriage with a step-mother (20–21), with a sister (22–25), and forbids it with others less closely related, such as a wife’s sister (26–28), and with an alien (29). It also strictly refuses to allow a woman who has been divorced and then married another to return to her first husband (31–31). There must be no intercourse during menstruation (32–33), and Philo himself disapproves of marriage with a woman known to be barren (34–36).",
                "Graver matters are pederasty, popularly treated with a favour which Philo deplores (37–42), and bestiality which he illustrates with the story of Pasiphaë (48–50). A harlot, too, is worthy of death (51).",
                "Speaking of adultery itself, he gives a full account of the test laid down in Numbers for the suspected wife (52–63). The penalties for rape or seduction of a widow or maiden are stated (64–71), and also for intercourse with a maiden betrothed to another (72–78), and for slander by a husband impugning the virginity of his bride (79–82).",
                "The Seventh (LXX) Commandment. Murder is sacrilege and deserves the utmost penalty (83–85), and attempted murder is as bad (86–87). Murderers must not be allowed sanctuary in the temple (88–91). While unpremeditated homicide may be less heinous (92), no mercy must be shewn to poisoners (93–99), and with them may be classed magicians, though there is a higher magic (100–103). Returning to the subject of unpremeditated homicide, as in a sudden quarrel, he notes the law which enacted that if the sufferer did not die at once, his opponent would not suffer the extreme penalty (104–107). From the law as stated in the LXX, that a miscarriage caused by a blow was a capital crime if the child was fully formed (108–109), he draws the inference that the exposure of infants is murder, and inveighs very feelingly against the cruelty of the practice (110–119).",
                "He then turns to the law which enables the involuntary homicide to fly to the “Cities of Refuge.” He dwells on the hint given in Exodus, that the death of the man thus killed was divinely ordained, and suggests that these Levitical Cities were privileged because of the conduct of the Levites in slaughtering the calf-worshippers, which story he repeats at length (120–129). In connexion with this he discusses the meaning of the provision that the homicide must remain there till the death of the high priest (130–136).",
                "Next we have laws dealing with cases where death is caused by a master beating a slave (137–143), or by a vicious bull left unguarded (144–146), or a pit left uncovered (147–148), or a roof left without a parapet (149).",
                "The insistence of the law that murder must be punished with death is emphasized by the order that the body is to be prominently exhibited for a time (150–152).",
                "No one is to suffer death as a substitute for the criminal, and here he enlarges on the cruelty shewn in attempts to extort taxes from the relatives of the debtors, and in laws which inflict death on the families of political offenders (153–168).",
                "We now come to assaults not actually causing death. The decree in Deuteronomy that the woman who makes an indecent assault is to lose her hand gives rise to reflections on the modesty demanded of women (169–177), followed by an allegorical interpretation of the law (178–180). Punishment for violence must correspond with the crime (181–183). The law of “an eye for an eye” leads to a disquisition on sight as the channel of wisdom (184–191), and the eye as expressing the phases of the mind (192–194), though the law is modified in the case of a slave. Similarly “a tooth for a tooth” is justified by the indispensability of the teeth for maintaining life (195–204).",
                "In conclusion he recurs to murder itself and argues that by holding contact with a corpse to cause uncleanness, the law shews its horror of the crime of taking life."

                    "BOOK III <br><small>On The Particular Laws Which Come Under Two Of The Ten General Commandments, Namely The Sixth Against Adulterers And All Licentiousness And The Seventh Against Murderers And All Violence</small> <br>[1] There was a time when I had leisure for philosophy and for the contemplation of the universe and its contents, when I made its spirit  my own in all its beauty and loveliness and true blessedness, when my constant companions were divine themes and verities, wherein I rejoiced with a joy that never cloyed or sated. I had no base or abject thoughts nor grovelled  in search of reputation or of wealth or bodily comforts, but seemed always to be borne aloft into the heights with a soul possessed by some God-sent inspiration, a fellow-traveller with the sun and moon and the whole heaven and universe.",
                    "[2] Ah then I gazed down from the upper air, and straining the mind’s eye beheld, as from some commanding peak, the multitudinous world-wide spectacles of earthly things, and blessed my lot in that I had escaped by main force from the plagues of mortal life.",
                    "[3] But, as it proved, my steps were dogged by the deadliest of mischiefs, the hater of the good, envy, which suddenly set upon me and ceased not to pull me down with violence till it had plunged me in the ocean of civil cares,  in which I am swept away, unable even to raise my head above the water.",
                    "[4] Yet amid my groans I hold my own, for, planted in my soul from my earliest days I keep the yearning for culture which ever has pity and compassion for me, lifts me up and relieves my pain. To this I owe it that sometimes I raise my head and with the soul’s eyes—dimly indeed because the mist of extraneous affairs has clouded their clear vision—I yet make shift  to look around me in my desire to inhale a breath of life pure and unmixed with evil.",
                    "[5] And if unexpectedly I obtain a spell of fine weather and a calm from civil turmoils, I get me wings and ride the waves and almost tread the lower air, wafted by the breezes of knowledge which often urges me to come to spend my days with her, a truant as it were from merciless masters in the shape not only of men but of affairs, which pour in upon me like a torrent from different sides.",
                    "[6] Yet it is well for me to give thanks to God even for this,  that though submerged I am not sucked down into the depths, but can also open the soul’s eyes, which in my despair of comforting hope I thought had now lost their sight, and am irradiated by the light of wisdom, and am not given over to lifelong darkness. So behold me daring, not only to read the sacred messages of Moses, but also in my love of knowledge to peer into each of them and unfold and reveal what is not known to the multitude."
                ],
                [
                    "[7] Since out of the ten oracles which God gave forth Himself without a spokesman or interpreter, we have spoken of five, namely those graven on the first table, and also of all the particular laws which had reference to these, and our present duty is to couple with them those of the second table as well as we can, I will again endeavour to fit the special laws into each of the heads.",
                    "[8] The first  commandment in the second table is “Thou shalt not commit adultery.” It comes first, I think, because pleasure is a mighty force felt throughout the whole inhabited world, no part of which has escaped its domination, neither the denizens of land nor of sea nor of the air, for in all three elements beasts, fowls and fishes all alike treat her with profound respect and deference and submit to her orders, look to her every glance or nod, accept contentedly even the caprices of her arrogance and almost anticipate her commands, so promptly and instantaneously do they hasten to render their services.",
                    "[9] Now even natural pleasure is often greatly to blame when the craving for it is immoderate and insatiable, as for instance when it takes the form of voracious gluttony, even though none of the food taken is of the forbidden kind, or again the passionate desire for women shewn by those who in their craze for sexual intercourse behave unchastely, not with the wives of others, but with their own.",
                    "[10] But the blame in most of these cases rests less with the soul than with the body, which contains a great amount both of fire and of moisture; the fire as it consumes the material set before it quickly demands a second supply; the moisture is sluiced in a stream through the genital organs, and creates in them irritations, itchings and titillations without ceasing.",
                    "[11] It is not so with men who are mad to possess the wives of others, sometimes those of their relations and friends, who live to work havoc among their neighbours, who go about to bastardize wholesale widespread family connexions, to turn their prayers for married happiness into a curse and render their hopes of offspring fruitless. Here it is the soul which is incurably diseased. Such persons must be punished with death  as the common enemies of the whole human race, that they may not live to ruin more houses with immunity and be the tutors of others who make it their business to emulate the wickedness of their ways."
                ],
                [
                    "[12] Excellent also are the other injunctions laid down by the law on the relation of the sexes.  It commands abstinence not only from the wives of others but also from widows  in cases where the union is forbidden by the moral law.",
                    "[13] To the Persian custom it at once shows its aversion and abhorrence and forbids it as a very grave offence against holy living.  For the Persian magnates marry their mothers and regard the children of the marriage as nobles of the highest birth, worthy, so it is said, to hold the supreme sovereignty.",
                    "[14] What form of unholiness could be more impious than this: that a father’s bed, which should be kept untouched as something sacred, should be brought to shame: that no respect should be shown for a mother’s ageing years: that the same man should be son and husband to the same woman, and again the same woman wife and mother to the same man: that the children of both should be brothers to their father and grandsons to their mother: that she should be both mother and grandmother of those whom she bore and he both father and half-brother of those whom he begot?",
                    "[15] Even, among the Greeks these things were done in old days in Thebes in the case of Oedipus the son of Laïus. They were done in ignorance, not by deliberate intention, and yet the marriage produced such a harvest of ills that nothing was wanting that could lead to the utmost misery.",
                    "[16] For a succession of wars civil and foreign was left to be passed on as a heritage to children and descendants from their fathers and ancestors.  The greatest cities in Greece were sacked, and armed forces both of natives and allied contingents were destroyed: the bravest leaders on both sides fell one after the other; brothers slew brothers in the deadly feud engendered by ambition for sovereign power. In consequence not only families and independent territories, but also the largest part of the Greek world perished involved in the general destruction. For cities formerly well populated were left stripped of their inhabitants as monuments of the disasters of Greece, a sinister sight to contemplate.",
                    "[17] Nor are the Persians either who follow these practices exempt from similar troubles, for they are always engaging in campaigns and battles, slaying and being slain.  Sometimes they are attacking the neighbouring populations, sometimes defending themselves against insurrection. For of insurgents many appear from many quarters, as the barbarian nature can never remain in quietude. Thus before the sedition of the hour is put down another springs up, so that no season of the year is reserved for a tranquil life, but summer and winter, day and night they are bearing arms, and so rarely does peace reign that they spend more time enduring the hardships of encampment in the open air than dwelling in their cities.",
                    "[18] I put on one side the great and magnificent triumphs of kings whose first exploit when they succeed to the throne is that worst of sacrileges fratricide—murders which they try to vindicate as reasonable by predicting that their brothers will probably attack them.",
                    "[19] All these things appear to me to be the result of the ill-matched matings of sons with mothers. For justice who watches over human affairs avenges the unholy deeds on the impious, and the impiety extends beyond the perpetrators of the deed to those who voluntarily range themselves with the perpetrators.",
                    "[20] But such careful precautions has our law taken in these matters that it has not even permitted the son of a first marriage to marry his stepmother after the death of his father,  both on account of the honour due to his father and because the names of mother and stepmother are closely akin, however different are the feelings called up by the two words. ",
                    "[21] For he who has been taught to abstain from another’s wife because she is called his stepmother, will <i>a fortiori</i> abstain from taking his natural mother; and if the memory of his father makes him respect her who was once his father’s wife, the honour which he pays to both his parents will certainly keep him from entertaining the idea of violating his mother in any way. For it would be the height of folly while acknowledging the claims of a half parentage to appear to treat with contempt the full and complete whole."
                ],
                [
                    "[22] Next comes a prohibition against espousing a sister, a very excellent rule tending to promote both continence and outward decency.  Now Solon the lawgiver of the Athenians permitted marriage with half-sisters on the father’s side but prohibited it when the mother was the same.  The lawgiver of the Lacedaemonians, on the other hand, allowed the second but forbade the first.",
                    "[23] But the lawgiver of the Egyptians poured scorn upon the cautiousness of both, and, holding that the course which they enjoined stopped half-way, produced a fine crop of lewdness. With a lavish hand he bestowed on bodies and souls the poisonous bane of incontinence and gave full liberty to marry sisters of every degree whether they belonged to one of their brother’s parents or to both, and not only if they were younger than their brothers but also if they were older or of the same age.  For twins are often born who, although separated and disunited by nature at birth, enter at the call of concupiscence and voluptuousness into a partnership and wedlock which are neither in the true sense of the words.",
                    "[24] These practices our most holy Moses rejected with abhorrence as alien and hostile to a commonwealth free from reproach and as encouragements and incitements to the vilest of customs. He stoutly forbade the union of a brother with a sister whether both her parents were the same as his or only one. ",
                    "[25] For modesty is lovely, why put it to shame? Maidens must blush, why drive the hue from their cheeks? Why hamper the fellow-feeling and inter-communion of men with men by compressing within the narrow space of each separate house the great and goodly plant which might extend and spread itself over continents and islands and the whole inhabited world? For intermarriages with outsiders create new kinships not a wit inferior to blood-relationships."
                ],
                [
                    "[26] On this principle he prohibits many other unions,  not allowing marriage with a son’s daughter or a daughter’s daughter, nor with an aunt whether paternal or maternal, nor with one who has been wife to an uncle or son or brother, nor again with a stepdaughter whether widow or unmarried, I need not say while the wife is alive, heaven forbid, but even after her death. For the stepfather is virtually a father whose duty is to set his wife’s daughter in the same position as his own.",
                    "[27] Again, he does not allow the same man to marry two sisters either at the same or at different times, even if the person in question has repudiated the one he married first.  For while she is still alive either as his consort or divorced,  whether she is remaining in widowhood or has married another, he considered that the law of holiness required that the sister should not take the position which the wife has lost by her misfortune, but should learn not to set at nought the rights of kinship, nor use as a stepping-stone the fallen state of one so closely united to her by birth, nor bask at ease while enjoying and returning the caresses of her sister’s enemies.",
                    "[28] For from this source grow grave jealousies and bitter feuds bringing with them train upon train of evils without number. For it is just as if the parts of the body were to renounce their natural partnership and place in the system and engage in strife with each other, thus producing incurable diseases and fatalities. Sisters though made as separate parts of the system are fitted into it and formed into a single whole by nature and identity of parentage. And jealousy is a most troublesome passion, creating if it breaks out grave evils unknown before and hardly to be cured.",
                    "[29] But also, he says, do not enter into the partnership of marriage with a member of a foreign nation, lest some day conquered by the forces of opposing customs you surrender and stray unawares from the path that leads to piety and turn aside into a pathless wild. And though perhaps you yourself will hold your ground steadied from your earliest years by the admirable instructions instilled into you by your parents, with the holy laws always as their key-note, there is much to be feared for your sons and daughters. It may well be that they, enticed by spurious customs which they prefer to the genuine, are likely to unlearn the honour due to the one God, and that is the first and the last stage of supreme misery.",
                    "[30] Another commandment is that if a woman after parting from her husband for any cause whatever marries another and then again becomes a widow, whether this second husband is alive or dead, she must not return to her first husband but ally herself with any other rather than him, because she has broken with the rules that bound her in the past and cast them into oblivion when she chose new love-ties in preference to the old. ",
                    "[31] And if a man is willing to contract himself with such a woman, he must be saddled with a character for degeneracy and loss of manhood. He has eliminated from his soul the hatred of evil, that emotion by which our life is so well served and the affairs of houses and cities are conducted as they should be, and has lightly taken upon him the stamp of two heinous crimes, adultery and pandering. For such subsequent reconciliations are proofs of both. The proper punishment for him is death and for the woman also."

                    "[32] Whenever the menstrual issue occurs, a man must not touch a woman, but must during that period refrain from intercourse and respect the law of nature.  He must also remember the lesson that the generative seeds should not be wasted fruitlessly for the sake of a gross and untimely pleasure. For it is just as if a husbandman should in intoxication or lunacy sow wheat and barley in ponds or mountain-streams instead of in the plains, since the fields should become dry before the seed is laid in them.",
                    "[33] Now nature also each month purges the womb as if it were a cornfield—a field with mysterious properties, over which, like a good husbandman, he must watch for the right time to arrive. So while the field is still inundated he will keep back the seed, which otherwise will be silently swept away by the stream, as the humidity not only relaxes, but utterly paralyses the seminal nerve-forces, which in nature’s laboratory, the womb, mould the living creature and with consummate craftsmanship perfect each part both of body and soul. But if the menstruation ceases, he may boldly sow the generative seeds, no longer fearing that what he lays will perish.",
                    "[34]  They too must be branded with reproach, who plough the hard and stony land. And who should they be but those who mate with barren women? For in the quest of mere licentious pleasure like the most lecherous of men they destroy  the procreative germs with deliberate purpose. For what other motive can they have in plighting themselves to such women? It cannot be the hope of offspring, a hope which they know must necessarily fail to be realized; it can only be an inordinate frenzy, and incontinence past all cure.",
                    "[35] Those who marry maidens in ignorance at the time of their capacity or incapacity for successful motherhood, and later refuse to dismiss them, when prolonged childlessness shews them to be barren, deserve our pardon. Familiarity, that most constraining influence, is too strong for them, and they are unable to rid themselves of the charm of old affection imprinted on their souls by long companionship.",
                    "[36] But those who sue for marriage with women whose sterility has already been proved with other husbands, do but copulate like pigs or goats, and their names should be inscribed in the lists of the impious as adversaries of God. For while God in His love both for mankind and all that lives spares no care to effect the preservation and permanence of every race, those persons who make an art of quenching the life of the seed as it drops, stand confessed as the enemies of nature."

Mark how conspicuously they braid and adorn the hair of their heads, and how they scrub and paint their faces with cosmetics and pigments and the like, and smother themselves with fragrant unguents. For of all such embellishments, used by all who deck themselves out to wear a comely appearance, fragrance is the most seductive. In fact the transformation of the male nature to the female is practised by them as an art and does not raise a blush.",
                    "[38] These persons are rightly judged worthy of death by those who obey the law, which ordains that the man-woman who debases the sterling coin of nature should perish unavenged, suffered not to live for a day or even an hour, as a disgrace to himself, his house, his native land and the whole human race.",
                    "[39] And the lover of such may be assured that he is subject to the same penalty. He pursues an unnatural pleasure and does his best to render cities desolate and uninhabited by destroying  the means of procreation. Furthermore he sees no harm in becoming a tutor and instructor in the grievous vices of unmanliness and effeminacy by prolonging the bloom  of the young and emasculating the flower of their prime, which should rightly be trained to strength and robustness. Finally, like a bad husbandman he lets the deep-soiled and fruitful fields lie sterile, by taking steps to keep them from bearing, while he spends his labour night and day on soil from which no growth at all can be expected.",
                    "[40] The reason is, I think, to be found in the prizes awarded in many nations to licentiousness and effeminacy. Certainly you may see these hybrids of man and woman continually strutting about through the thick of the market, heading the processions at the feasts, appointed to serve as unholy ministers of holy things, leading the mysteries and initiations and celebrating the rites of Demeter. ",

These persons begin with making themselves experts in dainty feeding, wine-bibbing and the other pleasures of the belly and the parts below it. Then sated with these they reach such a pitch of wantonness, the natural offspring of satiety, that losing their senses they conceive a frantic passion, no longer for human beings male or female, but even for brute beasts.  So according to the story did Pasiphaë the wife of King Minos long ago in Crete. ",

Consequently wild with passion, for amorousness is vastly intensified by unsuccess, she reported the trouble under which she was labouring to Daedalus, who was the best craftsman of his time. His masterly skill in devising plans for capturing the uncaptured enabled him to construct a wooden cow, into which he introduced Pasiphaë through one of its sides, and the bull supposing it to be a living animal of its own kind, charged and mounted it. She became pregnant, and in the course of time bore a half-beast called the Minotaur.",

                    "[47] It is true that some people value mules above all other beasts of burden, because their bodies are compact and exceedingly muscular, and accordingly in horse-stables or other places where horses are kept they rear donkeys of huge size to which they give the name of “Celons” to copulate with the female colts, who then give birth to a hybrid animal, the mule or half-ass. But Moses, recognizing that the way in which this animal is produced contravenes nature, stringently forbade it under the wider order by which he refused permission for animals of either sex to breed with those of an unlike species. ",
                    "[48] In making this provision he considered what was in accord with decency and conformity to nature, but beyond this he gave us as from some far-off commanding height  a warning to men and women alike that they should learn from these examples to abstain from unlawful forms of intercourse.",
                    "[49] Whether, then, it is the man who uses a quadruped for this purpose, or the woman who allows herself to be used, the human offenders must die and the beasts also; the first because they have passed beyond the limits of licentiousness itself by evolving abnormal lusts, and because they have invented strange pleasures than which nothing could be more unpleasing, shameful even to describe; the beasts because they have ministered to such infamies, and to ensure that they do not bear or beget any monstrosity of the kind that may be expected to spring from such abominations.",

She flings herself at the disposal of chance comers, and sells her bloom like some ware to be purchased in the market. In her every word and deed she aims at capturing the young, while she incites her lovers each against the other by offering the vile prize of herself to the highest bidder.

The act of adultery is signified by the earthen vessel because of its fragility, since death is the punishment decreed for adulterers; innocence of the charge by the earth and water, since both these are factors in the birth and growth and consummation of all things.",

In a sense such a one, though living in a city, is in a solitude, being solitary so far as helpers are concerned.

Should she not when she hears bad language stop her ears and run away? As it is, some of them go to such a length that, not only do we hear amid a crowd of men a woman’s bitter tongue venting abuse and contumelious words, but see her hands also used to assault—hands which were trained to weave and spin and not to inflict blows and injuries like pancratiasts and boxers.",

And the penalty shall be this—that the hand shall be cut off which has touched what decency forbids it to touch.",

This explanation was as follows.  There is in the soul a male and female element just as there is in families, the male corresponding to the men, the female to the women. The male soul assigns itself to God alone as the Father and Maker of the Universe and the Cause of all things. The female clings to all that is born and perishes; it stretches out its faculties like a hand to catch blindly at what comes in its way, and gives the clasp of friendship to the world of created things with all its numberless changes and transmutations, instead of to the divine order, the immutable, the blessed, the thrice happy.",

Therefore one who honours the dyad before the monad should not fail to know that he holds matter in higher esteem than God. It is for this reason that the law judged it right to cut off this tendency of the soul as if it were a hand, for there is no greater impiety than to ascribe to the passive element the power of the active principle."

Now the teeth are divided into the cutters and the grinders; the former do their part by cutting or biting the bread-stuffs and all other comestibles, whence their appropriate name of cutters, the latter by their capacity for reducing the bitten pieces into smaller particles.",

Apart from such matters as the apparently unsuccessful attempt to interfere with Jewish religion mentioned in <i>De Som</i>. ii. 123 (where see note in App.), and the oppression of the tax-collectors noted below (§§ 159 ff.), there must have been considerable friction in Alexandria caused by the special position of the Jewish πολιτεία long before the outbreak. It is this to which I understand the φθόνος to refer, rather than, as Goodenough, to the conventional idea of the jealousy of fate shewn to prosperity, an idea which does not seem to fit in well with the epithets μισόκαλος and κακῶν ἀργαλεώτατον.",

There are indeed other times (§ 5) when he can shake off the shackles altogether and perhaps feel the inspiration which he described in <i>De Mig</i>. § 35. But this is not one of these times.

Tertullian also in <i>Ad Nationes</i>, i. 15 and <i>Apol</i>. 9 repeats the statement on the authority of Ctesias, another early historian.

He does not say that it was a common practice, and when Plato, <i>Laws</i> 838 A, B puts brother and sister without adding ὁμομήτριος among the relations between which intercourse was not only unlawful but felt so strongly to be unlawful that most people had no desire for it, it is difficult to suppose that it was common.",

Assuming, then, that the remarriage shewed that the intermediate union was adultery, the offender would be liable under Roman law in Philo’s time. Elsewhere (see references in <i>Dict. of Ant</i>.) condonation of adultery is treated under the same law as <i>lenocinium</i>. Is this the Latin equivalent for what Philo calls προαγωγεία?

Clearly some people did not regard it as adultery, and, when Philo maintains the contrary, he seems to me to be upholding what he takes to be the view of Deuteronomy, which assigns the same punishment as for adultery, and speaks of the violator as having dishonoured (ἐταπείνωσε) his neighbour’s wife.

He suggests that εἶδος or an equivalent word has fallen out, and that ἀθάνατον is the result of a gloss explanatory of εἶδος. The glossator wrote αʹ (=ἕνα) θάνατον, and this having been re-embodied in the text in the form of ἀθάνατον ultimately ousted εἶδος.",
                "In the first part of the sentence the suggestion of inserting ἀμειλίκτως is due to H. Grégoire in <i>Hermes</i>, 1909, p. 320, though he would place it between ἐργασάμενον and ἀναιρετέον.",
                "§ 86. (Intention to kill.) Heinemann points out that in giving this interpretation to Ex. 21:14 ἐπιθῆται … δόλῳ, and extending it to cover βούλευσις in general, Philo is following Greek law, τὸν βουλεύσαντα ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ ἐνέχεσθαι καὶ τὸν χειρὶ ἐργασάμενον, Andocides i. 94.",
                "§ 89. (Punishment of poisoners.) Heinemann and Goodenough point out that Philo’s views on this subject are in accordance with the spirit of the <i>Lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficis</i> (about 81 B.C.) which decreed punishment for preparing, having or selling poisons for the destruction of human life, as well as for actually using them. Josephus, <i>Ant</i>. iv. 279 is closer to the Roman law, as he expressly includes the possession of such poisons as criminal. Both authors apparently go beyond the <i>Lex Cornelia</i> in saying that poison intended to cause other injuries than death. (Jos. εἰς ἄλλας βλάβας πεποιημένον is on the same footing.)",
                "§ 100. (The Magi and the true magic.) Mangey and others quote for the last part of the sentence Cic. <i>De Div</i>. i. 91 “Nec quisquam rex Persarum potest esse qui non ante Magorum disciplinam scientiamque perceperit.”",
                "As to what Philo understands by “true magic” I hazard the conjecture that he has in mind the distinction between “artificiosa divinatio” and “naturalis,” a distinction which is made by the Stoic in the <i>De Div</i>., and accepted by his opponent. The coincidence quoted above inclines one to think that both this passage and the substance of <i>De Div</i>. i. are based on some Stoic treatise (? Poseidonius). In the <i>De Div</i>. the “artificiosa” comprises haruspicy, augury, and the like, while the “naturalis” is limited to inspiration, such as oracles, and dreams. It seems to be equated in i. 90 with “ratio naturae quam φυσιολογίαν Graeci appellant.” This agrees with our passage and with <i>Quod Omn. Prob</i>. 74, where the Magi are extolled as “researching in tranquillity into the works (or facts) of nature and by clearer visions receiving and giving revelations (ἱεροφαντοῦνταί τε καὶ ἱεροφαντοῦσι) of divine excellences.” Further at the end of <i>De Div</i>. i. the Stoic, though he has defended the “artificiosa” in general, rejects the charlatan impostors in much the same tone as Philo takes in § 101. Compare also <i>Mos</i>. i. 277 where ἔντεχνος μαντική was inadequately translated by “his art of wizardry.” Rather it means the “artificiosa” discarded for the “naturalis” of the prophetic spirit. It is an objection to this, but not I think a fatal objection, that either Philo or Cicero must have misunderstood the reference to the Magi. For in Cicero the Magi “augurantur et divinant,” <i>i.e</i>. practise the “artificiosa.”",
                "Heinemann thinks that Philo is just adopting the accepted Stoic definition of μαντική as ἐπιστήμη οὖσα θεωρητικὴ καὶ ἐξηγητικὴ τῶν ὑπὸ θεῶν ἀνθρώποις διδομένων σημείων (<i>S. V. F.</i> ii. 1018, iii. 654), while giving the last words a “monotheistic” twist. He means, I suppose, that φύσις = (as often) θεός is substituted for θεῶν. In view of Philo’s wholesale denunciation of μαντική in i. 59 ff. it seems to me improbable that he would accept this definition without more explanation than this.",
                "It is possible, no doubt, that he is simply echoing the vague popular idea that there is a respectable as well as a disreputable magic, which we find also in the N.T. with the “wise men” from the east on the one hand and Simon and Elymas on the other, all described as μάγοι.",
                "§ 102. θανατῶντας. The same sense for θανατᾶν, <i>i.e</i>. “to be about to die,” is demanded certainly or preferably in <i>De Virt</i>. 34, <i>De Ex</i>. 159, and <i>De Aet</i>. 89. The word cannot be an interpolation in all these places; nor does Cohn raise any objection there. It is true that the accepted meaning of θανατᾶν is “to desire death,” as in <i>Phaedo</i> 64 B. If here and elsewhere it carries the sense of imminence rather than desire, it is presumably on the analogy of verbs of sickness such as ὑδεριάω = “be dropsical” or ὀφθαλμιάω = “have sore eyes.” In this way it may easily = “sick unto death,” and thence pass on to being doomed to death from other causes than sickness. It is a pertinent objection that these verbs are in -ιάω rather than -άω, though indeed to add the vowel in each case in Philo would be less drastic than expunging the word. At any rate the positive fact for the lexicographer is that in these four places the MSS. of Philo exhibit θανατᾶν as = “being near to death.” Possibly to these should be added i. 237, where θανατῶσαν νόσον is corrected by Cohn to θανατοῦσαν νόσον. That the disease itself is near to death (<i>cf</i>. “this sickness is not unto death”) would be a fairly natural extension.",
                "§ 108. <i>Both for the outrage, and for obstructing nature</i>, etc. Goodenough, pp. 113 f. points out that Josephus, <i>Ant</i>. iv. 278 mentions a double fine, (1) for diminishing the population; (2) compensation to the husband, and that Philo’s two reasons, “nature” and ὕβρις, roughly correspond to these. He infers that Philo also contemplates a double fine. He may very likely have found the LXX ἐπιζήμιον ζημιωθήσεται καθότι ἂν ἐπιβάλῃ ὁ ἀνὴρ τῆς γυναικὸς δώσει μετὰ ἀξιώματος obscure.",
                "§ 109. <i>A human being … from confinement</i>. Heinemann and Goodenough note a discrepancy between this and § 117, where Philo accepts the Stoic theory (<i>S. V. F.</i> ii. 806) that the child is not a separate living creature till it has left its mother’s womb. I do not think there is any real discrepancy. Here he is stating what he considers to be implied by the LXX, <i>i.e</i>. that the child at this stage is (potentially) a human being. There he argues that while the Stoic theory may be true and is supported by high authorities, the stricter law of the LXX seems to emphasize the sacredness of the infant and shews <i>a fortiori</i> how heinous is the destruction of the fully born. <i>Cf</i>. for a very similar argument <i>De Virt</i>. 137, 138.",
                "§ 120. (Involuntary homicide.) What does Philo understand by this? In the Pentateuch it seems to mean accidental homicide, see particularly the example given in Deut. 19:5 of the man killed by the slip of the head from his neighbour’s axe. Nothing is said in these sections exactly in contradiction of this, though the μὴ ἐκ προνοίας in § 128 may point to a wider interpretation. But in §§ 92 and 104 we have had suggestions that he regards homicide, if committed in sudden anger or in an unpremeditated quarrel, as different from ordinary murder, though he does not follow this up (see notes on §§ 92 and 104). His view in fact seems much the same as that of Plato, who (<i>Laws</i> 866 D ff.) discusses the point and says that one who kills another in hot blood or unpremeditatedly is οὐ παντάπασιν ἀκούσιος ἀλλʼ εἰκὼν ἀκουσίου. Philo’s ἡμίεργον in § 92 is a rough equivalent of Plato’s εἰκών (“likeness or shadow,” Jowett) and indeed may be a reminiscence of it. That is to say, it is something between ἀκούσιος and ἑκούσιος. One may conjecture that he does not consider it worthy of death, but in face of the law of Ex. 21:18, 19, described in § 100, refrains from saying so.",
                "§§ 131–136. <i>The death of the high priest</i>. Why the death of one high priest should abrogate the reasons assigned for the limit of the exile, when he is immediately succeeded by another, is not here discussed. The real explanation, as I understand from the commentators, is that the rights of the avenger of blood had to be limited, and that the succession of a new high priest, like the accession of a new sovereign, made a convenient limit. Philo himself in <i>De Fuga</i> 106 f. has pronounced the enactment, if literally taken, to be absurd, and therefore explains the death of the high priest as the death of the Logos in the soul.",
                "§ 148. (Punishment in the case where a man is killed by falling into an unguarded pit.) Philo’s statement in the face of the absence of any specific provision in the Law is regarded by Goodenough, p. 129 as clear evidence that he is here giving us the practice of the Jewish courts in Egypt. I think it is merely one of his reasonable inferences from analogous cases. By making the negligence punishable when an animal is killed, the law suggests that it is still more punishable in the case of a human being. What he says really amounts to saying that no one need think himself debarred from making a complaint to the court, which will then have to follow the principle laid down in the matter of the unguarded well, <i>i.e</i>. either death or a fine. He naturally hesitates to prescribe death in so many words, but evidently thinks it would be justified, as also in the case of the φόνος of the unguarded roof mentioned in § 149.",
                "§ 149. (The unguarded roof.) It is noteworthy that Josephus, <i>Ant</i>. iv. 284 also couples this with the unguarded pit, though they came from quite different parts of the Pentateuch, and this has sometimes (see Thackeray <i>ad loc</i>.) been regarded as one of the points which shew Josephus’s dependence upon Philo. See vol. vi., Introd. p. xxii, note <i>e</i>. I think the analogy of the two is obvious enough to have struck both writers independently.",
                "§ 164. (Traitors and tyrants, etc.) Heinemann in his note says positively that the latter law, <i>i.e</i>. against tyrants (in <i>Bildung</i>, p. 212, both laws, regarded as a single law), is an old Macedonian law. Goodenough accepts this and infers that it was probably continued in Ptolemaic Egypt and therefore known to Philo. All this has very slender foundation. Heinemann’s authority is two passages (cited quite reasonably by Cohn as illustrations), one from Curtius Rufus vi. 42. 20, the other from Cicero, <i>De Inventione</i>, ii. 144. The first of these mentions in connexion with a plot against Alexander a “law of the Macedonians providing that the relations of a conspirator against the king should be put to death.” Here it is relations (<i>propinqui</i>), not children, and an “insidiator” is not the same as a προδότης. Still there may be some connexion.",
                "The second passage deals with a problem in the rhetorical schools. There are supposed to be two laws: one that the tyrannicide may claim <i>any</i> reward; another that the “five nearest relations of the tyrant shall be put to death.” The example given is that of Alexander, tyrant of Pherae, who was murdered in 367 B.C., by his wife. By the first law she can claim the life of her son by him as the reward; by the second he must be put to death, and the arguments for either course are elaborately discussed by Cicero. As apparently Alexander’s wife was acting in concert with her brother, who afterwards assumed the tyranny (Diod. xvi. 14), the question can hardly have arisen, and if it did, Pherae was presumably not under Macedonian jurisdiction. But it is quite unsafe to assume that such a law was in existence. The death of Alexander was a famous case of tyrannicide and a useful peg on which to hang one of the controversies, in which tyrannicide was a favourite subject, and to which historicity was a matter of complete indifference. Heinemann and Goodenough have fallen into the same error as on ii. 244, in mistaking these fictions of the schools for sober history; though it must not be assumed that because they are worthless as evidence, Philo had not some other ground, historical or traditional, for his statements.",
                "§ 171. <i>The temple</i>. Possibly τὸ ἱερόν may have become in the διασπορά a conventional name for the synagogue as the best possible substitute for the temple, particularly in Alexandria where the synagogue is said to have been especially magnificent and famous (<i>Jewish Encyclopedia, s.v</i>. synagogue); and so too with the common collocation εὐχὰς καὶ θυσίας for the due performance of all religious rites possible.",
                "On the strict seclusion of women indicated in this section Heinemann (<i>Bildung</i>, p. 234) quotes <i>In Flaccum</i> 89 (of the Jewish women in Alexandria) γύναια κατάκλειστα μηδὲ τὴν αὔλειον προερχόμενα καὶ θαλαμευόμεναι παρθένοι, though he points out that it reflects Greek rather than Jewish ideas.",
                "Goodenough cites a passage from the female Pythagorean Phintys, quoted in Stobaeus (Meineke, iii. 64), which in some ways curiously resembles this, but shews less strictness. Phintys’s lady may go out duly attended not only to public worship but to see spectacles (θεωρίαι) and to shop.",
                "§ 176. (Exclusion of women from gymnastic competitions.) The only evidence for this known to me is their exclusion from the Olympic games mentioned in Aelian, <i>V.H</i>. x. 1, and Pausanias, v. 6. 7. Elsewhere Pausanias, vi. 20. 9 (if the text is right) states that virgins were not excluded.",
                "§ 181. (Penalties not corresponding to the crimes.) Goodenough, p. 137 says that the list of punishments here given follows those provided in Greek law for the several crimes. This seems to be only partially correct. The punishment for αἰκία was a monetary fine, and murderers were apparently allowed to evade the death-penalty by flying the country. But the punishment for τραύματα ἐκ προνοίας, <i>i.e</i>. wounding intended to kill, which perhaps may be equated with Philo’s τραύματα καὶ πηρώσεις, was banishment, not ἀτιμία, which is a loss of civil rights not entailing banishment. It seems to be true that theft might sometimes be punished by a few days’ imprisonment as a supplement to a manifold restitution of the things stolen, but what Philo here means is imprisonment instead of such restitution. I do not see any reason to think that he refers to any particular body of legislation.",
                "The references given by Goodenough to Lipsius are to pp. 646, 605–607, 440, to which add for wilful murder, 603–604.",
                "§ 183. ἀποφράδες ἡμέραι. The idea suggested in the translation is that, as all religious rites are forbidden on these days, the action cannot desecrate them. Compare Lucian, <i>Pseudologistes</i> 12, where the performance of sacred rites is included among the things prohibited on the Apophrades. Something of the same sort appears in <i>Laws</i> 800 D, where Plato forbids the melancholy strains used at sacrifices as blasphemy and relegates them to the Apophrades.",
                "It seems possible, however, that the contrast intended may be the opposite of this, namely that things which are lawful on the feast-days are intolerable at other times. Philo may be thinking of pagan usage around him and allude to the license allowed on public feast-days (<i>cf.</i> <i>De Cher</i>. 91 ff.). This will give ἀποφράδες ἡμέραι something more like its ordinary meaning. Days which are inauspicious for ordinary business will be still more inauspicious for unlawful actions.",
                "§ 184. <i>The most conspicuous and distinguished situation</i>. Heinemann quotes Cic. <i>De Natura Deorum</i>, ii. 140 “oculi tanquam speculatores altissimum locum obtinent,” but the thought there is somewhat different, rather of convenience than dignity, as it continues “ex quo plurima conspicientes fungantur suo munere.”",
                "§ 204. (The law of the millstone). Heinemann, who (<i>Bildung</i>, p. 430) gives ἵεται ἐπʼ ἀνδροφονίαν the somewhat stronger sense of “aims at murder,” considers Philo’s comments to be a rhetorical exaggeration, and that no such murderous intention on the part of the creditors is suggested by a law which merely prohibits the attachment for debt of an indispensable article. (Such laws are paralleled in other legislations, indeed in the Common Law of England, see Adam Smith <i>ad loc</i>. Goodenough (p. 142) aptly cites out of the Papyri an example from the Ptolemaic law of Egypt, where a farmer’s cattle and tools and a weaver’s loom are mentioned.) But Philo gives a natural interpretation of the strong phrase ψυχὴν ἐνεχυράζει. It must be remembered that he only notes this law incidentally to strengthen his point of the criminality of destroying a man’s teeth."

                "THE SPECIAL LAWS (DE SPECIALIBUS LEGIBUS) <br>INTRODUCTION TO <i>DE SPECIALIBUS LEGIBUS, IV</i>",
                "The first part of this treatise (1–135) deals with particular laws falling under the eighth, ninth and tenth commandments. We begin with the eighth. Note that robbery with violence is a worse crime than mere stealing, which is punished by a two-fold restitution, so if the thief cannot pay he may be sold into temporary slavery (2–4). Some considerations follow showing that this is not too severe (5–6). A housebreaker caught in the act may be killed in the night-time, but in daylight the ordinary legal process must be observed (7–10). Also the law provides a higher rate of compensation, if sheep and, still more, if oxen are stolen, reckoned, Philo thinks, according to the services they render to mankind (11–12). Kidnapping is another worse form of stealing, especially if the sufferer is an Israelite (13–19). Damage done by the trespassing of other people’s cattle, or by fire started carelessly, also calls for compensation (20–29). Then follows an account of the complicated procedure laid down by the law when anything deposited or lent is stolen from the depositary or borrower (30–38). And this part concludes with shewing how stealing leads up to other crimes culminating in perjury (39–40).",
                "The ninth commandment. We begin with false witness in the literal sense, but pass almost at once to the thought that assent to evil, especially when it arises from subservience to the multitude, comes under the same head (41–47). And so do the deceits of the practisers of divination, which is really false witness against God (48–54). So, too, does any dereliction on the part of judges, who must remember the sacredness of their office (55–58). Three of their special duties are emphasized by the law. First, not to listen to idle reports (59–61). Secondly, to receive no gifts, even if no injustice results. To do this is to forget that just and honest actions may be vitiated by being done with dishonest motives (62–66). This leads to a digression on the supreme importance of truthfulness and how it is often lost by bad associations in childhood and how it is symbolized in the place given to it on the breastplate of the high priest (67–69). Thirdly, the judge must not respect persons but must consider only the facts (70–71). And the particular injunction not in giving judgement to show mercy to the poor causes him to point out that the law calls also on the possessor of any authority to remember his weaker brethren and only means that the guilty cannot plead poverty to escape from punishment (72–77). We now pass on to the tenth commandment (78).",
                "The commandment “Thou shalt not desire” leads to a long disquisition, much of it repeating what was said of it in <i>De Decalogo</i> on the evils which spring from the desire of what one has not got (79–94). The lawgiver realizing this showed the necessity of restraining concupiscence by regulating, as an example, one particular form, the appetite for food and drink (95–97). He did this, first, by demanding the first fruits (98–99). Secondly, by the dietary laws on the use of the flesh of beasts, fishes and fowls (100–101). All carnivorous beasts are on the prohibited list, and only ten species, which divide the hoof and chew the cud, are allowed (102–104). An allegorical explanation of these two qualifications follows (105–109). Of fishes only such that have scales and fins are permitted, and again an allegorical explanation is given (110–112). So also creeping things with few exceptions (113–115), predatory birds (116–118), flesh of animals that have died a natural death or been torn by wild beasts (119–121) are forbidden. Eating strangled animals and taking blood and fat are also forbidden (122–125). The need of restraint is illustrated from the story of the quails and the visitation that followed that craving for flesh (126–131).",
                "So much for the particular laws falling under one or other of the Ten Commandments, but the cardinal virtues belong to all the ten, and we must note how these virtues are exemplified in various laws. For piety, wisdom or prudence and temperance, this has been done sufficiently. There remain three others, justice, courage or fortitude and humanity or kindness. The rest of this treatise is concerned with the exemplification of justice (132–135). We need not here repeat what was said about judges and law-courts when treating the ninth commandment, but before going on to our subject, we give some general thoughts on justice (136). First, there is the injunction to record the laws in the heart, on the hand and before the eyes and on the doors and on the gates (137–142). Secondly, that nothing is to be added or taken away, which may be taken to suggest that each virtue is a mean, which must not be allowed to degenerate into the extremes on the other side (143–148). Thirdly, that in the law, “not to remove the landmarks which thy forefathers set up,” we may see a command to observe the unwritten law of custom (149–150).",
                "Now for the exemplification of justice. First, as seen in the ruler or king. He must not be chosen by lot, a system which we see in ordinary matters to be absurd (151–156), but by election by the people, confirmed by God, and this ruler is not to be a foreigner (157–159). The ruler must copy out and study the law and its principles (160–169). Thirdly, he must follow the example of Moses in appointing subordinates to decide minor cases, but reserve the greater for himself (170–175). And the greater are those which concern not great people but the weak and helpless, the stranger, the widow and the orphan (176–178). And as orphanhood is the condition of the Jews as a nation (179–182), the ruler must use no guile but hold himself to be the father of his people (183–187). But the ruler or judge may sometimes find cases too difficult for him, in which case they are to be referred to the priests (188–192). Leaving the duties of the ruler, we have the following general rules of justice. There must be complete honesty in commerce (193–194). Wages must be paid on the same day (195–196). The deaf and the blind are not to be ill-treated (197–202). The ordinances about mating different species, ploughing with ox and ass together, and wearing garments of mixed material and sowing the vineyard to bear two kinds of fruit, are treated as rules of justice (203–207). This last is discussed at greater length as injustice to the land like the violation of the sabbatical year (208–218). Next we have the laws of warfare, willingness to make terms, severity if they are not accepted, but mercy to the women (219–225), and joined with this is the prohibition of destroying the fruit-trees (226–229). The treatise concludes with the praises of justice, the daughter of that equality which is the general principle of all life as well as of the cosmic system (230–238)."

Secondly because it is the property of others which he eyes so avidly and sets his snares to secure for himself and deprive the owners of their possession.

The first reason for this is to keep things of a different kind from being mixed and confused. For sown crops have no relation to trees nor trees to sown crops and therefore nature has not appointed the same date to both for producing their annual fruits, but has assigned spring to the one for reaping the corn harvest and the end of summer to the other for gathering the fruits.",
                    "[209] Thus we find that the sown plants after their flowering wither at the same time as the trees sprout after withering.

For if this nourishment is divided up, as it is in times of famine and dearth, all the plants will necessarily lose all their strength and either become sterilized and completely unproductive or else bear nothing but poor fruit as a consequence of the debility caused by their lack of nourishment.",
                    "[212] The third reason was that good soil should not suffer from the pressure of two very heavy burdens, one the close unbroken density of the plants which are sown and grow on the same spot, the other the task of bearing a double crop of fruit. A single yearly tribute from a single piece of ground is enough for the owner to receive, as the same from a city is enough for a king. To attempt to levy more than one toll shows excessive avarice, and that is a vice which upsets the laws of nature.",

He will not exact a double tribute nor wring the life out of his subjects with his imposts.

                "(The title.) This, as it is given here, is taken from a list of some of the works of Philo, found in an eleventh-century MS., which itself contains only half of the <i>De Opificio</i>, but the list no doubt is the table of contents in the exemplar from which that MS. was taken. It agrees with that in the two MSS. (S and M) of this treatise, except that they omit ὅλης. All these omit the last word or words, which Cohn supplied by τέλος. The last six words so amended are translated in Goodhart and Goodenough’s <i>Bibliography</i>, p. 135, “and which (<i>i.e.</i> justice) is the objective of the whole code.” I understand ὅ to have the phrase περὶ δικαιοσύνης for its antecedent, and συντάξεως, which could hardly mean “code,” as referring to the whole of the four books.",
                "The addition of τῶν εἰς ἕκαστον ἀναφερομένων seems quite needless. Compare the titles of the other three books.",
                "§ 2. (Stealing open and secret.) As the distinction made by Philo, though natural enough, is not drawn at any rate directly from the Law it is a case where perhaps he may have been influenced by other legislation. Goodenough, <i>Jewish Jurisprudence in Egypt</i>, pp. 145 ff., and Heinemann, <i>Bildung</i>, pp. 421 ff., have some discussion on this. Goodenough notes that the Ptolemaic law in Egypt distinguished between open robbery (λεία) and ordinary stealing. He gives a reference to Taubenschlag, <i>Strafrecht</i>, pp. 26 ff., which I have not been able to see. In Roman law the person who committed a “furtum manifestum” was held to be a “fur inprobior” (Mommsen, <i>Strafrecht</i>, p. 601). In Attic law the distinction does not seem to be so clear. In Xen. <i>Mem.</i> i. 2. 62, which Goodenough cites, κατὰ τοὺς νόμους ἐάν τις φανερὸς γένηται κλέπτων … θάνατός ἐστιν ἡ ζημία, φανερός may mean “detected,” “clearly proved” rather than, as Goodenough, “openly.”",
                "§ 2. <i>Repay the stolen goods twofold</i>. Mangey on these words and Driver on Ex. 22:4 give several examples of a similar rule. Among them are Solon’s laws as stated by Gellius xi. 18 and Dem. <i>Adv. Timocrat.</i>, p. 467 (of conviction for theft in a private action) and Plato, <i>Laws</i> 857 A. Philo may have known these, but his generalization is not so inexact that we need suppose him to have been influenced by other legislations.",
                "§ 4. <i>General proclamation</i>. Heinemann, <i>Bildung</i>, p. 421, dissents from the view that there is an allusion to Lev. 25:10, and regards the phrase as meaning merely a public announcement. The absence of the article may favour this, but he does not give any evidence of such a regulation from Philo or elsewhere. The Athenian ἀποκήρυξις which he quotes as an analogy, a term applied to a formal notice of disinheriting, does not help much.",
                "§ 7. <i>In the very place where he has broken in</i>. L. and S. revised give “(the act of) breaking in” for διόρυγμα as a LXX usage, citing this passage, viz. Ex. 22:2 and Jeremiah 2:34. I do not think this is right. In neither passage, the second of which appears to be an allusion to the first, is there any necessity to understand the act rather than the place. Anyway, Philo is more likely to have understood the word, which he quotes from the LXX, in its usual sense.",
                "For the law that a thief might be legally killed at night <i>cf.</i> the Attic law as stated by Demosthenes, <i>Adv. Timocrat.</i>, p. 463, also Plato, <i>Laws</i> ix. 874 B νύκτωρ φῶρα εἰς οἰκίαν εἰσιόντα ἐπὶ κλοπῇ χρημάτων, ἐὰν ἑλὼν κτείνῃ τις, καθαρὸς ἔστω. In Roman law, the XII Tables have “si nox furtum factum sit, si eum occisit, iure caesus esto.” As Philo is reproducing Exodus, these are illustrations of that rather than of this. However, one point noted by Goodenough, p. 154, may be worth mentioning. The Roman law, as stated in the Digest, directed that the killing must be preceded by a call for help (“cum clamore”). If Philo knew this, it would agree with his insistence that the right to kill is founded on the inability to get help. Much the same point is made in another connexion in <i>Spec. Leg.</i> iii. 74–78.",
                "§§ 11, 12. (Value of Sheep and Ox.) Heinemann’s suggestion (approved by Goodenough), that the thought in these sections was developed from the Stoic doctrine that animals were created for the service of man, seems to me fanciful. Philo has to give a reason why the law requires a higher rate of compensation for a sheep and still more for an ox than for other goods, and this necessarily depends on their value to the owner. The passage he quotes from Cic. <i>De Nat.</i> ii. 158 ff. certainly says that the sheep was intended to supply man with wool and the ox to supply him with means for ploughing, but does not note the other abilities noted here. The two passages are also alike in not mentioning that either animal is good for food, but elsewhere the Stoics seem to have held that they were also created to be eaten (“ad vescendum”), Cic. <i>De Leg.</i> i. 8. 25 (<i>S.V.F.</i> ii. 1162).",
                "§ 13. (Kidnapping.) As the LXX (see footnote) does not deal with the crime of kidnapping a non-Israelite, Philo leaves the punishment to be determined by the “court,” cf. <i>Spec. Leg.</i> iii. 148, where the same is laid down in the case of death caused to a man by falling into an unguarded pit, whereas the law only prescribed compensation for the death of an animal. By the Court I do not understand him, as Goodenough does, to be thinking of the Jewish Court in Alexandria. What he says in these sections is that (1) the act is obviously a crime against humanity, and (2) would therefore have to be punished by a court, (3) should be, or at least might be, punished by something less than death.",
                "In Roman law kidnapping (“plagium”) was a serious crime, sometimes punishable by death (see Dict. of Ant.).",
                "§ 21. (ἀγρονόμοι.) Nothing really is known of this office, except from two passages in Aristotle, <i>Politics</i> vi. 5, 1321 b and vii. 11, 1331 b, where he says that the ὑλωροί or forest-wardens are also called ἀγρονόμοι, but he does not specify the states where these are to be found. It is conjectured (see Pauly-Wissowa) that the πεδιανόμοι at Sparta, whose title is found in an inscription, are the same. But Plato in several passages of the <i>Laws</i> recommends the appointment of such officials to do for the country what the ἀστυνόμοι do for the towns. See particularly 760 ff. and 844 B, where they are empowered to redress civil injuries. Very little importance, I think, can be attached to Philo’s statement that the best governed cities have these officials. It is an inference which he would easily draw from Plato’s way of speaking of them. And indeed some modern scholars seem to have made the same assumption (see Dict. of Ant.).",
                "§ 39. τῶν … μελλόντων. In support of the translation somewhat doubtfully given in the text it may be pointed out that Philo evidently sees in Lev. 19:11, 12 something like the rhetorical figure, technically called “the ladder” (κλῖμαξ), in which at each stage the crucial word of the preceding stage is repeated. (See Ernesti, <i>Lex. Rhet.</i>) A similar example in Demosthenes (speaking of the process by which a quarrel rises to bloodshed) runs μηδὲ κατὰ μικρὸν ὑπάγεσθαι, ἐκ μὲν λοιδορίας εἰς πληγάς, ἐκ δὲ πληγῶν εἰς τραύματα, ἐκ δὲ τραυμάτων εἰς θάνατον. Of course in Lev. itself it is not a proper “climax,” as the πρότερον is not repeated before the ἑπόμενον, but Philo’s exposition takes that form.",
                "§ 40. <i>Unscientific method of proof</i>. The depreciatory note which Philo here puts into the word ἄτεχνος is very unfair. The ἄτεχνοι πίστεις are, as quoted from Cope in the note to <i>De Plant.</i> 173 (vol. iii. p. 499), “proofs not due to the artist’s invented skill, but supplied to him from the outside as it were of his art.” They are not opposed to ἔλεγχοι δίκαιοι but are indeed really more “just,” in so far as they cannot be perverted by the orator’s skill. In <i>De Plant.</i> the word was translated “inartistic” (perhaps better “unartistic”), and that or “unartificial” is the equivalent usually given. But “unscientific” seems to me in the usual English usage to come nearer to the meaning (or perhaps “non-scientific,” though I have kept the “un-” as giving something of Philo’s depreciatory note).",
                "§ 40. (Text of φύσει ἀγαθὸν καὶ θεῖον ὄνομα, etc.) As stated in the footnote Cohn expelled ἀγαθὸν καὶ on the grounds (1) that ἀγαθόν is an unsuitable adjective in this context, (2) that the fairly obvious corrections ἅγιον or ἀγαστὸν suggested by Mangey are ruled out by the hiatus after φύσει. This objection applies of course to ἀγαθὸν also.",
                "In a note in vol. vii. p. 620 I said that I did not know how far Cohn’s argument that a certain reading was unacceptable on account of the hiatus was valid and that Cohn did not anywhere formulate his doctrine. Since then I have got more information originally through Cumont’s edition of the <i>De Aeternitate</i>, Prol., p. xx. Cumont refers to a publication by J. Jessen in a <i>Festschrift</i> to Hermann Sauppe entitled <i>De elocutione Philonis Alexandrini</i> (1889). Jessen’s article is largely occupied in showing that Philo uses μέχρι or ἄχρι according as a vowel or consonant precedes. But towards the end he discusses hiatus in general from a study of the <i>De Opificio</i> and concludes that it is only admitted when (<i>a</i>) Philo is quoting scripture or another writer such as Plato, (<i>b</i>) when any stop, even a comma, intervenes, (<i>c</i>) in familiar conjunctions of words forming a single phrase such as ἐτήσιοι ὧραι, (<i>d</i>) after the article, or the relative pronoun or prepositions or καί, μή, τι, ὅτι, etc. This last class means, I suppose, the little common words which recur so frequently that the writer would be hampered if he always had to follow with a consonantal word. Cumont finds that this rule also applies to the <i>De Aet.</i>, the genuineness of which he is supporting.",
                "Jessen however admitted that in the <i>De Op.</i> there was a certain residuum of cases, where the hiatus had no such excuse, and Cumont said the same of the <i>De Aet.</i>, and probably an examination of the other treatises would give the same result. Most of those quoted by Jessen and Cumont are capable of emendation, sometimes easily, sometimes only with some straining. As a matter of fact I observe that Cohn, who had Jessen’s work before him, left all but one of these cases of hiatus as they stand in the MSS. in his own edition.",
                "The real question is whether Philo put the hiatus on the same footing as a grammatical error, or whether he thought it a thing to be avoided generally, but not if the avoidance hampered his expression in any way. I should be inclined to take the second view and hold that while a hiatus may justly increase suspicion of a reading to which there are other objections, it does not in itself create a fatal or even a very serious objection. In the case under discussion I do not think that the expulsion of ἀγαθὸν καὶ is justified, particularly as the same hiatus after φύσει occurs elsewhere (ἑβδομάδος φύσει οἰκεῖα, <i>Leg. All.</i> i. 16), where neither is any easy emendation possible nor has Cohn or any other editor raised any objection.",
                "As for the first objection, it may be granted that as ἀγαθός when applied to God regularly connotes His beneficence, ἅγιον would be more appropriate here. But it is going too far to call it unsuitable. It is applied to the Divine Name in Ps. 53(54):6.",
                "§ 49. Heinemann refers on this passage to Plato, <i>Ion</i> 534. Here and in the parallels, <i>Spec. Leg.</i> i. 65 and <i>Quis Rerum</i> 265 f., Philo may have had in mind this passage, particularly διὰ ταῦτα δὲ ὁ θεὸς ἐξαιρούμενος τούτων (<i>i.e.</i> “poets”) τὸν νοῦν τούτοις χρῆται ὑπηρέταις καὶ τοῖς μάντεσι τοῖς θείοις … ἀλλʼ ὁ θεὸς αὐτός ἐστιν ὁ λέγων, διὰ τουτῶν δὲ φθέγγεται πρὸς ἡμᾶς. But Heinemann goes much too far, I think, in saying that this conception is derived (“entlehnten”) from Plato. The idea of the prophet as God’s mouthpiece is self-evident throughout the prophetical books, and the most striking point in Philo’s imagery here and in <i>Quis Rerum</i>, that the prophet is the musical instrument on which God plays, does not come so far as I know from Plato, at any rate not from this passage in the <i>Ion.</i>",
                "§ 52. ὁλοστὸν. Stephanus gives for this word “integer totus,” Hesychius ὅλως ὡς ἔστιν (what does that mean exactly?) and L. and S. old and revised merely repeat this statement or part of it. It is a mis-statement to say that it is only known from Hesychius. It is found here in the MSS. of Philo in a passage the genuineness of which was not questioned till lately, but was overlooked by the lexicographers, who conceivably may have overlooked the word elsewhere. In fact it has the advantage over several other words only quoted from Philo that it has the support of Hesychius. But the formation is odd. If formed like other words in -στός, the ordinals and ὀλιγοστός, πολλοστός, it should be “one out of a whole”: a further difficulty here is that it seems to be used as a substantive, which is not the case, so far as I know, with the other words in -στός. I am inclined to think that the writer of the clause, whether Philo or another, actually wrote as Mangey suggests ὅλως αὑτὸν, which, as he says, would easily pass by abbreviation into ὁλοστὸν.",
                "§ 54. (Last sentence.) Heinemann remarks on these words that both the expression and the thought are derived from the Stoics, who, while combatting the sceptical doctrine that certain knowledge was unattainable and ἐποχή was universally necessary (<i>cf.</i> the sceptical sections in <i>De Ebr.</i> 171–205), allowed that there were cases where for want of evidence ἐποχή was necessary. <i>Cf</i>. <i>S.V.F.</i> ii. 121 πᾶς δογματικὸς ἔν τισιν ἐπέχειν εἴωθεν, ἤτοι παρὰ γνώμης ἀσθένειαν ἢ παρὰ πραγμάτων ἀσάφειαν, ἢ παρὰ τὴν τῶν λόγων ἰσοσθένειαν. ἐπέχειν and ἐποχή are the accepted technical terms in this sense, but need such a commonsense observation as that, when two things are equal, you cannot decide in favour of either, be necessarily traced to Stoic sources?",
                "§§ 63 ff. These sections have a close parallel in Plato, <i>Laws</i> 955 C–D “those who serve their country ought to serve without receiving gifts, and there ought to be no excusing or approving the saying ‘Men should receive gifts as the reward of good but not of evil deeds’—for to know what is good and to persevere in what we know is no easy matter. The safest course is to obey the law, which says ‘Do no service for a bribe’ ” (Jowett). That Philo had Plato in mind is made more probable by his introduction of another Platonic word ἡμιμόχθηροι, <i>Rep.</i> 352, used to describe the half-way house in injustice.",
                "§ 64. <i>Awarder</i> (or <i>umpire</i>) <i>of justice</i>. Heinemann may be right in regarding this as a direct quotation from Aristotle. Philo however also knew the expression βραβεύειν τὰ δίκαια from Demosthenes, <i>Ol.</i> iii. 96. βραβεύς, βραβεύειν and βραβευτής, originally applied to the games, easily lend themselves to metaphor and Philo has used the last several times in other connexions. But see on § 149.",
                "§ 73. <i>One of the men of old</i>. Mangey supposed that this refers to the passage in the <i>Theaetetus</i> of Plato quoted below on § 188. But imitation is not quite the same as assimilation, nor is showing kindness there specifically marked. Heinemann’s note is “this frequently quoted saying was ascribed to Pythagoras and Demosthenes,” and refers for the evidence of this to Vahlen’s edition of Longinus, <i>De Sublimitate</i>, p. 216; Cohn gives the same reference. I am sorry that I have been unable to see this edition, but presumably the evidence is the same as or includes that quoted by Roberts in his edition of the <i>De Sub.</i>, p. 244. (<i>a</i>) Aelian, <i>Var. Hist</i>, xii. 59 “Pythagoras said that the two best gifts of the gods to men were speaking the truth and showing kindness (τό τε ἀληθεύειν καὶ τὸ εὐεργετεῖν), and he added that both resembled the works of the gods.” (<i>b</i>) Arsen, <i>Viol.</i> 189 “Demosthenes, being asked what man has like God, said ‘showing kindness and speaking the truth.’ ”",
                "§ 85. ἔρως. This is a word for which there is no real equivalent in English when the context does not allow it, as no doubt it often does, to be rendered by the single word “love.” The phrase “sexual love” is not attractive, and does not cover the whole of the Greek conception. The Stoic definition of ἔρως as one of the seven different forms of ἐπιθυμία, Diog. Laert. vii. 113, is ἐπιθυμία τις οὐχὶ περὶ τοὺς σπουδαίους· ἔστι γὰρ ἐπιβολὴ φιλοποιίας διὰ κάλλος ἐμφαινόμενον, which Hicks translates “a craving from which good men are free, for it is an effort to win affection due to the visible presence of beauty.” An interesting study of the four words στοργή, ἔρως, φιλεῖν, ἀγαπᾶν, particularly as used by Plato and Aristotle, is given in an Appendix to Sandys’s edition of Aristot. <i>Rhet.</i>, vol. i.",
                "§ 104. μακρόθεν. As Heinemann, Mangey and Cohn generally give quite a different sense here and elsewhere from myself to this adverb and πόρρωθεν, I take the opportunity of collecting the passages I have noted in this book and the preceding and the <i>De Virtutibus</i>. In nearly all the clear intention is to show that the injunction actually given leads on to another principle of a higher kind, which I have generally translated by the adverb “indirectly” or “by implication,” on which see below.",

                "Cohn gives this well, “zieht durchaus die weitere Lehre”; Mangey “inde dixit rationalibus potiorem curam inpendere.” To these may be added <i>De Virt.</i> 151 τὸ μέλλον ὥσπερ ἀπὸ σκοπῆς μακρόθεν … καθορᾶσθαι, where the same phrase is used as in iii. 48, but has no reference to Moses’ teaching. <i>Cf.</i> also <i>De Virt.</i> 129.",
                "While taking the adverbs in an intensive sense “to keep far away” will suit (7) and perhaps (2, 4, 6), if the adverbs in -θεν can bear this sense, which seems to me doubtful, it is hardly compatible with ἀπειπεῖν (3), or ἀνακοπὴν ἐργάζεσθαι (5), or ἐπισχεῖν (9), and quite impossible with σωφρονίζειν (1), and ἀναδιδάσκειν (8, 10). It is clear to me that throughout, as indicated by (1), both adverbs express Philo’s conception of the Law as a code in which those who have eyes to see may discern other lessons <i>far away</i> from the primary and literal. I do not feel that the translation “indirectly” or “implicitly” is at all adequate. “A lesson reaching far beyond the actual words” would express the meaning better, but be too heavy a rendering for this single word.",
                "§ 106. (Dividing the hoof.) In this treatise the phrase is used of ethical questions only and signifies the distinguishing of the desirable from the undesirable. In <i>De Agr.</i> 131–145 the treatment is somewhat different. In § 133 as here it is taken to mean distinguishing the beneficial from the injurious, but as the discussion proceeds it is applied to analysis and distinction in the arts and sciences—grammar, music and logic. The sophists in fact are represented by the pig, because although they divide the hoof they do not chew the cud.",
                "As Philo’s interpretation of διχηλεῖν or something like it appears in the letter of Aristeas 150, which though of uncertain date is by general agreement considered to be earlier than Philo, it is not altogether original with him. As to whether it was accepted later, I have no information as far as Rabbinism is concerned. Heinemann’s silence in <i>Bildung</i> would suggest that it was not. But there is an interesting passage in the <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>, where Faithful discoursing about Talkative says that he reminds him of Moses’ saying that the clean beast must both chew the cud and part the hoof. “The hare cheweth the cud, but yet is unclean because he parteth not the hoof. And this truly resembles Talkative. He cheweth the cud, he seeketh knowledge; he cheweth upon the word; but he divideth not the hoof; he parteth not with the way of sinners; but as the hare, retaineth the foot of a dog or bear, and therefore he is unclean.” This is not very different from Philo’s interpretation. Is Bunyan here following a tradition of the Christian pulpit? Christian’s reply is “You have spoken, for aught I know, the gospel-sense of these things.”",
                "§ 109. πολύχηλα. This word is not recorded by Stephanus or the earlier L. &amp; S. The revised L. &amp; S., citing this passage, erroneously gives it as “dividing the hoof, opposed to μονώνυχα.”",
                "§ 113. <i>Cormorant</i>. αἴθυια (“sea-gull”?) is taken as a type of voracity with the same verb ἐμφορεῖσθαι in <i>Leg. All.</i> iii. 155 and <i>Quod Det.</i> 101. Philo is the only author quoted for this usage, as the other passage cited by Stephanus, Athenaeus vii. 283 c, is not to the point. L. &amp; S. do not notice it at all.",
                "§ 116. (Clean and unclean birds.) Aristeas 145–147 gives the same definition of the unclean birds and mentions doves, pigeons, geese and partridges as specimens of the clean. He also adds the moral that the prohibition is intended as a warning against injustice and tyranny among men.",
                "§ 128. ἀνδρὸς εὐζώνου. While εὔζωνος in a general sense is common enough, the phrase as a standard of measurement is not quoted in the Lexicon from any writers later than Herodotus (i. 72, 104) and Thucydides (ii. 97). If the absence of quotation reflects the facts, we may fairly set its presence here as a conscious literary reminiscence or imitation of the historians.",
                "§ 137. <i>Shaking before the eyes</i>. Though Philo does not actually use σαλευτά nor get nearer to it than σάλον δʼ ἐχέτω below, there can be no doubt that this is what he read. It is equally clear that it is a misreading, and his explanation is fantastical. But the mistake is not confined to him. The Apparatus Criticus in Brook and Maclean’s edition of the LXX shows that one MS. has σαλευτόν in Deut. 11:18, though not apparently in 6:8, and that the Old Latin version had “mobilia.” This is also supported by a treatise of Origen, which only survives in the Latin. The reference to this is not given. Otherwise it would be interesting to see whether Origen owed the idea to Philo and gave it further currency.",
                "§§ 149, 150. <i>Unwritten Laws</i>. Heinemann rightly notes the resemblance to Aristot. <i>Rhet.</i> i. 14. 7, where Aristotle says that on the one hand it may be argued that “the better man is he who is just without compulsion; now the written laws of right are compulsory, the unwritten are not.” This is the view taken here. From another point of view it is worse to offend against the written, “for he who commits offences which are dangerous and liable to penalty will still more do so when there is no penalty.” Our passage looks like a definite reminiscence and strengthens the probability that the phrase in § 64 is a direct quotation (the same can hardly be said of the allusion to ἄτεχνοι πίστεις in § 40). The distinction between ἄτεχνοι and ἔντεχνοι πίστεις, though originating with Aristotle, runs through the whole of later rhetoric and must have been “known to every schoolboy.”",
                "It is to be observed that the sense of ἄγραφοι νόμοι here is totally different from that of <i>De Virt.</i> 194, where see note <i>b.</i>",
                "§ 158. (Footnotes <i>b</i> and <i>c.</i>) In <i>De Agr.</i> 84 ff. Philo takes ἵππον, which he here paraphrases by θρέμματα, in its regular sense of cavalry and introduces his allegory by declaring that the literal interpretation is untenable because Moses would not recommend that a ruler should forgo such an indispensable part of his armament. <i>Cf.</i> note on <i>De Virt.</i> 28 ff.",
                "§ 160. Ἐπινομίδα. Philo has used this name for Deuteronomy in <i>Quis Rerum</i> 162, 250. As so applied it is not quoted from any other writer, and if the application is due to him it is a reasonable supposition that it is modelled on the pseudo-Platonic treatise of that name.",
                "§ 188. <i>Assimilated to God</i>. Philo no doubt here and elsewhere where he uses this expression is thinking of Plato, <i>Theaetetus</i> 176 A–B, which he quotes, naming the treatise, in <i>De Fug.</i> 63, “to fly away (from earth to heaven) is to become like God (ὁμοίωσις θεῷ) as far as this is possible, and to become like him is to become just, holy and wise.”",
                "§ 188. Σῶμα σῆμα. This play of words appears also in <i>Leg. All.</i> i. 108 in connexion with a saying of Heracleitus, from which “the editors of Heracleitus infer that σῶμα σῆμα was originally said by him” (Thompson on <i>Gorg.</i> 493 A). Plato himself in the <i>Cratylus</i> ascribes it to the Orphics. Heinemann refers to Philolaus fr. 14 Diels, which I have had no opportunity of verifying. Possibly it is the same as the saying attributed to Philolaus by Clement Al. <i>Strom.</i> iii. 17 a ἁ ψυχὰ τῷ σώματι συνέξευκται καὶ καθάπερ ἐν σάματι τούτῳ τέθαπται.",
                "§ 190. (Footnote <i>a.</i>) According to Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> iv. 218, this court of appeal consists of the high priest, the Prophet and the council of elders. Is there some connexion between this inclusion of the Prophet and Philo’s insistence in § 192 on the prophetic character of the true priest?",
                "§ 191. νηφάλια θύειν. This use of the neuter accusative plural is too well attested in Philo (see footnote) to be disposed of by correction to -ους. But the usage is strange and calls for more explanation than I can give with any confidence. May we suppose that in the wineless offerings to various deities the abstention of the offerer was felt to be an essential element (<i>cf.</i> νήφων ἀοίνοις, Soph. <i>O.C.</i> 100), and so the phrase acquired this personal meaning? Two passages quoted by Stephanus from Plutarch suggest something of the kind, <i>Mor.</i> 464 C ἀμεθύστους καὶ ἀοίνους διαγαγεῖν, ὥσπερ νηφάλια καὶ μελίσπονδα θύοντα, and 132 E αὐτῷ τῷ Διονύσῳ πολλάκις νηφάλια θύομεν ἐθιζόμενοι μὴ ζητεῖν ἀεὶ τὸν ἄκρατον.",
                "§ 193. <i>Market-controllers</i>. “Agoranomi existed both at Athens and Sparta, and, as inscriptions prove in almost every Greek state, … they regulated the price and quantity of all things which were brought into the market and punished all persons convicted of cheating, especially by false weights and measures.” (Dict. of Ant.)",
                "§ 199. (ἀδικοπραγεῖν.) Stephanas quotes five examples of this word, one from Plutarch, the other four all from Philo. Of these one as Stephanus has it, and as it stands in Mangey’s text, is transitive, viz. <i>Spec. Leg.</i> iii. 182 ἐὰν περὶ τὰς οὐσίας ἀδικοπραγῶσι τὸν πλησίον, and so the majority of MSS. F however has τῶν πλησίον and S apparently τῶν πλησίων. I feel no doubt that Cohn is right in following F. The corruption of τῶν to τὸν to bring it into supposed agreement with πλησίον is very natural.",
                "The converse δικαιοπραγεῖν is commoner or at least is cited from a much greater range of authors and seems to be always intransitive.",
                "§ 231. (Footnote <i>c.</i>) For this Pythagorean thought see Zeller, <i>Presocratic Philosophy</i> (Eng. trans.), vol. i. pp. 420 f. τῆς δικαιοσύνης ἴδιον … το ἴσον, and the statement “that the first square number (ἰσάκις ἴσον), <i>i.e.</i> four or nine, is justice.” So in <i>De Plant.</i> 122 the saying “that equality is the mother of justice” is connected with the equality of the sides of a square.",
                "§ 237. <i>Democracy … the best of constitutions</i>. Democracy is equated here to ἰσότης, <i>cf.</i> <i>De Conf. 108</i>, “which honours equality and has law and justice for its rulers.” There it is opposed to mob rule, ὀχλοκρατία, and so also <i>De Agr.</i> 45 and <i>De Virt.</i> 180, but in <i>De Abr.</i> 242 to tyranny, while in <i>Quod Deus</i> 176 we have the curious idea that the world is a democracy because each nation in its turn gets supremacy. From all this one can gather little more than a vague idea of order, justice and a government under which every one receives the rights and duties for which he is best fitted.",
                "On the puzzling question how Philo comes to apply to this ideal constitution the name of democracy repeated so emphatically six times (see note on <i>Quod Deus</i> 176) a good deal has been written lately. Dr. Eric Langstadt in his essay <i>Zu Philos Begriff der Demokratie</i>, Dr. Martin Braun in an essay called <i>Social and Political Aspects of Philo’s Philosophy</i>, Professor Goodenough in his <i>Philo’s Politics</i>, <i>Practice and Theory</i>, have all dealt with the subject. Langstadt in the body of his essay gives a careful and interesting analysis of Philo’s conceptions of good government, conceptions which he may be supposed to have summed up under the name of democracy, but which only serve to make the name more surprising. For an attempt to explain the name we must turn to his <i>Nachwort</i>. In this he suggests that the name is taken from the Platonic or pseudo-Platonic <i>Menexenus</i> 238 C, where Socrates is represented as saying of the Athenian constitution as it was and is “one man calls it a democracy, another by any name which pleases him. In reality it is an aristocracy carried on with the approval of the multitude.” There are some good points in favour of this theory. Philo quotes another part of this description as from Plato in the <i>De Op.</i> 133, and there are features in this idealized picture of the Athenian constitution which remind us of Philo. A notable example is the insistence on equality of birth as the source of its excellence, and some more recondite resemblances are pointed out by Langstadt. But on the whole it is difficult to suppose that this casual mention of the name democracy can so have impressed Philo as the theory supposes.",
                "Braun finds the solution of the puzzle in the use of δημοκρατία as the Greek equivalent for the Latin “Res publica,” particularly in the sense of the republican constitution which was superseded by Caesarism. He gives many examples of this from Dion Cassius, and what is more important as nearer to Philo, from Josephus. His main point is that δημοκρατία had become the battle-cry of the senatorial opposition, though to say this does not do justice to his full analysis of the political situation both at Rome and Alexandria.",
                "Goodenough also takes this use of δημοκρατία as his starting-point. But he lays more stress on the acceptance of the term by the upholders of the principate. He points out that in the chapters in Dion Cassius 52, where Augustus is advised by Agrippa to refuse and by Maecenas to assume supreme power, while Agrippa extols democracy, Maecenas declares that a monarchy will insure the true democracy, and that Dion also remarks that the emperors were careful to build up their power by assuming democratic titles. So he finally comes to the conclusion that to Philo the ideal government is monarchy in its Roman form of democracy, kingship in its best sense.",
                "If one may take as a working hypothesis that Philo’s use of the term springs from this special sense, while I think Braun is nearer the truth, I should suggest a middle course between the two views. Perhaps we may say that reverence for the great Roman Republic, S.P.Q.R., had by Philo’s time raised the name from the disparagement cast on it by Plato and Aristotle to a position of high respect. On the lips of the opposition its meaning was unmistakable, and I think Braun might strengthen his argument by the fact that this opposition was largely Stoical, though not perhaps so markedly so as some decades later (see Arnold’s <i>Roman Stoicism</i>, pp. 392 ff.). But the imperialist would not allow his opponent to monopolize the term. He claimed, as Maecenas says, that the Principate gave a freedom which, unlike the freedom of the mob, awarded equally to all according to their deserts, and was, in fact, government of the people for the people though not by the people. Philo thus adopts this slogan or catch-word as Braun calls it and, as he well says, surrounds it with a religious and metaphysical halo, not caring very much how far it fitted in with his Platonic conception of the philosopher king."
