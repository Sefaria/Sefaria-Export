            "INTRODUCTION TO <i>QUOD OMNIS PROBUS LIBER SIT</i>",
            "This treatise is usually believed to be a youthful essay of Philo’s and we may well suppose that it belongs to a period of his life when he still had the dialectic of the philosophical schools fresh in mind and before he had settled down to his life’s work of interpreting the Pentateuch. Its genuineness has been impugned but on no good grounds. It has the testimony of Eusebius, who names it in his list of Philo’s works, and also makes a long extract from it, and it is also used on a considerable scale by St. Ambrose though he does not name the author. But apart from these the close resemblance in style and language, remarkably close, considering the difference of subject to the main body of treatises, leaves little doubt as to the authorship.",
            "The tract is an argument to show the truth of the Stoic “paradox” that the wise man alone is free. The paradoxes are one of the best known features of the Stoic system. The doctrine that all the gifts and qualities generally held desirable belong in the true sense to the virtuous or wise man is a natural deduction from the primary maxim that the morally excellent, τὸ καλόν, is the only good. Though they sometimes assume a fantastic form, as when the Stoics claimed, or were supposed to claim, that only the wise man could be a general or a pilot or a poet or a cobbler, the more obvious ones that he alone is free or rich or noble or beautiful, are really almost truisms which have been echoed by preachers and moralists in every age. But they put the doctrine in arresting forms which impressed the serious and also gave occasion for banter to those who observed that the life of the philosophers was not always consistent with their principles. Allusions to them and short explanations of their meaning abound in Stoic writings. The list compiled by Arnim (<i>S.V.F.</i>) contains some 120 items. But the peculiarity of this treatise is that it argues out the matter with a fullness and lengthiness unparalleled elsewhere, though since the writings of the founders of Stoicism have not survived we cannot say how they may have treated it. At any rate the treatise, whatever its intrinsic merits, has this interest that we have in it a specimen of Stoic dialectic preserved to us almost by accident because it was part of the works of an author whose treatment of the Pentateuch appealed so strongly to the Christian mind.",
            "The length and fullness become still more remarkable when we find that we have here only the second part of a disquisition, for Philo tells us in his opening sentence that it was preceded by “that every fool or bad man is a slave,” which is also mentioned by Eusebius in the catalogue named above. Since mankind are divided into free and slaves and also, according to orthodox Stoicism, into wise and fools, then if the wise alone is free it must follow that a fool is a slave, and one cannot but think that the two should be taken together as they are by Cicero. However, it is a fact that the slavery of the bad though frequently just mentioned is never discussed at length in our treatise except in §§ 51 if., where the argument that the wise enjoy the right of free discussion (ἰσηγορία), which is the mark of the free, is followed by the converse so completely worked out that it can hardly have been given in the earlier half. The slavery of lovesickness is also described at some length in § 38, but it is introduced there so incidentally that one would not be surprised to find it earlier. The main topic presumably was the slavery to the passions which is noted in § 45 and more fully in §§ 156 and 158 f. and is a subject capable of development to any extent. Slightly different to this is the slavery of the multitude to opinion, <i>cf.</i> § 21, and he may well have noticed also what Cicero gives as an example, the devotion to artistic objects. The description of a statesman who never cringes to the mob in <i>De Ios.</i> 67 suggests that something about the statesman who is in servitude to the people would be appropriate, and this again appears in Cicero. The thought that slavery in the sense of subjection to the wise is the best hope for the wicked, a moral which he draws from the story of Esau (§ 57) and from Noah’s curse of Canaan in <i>De Sob.</i> 69, may well have played a part. One thing we may be sure of is that examples were drawn from secular history such as the slavish fear of Dionysius or the impious infatuation of Xerxes to correspond to the examples of philosophical heroism in which this tract abounds.",
            "The great preponderance of secular illustration may be fairly regarded as another sign that this and the twin treatise belong to the youth of Philo. There are altogether only five allusions to or quotations from the Pentateuch. In this the treatise stands in marked contrast to the <i>De Nob</i>, which as I have pointed out elsewhere is really a dissertation on the twin paradox that the wise man is noble but is illustrated entirely from the Pentateuch.",
            "It is a consequence of this predominantly secular character that to judge from Cohn’s footnotes little use of the treatise was made by Christian writers with two marked exceptions. The first is the account of the Essenes in §§ 75–91, which is quoted in full by Eusebius, <i>Praep. Ev.</i> viii. 12. Eusebius has special reasons for making this extract. The other is the 37th letter of Ambrose, a large part of which is a kind of paraphrase of the <i>Quod Omnis Probus</i>. I have mentioned in my notes three passages from this which have some bearing on the text or its interpretation, but there are many others cited by Cohn.",
            "The following is an analysis of the treatise.",
            "After stating the subject of this and the preceding treatise Philo points out that such high doctrines are beyond the comprehension of the uneducated multitude (1–3) to whom they seem wild illusion (4–5). He gives a highly coloured picture of the way in which the ignorant react to the paradoxes that the wise and the foolish are respectively (<i>a</i>) citizens and exiles (6–7), (<i>b</i>) rich and poor (8–9) and says that they raise the same objection to the paradox of freedom and slavery which is here discussed (10). Such persons should like sick people put themselves under the guidance of the physician, that is the philosopher, and if they do so they will feel that they have wasted their past, whence we see the need of philosophical education for the young (11–15).",
            "Coming to the main question, after pointing out that he is not dealing with freedom or slavery of the body (16–18) and declaring that the true freedom, like true sovereignty (though this does not concern us at present), lies in following God (19–20), he passes at once to the main point that the wise man is free from the domination of the passions (21–22). What the poet rightly says of the contempt of death is true of the contempt of other ills, and the wise man will assert his freedom by facing these bravely (22–25). This is supported by citing the resolution shown by pancratiasts (26–27); also the wise man is unmoved and thus has the leadership of the common herd (28–31). At this point he seems to digress in order to show that some common conceptions of slavery are inconsistent. Such are (<i>a</i>) the fact of service, but soldiers serve without being slaves and the same is true of the impoverished free man, whilst slaves often have control of others (32–35), (<i>b</i>) the fact of having to obey, but children obey their parents yet are reckoned free (36), (<i>c</i>) of being purchased, but free men are ransomed and purchased slaves often rule their masters just as purchased lions intimidate their owners (37–40). The argument is resumed by showing that the wise man is (<i>a</i>) happy (41), (<i>b</i>) like Moses a friend of God and therefore free (42–44), also as law-abiding cities are considered free, so he also obeys the law of reason (45–47). Next comes an intricate argument on the ἰσηγορία or right of discussion on an equal footing enjoyed by the wise (48–50) and not enjoyed by the fool (51–52), and this is supported by a saying of Zeno (53–56) which Philo supposes him to have derived from Moses’s account of Isaac condemning Esau to be the slave of Jacob (57). A final argument is: “the wise man is free because he does right voluntarily, cannot be compelled to do wrong and treats things indifferent with indifference” (58–61).",
            "Here till towards the end of the treatise the argument proper is dropped and we have several stories of persons who exemplify the picture of the wise man given above. These are introduced by a discussion whether such persons are to be found. Some doubt it (62), yet they do exist and have existed though they are scarce and also hard to find because they seek retirement from the wickedness of the world (62–63). We ought to seek them out instead of ransacking land and sea for jewels and the like (64–66) and we should remember the text, “the word is very near thee in thy mouth and thy heart and thy hand.” The thoughts, words and deeds here symbolized will if properly cultivated produce good fruit (67–70), but we neglect this and consequently the rarity of the virtuous (71–72). Still they exist both in Greece itself and outside Greece, among the Persians and Indians (73–74), while in Palestine we have the Essenes (75). The long account of the Essenes which follows describes the innocence of their occupations (76–78), rejection of slave labour (79), devout study of the law, particularly on the Sabbath (80–82), threefold devotion to God, virtue and man (83–84), the last particularly shown by sharing house and property and providing for the sick and aged (84–87). Their excellence is attested by the respect shown them even by tyrants and oppressors (88–91). Passing on to individuals, we have the story of the Indian Calanus and his firm resistance to Alexander (92–97), and returning to the Greeks some examples from poetry and history, the picture of Heracles in Euripides (98–104) and, leaving demigods out as not fair specimens, Zeno the Eleate and Anaxarchus (105–109). Further, the dauntlessness shown by those who are not philosophers assures us that the true philosopher is still more dauntless. Among these are the athletes (110–113) and even boys and women (114–117), and whole people like the Xanthians (118–120). In these we see a fortitude which ends in their death, but there is also a fortitude in continuing to live, and so we here have a number of anecdotes of Diogenes, somewhat irrelevantly, since Diogenes was a philosopher (120–124). This leads to other stories of bold answering by Chaereas and Theodorus (125–130); after this digression we return to the fortitude which defies death, the example being fighting cocks who fight on till they are killed (131–135). Then there is another digression. That freedom in the ordinary sense is noble and slavery disgraceful is universally recognized (136–137) and examples of this feeling are given—the desire for political freedom shown by senates and generals (138–139), the abhorrence of slavery shown by exclusions of slaves from festivals and from the Argo (140–143). The remainder of the treatise is connected though loosely with the main theme. The wise man will scorn and have a ready answer for all attempts which threaten his independence (144–146) for, since actual slaves when in asylum often exhibit great boldness, the wise man will find a stronger asylum in his virtue (148–153) and will discard all crooked and crafty ways (154–155). It is absurd to suppose that manumission gives true liberty (156–157). The concluding sections (158–161) repeat the main doctrine that freedom lies in eliminating the passions and emphasize the need of education of the young to attain this end."

They in their desire for health commit themselves to physicians, but these people show no willingness to cast off the soul-sickness of their untrained grossness by resorting to wise men from whom they can not only unlearn their ignorance but gain that knowledge which is mankind’s peculiar property. ",

Let us proceed to the subject of our discourse and give it careful consideration, that we may not go astray, misled by the vagueness in the terms employed, but apprehend what we are talking about, adjust our arguments to it, and so prove our point. ",
                "[17] Slavery then is applied in one sense to bodies, in another to souls; bodies have men for their masters, souls their vices and passions. The same is true of freedom; one freedom produces security of the body from men of superior strength, the other sets the mind at liberty from the domination of the passions. ",

Let us hear the voice of Sophocles in words which are as true as any Delphic oracle <br>God and no mortal is my Sovereign.",

But the subject of the wise man’s sovereignty must be postponed to a more suitable occasion and we have now to examine his freedom carefully. ",
                "[21] If one looks with a penetrating eye into the facts, he will clearly perceive that no two things are so closely akin as independence of action and freedom, because the bad man has a multitude of incumbrances, such as love of money or reputation and pleasure, while the good man has none at all. He stands defiant and triumphant over love, fear, cowardice, grief and all that sort, as the victor over the fallen in the wrestling bout. ",
                "[22] For he has learnt to set at nought the injunctions laid upon him by those most lawless rulers of the soul, inspired as he is by his ardent yearning for the freedom whose peculiar heritage it is that it obeys no orders and works no will but its own. Some people praise the author of the line <br>What slave is there who takes no thought of death? <br>and think that he well understood the thought that it involves. For he meant that nothing is so calculated to enslave the mind as fearing death through desire to live."

                "[24] For he who with a mean and slavish spirit puts his hand to mean and slavish actions contrary to his own proper judgement is a slave indeed. But he who adjusts himself and his to fit the present occasion and willingly and also patiently endures the blows of fortune, who holds that there is nothing new in human circumstances, who has by diligent thought convinced himself that, while what is God’s has the honour of possessing eternal order and happiness, all mortal things are carried about in the tossing surge of circumstance and sway unevenly on the balance, who nobly endures whatever befalls him—he indeed needs no more to make him a philosopher and a free man. ",

                "[27] Much the same as it seems to me is the case of the virtuous man; his soul strongly fortified with a resolution firmly founded on reason, he compels the employer of violence to give up in exhaustion, sooner than himself submit to do anything contrary to his judgement. This statement may perhaps seem incredible to those who have had no experience of virtue (so would the other just mentioned to those who do not know the pancratiast), but none the less it is an actual fact. ",

                "[29] The law-giver of the Jews describes the wise man’s hands as heavy, indicating by this figure that his actions are not superficial but firmly based, the outcome of a mind that never wavers. ",

For just as goats and oxen and sheep are led by goatherds and oxherds and shepherds, and flocks and herds cannot possibly give orders to herdsmen, so too the multitude, who are like cattle, require a master and a ruler and have for their leaders men of virtue, appointed to the office of governing the herd. ",

Many too have the wives and orphan children of their masters committed to their charge, being preferred for trustworthiness to friends and members of the family. Still all the same they are slaves though they lend, purchase, collect revenues and are much courted.

Selling does not make the purchaser a master, nor the purchased a slave. Fathers pay a price for their sons and sons often for their fathers if they have been carried off in raids or taken prisoners in war, and that such persons are free men is asserted by the laws of nature which have a more solid foundation than those of our lower world.",

For these two are engines of attack against souls with no ballast or stability, engines mightier than all the machines constructed to demolish walls. ",
                "[39] This is shown by the way in which their owners court them, supplicate them, eagerly beg their favours, as though they were praying to fortune or some good genius. If they are scouted they go into fits of despair and if they just see a kindly glance they dance for joy. ",

Well then must we not suppose that if lions cannot, still less can the wise man be enslaved, who has in his free and unscathed soul a greater power of resistance to the yoke than any he could make with the naturally slavish body and all the vigour of its physical strength?"

For what greater misery is there than to live with no power over anything, including oneself? But the wise man is happy, ballasted and freighted by his high morality, which confers power over everything, and so beyond all doubt and of sheer necessity, the good man is free. ",
                "[42] Furthermore no one would deny that the friends of God are free. Surely when we agree that the familiars of kings enjoy not only freedom but authority, because they take part in their management and administration as leaders, we must not give the name of slaves to those who stand in the same relation to the celestial gods, who are god-lovers and thereby necessarily god-beloved, rewarded with the same affection as they have shown, and in the judgement of truth are as the poets say, rulers of all and kings of kings. ",
                "[43] The legislator of the Jews in a bolder spirit went to a further extreme and in the practice of his “naked” philosophy, as they call it, ventured to speak of him who was possessed by love of the divine and worshipped the Self-existent only, as having passed from a man into a god, though, indeed, a god to men, not to the different parts of nature, thus leaving to the Father of all the place of King and God of gods. ",
                "[44] Does one who has obtained so great a preferment deserve to be considered a slave and not rather the solely free? Though he was not deemed worthy of divine rank in his own right, yet because he had God for a friend, he was bound to have absolute felicity, for he had no feeble champion, nor one neglectful of the rights of friendship in Him who is the comrade’s god and keeps watch over the claims of comradeship. ",
                "[45] Further again, just as with cities, those which lie under an oligarchy or tyranny suffer enslavement, because they have cruel and severe masters, who keep them in subjection under their sway, while those which have laws to care for and protect them are free, so, too, with men. Those in whom anger or desire or any other passion, or again any insidious vice holds sway, are entirely enslaved, while all whose life is regulated by law are free. ",

                "[48] Further, besides these just mentioned, we have a very clear evidence of freedom in the equality recognized by all the good in addressing each other. Thus it is argued that the following iambic verses contain sound philosophy: <br>No part or lot in law has any slave <br>and again <br>A slave thou art, no right of speech hast thou.",
                "[49] Just as the laws of music put all adepts in music on an equal footing in discussing that art and the laws of grammar and geometry do the same for their respective professionals, so, too, the laws of human life and conduct create a similar equality between those who are proficient in life-matters. ",
                "[50] But the good are all proficient in such matters, because their proficiency embraces the whole of nature. Some of the good are admittedly free, and, therefore, all who enjoy the right to address them on an equal footing are free also. Consequently none of the good is a slave but all are free."

The laws of music, of grammar, of art in general, do not put the unmusical, the illiterate, the inartistic in general on an equal footing in discussion with the musical, the literary and the artistic. In the same way the laws of life and conduct do not put the unproficient in life matters on an equal footing in discussion with the proficient. ",
                "[52] But this right of equal discussion, which these laws give, is given to all the free [and some of the good are free]. And in life-matters the bad are unproficient, while the wise are most proficient and consequently none of the bad is free but all are slaves. ",
                "[53] Zeno, who lived under the direction of virtue to an unsurpassed degree, proves still more forcibly that the bad are not on equal terms in addressing the virtuous. “Shall not the bad rue it if he gainsay the good?” he says. The bad man, therefore, has no right to speak to a good man as his equal. ",
                "[54] I am aware that many people will pour abuse on such words and hold that Zeno’s question shows presumption rather than good sense. But when they have had their jeering and stopped laughing, if they are willing to look closely and seek for a clear understanding of the saying, they will to their utter confusion recognize its absolute truth and that nothing will a man rue more than refusal to listen to the wise. ",
                "[55] For confiscation of money or disfranchisement or banishment or the cruel disgrace of the lash, or anything else of the same kind, are small things and of no account when set against vices and the results which vices produce. But the majority, who through the blindness of their reason do not discern the damages which the soul has sustained, only feel the pain of external injuries, because the faculty of judgement, which alone can enable them to apprehend the damage to the mind, is taken from them. ",
                "[56] But if they could recover their sight, observing the delusions which folly brings and the outrages wrought by cowardice and all that the sottishness of incontinence and the lawlessness of injustice has done, they will be filled with ceaseless sorrow at the calamitous plight of the best thing they possess, and even refuse to listen to consolation, so vast are the evils which have befallen them.",
                "[57] We may well suppose that the fountain from which Zeno drew this thought was the law-book of the Jews, which tells of two brothers, one wise and temperate, the other incontinent, how the father of them both prayed in pity for him who had not attained to virtue that he should be his brother’s slave. He held that slavery, which men think the worst of evils, was the best possible boon to the fool, because the loss of independence would prevent him from transgressing without fear of punishment, and his character would be improved under the control of the authority set above him."

For some can only be brought to understand under the impact of a continued series of demonstrations. ",
                "[59] Thus the following argument is well to the point. He who always acts sensibly, always acts well: he who always acts well, always acts rightly: he who always acts rightly, also acts impeccably, blamelessly, faultlessly, irreproachably, harmlessly, and, therefore, will have the power to do anything, and to live as he wishes, and he who has this power must be free. But the good man always acts sensibly, and, therefore, he alone is free. ",
                "[60] Again, one who cannot be compelled to do anything or prevented from doing anything, cannot be a slave. But the good man cannot be compelled or prevented: the good man, therefore, cannot be a slave. That he is not compelled nor prevented is evident. One is prevented when he does not get what he desires, but the wise man desires things which have their origin in virtue, and these, being what he is, he cannot fail to obtain. Further, if one is compelled he clearly acts against his will. But where there are actions, they are either righteous actions born of virtue or wrong actions born of vice or neutral and indifferent. ",
                "[61] The virtuous actions he performs not under constraint but willingly, since all that he does are what he holds to be desirable. The vicious are to be eschewed and therefore he never dreams of doing them. Naturally too in matters indifferent he does not act under compulsion. To these, as on a balance his mind preserves its equipoise, trained neither to surrender to them in acknowledgement of their superior weight, nor yet to regard them with hostility, as deserving aversion. Whence it is clear that he does nothing unwillingly and is never compelled, whereas if he were a slave he would be compelled, and therefore the good man will be a free man."

And although by reason of his tender years he had not received the solid nutrition of the laws of Lycurgus, yet from his mere taste of them, he judged that death was a happier lot than his present valueless life, and despairing of ransom gladly put an end to himself. ",

This has been emended to ἐντὸς, but does it not rather point to a variant assigning a quite different and more obvious meaning to the maxim?",
            "§ 3. <i>Super-law</i>. Or “divine ordinance.” <i>Cf.</i> <i>De Op.</i> 143 νόμος ὁ τῆς φύσεως ὀρθὸς λόγος, ὃς κυριωτέρᾳ κλήσει προσονομάζεται θεσμός, νόμος θεῖος ὤν. In the same way the Ten Commandments are in a true sense θεομοί, <i>Quis Rerum</i> 168. Besides being more divine the θεομός has a wider scope and is like a general principle. So the Ten are θεσμοὶ τῶν κατὰ μέρος ἀπείρων νόμων γενικὰ κεφάλαια, <i>De Cong.</i> 120. It is a pity that these examples from Philo have not been used in the lexica. For though L. &amp; S. remarks that θεαμός properly applies to ancient laws supposed to be sanctioned by the gods, it cites no examples which bring out the distinction from νόμος. Stephanus too after quoting the θεομοί of Draco and the νόμοι of Solon, which may be merely traditional titles, only cites Plato, <i>Ep</i> viii. 355 B, where after an exhortation to set the ἀρετή of the soul above that of the body, and that again above money, he says ὁ ταῦτα ἀπεμγαζόμενος θεαμός νόμος ἄν ἀρθῶς ὑμῖν εἴη κείμενος, which points to a sort of distinction as that quoted above from <i>De Cong.</i>",
            "§ 5. <i>The puppet show</i>. Though probably this is suggested by the words quoted in the footnote, those do not mean what is stated here. Plato does not mean that the prisoners in the cave mistake the realities for θαύματα. The phrase comes in incidentally to indicate that the wall behind which move the persons who carry the objects the shadows of which are reflected is like the screen behind which the θαυματοποιοί stand when exhibiting their show. Elsewhere Plato uses the figure (<i>Laws</i> 644 D, 804 B) to describe human conduct, mankind being the puppets whose strings are worked by some higher power, a figure which Philo also uses, <i>De Op.</i> 117, <i>De Fug.</i> 46.",
            "§ 10. <i>Highly connected</i>. Or more exactly “highly connected on both sides.” Philo has ἀμφιθαλής twice elsewhere, <i>De Cong.</i> 132, where Moses is said to be καὶ τὰ πρὸς πατρὸς καὶ τὰ πρὸς μητρὸς ἀμφιθαλής, and <i>Legatio</i> 93, where Hermes, Apollo, and Ares are μείζονες καὶ ἀμφιθαλεῖς as compared with Dionysus and Heracles, presumably because Semele and Alcmene were mere women. This is a natural extension of the meaning in <i>Il.</i> xxii. 496 and Plato, <i>Laws</i> 927 D, viz. a child who has both parents alive. So here <i>cf.</i> πρὸς ἀνδμῶν καὶ πρὸς γυναικῶν below.",
            "§ 15. (The hiatus παιδείᾳ ἀναθεῖναι.) Cohn in <i>Hermes</i>, li. (1916), pp. 172 ff. propounds a theory that the hiatus here is justified on the principle that Philo does not avoid it between the verb and its noun or adjective, which are so grammatically connected as to form a sort of unity. In the same way he accounts for ἴσῃ ἀντιτιμηθέντες εὐνοίᾳ (§ 42) and φόβῳ ἐκκλίνει (§ 159), and notes similar examples in other treatises. On the other hand εὐτονίᾳ κραταιοτάτῃ ἰσχύος (§ 40), θεοῦ ἐλευθέρους (§ 42) and σὺν εὐτολμίᾳ εὐθυβόλον (§ 124) have no such justification. Accordingly the first of these remains “suspect” (though one would have thought κραταιοτάτης was an easy correction), the second is corrected to τῶν θεῶν, and the third has μετʼ εὐτολμίας suggested in a footnote. This new law of justifiable exceptions is a big extension of the principle laid down by Jessen and Cumont (see my note in vol. viii. p. 428), by which familiar conjunctions like ἐτήσιοι ὧραι are declared acceptable. There are no such familiar conjunctions in the instances quoted from §§ 42 and 159.",
            "Wendland in his essay on <i>De Providentia</i> written several years earlier points out (p. 146) Philo’s general avoidance of the hiatus in that treatise, but notes a few exceptions, ἀδιαλύτῳ ἑνώσει ἀρμοσάμενος (§ 3), εὐμορφίᾳ ἀγάλλοιτο (§ 15), ἀπατηλαὶ αἰσθήαεις, πάθη ἐπίβουλα (§ 36), and there are some others which he has not observed. He then makes a remark which seems to me worth quoting: “We must not forget that avoidance of the hiatus is a matter of feeling only, not of anxious calculation, and there were very few writers in whom this feeling was so finely developed that it was not exposed to fluctuations and caprices.” This is not quite the same as the view suggested in the note above mentioned, namely that he avoided it generally but not when the avoidance would hamper his expression, but it leads to the same practical conclusion. When the tradition, Wendland continues, does not present any difficulty or any other cause for alteration, the editor of a writer like Philo will do well not to introduce any alteration merely on account of the hiatus.",
            "§ 15. <i>New vessels</i>, etc. Cohn quotes Quintilian i. 1. 5 “natura tenacissimi sumus eorum quae rudibus annis percepimus, ut sapor, quo nova imbuas, durat.” The parallel will be still clearer if we adopt the correction “quo nova imbuas &lt;vasa&gt;.” As Quintilian in the sentence before has quoted Chrysippus, Περὶ παίδων ἀγωγῆς, it seems probable that the illustration in both cases comes from a Stoic source.",
            "§ 28. (Insertion of οὕτως.) Though not grammatically necessary it certainly appears to be Philo’s invariable usage when a comparison begins with a relative conjunction to introduce the main clause with an adverb οὕτως or τὸν αὐτὸν τρόπον. So in this treatise §§ 15, 30, 45, 49, 51, 130, 140. And so in <i>De Prov.</i> §§ 3, 6, 20, 23, 39, 40, 52, 55. If the comparison begins with the main clause as in § 155 the rule naturally does not apply, nor always if the relative clause does not contain a separate verb as in <i>De Prov.</i> 32. Otherwise I have found no exceptions either in these two treatises or in <i>De Praem.</i>, in which I have tested it.",
            "§ 70. <i>Wholefruits</i>. Or “wholly fruits.” In this digression induced by a favourite text, Deut. 30:14, and the favourite interpretation of mouth, heart, hands by words, thoughts, actions, we have something more akin to the Philo of the Commentary than we find anywhere else in this treatise. The meaning is that while in the natural garden the fruit only comes in the final stage, in the spiritual life all is fruit. As a matter of fact ὁλοκαρπώματα occurs only three times in our text of the Pentateuch and then only as a variant for ὁλοκαυτώματα. But the form ὁλοκάρπωσις is more frequent, occurring three times in Gen. 22 in the story of the sacrifice of Isaac, and also in Gen. 8:20, where Noah took of every clean beast and every clean fowl and offered them for a ὁλοκάρπωσις. On this passage, where perhaps he read ὁλοκάρπωμα for ὁλοκάρπωσις, Philo has a special meditation in <i>Quaest. in Gen.</i> ii. 52. The point of this is that the pure beasts are “sapientis sensus” and the pure fowls “intellectus cum cogitationibus in mente agitatis” and that they must be offered as “integer fructus.” The thought is perhaps much the same as in the stanzas of Rabbi Ben Ezra beginning “Not on the vulgar mass.”",

I find that the view taken in the footnote that the appellation is ἔτυμον because ἑπτά is akin to σέβας and οεμνός is thought to be a hard saying; and I am asked why it should not mean that they were called σοφοί because they were truly wise. I think that that explanation not only slurs the πρός but is entirely contrary to Philo’s use of ἐτύμως and ἔτυμος. That word in classical use is an epic or lyric word, in the ordinary sense of “true,” but with the grammarians came to mean the true or original form of the root from which other words spring, and thence the name “etymology” for the science of these ἔτυμα. Thus (<i>De Op.</i> 127) the Latin “septem” is said to be ἐτυμώτερον than the Greek ἑπτό because it preserves the original α of the etymon.",
            "As stated shortly in the note in vol. iv. p. 556, the examples of έτύμως in the index bear this out.",
            "Names are said to be given ἐτύμως:",
            "(1) <i>De Op.</i> 36. στερέωμα to “heaven,” because it is σωματικός (as opposed to νοητός), and σῶμα is στερεόν.",
            "(2) <i>Ibid.</i> 126. φωνήεντα to the vowels, because ἐξ ἑαυτῶν φωνοῦνται.",
            "(3) <i>Ibid.</i> 133. παμμήτωρ and like names given by the poets to γῆ, because it is the source (αἰτία) of γένεσις.",
            "(4) <i>De Conf.</i> 137. θεός to God, because ἔθηκε τὸ πᾶν.",
            "(5) <i>Mos.</i> i. 17. Moses so called, because he was drawn from the water and the Egyptian for water is μῶυ.",
            "(6) <i>Ibid.</i> 130. “Dog-fly” from its persistence, because the dog and the fly are the most shameless creatures in earth and air.",
            "(7) <i>Mos.</i> ii. 105. θυμιατήριον given to the altar of incense, because ἀναθυμιάσεις τηρεῖ.",
            "(8) <i>Ibid.</i> 149. τελειώσεως to the rams by which the sacrifices were admitted to the τελεταί.",
            "(9) <i>Spec. Leg.</i> i. 88. λογεῖον to the breastplate symbolizing heaven, because heaven is governed by λόγος.",
            "(10) <i>Ibid.</i> 93. ῥοΐσκοι to pomegranates παρὰ τὴν ῥύσιν.",
            "(11) <i>Ibid.</i> 147. σιαγόνες to the jaws, because they shake (σείω).",
            "(12) <i>Ibid.</i> 183. πρωτογεννημάτων to Pentecost, because τὰ πρῶτα τῶν γεννημάτων are then offered. So also <i>De Dec.</i> 160.",
            "(13) <i>Spec. Leg.</i> ii. 188. “Trumpet-feast” to the ἱερομηνία, because it is the custom to sound the trumpet.",
            "In this volume, besides the words under discussion, we have (14) <i>De Vit. Cont.</i> 2, the Therapeutae, so called because θεραπεύουσι (“worship” or “heal”).",
            "(15) <i>De Aet.</i> 54. κόσμος to the world, because it exhibits κόσμος (“order”).",
            "Many of these are explanations of a term rather than what we should call derivations or etymologies, but they all have this in common, that the ἐτυμότης does not consist in the appropriateness of the term in itself, or of its application in the particular case, but in its relation to some other word or in (15) to some other sense of the same word. None of them suggest that a person could be called ἐτύμως σοφός because the adjective σοφός could be justly applied to him. The ἐτυμότης therefore I believe belongs to ἑπτά, and the words of <i>De Op.</i> 127 explain in what it consists.",
            "I should add that in the note, vol. iv. p. 556, I suggested that σοφός also was traced to σεβασμός, but this, I think, has no foundation.",
            "§ 74. πρεσβευταὶ λόγων καὶ ἔργων. Or πρεσβεύεται λόγων ἔργα? In support of the latter it is worth noting that Strabo xv. 1. 59 cites Megasthenes as saying of the Brachmanes (on whom see next note) ἐν ἔργοις γὰρ αὐτοὺς κρείττους ἢ λόγοις εἶναι. That Philo in his account of the Gymnosophists and Calanus had Megasthenes in mind is at least very probable.",
            "§ 74. <i>Gymnosophists</i>. What did Philo understand by the Gymnosophists? Is it simply another name for the caste of the philosophers, <i>i.e.</i> the Brahmans, or for a specially ascetic type among them and possibly other castes? They are mentioned in the same vague way as here by Strabo xvi. 2. 39 coupled with the Magi and the μάντεις of other nations. So too Plut. ii. 322 B eulogizes the γυμνῆτις σοφία of the Indian sages.",
            "When Strabo xv. 1. 39 ff. describes from Megasthenes the seven castes, of which the philosophers are the first, he does not use the term Gymnosophist or indicate any especial asceticism. Further on, <i>ibid.</i> 59, Megasthenes is stated to classify the philosophers as Brachmanes, <i>i.e.</i> presumably Brahmins, and Garmanes, by whom experts appear to understand Buddhists, and it is these Garmanes or some of them who seem best to exemplify the asceticism implied in the name of Gymnosophists, though nakedness is not actually mentioned. Again, <i>ibid.</i> 70, the Brachmanes are distinguished from the Pramnae and it is as applied to some of these last that we first meet the term.",
            "On the other hand Arrian, who also is supposed to be quoting Megasthenes, definitely says of the philosophical caste that as a whole they live (διαιτῶνται) naked, and when Plutarch (<i>Alexander</i> 64) applies the name Gymnosophists to the philosophers who had stirred up national feeling against the invader (§ 59), presumably he means the caste as a whole. I leave the experts to disentangle these conflicting statements. I suspect that the legend as Philo received it included (1) a belief that the philosophers were a caste, (2) that some of them were believed to practise a special ascetisicm, without aiming at anything more exact.",
            "§ 75. <i>Essenes</i>. This note does not attempt to digest the many theories propounded about the Essenes but merely to summarize what Philo says about them and compare it with Josephus. In <i>Quod Omn. Prob.</i> Philo gives the following account of them: (1) They do not sacrifice animals; (2) they live in villages; (3) they work industriously at various occupations, not military nor commercial; (4) they keep no slaves; (5) their study is on morals and religion, particularly the allegorical meaning of the Scriptures; (6) they pursue and exhibit every kind of virtue; (7) this includes refusal to swear oaths and ceremonial purity; (8) they hold goods and clothing in common; (9) they provide for the sick and aged. To this is added an account of their sabbatical meetings, but this does not materially differ from that given of the Therapeutae in the <i>De Vit. Cont.</i> and of the nation as a whole in the <i>Hypothetica</i>.",
            "Of these the <i>Hypothetica</i> mentions in much the same strain (3), (6), (8) and (9) and adds (10) that only adults are admitted to the order and (11) that they eschew marriage and have a poor opinion of women.",
            "Josephus’s account is given in <i>B.J.</i> ii. 8. 2–13, with some additions in <i>Ant.</i> xviii. 1. 5. It confirms practically all the points mentioned by Philo but goes far more into detail. Thus he describes fully the terms and process of admission to the order and also their refusal to take oaths in ordinary life and their ceremonial ablutions, points indicated by Philo only by the single words ἀνώμοτον and ἁγνεία. Interesting additions which he gives are that they regard the use of oil as a defilement, wear white garments, keep the sabbath with extraordinary strictness and show a feeling of reverence for the sun and sunrise which reminds us somewhat of <i>De Vit. Cont.</i> 27 and 89. Elsewhere he credits them with the power of predicting the future, also he gives us, what Philo entirely omits, some information about their doctrines, that they believed in the immortality of the soul though not of the body and in future rewards and punishments.",
            "(Sections 89 to 91.) I have not seen any notice of the historical statements made in these sections and this note must be regarded as a tentative inquiry. I feel little doubt that Philo is referring in the first instance to Herod, who, according to Jos. <i>Ant.</i> xv. 10. 5, treated the Essenes with special friendship and thought of them as something higher than human (μεῖζόν τι φρονῶν ἐπʼ αὐτοῖς ἢ κατὰ τὴν θνητὸν φύσιν). This friendship is traced by Josephus originally to the predictions made by the Essene Manahem to Herod, first in his boyhood when Manahem prophesied that he would be a king who at first would govern righteously but afterwards would commit crimes for which he would be punished. When he became king Herod asked Manahem how long he would reign and was told that for at least thirty years, but no other limit was given, which answer appears to have satisfied Herod.",
            "We have no other evidence, I think, as to how the Essenes were treated by any other ruler in Palestine. But we may ask who are these ferocious or treacherous potentates here alluded to. Apart from the wild statement of Pliny, <i>N.H.</i> v. 17 that the Essenes had flourished in Palestine “per millia saeculorum,” the only allusion to their existence in earlier times is in Jos. <i>Ant.</i> xiii. 5. 9, where he mentions them as existing in the times of Jonathan the high priest, <i>i.e.</i> about 150 B.C. But this does not of course show that they did not exist at a considerably earlier date, and Philo might well have had Antiochus Epiphanes in mind. One would hardly think that any of the Hasmoneans would appear in this light to Philo, though both Aristobulus and Alexander Jannaeus are credited with some barbarity. Archelaus at the other end, who also (<i>B.J.</i> ii. 7. 3) listened to the prediction of an Essene, would fit, but his date is too late, at any rate if the <i>Quod Omn. Prob.</i> is an early work of Philo.",
            "§ 96. (Death of Calanus.) This is described by Strabo (xv. 1. 68), who says that while the historians differ on some minor points they agree that he accompanied Alexander and when in his seventy-third year he fell ill for the first time he burnt himself to death in Alexander’s presence. Strabo adds that Megasthenes denied that suicide was enjoined by the philosophers, who regarded it as showing a reckless disposition.",
            "<i>Ibid.</i> (Text of the letter.) Cohn in the article in <i>Hermes</i> mentioned in the note on § 15 observes that it contains four instances of hiatus, which however need not concern us, as Philo though avoiding it himself does not trouble himself to correct them in quotations. Cohn would not therefore raise this objection to my proposed insertion of ἀρεταὶ ἡμῖν.",
            "§ 99. “<i>Burn me, consume my flesh</i>,” etc. I am rather surprised that Nauck, <i>T.G.F.</i> p. 525, lists this quotation as from the <i>Syleus</i>. Is not its juxtaposition with the <i>Syleus</i> in this one of the four places where it occurs sufficiently accounted for by the fact that Heracles plays a part in both? But the attitude which it represents seems very different from the boisterous behaviour in the Satyric play.",
            "§ 100. (The <i>Syleus</i>.) Who speaks the last four lines of the first quotation and the three of the second? Cohn, following Nauck, <i>T.G.F.</i> p. 526, says Syleus. Subject to correction from those who know the ways of Satyric drama better than I do, I should reconstruct the situation as follows. Hermes brings Heracles to market much as Diogenes is brought in § 123, and one of the possible purchasers asks the question whether he is φαῦλος. The auctioneer emphatically denies this, and then turning to Heracles says “Do try and look more like the sort of servant that people like to have.” Heracles then accommodates himself somewhat and is bought by Syleus, who finds out too late what a bad bargain he has made. Even if we assume that Cohn and Nauck are so far right that the last four lines from οὐδεὶς to ἐμβολήν are to be detached from the other four, I should still prefer to ascribe them to one of the ὠνητικῶς ἔχοντες, who declined to buy anyone so dangerous, rather than to Syleus.",
            "§ 127. <i>Theodorus</i>. An account of this follower of Aristippus about the end of the fourth century is given by Diog. Laert. ii. 98–102, who mentions his important book Περὶ θεῶν and his denial of much of the popularly accepted morality. According to Diogenes Laertius he did not take refuge with Lysimachus on his expulsion from Athens but with Ptolemy, who sent him on an embassy to Lysimachus. Another saying attributed to him by Cicero and others is that when Lysimachus threatened to crucify him he replied that it was a matter of indifference to him whether he went to corruption in the earth or in the air.",
            "§ 134. <i>Ion.</i> A contemporary of the great Tragedians and sufficiently eminent for Longinus to say that though he was faultless, polished and elegant no one in his senses would match all his tragedies taken together with one of Sophocles. Little has been preserved of his, and of the sixty-eight fragments listed by Nauck many are single words, few as long as this and only one longer.",
            "§ 140. <i>The Venerable Goddesses</i>. Cohn’s statement that these are Demeter and Persephone seems rather rash. He adduces Ar. <i>Thesm.</i> 294",
            "δούλοις γὰρ οὐκ ἔξεστʼ ἀκούειν τῶν λόγων,",
            "and though this line has been suspected as a gloss the preceding words,",
            "σὺ δʼ ἄπιθʼ, ὠ Θρᾶττʼ, ἐκποδών,",
            "show that the slave girl was excluded. But it does not follow that this was the only cult from which slaves were excluded. Though no doubt the epithet σεμναὶ θεαί might be applied to Demeter and Persephone, its regular connotation is the Eumenides. The procession in honour of the Eumenides is alluded to by Aeschylus at the end of the play and is mentioned by other writers as including the carrying of sacred cakes (see Pfühl, <i>De Atheniensium pompis sacris</i>, pp. 92 ff., a reference given me by Dr. Cook). Pfiihl accepts without question that it is this to which Philo refers.",
            "Also it would seem <i>prima facie</i> unlikely that the procession at the Thesmophoria would include men as well as women or that the cakes would be prepared by the Ephebi, though I do not know that there is positive evidence about this. <br> <br>"
