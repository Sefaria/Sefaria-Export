And I too shall speak over my part which Hashem has granted me, and with this we shall also understand that which is written (Psalms 34:13), \"Whoever is a man who desires life and covets [his] days in order to perceive benevolence, shield your tongue from evil\" etc. "

Woe to those who stir up the evil side, and do not guard their mouths and tongues and do not fear it and do not know that the awakening below depends on the awakening above, whether for good or for bad, etc., and all of them conspire to stir up that great serpent, who will conjure up the world, and all for the sake of the same awakening of slander, when its awakening is found below."
