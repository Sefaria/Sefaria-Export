            "[Concerning] the human being, it is proper/worthy/ra’uy that he should make himself  resemble /yitdameh his Possessor /qono, and then he will be [configured] in the secret of  the upper/exalted (supernal) form/tsurah, tselem and d’mut. For if he is alike in his body  and not in his actions, he makes the form [in which he was created] a lie. And they will  say of him: “A lovely form and (but) ugly deeds”. For the essence of the exalted/ `elyon  image and likeness is his actions. And what use would it be to him to be like the higher  form [in] the image of the structure of his limbs / d’mut tavnit eivarav, while in his  actions he does not make himself like his Creator? Therefore it is proper that he should  make [his actions] resemble the actions of Keter, the thirteen qualities of upper (divine)  compassion. ",
