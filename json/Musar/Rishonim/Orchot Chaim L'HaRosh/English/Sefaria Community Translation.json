            "Have faith in God with all your heart, believe in His personal providence, that way you will fulfill in your heart the true singularity of belief in Him; for His eyes hover over all the land, set upon every person, discerning the heart and investigating the insides. for one who does not believe 'that He took you out from the land of Egypt', or in 'I am the Lord your God' does not believe and this is not absolute singularity of God. This was the uniqueness of Israel from the other nations and this is the foundation of the entire Torah."
