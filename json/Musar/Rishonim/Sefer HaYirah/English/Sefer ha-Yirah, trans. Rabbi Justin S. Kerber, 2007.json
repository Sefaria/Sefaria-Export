Therefore our rabbi wrote precisely (דוקא) that he should not sit in bed in a lazy manner but before he gets up from his bed it is good or well that he should tarry a little in his sleep. (אוהל יוסף) Now it seems to me that where our rabbi wrote to sit (יושב) its meaning is is like “to dwell in praise” (יושב תהילות) or “so you dwelt in Kadesh (many days)” (Deut. 1:46) which is the language of delay.</i> but rather with speed and vigor let him rise immediately.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See e.g., Shulchan Aruch1:1.

Avot 4. (but quoting R. Yehuda b. Teimah, M. Avot 5:20); Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 1:1, Tur 1:1, 2:1, R. Moses Isserles (mappah, gloss on Shulchan Aruch 1:1). And the ב\"ח draws an inference that despite that he agrees about rising early, he should get up before the light of the morning.<br>So it is in the older edition, and our rabbi writes here three which are really six reasons which by their hand a man should wake up to conquer his natural inclinations to get up immediately: (a) fear of a man and respect due the man, (b) financial gain and loss, (c) fear and respect of the king to find favor in his eyes. And not to connect solidifying (?) that to write of the most stubborn of them to learn, how much the more so to rise immediately because of the King of Kings, the Holy One Blessed be He. Since just as knowledge has no conclusion, feeling has no conclusion, and each one gets up according to his own marker and level just as one who is a prince and a head does not connect himself to the accounting of fear and honor of man … but this should be understood… thus as written in Duties of the Heart, 30 accountings but for each accounting a man has it in his ability to reverse the accounting from one extreme to the other and to bring himself close to the Blessed Creator.

Negrin does not discuss the injunction to rise swiftly. However, he recommends that as soon as a man rises, he should learn the Torah portions of the Binding of Isaac (Gen. 22) and of the Manna (citing the Tur). Learning the Binding of Isaac, he explains will lessen God’s harsh judgment of us (in mystical thinking, by sympathetically linking us to the meritorious actions of our ancestors) and learning the portion of Manna will mystically invoke blessing and prosperity upon us, too. He mentions that it is not necessary to learn the Binding of Isaac on Shabbat because on that day God’s judgment is dormant and God feels only loving mercy (רחמים). Instead, one should learn the 10 commandments for the sake of mystically unifying the disparate aspects of God. For the same reasons, he recommends learning the portions of the Torah involving the daily sacrifices in the ancient Temple, as a way of symbolically offering them ourselves, and thereby mystically invoking God’s love.</i>",

Not like in <i>sefer ha-Yirah,</i>who will designate me, from language of witnessing. So far his words. And on the basis of this explanation it is possible to say what our Rabbi meant by [the apparent redundancy of] “inner rooms” and “dark house”: “will know me,” in the inner rooms and “wil see me” in the dark house.</i> for the whole earth is full of His glory. Before Him, the darkness is like light.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">AMEN (ה): The reason for this is that the man’s limbs hint at things of the upper worlds, as Job wrote: (19:26) “…from my body, I would see God.” Even the [sign of] the holy covenant [i.e., the circumcision] and therefore it is not fitting to reveal them, for the honor of God is in the secret of his limbs.<br>Negrin further comments on the issue of modesty (his ו’): the inner spark (הפנימי) is pure, but the outer side (הצד החיצון) is susceptible to impurity.

And for a woman, one hands-breadth behind her and in front of her, nothing.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">AMEN (XV). From here, one must be strict not to expose even his arm when he lays tefillin because all the limbs of a person hint at great and awesome things and there is not praise like modesty.<br>Once again, Negrin shows the kabbalistic idea that the limbs of a person reflect aspects of the divine being.<br>Negrin continues: When he sits, he should face south with his back to the north. The south is associated with [the sefirah of] Hesed, the characteristic of Abraham, as is said, “loyal love (חסד) to Abraham” (Micah 7:20 following Koren), and his back to the north, as is said, “out of the north the evil shall break forth,” (Jer. 1:14, Koren). And he should not sit between east to west, since the Shekhina is in the west and since everlasting memory לזכר בעלמא … is between east to west it is forbidden in whatever place may be. And by my opinion the secret [meaning] of east to west the crown of Tiferet, in order not to divide them, and it is enough to understand.<br>Makor ha-Yirah: But see, in the Shas (the Talmud) BT Berachot 62b, 23__ it is explained the opposite, (as we see in the Negrin ed.), in front of him two hands-breadths because of spouting urine. And behind him one hands-breadth, and so it turns out that there is no distinction between a man and a woman as to the matter of behind. But according to the edition of our rabbi goes the <i>Bet-Yosef</i> and the <i>Tur, Orach Chaim</i>, and the scrivener’s error has falllen into the books, in front instead of behind and behind instead of in front. Now the words of our rabbi do not mention but in the new printing (?) הב\"ח writes that since even in Sefer ha-Yirah the version is so, it is difficult to dismiss as a scrivener’s error, one falling in all the books but rather it is certain that the versions in the <i>shas</i> ibid, and distinguish between a man and a woman, it appears that as to the woman the stricture is greater. But in the new printing (?) it explicates a different reason: to choose the stricter of the two versions. And see in the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> in the name of the Latter [sages]. (אחרונים)</i>",

First, he says that the words and letters must be carefully separated because each and every word and letter in the Torah is a hint of the sefirot and the upper worlds. One should sing “Baruch she’amar” beautifully because it contains 87 (פ\"ז) letters, which equals “his head is most fine gold” ( ראשו כתם פז) (Song of Songs, 5:11). Such is Ashkenazi practice, established by the men of the Great Assembly (c.f. M. Avot 1:1) But it is important not to add to the 87 letters because it would detract from the kavvanah. They also say it while standing in all lands of Ashkenaz and Tzarfat. “Baruch she’amar” contains 10 “baruch…” statements, according to the 10 statements by which the world was created (i.e., “And God said, ‘let there be light,’ and there was light...”) He continues through the early parts of the morning prayer service, mentioning “kol ha’neshamah t’hallel yah” and “yishtabach” mentioning the Talmudic requirement to recite praise with song and melody before praying (the Amidah) [BT Berachot 32a]. He adds that the air is full of evil spirits and that prayer will protect against them. Later in this lengthy comment he says that when reciting פותֵחַ את ידיך in the Ashrei, one should pronounce ידיך as יוּדיך (“your yuds”) as the secret meaning of the two letterֿs yud (perhaps in the abbreviation of the divine name יְיָ) that draw down the great light and the holy flow into the world. This is also the meaning of the 3 letters yud in the [beginning of each phrase of the] priestly blessing. And from Ashrei through “l’olam va’ed” there are 613 letters, so that by reciting them correctly it is as if one had fulfilled all 613 mitzvot. The ten psalms that begin and end with “halleluyah” are compared to praise of a king. But if one cannot recite them all, he should say at least: ברוך שאמר, תהילה לדוד, הללו אל בקדשו which accompish something of the same purpose. Reciting shirat ha-yam will merit seeing the messiah, as when Israel first recited it they were crowned with the same crown that God will in the future crown the messiah. It has 18 verses corresponding to the 18 vertebrae in the spine [a concept seen elsewhere in Sefer ha-Yirah] adn the placement of “then Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the shore of the sea” next to “so Moses sang” hinting at the death of the nations but the life of Israel. He discusses the need to pronounce the letter Kaf in מי כָּמוֹךָ to avoid language of blasphemy or else it would sound like “Michah is like you, O God” asserting that the Biblical prophet Micah secreted away the pronunciation of the divine Name. Negrin segues into how responding forcefully enough to the prayers such as “amen” or “y’hei shmei raba” or “baruch hashem hamevorach” causes unfavorable heavenly judgments to be ripped up. He goes so far as to say that the letters of the prayers should be said with as much exactitude as the letters of the Torah. Eventually, he concludes by saying each and every letter is like a candle corresponding to one of the 248 positive mitzvot (the metaphor comes from “the commandment is a lamp and Torah is light.” Prov. 6:23)</i> [one] needs to separate them, this one from that one, and so with “ [adonai] elocheichem emet” and [such] as come out with these.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are siddurim that actually place stars over such letters to make clear the need to enunciate where the letters would run into one another.</i>",
