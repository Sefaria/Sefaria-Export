Then he recites the blessing, \"Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who has commanded us about the destruction of chametz.\" And he searches afterwards, since the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said, \"One must recite the blessing over all commandments, passing upon them\" - meaning before [them]. And after checking, he takes the chametz in his hands and places it in a closet or in [another] place that a mouse cannot reach. It is like [the textual version] we teach in the Yerushalmi, \"How do we do it? We cover it with a vessel. If he covered it and did not find it, I say that a [human] hand took it. If he did not cover [it] and he did not find it, he needs to check the house another time.\" And afterwards, he nullifies all of the chametz that is in his possession that he does not know about. And he needs to express the nullification with his mouth, with words that nullify it in any language that he wants. However, it has become customary to nullify [it] with the wording of the Gemara. And that is: All the chametz that I have in my possession that I have not seen and that I do not know about, let it be considered like the dust of the earth (<i>Kol Chamira...</i>)."

                "Our father Abraham lowered himself, so the Holy One, blessed be He, gave him greatness. And that is to the one to whom the Holy One, blessed be He, first said, “Ask.” Rabbi Yonatan said, “There are three to whom the Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘Ask.’” Rabbi Acha said they are four - Abraham, Solomon, Achaz and the messianic king. Abraham, from where [do we know it]? As it is written (Genesis 15:2), ‘And [he] said, “My Lord God, what will You give me?’” He would not have said, ‘What will You give me,’ unless He had said to him, ‘Ask.’ Solomon, from where [do we know it]? As it is written (I Kings 3:5), ‘In Givon, the Lord appeared to Solomon [... and …] said, “Ask that which I shall give you.”’ Achaz, from where [do we know it]? As it is written (Isaiah 7:10-11), ‘And the Lord spoke further to Achaz, “Request a sign for yourself from the Lord, your God.”’ The messianic king, from where [do we know it]? As it is written (Psalms 2:8), ‘Request of Me, and I will render nations your inheritance, your estate will be the limits of the earth.’” Rabbi Levi said, “The Holy One, blessed be He, showed our father Abraham, peace be upon him, the stars, the constellations and all the corners of the firmament, as it is stated (Genesis 15:5), ‘And He took him outside (<i>chutzah</i>).’ And did He take him outside of the universe? Rather it is that He showed him the chambers of the skies that are called <i>chutzot</i>, as it is stated (Proverbs 8:26), ‘Before He made earth and <i>chutzot</i>.’” Rabbi Yehudah bar Ilai said, “Five things did the Holy One, blessed be He, show to our father Abraham, peace be upon him, and these are them: 1) He showed him the splitting of the Red Sea, as it is stated (Genesis 15:17), ‘which passed between these pieces (<i>gezarim</i>).’ And likewise does it state (Psalms 136:13), ‘To slice the Red Sea into pieces (<i>gezarim</i>).’ 2) He showed him the giving of the Torah, as it is stated, ‘and behold, a smoking furnace and a flaming torch.’ And likewise is it with the giving of the Torah (Exodus 20:14), ‘And the entire people saw the torches and the sound of the shofar. 3) He showed him the Temple built and [4)] the order of the sacrifices, as it is stated, (Genesis 15:9), ‘He said to him, ‘Take for Me a calf of three.’ [5)] And He showed him the four empires (destined to subjugate Israel), as it is stated, (Genesis 15:12) ‘and behold, a dread of deep darkness fell upon him.’ Those were the four empires.” Rabbi Channan said, “He showed him the revival of the dead, as it is stated (Genesis 15:10), ‘Birds of prey came down upon the carcasses.’ He took the limbs and placed them side by side. And once the bird descended upon them, they came to life, as it is stated, ‘but Abram repelled (<i>vayashev</i>) them.’ And <i>vayashev</i> is always that they are scattered by the wind (which is only possible here if they returned to life), as it is stated (Isaiah 40:7), ‘when the breath [of the Lord] blows (<i>nashvah</i>) upon it.’”"

            "Strength seduces a person. When he sees about himself that, among his fellows, he is like a lion among flocks of sheep, he will trust in the power of his strength: If they rise up against him and he defeats them, he will not recognize the hand of God that saved him from their hand, so he will not hail and praise [God]. Rather, he will say, \"I did it with the strength of my hand.\" So his heart will turn from God and he will deny a major principle, as happened with Goliath the Philistine, who blasphemed the God of the Jewish war encampments.",
            "What is its antidote? He should put into his heart and contemplate how many strong men failed with their strength; due to the circumstances, they fell into the hands of weaker ones. [Likewise should one contmplate] that there is no strong man who can escape accidents, like hitting his foot on a rock, falling from the roof, drowning in a river, getting sick or other accidents that are similar to this, that have no connection to strength. So the only salvation and rescue for someone from them is God, may He be blessed, who has the salvation. He should attach a poem of accidents to his heart, and see that he has no protections and no shelter other than the supernal Shelter; and that he has no protection if he does not seek protection from Him. For 'who is the one and which one is it' who is as strong as Goliath? But because he relied upon his strength and trusted in his weapons and the copper helmet on his head and his spear, that was like a weaver's shaft, he disparaged David; that is why he fell into his hand. Whereas David who trusted in God, who was his strength, stole the spear from his hand and severed his head. And likewise did he say to him when he approached him (I Samuel 17:45), \"You come to me with the sword, etc.\" When a person looks at and contemplates these things and their particulars, he will place his mind towards Him and plant his spirit in the hand of the 'God of the spirits of all flesh,' 'who gives strength to men to establish power.' And then the haughtiness of his heart will bow down and he will lower his uppity eyes. But 'kindness will surround the one who trusts in God.'"
