            "1.\tT<small>HE</small> sage says, Wisdom is the means by which the wise thoroughly evince their gratitude towards their Creator; by which they become his true worshippers during life, and obtain a good name after death.",
            "2.\tNothing, says he, tends so greatly to render the intellect acute as instruction and wisdom; nor is anything more calculated to manifest true knowledge, than good conduct.",
            "3.\tThe questions of the wise are indicative of wisdom; affability towards mankind denotes intellect; and economy is equivalent to half a subsistence.",
            "4.\tWho is the most fitted to rule? The wise man who has succeeded to power or dominion, or the king searching after wisdom.",
            "5.\tThe wise and the just should fear no man; for the pious fear none but God.",
            "6.\tThe means of attaining wisdom once neglected, are irrecoverable; but wisdom leans to those who seek her.",
            "7.\tHe who strives after wisdom and morality, strives for a diadem of golden words and sublime expressions, woven by the poet to deck the brow of his dearest and most deserving friends.",
            "8.\tThe pursuit of wisdom arrests the commission of iniquities, and inclines man to despise this transient world, and to love the everlasting one.",
            "9.\tThe sage was wont to say, Wisdom is incompatible with the banquet and the revel—her presence is not welcomed there.",
            "10.\tHe whom the Creator has endowed with wisdom will never be dismayed in trouble or distress; for the end of wisdom is peace and tranquility, whilst that of gold and silver is grief and vexation.",
            "11.\tI do not vainly hope, said the sage, to attain wisdom in its fullest extent, but solely to escape the imputation of ignorance, a principle imperative on every rational being.",
            "12.\tHe also counsels his son not to be wise in words, but in deeds; for practical wisdom benefits man hereafter, whilst wordy wisdom extends not beyond this transient world.",
            "13.\tHe likewise enjoined his son to court the society of the wise; For, said he, they will award praise to thy knowledge; instruct thine inexperience; and their commendations will benefit thee.",
            "14.\tHe used to say, It is peculiar to the ignorant to be fettered by death,— wisdom must loosen the shackles.*",
            "15.\tWisdom, excites us to activity, and activity induces wisdom; yet it is less unpardonable to neglect wisdom from ignorance, than to neglect it from disdain.",
            "16.\tTo the question, How he became wiser than his companions? he replied, Because, I spent more in oil than they in wine.",
            "17.\tMan without wisdom, is like a house without a foundation.",
            "18.\tHe who is renowned for wisdom is regarded with respect .",

            "20.\tNothing is more useful to man, than to be conscious of his station, the extent of his wisdom, and power of perception; by these only must his words be regulated.",
            "21.\tDuring the pursuit of wisdom man may be termed wise; but the conceit of having attained it, renders him a fool.",
            "22.\tThe most precious bequest is wisdom; for wealth is obtained by wisdom, but is forfeited by folly, to the inevitable sacrifice of all.",
            "23.\tHe who humbles himself in quest of wisdom, will in turn be honored by those who seek it of him.",

            "31.\tScruple not to be enlightened on subjects of which thou art ignorant, so that thou be spared the blush of confessing thine own folly.",
            "32.\tKnow that the connexion of reason and faith is as that of the head and the body; for as the loss of the head necessarily entails that of the body, so does the loss of reason involve that of faith.",
            "33.\tMan's worth is estimated according to his knowledge.",
            "34.\tLet not the honour bestowed on thy wealth and power elate thee, for that honour vanishes when they disappear; but gratifying indeed is that honour elicited by wisdom, fear of the Lord, and morality.",
            "35.\tThe wise of the earth resemble the luminaries of the heavens.",
            "36.\tIt was asked of the sage: Who are superior, the wise or the rich? The wise, was his reply.",
            "37.\tBut why, objected the querist, are the wise more frequently at the door of the rich, than the rich at the door of the wise? Because, rejoined he, the wise know the value of wealth, whilst the opulent do not know that of wisdom.",
            "38.\tThe true believer only condescends to flatter when he pursues wisdom.",
            "39.\tThe first step to wisdom is silence; the second attention; the third memory; the fourth activity; the fifth study.",
            "40.\tIn the assembly of the wise be more disposed to listen than to speak.",
            "41.\tGod will bestow wisdom on those who truely revere him, and her outpourings will be conveyed from the heart to the tongue.",
            "42.\tHe alone can be considered wise who possesses the following three qualities, not to despise inferiors in their endeavours to attain wisdom; not to envy those who are wealthier than himself; and not to barter his wisdom for lucre.",
            "43.\tSeek wisdom even in the language of folly, but impart it unsparingly and with discretion, after the manner of the liberal.",
            "44.\tMan's most estimable peculiarity is an inquiring mind.",
            "45.\tHe who seeks wisdom in the garb of bashfulness, will be enveloped in the attire of folly; let therefore the votary of wisdom divest himself of that garb.",
            "46.\tArrogance diminishes wisdom.",
            "47.\tThe wise man continues: Wisdom is ever found accompanied by diffidence and patience, and the interrogatories of the fool by meanness and pride.",
            "48.\tTimidity is incompatible with hope, as is bash fulness with wisdom.",
            "49.\tIt is imperative on the true believer to repair the loss of wisdom, even through the medium of the sceptic.",
            "50.\tThe sage recommended his son, to be untiring in the acquisition of wisdom; For though, said he, thou mayest be subordinate to some, thou will prove superior to others.",
            "51.\tHow degrading is folly in old age!",
            "52.\tImpart learning to the ignorant, and receive it from the erudite; thus wilt thou acquire that of which thou art ignorant, and retain that which thou hast acquired.",
            "53.\tWisdom sought after in old age fades like letters traced in sand, whilst that obtained in youth may endure like characters engraved in stone.",
            "54.\tWithhold knowledge from the unworthy, lest you wrong wisdom; refuse it not from the deserving, lest you wrong them; nor requite the wicked according to their wickedness, lest you forfeit the reward of your Creator.",
            "55.\tObedience consists in our promptitude to observe the commands enjoined on us, and in abstaining from things prohibited to us.",
            "56.\tPoverty can never disgrace the wise man, nor will lust subdue him.",
            "57.\tThe sage who was once contradicted by an illiterate man, thus replied: Hadst thou been able to appreciate my words, thou wouldst have acquiesced in them; or had I not penetrated thy meaning, I should have condemned thee; but though thy ignorance merit reproach, I who know thy folly acquit thee.",
            "58.\tWisdom lying dormant is like an unproductive treasure.",
            "59.\tWisdom may be comprised under the following two heads: the wisdom of the heart which is of real effect, and the wisdom of the tongue unaccompanied by deeds; the one is the most useful, the other causes man to incur the reproach of his maker.",
            "60.\tMankind may be classified thus: 1st. the learned man, who is conscious of his learning; he may be termed truly wise—of him shalt thou seek knowledge. 2nd. If learned, but unconscious of his learning, remind him of it (that he may not further forget it). 3rd. If ignorant, and aware of his ignorance, instruct him. 4th. But if ignorant, and assuming to be learned, he is a fool, dismiss him.",
            "61.\tHe used to say, Pretend not to that of which thou art ignorant, lest thine actual knowledge should be discredited.",
            "62.\tNo virtues lead to more felicitous results than faith in God, honour to parents, love to wisdom, and attention to moral instruction.",
            "63.\tThe fool is prone to impute his faults to others; the votary of moral improvement will freely confess his errors; but the truly pious and wise will endeavour to avoid either.",
            "64.\tBe ready to accept truth from whomsoever it may emanate, even from inferiors.",
            "65.\tHe who would philosophize without wisdom, may be compared to an ass, which moves round the millstone, without advancing beyond it.",
            "66.\tThe sage observed, Pity the noblehearted who has fallen; the rich that has become reduced, and the wise, whose lot is cast amongst the fools.",
            "67.\tNone deserves our pity more than the wise who has become subjected to the judgment of fools.",
            "68.\tCast not pearls to the swine, for they are valueless to them; intrust not wisdom to him, who cannot appreciate it; for wisdom is dearer than pearls, and he who seeks it not, is inferior to the brute.",
            "69.\tThe sage observes: The exhortation of the wise, unaccompanied by practice, falls on the heart as rain on stone; and he whose words are at variance with his deeds disgraces himself; hence, words which emanate not from the heart can never penetrate the ear.",
            "70.\tWe can only be sensible of the errors of our preceptors, when we have heard their doctrines contested.",
            "71.\tOn being asked, whether the acquisition of knowledge befits old age? the sage replied, If ignorance be a disgrace, then must learning be an ornament.",
            "72.\tTrue dignity will never scorn the performance of the following four duties: 1st. To rise from his seat before his parent 2nd. To wait upon his guest. 3rd. To devote personal attention to the state of his horses, equipage, and property, though he may have a hundred servants to do it 4th. To respect the learned, so as to profit by their wisdom.",
            "73.\tThe society of the wise confers honour, that of the ignorant contempt.",
            "74.\tAvoid the ignorant who feign piety, and the learned man who is sinful.",
            "75.\tSeek wisdom with the avidity with which thou wouldst search for hidden treasures, for it is more precious than gold and silver. "

            "76. THE wise man was asked, Who is the Creator? he replied, To discuss a subject which cannot be comprehended is folly, and to dispute on matters beyond the power of conception is sinful.",
            "77. He used to say, A wise man chancing to enter an assembly of disputants, addressed them as follows: Your argument will never lead to a satisfactory result. On being asked, Wherefore? he replied, A successful result would imply unanimity of opinion."

            "79. He used to say, Evil words fall harmlessly on my ears. On being asked for a reason, he answered, It is from the dread of hearing epithets harsher still.",

Be brief, said the philosopher, and leave me, lest thy slander should be overheard by my menials, who may then compel thee to hear that which may displease thee, and repay thy slander with castigation.

He who is not resigned to the decrees of the Creator will be discontented with the course of this world; he who would reduce God's mercy to the mere relief of physical necessities displays gross ignorance; and he who envies the possession of another prolongs his own grief, and his morbidness is past cure.

To the question, What lends a charm to life and banishes sadness? the sage replied, A due estimation of the duties we owe to the world, and of those which the world owes to us; as the adage says, The world honours him most who disregards its vanities, and slights him who courts them; for the end of riches may be poverty, the result of rank degradation, and the consequences of ease disease.

Man can likewise be compared to one encompassed by ferocious animals and lurking enemies, and though he may elude some, he cannot escape all; he who views the world thus will not be elated at the happiness it confers, nor dejected by the mishaps it inflicts; as the sage observes, This world is fraught with grief, and its few joys should be regarded as gain unlooked for.",

            "520. The love of worldly possessions is a source of grief; lesson the one, and thou wilt diminish the other. ",

Man may also be compared to a famished dog, gnawing a dry bone, until the blood streams from its month, whilst, under the false impression of imbibing nourishment, it greedily licks its own blood. Thus it is with man engaged solely with worldly pursuits, and regardless of the service of his Creator, believing himself a gainer, whilst he is really a loser, for man is responsible for his deeds hereafter.

            "532. He who makes the service of God his chief pursuit, will enjoy interest without possessing capital. ",
            "533. Indifference to this world affords mental ease and corporeal repose, but the allurements of this world produce uneasiness of mind and physical disquietude; and a thorough conviction of God's providence knows no dread of privation, anxiety for sustenance, nor fear of man. ",
            "534. He who devotes himself to godliness will escape the cares of this world, and the anxieties regarding the future state. ",
            "535. The lot of human nature is perturbation, which crushes the bones and consumes the strength. ",
            "536. On being asked to state his circumstances, the sage replied, What can be the condition of him whose existence is perishable, whose health is impaired, and who is vulnerable in his imagined security? ",
            "537. Being told of one who had acquired abundant wealth, the sage inquired whether he had also acquired days in which to spend it. ",
            "538. It is related, that an Indian king gave one of his pages a mandate, with the injunction to present it to him whenever he observed him under the influence of rage.

            "541. The sage having been told of one who had died in the full vigour of health, replied, Can he be deemed healthy about whose neck death is pending? ",
            "542. The sage having observed a man dismayed, addressed him to the following effect: If thine anxiety be of this world only, the Creator has anticipated thy relief; and if thy solicitude be of the world to come, may the Creator increase it. ",
            "543. When the world is tested by the man of intellect, it will be found an enemy in the guise of friendship. ",

A sage, having been overtaken by sickness, was asked to disclose his affairs, to which he replied, What can be expected from one who sets out on a distant journey without provision, who is about to descend unattended into a pit in the wilderness; or one who is cited to appear before the king and has no defence— assailed by so many calamities, what can be his condition?

            "545. The querist, however, replied, But how can man remedy these evils? to which the sage rejoined, By attaining much for little; by a consciousness of earthly sorrows; by resisting the allurements of the lesser for the sake of the greater world—he will thus obtain twofold happiness.

            "546. There was once discovered, in a province of the Roman empire, a stone on which the following inscription was engraved in Roman characters: Son of man, act whilst thou canst, and place thy reliance on God. Let not thine unbridled passion induce thee to sin, neither anticipate care; for if it be destined in thy day, the Creator will bring it despite thy struggles. ",
            "547. It proceeded, Let not the accumulation of wealth perplex thee; for it is hoarded by many for the future husbands of their wives, and that which man denies to himself often increases the treasures of others. The man of intellect will derive information from these maxims and profit by them. ",
            "548. The sage relates, that there was discovered, on the gate of a ruined city in Greece, a stone bearing the following inscription in Greek characters: Son of man, were thy thoughts but directed to the fewness of days yet left to thee, thou wouldst despise the futility of thy desires, moderate thine activity, and circumscribe thy designs, lest remorse overtake thee when thy feet shall totter, when thine household and thine attendants will forsake thee, when thy relatives will abandon thee, when thy friends will neglect thee, and when thou shalt return no more to thine house, and thine avocations shall be beyond thy powers.

            "549. There was further engraved thereon: Son of man, thou pursuest the transient desires and fleeting pleasures of this world, and seekest to exact its wealth, and thus thou heapest sin on thyself and wealth on thine household ;—the former thou carriest to the grave, and the latter thou bequeathest to thy survivors.

            "550. A man said to the sage, Alas, how extreme is thy poverty! to which he meekly replied, Couldst thou but define poverty, thou wouldst be concerned more for thine own than for mine. ",
            "551. It is related of a sage, who dwelt in a province whose inhabitants were in great distress, but who remained indifferent to the public sorrow, that being asked whether he sympathized with the sufferings of his fellow creatures? No, was his reply. Being interrogated as to the reason? he rejoined, Had this scene appeared to me in a dream, couldst thou imagine that the illusion would have remained on mine awaking? Hence my indifference; for reflection leads me to regard every event in life as a dream, and him alone vigilant who forms a correct notion of human nature; for as the spark is the eye of light, so is the intellect the eye of the soul; and as the sun is the luminary of the universe, so is the soul the light of the body. ",
            "552. The following three inscriptions engraved on three tombs, were once discovered in the land of YASHAE. The first convoyed the following reflection: Must not the enjoyment of man's life be damped by the consciousness that the Creator will judge his good and evil deeds, and reward him accordingly? The second run thus: How can he taste the sweets of life, who feels that death may suddenly overtake him, remove him from power and dignity, and consign him to that dark abode which has been prepared for him? And the third was: How can he delight in life, whose lot is the dark subterraneous cave, which will pale his features, change his brightness, and consume his flesh and bones? ",
            "553. The sage observed, How many enter on a day which they do not see completed, and how many hope for the morrow which, alas! has not been allotted to them? ",
            "554. He continued, Could man but perceive the casualties of life and its sequel, he would not fail to despise both its wealth and vicissitudes. ",
            "555. Alas! said the sage, that man should weary to benefit his heir, or be anxious for that which is the inheritance of the grave. ",
            "556. Man! thy happiest position in this world is not without alloy; thou canst not enjoy honey unmixed with venom. ",
            "557. When success crowns thine efforts, and rumour declares thy wishes wholly successful, beware of impending reverses. ",

            "559. WHOSE cares are the most protracted? The sage replied, His whose daily requirements are his constant anxiety. ",
            "560. He who prefers sordidness to the dignity of contentment, or craves for more than he needs, or covets that with which God has favoured others, will meet with endless care and weariness that knows no repose. ",
            "561. A sage chanced to pass a certain man, and addressed him thus: How do thy worldly affairs progress? I diligently attend to them. But, continued the sage, has success crowned thine endeavour? No, said the other, but scantily. Well, continued the sage, if thou hast but scantily succeeded in that which thou pursuest so ardently, what canst thou expect in the future state, which thou so utterly neglectest?"

            "564. Better the grave than a fall to poverty. ",
            "565. The sage having been asked how he fared in life, he replied, How can one fare, who has lost his wealth but retained his luxurious habits?",

            "569. Of all the bitterness that I have tasted, said the sage, none exceeds that of soliciting favours. ",
            "570. The sage was asked what he deemed incurable. He defined it, The favour solicited by the philanthropist, and denied by the sordid. ",
            "571. Better submit to privations than solicit a favour of the unworthy, whose refusal but aggravates the humiliation. ",
            "572. A man thus addressed the sage: Pray to thy God, that I may not need mankind. No, replied the sage; mutual dependence is indispensable; but I will pray, that thou mayest not need the worthless amongst men. ",

A sage is said to have implored God not to subject him to dependence on mortals; but, continued he, should it be my lot to need thy creatures, grant that it may be the kind-hearted and liberal-minded, whose words are affable and sweet, and who will not vaunt in my presence of the services they have rendered.

            "574. The sage impressed on his son, To implore God not to render wicked men indispensable to his existence, for that is the presage of disaster. ",
            "575. He who craves for more than he needs or merits deserves a refusal. ",
            "576. Avarice engenders disrespect, rashness error, and over-circumspection loss. ",
            "577. To solicit from him who procrastinates, and ultimately disappoints, is like seeking favours from a lifeless image. ",
            "578. He who asks a favour of the niggard will reap disappointment and incur hatred. ",
            "579. He who seeks a fayour of the niggard renders himself worse by far than he. ",
            "580. The guest of the miser needs not fear nausea, nor will he require medicine. ",
            "581. The hospitality of the sordid starves the animal, and the stable will require no cleaning. ",
            "582. Tell to me, said a king to his minister, what you consider the greatest of calamities? Poverty, your liege. No, rejoined the king, I conceive it to be that sordidness which does not quit its followers until they incur disgrace. ",

            "584. The following words were addressed by a philanthropist to his friends: Should you ever need my favour, apply by petition, and not personally, lest your countenance betray the humiliation of soliciting.",
            "585. There is no equivalent for the degradation of seeking favours, though riches may be obtained thereby.",
            "586. Should the humiliation of seeking favours be balanced with the acquired gift, the former is sure to outweigh the latter. ",
