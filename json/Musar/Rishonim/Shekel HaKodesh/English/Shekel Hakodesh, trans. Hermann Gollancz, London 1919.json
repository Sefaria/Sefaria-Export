        "Prelude": [
            "O wise one, lay it to heart at all times, yea, every day, whether week-day or feast-day, sabbath or new moon, and you will find in ' The Holy Shekel ' every good quality, more precious than gold, yea, than fine gold.",
            "The object of this work is to make clear the proverb and parable, knowledge and counsel, the words of the wise and their dark sayings, the maxims of the sages and men of understanding, and their conceits.",
            "I, Joseph the son of Isaac, surnamed Kimchi, have weighed such in the balance of the Holy Tongue, measuring them in verses; I found them originally scattered here and there, some in Arabic, and some in Hebrew, and I have weighed them so that they may be easily understood, both as regards matter and language.",
            "I have, therefore, called the book 'The Holy Shekel,' collecting the proverbs and maxims resembling one another, into their appropriate chapters; there are in all 22 chapters, according to the number of the letters of the Torah (<i>i.e</i>., Hebrew alphabet). I have summed up the verses of each and every chapter at the end thereof, the number being contained in the similarly-sounding final words of the concluding couplet—one line of which sets forth the subject matter, and the other the number of rhymes, for the benefit of those who would be wise and understand.",
            "The wise will hear, and gather doctrine and speech, and the man of understanding will gain prudence.",
            "Now, I say, the vital soul (of Wisdom) is beyond the heavens in duration. Take millstones from the mountains of Intelligence and grind therewith the flour of Thought, and having made all due preparation for the sweet fare and rich repast, dress thy (spiritual) food and mix thy (ethereal) wine, so that their fragrance may be wafted as myrrh in every man's countenance.",
            "Regard these rhymes well. There cannot be compared to them ornaments of the choicest gold, even of the gold of Parvaim;—they are as rows of precious stones set in beauteous pattern of finest linen, a delight both to the eyes and the heart; I have arranged them in verse, weighing them not in the material balance, but balancing them in my mind, and this for the daughter of the son of Kimchi.",
            "The sparks of burning instruction glow as a torch: wherefore grasp them not with tongs but with the heart. Such verses are written upon the tablet of the heart of man; wherefore place thou them upon these tablets."
        ],
        "On Wisdom": [
            "Wisdom giveth life to its possessor, paying the reward of God for His service. By wisdom doth man acquire the days of this life, a goodly name, and honour after death.",
            "The rain of Heaven reviveth the seed in the hour in which it falleth; but if it fall too heavily, it will surely kill the seed. Wisdom, too, the wise man's heart reviveth; but the more it groweth, the surer 'twill lead to eternal life.",
            "Grieve not when thy wealth doth perish, if thy sense and honour remain; for why shouldst thou pine for the scabbard, when thy hand the sword doth retain?",
            "Who is meet to be king o'er the world, the ship as mariner or captain to guide? He who in all things is wise, is alert in deciding, enduring much in the search after wisdom.",
            "Why should he who wisdom gathereth, he whose hand layeth hold of truth, fear the bear, the lion, or adder, the poison of dragon, or aught that doeth harm? Despond thou, if thy good sense doth fail, such loss will never be regained; wherefore keep thy sense for aye; once gone it will not come again.",
            "The man whom God with much knowledge hath graced, need have no care for wealth or possessions; 'tis peace that marketh the wise man's end; the end of wealth is bitter, and sad remorse.<br>Search thou for understanding, seek wisdom, and regard not the issue; investigate her hidden worth, her treasure-store, and beauty.",
            "Verily, as a man without a wife is fear without wisdom; but wisdom without fear is as a woman without a spouse. Understanding without wisdom is as a bow without a string; but the man in whom these two are found will ever \"rise from high to higher.\"",
            "No man is accounted great by reason of his body's strength, but according to the brilliance of his mind, his wisdom, and his prudence. Not he who wanteth bread doth want; who wisdom wanteth, wanteth much, he lacketh that which sustaineth life.",
            "Lo, wisdom may indeed be found in the poor and forlorn state, as well as in the abundance of this world's wealth and power; just as this field will produce all wheat, whilst the one adjoining will bring forth thorn and brier.",
            "If 'tis wisdom which thou dost love, choose upright action, and hate rebellion. Know, wisdow is like a tree, action is its fruit. Wisdom (theory) to practice joined will lead a man to the day of his death; but knowledge, whence no actions flow (die with him), he leaveth no aftermath.",
            "Choose the seat of the wise, and men will honour thee for thy good sense, and praise thee in full measure. When thou wouldst err, they will teach thee; and whensoever thou wouldst falter, they will make thee understand, and direct thee in the right way.",
            "Knowledge and action are twins by birth, one giving glory to the other. Action without understanding, how can it be pure? And where there is no action, what reward hath understanding?",
            "I would rather leave wisdom through folly and lack of knowledge than, knowing what is right, forsake it in scorn.",
            "A man, wise in his time, was once asked, \"How is it that thou excellest all others in wisdom?\" And he replied: \"I did not spend that which I had upon the juice of grape or wine,—upon the midnight oil it was spent.\"<br>Truly man's body without wisdom is as a house without a base, as a field in which the thorn springeth forth in the furrow.",
            "Canst thou find a quality in man higher than that which recogniseth the measure of his position, so that when he speaketh, he will but speak to all men according to his rule and regulation?",
            "A man of wisdom will continue in the search for wisdom, seeking knowledge wherever it may dwell or be kept. There is no fool equal to him who may think that he hath finished and completed his studies.",
            "Obtain wisdom, and say not that thou hast enough to sustain fully therewith the position thou dost hold; for know, that wealth without wisdom will be lost, so that it ceaseth to exist, and thou mayest remain bereft of all things; whilst he who laboureth in the search for wisdom, and stoopeth to search out and find one to enlighten him, may on the morrow be in the track of rising higher; and, having been the tail before, may rise to become the head.",
            "Kings may rule the world, but the wise rule kings. Men of understanding find delight in their wisdom, but fools delight in their folly.",
            "Blindness of heart is blindness indeed; therefore incline thou the ear to hearken; for what availeth the open eye, if the heart itself be closed?",
            "How many men there are in the world who, as they make their appearance, strike terror; but when they once begin to speak, they are thought to be no better than dumb?",
            "There are men of stature and height, men of muscle, able to brandish the spear and the lance; but of what avail are they without knowledge, being altogether lacking in understanding and wisdom?",
            "If a thing be clearly good, let the man of wisdom take hold of it; if it clearly doth harm, let him move away from it; if it be doubtful whether it be good or ill, let him cast his burden upon the Lord.",
            "A man who with wisdom humility doth join, will find that among all qualities it standeth pre-eminent. So also will he be respected and honoured, who at all times joineth forgiveness with power.",
            "The hard-working student whose constant aim it is to strengthen himself in his studies, even to tread in the path of wisdom, is not likely to be possessed of two things—a greasy face or portly body.",
            "My son, if thou wouldst be wise, choose four things, and beware lest thou neglect the fifth: be learned; if this cannot be, be a learner, a listener, be law-loving, and be not too much given to bitterness.",
            "In searching for wisdom at the hands of the wise, be not slow to ask questions. Be not ashamed to confess, \"I know not,\" if thou grasp not the depths of a matter. If thou dost overcome this sense of bashfulness, thou wilt in time be recognised and esteemed by those among whom thou dost move.",
            "Exult not when men honour thee for thy wealth and power; for when thy honours flee from thee, then also will their flattery flee. Let it be most sweet to thee, if thou dost honour gain from that pre-eminence which moveth with thee, even when thou dost roam abroad.",
            "To him who enquireth, Who are the great ones of the world, the wise or the rich? Answer, He who carrieth about with him all that he hath, that which may sustain him, whether he cross the desert, or travel by sea.",
            "Then say, Why dost thou find it is the way of the world for the wise to be knocking at the door of the rich? Because the wise of heart, knowing the folly of the rich, make allowance for their poverty in sense when compared with their own.",
            "Cease from speaking vanity, and using smooth speech; and excite not thyself at the forward and crooked. Yet how good is it for man to have his tongue smooth, when he cometh to seek understanding and wisdom!",
            "Men of intelligence and understanding give five as the number of points from which knowledge and wisdom start, namely, Silence, Attention, Memory, Exercise, and Study; these form, as it were, the tower and wall of the edifice.",
            "There are three things which distinguish a man, and without the full possession of which no one can be called \"wise of heart.\" They are as follows:—Never to despise the man below thee in knowledge while he be earnest in acquiring learning; never to be jealous of the man who can command a richer home and a wealth of golden treasure; and never to ask payment of one whose heart is fully turned to the search after wisdom and knowledge.",
            "In enquiring for knowledge, ask questions, even though they give evidence of folly; but in keeping knowledge, guard it as thou wouldst guard the diamond, agate, or amethyst.",
            "He who is clothed in the garb of bashfulness while seeking wisdom, will on the morrow wrap himself in the cloak of folly; therefore rend this garment, and take thy stand at the door of the wise, as the pauper at the door (of the rich).",
            "If a believer hath lost some form of knowledge, let him seek it at the hand of whomsoever it be; yea, even at the hand of the sceptic it is right that its loss be restored.",
            "To seek knowledge and search out wisdom, travel every city and spot; for what may be regarded as of little account by some may be considered of value by others.",
            "Impart thy knowledge to him that knoweth not, and learn that of which thou art ignorant, and which thou dost not know; by doing so, thou wilt keep up afresh the knowledge which thou hast, and wilt continue to acquire information and learning anew.",
            "Knowledge impressed upon the heart of the young is like engraving on stone; but if man take to learning in old age, it is like making an impression on sand.",
            "Do not that violence to knowledge to place it in the hands of men who are the fools of society, lest thou commit a sin thereby; but put it in the hands of those who love its ways, and then life and grace thou shalt find.",
            "As for the wise of heart, poverty will never debase him, nor will lust lead him astray; his knowledge is like unto a crown placed upon his head, and it draweth him along the path of right. Take heed thou observe that which thou hast been commanded, even though it be weariness to the flesh; furthermore, deal not with the wicked according to his deeds, lest thy reward from God be lost.",
            "Beware lest thou condemn the boor who disputeth thy contention, when thou knowest his folly and senselessness; rather lay up thy wisdom for the man of understanding; for had the former been of the wise and understanding, he would have found delight in thy words.",
            "Verily, knowledge which is not published is as a treasure buried in the dust of the earth.",
            "Wisdom without action (theory without practice) hath its seat in the mouth; but by means of action, it becometh fixed in the heart.",
            "The man who, in spite of the knowledge he hath and the hidden things made clear, transgresseth the commands and precepts of that knowledge, is as a physician that taketh to his bed through sickness, and yet partaketh of food that is unfit for him.",
            "A man of knowledge, who by his wisdom is of use to others, yet neglecteth himself, is as a spring that refresheth the thirsty, itself seething in mud, mire, and dirt.",
            "Men may be grouped under four heads; consider them, and take a lesson from them. There is the one who knoweth, and is aware that he knoweth; he is wise of heart, learn thou from him. There is the one who knoweth, but he is not aware that he knoweth; speak to his heart comfortingly, and remind him thereof. There is the one who knoweth not, and hath fear, because he knoweth not; have pity upon him, and give him information. But as regards him who knoweth not, yet thinketh that he knoweth—the simpleton, shun him, and keep him far off.",
            "Say not, I know and understand with regard to some branch of learning of which thou hast no knowledge whatsoever; guard thyself from thus falling into a snare and trap, lest thou be suspected of ignorance even in that which thou dost know.",
            "When a fool sinneth, he throweth the guilt upon him whom his sin hath put to shame; the man of knowledge and understanding is satisfied to bear the burden of his guilt on his own head.",
            "He who speaketh as though he were wise, while utterly devoid of all wisdom, may be compared in his folly to the ass of the mill; day by day it goeth round and round, yet moveth not from its circuit, as though it were stricken in the feet.",
            "Should not thy heart feel faint when thou seest the learned falling into the snare of the simple, men of honour falling into disgrace, and wealthy ones becoming impoverished, having come down to the lowest depths?",
            "As for him who reproveth others, however clever he may be, if his own actions are not straight, will not his reproof fall upon the hearts of his hearers like rain coming down upon a stone?",
            "Attend to four things in person, and consider not thine own self too high, although thou mayest have one hundred servants at thy command. Attend thyself to thy guests; do the honours to scholars; show due respect to thy well-beloved parents; and look after matters connected with thy stables, even though thou mayest drive pairs and teams.",
            "He who walketh in the company of the wise will himself be honoured, and called great and noble; and thus he who joineth with the simple will be despised, and he who feedeth with the fool will be broken.<br>See Wisdom enthroned as a king, and Beauty as his lieutenant! Joseph's beauty it was which bound him in the prison-house; his wisdom it was that brought him into the presence of the king.",
            "Beware of the simpleton who is religious, and the fool who is ceremonial, also of the scholar who is without scruple; their hope will indeed be lost for ever.",
            "A wise man was once asked by the men of his time, Who is the Lord of the Universe, our Creator? He replied: It is forbidden to investigate such a matter; we are too weak in our natures, and would come to sin in the attempt to fathom it.",
            "Knowledge is as a tree producing goodly fruit; if good fruit be in it, all is in it; if this be not in it, what is in it?",
            "The best of possessions is knowledge; purchase it for thyself from those who sell it (<i>i.e.</i> teachers). He who hath this as a possession, what doth he lack? If he lack this, what doth he possess?",
            "The subject of study inscribe on thy heart, and repeat it twice and thrice until thou dost know. Exceeding much study may weaken thy sense, and the intellect becloud. The lamp, when trimmed, will burn on anew; fed with too much oil, it will burn itself out.",
            "Choose Wisdom as thy portion, so that it may be <i>for a standard</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">[\"<i>For a standard</i>\"=140, the number of lines in this section.]<br>[E<small>XPLANATION</small>.

But they do not stand the test throughout as giving the number of rhyming lines. <i>See</i> p. 1., para. 4.]</i> o'er thy head."

        "On Humility": [
            "Meekness of spirit is the halo of the wise; impudence is the sign of the fool.",
            "If thou hear one speak insultingly concerning thee, pay no heed to him, nor regard him, lest thou hear more cruel things said about thee, and thou wouldst stumble and fall.",
            "Do not reply to the insult of a fool, for whatsoever the insult, it is less vile than the one who uttereth it. Silence is the best reply, for by silence thou canst best forget it.",
            "Choose three things for thyself, and through them thou shalt find favour with the Creator of all: Humility, wherewith to subdue all folly; Reverence, by which to lessen sin; and Knowledge, teaching how to use moral suasion with men by the art of well-chosen language.",
            "In mixing with men, it is often useful to be dumb, though able to speak; to be deaf, though able to hear; and blind, though able to see. In this way thou shalt be much courted, and become their chief and ruler.",
            "He is not of highest quality who only abstaineth from harming his fellow-men, but he who taketh upon himself a share of the burden of their injuries; and, whatsoever may happen, he goeth forth to meet them with a cheerful countenance.",
            "The disciple of a Sage, once seeing his Master insulted by a fool, was incensed, and in his anger sought permission to handle roughly and to inflict bodily harm upon the offender; whereupon the Sage replied, ' Tis not the part of the wise to permit loss or bodily ill to be done to one's fellow-man.",
            "The man who hath both much knowledge and humility, is called blessed by all who look upon him; for by the two he lesseneth the number of his foes, and his band of supporters increaseth.",
            "The Wise Man spake: \"I will lift up my soul\" (<i>i.e</i>., can swear) \"that no fault will be found in me when my humility shall be weighed in the balance.\"",
            "The end of all strife and contention is regret; but the end of humility is strength and possession.",
            "If a man cannot control himself, how can he sway another man's soul?",
            "When in enmity a man scoffeth at words spoken in praise of thee, leave friendship undisturbed till the morrow; forget the reproachful word for the day, and perchance thou wilt have changed a foe into a friend.",
            "Be ready betimes to bend the knee, and to incline thy frame; take heed that thou be not slothful therein. When, with their hand, men throw a stone at thee, stoop, then shalt thou cause them to miss their aim, and thus thou shalt escape.",
            "To endure pain is to halve the pain; to try to thrust it off, is to increase it.",
            "Having had thy full say in reproach of another, bear him no further grudge; leave room for reconciliation.",
            "Seek no ruling position in thy city, and never look down upon thy inferiors.",
            "O man, if one would honour thee by flattering words and false, strive thou until they may be applied to thee in all truthfulness. Trust no man who doth ascribe to thee deeds of merit which thou hast not performed. And if thy fellow-men praise thee for some pre-eminence which is not in thee, turn thou from their company.",
            "Be lowly and humble in spirit amid the greatness of thy glory; and have no care for the fortune which hath never come to thy hands.",
            "When a man discerneth in others some advantage which he hath not, then is the time to regulate the sense of humility within him. If, for example, he see one richer than he is, let him think that the other is a great man, and superior to himself in righteousness. If he observe a poor man, let him reflect that he is poor and lowly, and that his opportunities for sin are, therefore, poorer and less. If he behold an aged man, one full of years, let him say, Truly his length of days are due to his devotion unto Heaven. When he looketh at a youth, let him realise that his transgressions have been few, and that his guilt is slight. If he see one who is better informed, let him consider that he is pure and innocent in his intelligence. And if he regard the simple-minded, let him think, peradventure he will be judged for his sins in the balance which will weigh them but as errors of judgment.",
            "To the way of humility I incline, and thus <i>my heart</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">[\"<i>My heart</i>\"=42, the number of lines in this section.]</i> will understanding gain."

            "All man's striving in this world is but for honour, riches, and ease; and yet he who loveth this life too much is often far removed from them, and more closely bound to sorrow and sighing.",
            "Fret not for the store laid up, for the riches heaped of yore, fearing lest men rob thee of them, when they steal thy substance and wealth.<br>Leave that which thou requirest not, seize but that which thou dost need; then shall the glory of God be thy rereward, and good fortune shall be thy meed.",

            "In the days of youth fear the day of death, and depart from sin; for upon old camels the skins of young sheep are borne.

Whene'er thy soul desireth some object to attain, think, is not the price thou pay'st for it much too high and dear?
