        "Prelude": [
            "H<small>AVE</small> I not written for thee a number of times counsels regarding knowledge, how to acquire wisdom and instruction, and to comprehend words of understanding? The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; there is good success to every one that exerciseth himself in these pursuits; his praise endureth for ever.",
            "Men of understanding have asked me to teach them the ways of instruction and wisdom, to give them rules whereby they might find life for their bodies while they are upon the earth, and help them towards the life of the soul on the day when they shall be called to ascend on high.",
            "I was much astonished at their request; it seemed, indeed, strange in my sight, considering that the matter is closed and concealed, nay, hidden from the eye of all creatures; no mortal knowing and estimating the way;—'tis but found by those who fear God.",
            "I then turned to inquire, and to search in the Law of God, and I attuned my thoughts; I tested in the refining vessel the opinions of experts who went before me, and I realised that all is nought and vanity beside the fear of the Lord.",
            "Therefore, why shall I remain silent? Is it not well that I rouse the slumberers, and build up a habitation firm and exalted upon the mountain-top whither my goal shall be? Indeed, as for the \"Foundation of Fear,\" I will establish it upon its true basis, and set it forth in chapters and stanzas.",
            "Hearken unto me, and incline thine ears; attend with thy heart, and open thy eyes; rebel not against the words of my mouth and against my voice when I speak; accept my instruction, and I will argue and order my subject with the help of direct proverbs, clear and transparent.",
            "Take advice, and harden not your hearts; for why shall it be unto you as a snare? Try to understand that all my words are honestly meant; there is nothing perverse or crooked in them. They are intended to flow upon the human heart with the fertilising effect of the former and latter rain."
        ],
        "On Fear": [
            "F<small>EAR</small> the Lord! This is the first and beginning of all wisdom; yea, its end and aim. In the first place, it ensures physical repose, wherein you forget sorrow and labour; and ultimately man is assured thereby of spiritual peace, a good name, and reputation.",
            "Fear God, and humankind thou needst not fear, though they mount even the royal throne. Will not the fear of God be thy fortress, if thou art low and humble? Confide in it, and none will make thee afraid, for it is an attribute chosen above all attributes.",
            "Fear God, and men will fear thee, though they be stronger and mightier than thou. For when thou opposest them with the strength of thy fear of God, they in their terror will tremble in their hearts like women; while the sense of confidence, security, and tranquility will suffer thee to draw thy foot out of the snare of the fowler.",
            "Fear God out of love, and be thou perfect, and thy fear will then be whole; 'tis meet that it should be so, for He formed thee out of nothing, and from nothingness He brought thee to stand before Him continually, and fashioned thee into a beautiful form.",
            "Fear and tremble for the measure of thy works, and let them all be pursued in the uncertainties of existence. Trust not in thy riches with daring; thou hast an eye, yet how blind mayest thou be; for who knoweth whether to-morrow will be as to-day, whether man may not become like unto the beasts that perish?",
            "Fear God, and place Him before thee in thy actions, so wilt thou never sin; and when the remembrance of His Holy Name shall be upon thy lips in all things, then shalt thou be whole. Therefore close not thine eye like the blind, and muzzle not thy mouth and be dumb.",
            "Fear God, and be concerned to perform that which He hath commanded thee in the precepts of His Law; and shouldst thou sin, regard the error done in ignorance as equal to the presumptuous sin in point of regret and repentance; then mayest thou hope for His bountiful mercies, and He will reckon unto thee thy wilful guilt as nothing more than slight errors, when thou returnest to swell the ranks of those who cleave unto Him."
        ],
        "On Prayer and Service": [
            "F<small>EAR</small> G<small>OD</small>, and cleave unto Him, to serve Him with a perfect heart, then hope for His goodness and mercies; let thy heart exult for all His bounties and bless His glorious Name. Do nought without Him: is He not God, and none beside Him?",
            "Be it thy soul's desire to render service unto God; for without such, thou servest strange gods. What profits it thee in all the labour which thou performest, to leave possessions unto others? and what doth He require of thee but to fear Him, to love mercy, justice, and uprightness?",
            "Fear God, and pray unto Him, and thou shalt find favour and good success in His eyes. And when thou askest a request from Him, fear and tremble; lest He be angry, guard the opening of thy lips; then will He be gracious unto thee, and grant thee of His favours.",
            "Fear God, meet Him with thanksgiving before thou settest forth to do aught for thyself. Lift up the standard of thy feet in His Holy Name, then there need be no trembling in all thy ways; and direct thy lips and heart to the One God, and thou shalt not be moved in slipping.",
            "Fear God, and when thou orderest thy prayer before Him, fear, and stand in dread; close thine eyes, and fold thy hands, lest thy heart turn to strange thoughts. Wouldst thou in seeking the presence of an earthly king, flesh and blood like thyself, turn thy thoughts to labour or merchandise?",
            "Have a fixed place where thou standest before Him in prayer, for why shouldst thou move about hither and thither? Seek only that from Him which is necessary to supply thy wants at all times; beware against seeking that which is superfluous. Then will He have compassion with thee, and grant thee His grace.",
            "Arrange the order of thy prayer, and afterwards cry unto Him, and seek His presence; and when thou comest unto His dwelling, bring with thee in thy hand thy gift as an offering. Is it becoming to draw out a lengthy prayer before Him, when deceit and lying are in thy right hand?",
            "When thou standest before the Supreme King of kings to beg from Him thy wants, remember who thou art, and what thy acts are, whether they be straight or the reverse, and who the God is before whom thou standest, who seeth into the darkest secret places.",
            "When thou seekest the face of thy fellow-man, thy friend, hast thou not some shame, and art thou not covered with confusion, doubting whether it will be in his power to grant thee thy request, and considering how much thou wilt gain from him? And why then shouldst thou not be clothed with fear, when thou seekest Him who anticipates all the bounties which thou wouldst have bestowed upon thee?",
            "Then thanks for all the bountiful mercies and kindnesses with which He has anticipated thy wishes, and due reflection be in the case of the petitions with which thou wouldst supplicate Him as regards the coming time! This is what is meant by the <i>Ordering of Prayer;</i> this it is which was the essential characteristic of the methods adopted by the early Pious Ones when they prayed."
        ],
        "On the Law and Wisdom": [
            "F<small>EAR</small> God; fear His wise men who teach thee the right way; and consider how to follow them, and to learn knowledge and law from their mouths. Know that thy soul is in their hands, and might be bound up in the bundle of everlasting life.",
            "Fear God; fear His Holy Law, and dearer than precious stones let it be unto thee; then shall thy lines fall in pleasant places, when thou shalt direct thy actions according to its norm; it will, indeed, prove the treasure of thy soul, and at the same time add days and years to thy life.",
            "Acquire understanding, acquire the instruction of the Law and the Commandment, then shall thy hand be strong through them. Is this not the direct path leading to the fear of God, though it may appear the more distant? How often does that man transgress who is wanting in understanding, who knoweth not the secret of the deep Service of Heaven?",
            "Acquire a knowledge of the Law; acquire books; they are more precious than fine gold and precious stones; for should doubt arise within thee in consequence of thy speculation, consult them as the <i>Urim and Thummim</i> (i.e., Oracle). Will the hero who goes into battle prevail, if he lift not up the sword which is in his right hand?",
            "Acquire wisdom and instruction, and meditate thereon until they be written upon the tablet of thy heart. And if thou continue to meditate upon them day by day, then shall their light appear as new fruit in its springing forth; or as in the case of a man who opens and turns over the soil: the more he ploughs, the more he gathers produce.",
            "See how beautiful is the Law, how pleasant the fear of Heaven! They are like as unto a beautiful and comely woman, decked in golden ornaments, clothed in scarlet, having adorned herself with the help of the mirror, one to be commended for her good taste, bearing all the evidence of pleasantness and grace.",
            "Learning without religious fear is as a woman of contradictions, disobedient, and lacking in manners, one who makes her eyes look large by the use of rouge and eye-paint, and adorns herself with necklaces and ear-rings. What is the use of all her beauty and splendour, when her clothing is untidy, and her true nature is disclosed?",
            "See how religious instruction, based upon religious fear, finds itself a very stronghold, and as a tower of strength built upon a height, whose foundation is laid broad, and not narrow! For ever does it stand, strong and mighty in face of the enemy, though he press with all his strength.",
            "But learning without fear is as a house and a high tower, which have no proper foundation. To-day it is high and lofty as the heavens, as a row of hewn stone forming a citadel and fortress; but of what avail is it? To-morrow the satyrs and children of destruction may dance upon its mounds.",
            "Acquire wisdom and understanding by study, and see that thou keep and cultivate it; remember that study without practice is considered nought and void, and becomes unreal. This was the motive in the scheme of the Creator when He gave to man alone of all His creatures the power of speech.",
            "He who has learnt in order to teach others, while his own soul loathes instruction and wisdom, will find that his intelligence and reasoning will be unto him as the snare of the fowler, and will avail him nought; his lessons will be but mists of empty wind, and showers of dust and earth upon the ground.",
            "Obtain knowledge of the Law, and say not: \"It is an inheritance bequeathed unto me from my fathers.\" Meditate upon it, and study it by day and by night, and thy reward for the labour will consist in the wisdom gained. Sow thy land, and reap its produce, even though thou dost experience thorns and thistles in its cultivation.",
            "See, in all mortal bequests, the heritage becomes the property of the living, whilst it slips from the dying; whereas in the case of one who bequeaths unto his children the inheritance of religious knowledge, wisdom, and the Holy Law, the possession, while being transmitted to his children, is not altogether alienated from him after death.",
            "Obtain knowledge for thyself, and regret not if its price be high; for thou hast made the much better bargain in exchange for what thou hast given for it. It will stand thee in good stead in the hour in which all the great substance which thou possessest will be powerless to be retained.",
            "Obtain instruction, wisdom, and discipline, and say not, \"I am a prince and ruler\"; for whom beseemeth it to be discreet, if not a person of noble birth, and of good name and princely station? What is the use of an exalted tree, if it be dry and produce no fruit, when even its shade disappears?",
            "Obtain wisdom, and care not in whose hands it may be found, and how it will be regarded. Is the clay vessel reckoned according to its maker? Is it not the thought of what is placed within the vessel? There are weeds which flourish like the lily, and through their flourishing men suffer them to rise at the very head of the garden.",
            "Acquire knowledge, and with it acquire humility and a winning discipline; and then thou wilt not be over-bearing in pride. Among all enduring qualities, thou wilt find none to equal humility, which is pleasant and becoming; besides, the effect of humility is abundance of peace, and the end and aim of true knowledge is security and restfulness.",
            "Darest thou to boast thyself of thy superior knowledge or wisdom, and allow thy heart to be exalted because thou hast acquired it, and to become proud on account of the acquisition in relation to thy friends and relatives, who have not had the sense to make its acquaintance for themselves? Understand, such possessions gain no footing; for by thine own pride dost thou destroy them.",
            "Behold, wisdom is planted upon religious fear, just as a tree that is planted by streams of water; its shoots and stems it sends forth far and wide, and it produces branches; and, as for its fruit, it is ever renewed and fresh, ripening with sweet fragrance, with its spikenard and cypress-flowers.",
            "Wisdom without fear may be likened to a shrub springing up and flourishing in a wilderness; and if, while it be yet moist and its shoots green, its boughs and branches multiply, on the morrow its stem and root will dry up; how can it then produce fruit for food?",
            "Behold, wisdom is as the sun in the heavens, giving light to those far and near. And so there is value in a man's understanding and intelligence, if they help him in his own case to fulfil the commandments and statutes; whilst they who are strangers (to such wisdom) will walk by its light, keeping to law and equity, it being sweet to them as the droppings of the honeycomb.",
            "Acquire wisdom, and do thy work by help of it; do nothing without it. Place it at the head of all thy pursuits; for if thy actions come before discretion, thou wilt have to tremble with fear; as in the case of the chariot, when its wheels are caught in the traces, there will be a mishap, and the vehicle will come to pieces.",
            "Know whether thy wisdom is sufficiently great that thou art able to discharge thy duties in an efficient manner, and how thy actions may be regulated in the right way in accordance with thy knowledge. Wilt thou burden thy heart with that which it hath not borne? Can a fly carry the burden borne by foals?",
            "Ask for knowledge, and study that which thou hast not learnt; and to him who asks, make reply according to his question. If thou knowest, say, \"Truly, I know it\"; for wherefore shouldst thou deny him the truth? What boots it when clouds rise, if there be neither the former rain nor the latter rain in its due season?",
            "Ask for information; why shouldst thou be ashamed? Surely it is more shame for thee that thou dost not know. Say not, \"My own heart will teach me; I am quite sufficient in myself as regards counsel\"; for when others will load thee, shalt thou be able to bear things which thou hast not before borne?",
            "The human frame without knowledge may be compared to a majestic vessel in the midst of the deep sea, moved and tossed about as a reed at every light or strong breeze; how can it possibly stand, if there be no one to handle the rudder, no sailor to spread the sail upward?",
            "Frequent the haunts of the wise, and learn wisdom; but keep thy mouth closed, and open thine eyes and ears. See and hear, and take to heart their words, weighing and balancing them well; incline thou whither they incline, and it will be well with thee; say not, \"I am a prince and ruler.\"",
            "Learn wisdom and teach it unto others, but only when they appreciate it. Why shouldst thou teach the foolish and wicked, when they desire it not? Wouldst thou sow thy seed among the clefts of the rock? Do things grow in the waste as on the plain?",
            "Follow after wisdom even across the distant sea, until thou shalt find the man perfect in his knowledge; so that all the nobles and wealthy among the people may come from the corners of the land to listen to thee. There are twigs which are transplanted from their natural soil, and become stronger than their original stem.",
            "Has thy heart ever whispered to thee, \"What have the wise of all their wisdom, even though they gain their living thereby; and what advantage have they over the fools, who have a pleasant time of it both in life and in death?\" Reflect, the wild ass in the forest also finds its fodder, sufficient to keep it alive.",
            "Acquire wisdom, and thou shalt not want any good thing; thou shalt find all that thou desirest to have. Without it, acquire everything, and be thy wealth ever so great and stupendous, it will be considered of little account. Wisdom it is which is more precious than pearls; it equals, indeed, every priceless article and possession."
        ],
        "On Appreciation": [
            "F<small>EAR</small> God, and appreciate the bounties and kindnesses which He bestows upon His creatures; understand that He does not require their help, while He is able to supply their every want. And shouldst thou inquire and say, \"Wherefore did He create them?\" It was in order to demonstrate to them the strength and height of His power.",
            "Open the eye of thy heart, that thou mayest appreciate what thou seest with thy physical eye; for how many mortals are there who have their eyes open and look, yet see not; while many a closed eye sees all, and even that which is concealed is revealed to it!",
            "A man should be sensible in recognising his position, and regulate all his actions by personal experience. Surely when a man walks in his integrity he will be at ease, and find that in this world all's well in the end; but as soon as he turns either to the right or to the left, the scent and flavour of his character will have faded and evaporated.",
            "But what profits it if a man recognise the right thing, and yet does not regulate his actions accordingly? Will a man, fleet on his legs, escape among the rocks which abound in stumbling-blocks? As for the man who cannot distinguish what is best, He who keeps the simple will preserve him on his path.",
            "If a man is anxious to give a false estimate of himself (<i>lit.</i>, to obtrude his qualities for the recognition of that which he does not possess), so as to be great, shun him, and have nothing to do with him; turn from him, and fly from him. It is as though a man would leave the straight path, and find a way for himself by breaking through a flinty rock.",
            "Be wise in learning to estimate the future by the experience of the past, so thou wilt understand to deal with it; and thou wilt attain that which has not yet come to thy hand by means of that which has fallen to thy lot with its worries, just as a fowler gains experience from the birds he trapped into his net on a former occasion.",
            "Judge things, too, before thou hast committed thyself, whether it be in speech or action; for what is the use of recognising the true nature of a thing when it is already done, and what is the value of regret? Can the eye of mortal recover its sight when it has once been blinded by total darkness?",
            "As for the man who sees and recognises in another's eye the thread of a hair that may be in it, and does not realise and makes nothing of that in himself which is quite open to his own eyes, would it not be better if he closed his eyes, and lightened from himself the yoke of others which he carries without necessity?"
        ],
        "On Shame and Shamelessness": [
            "F<small>EAR</small> God, and have shame for thyself rather than sin; do well, and act straight; for when thou clothest thyself in the garb and veil of shame, thou wilt be God-fearing, and shalt be happy for ever; thereby shalt thou be able to cover up human failing, and thereby is man considered righteous and upright.",
            "Is it good for thee that thou sufferest others to put thee to shame, whilst thou thyself findest thy actions blameworthy and reproachful? Would it not be better if thou wert to set the eyes of thy heart as a watch-tower over all thy paths:? Why shouldst thou close thine eyes as the blind, and not be ashamed of thy open nakedness?",
            "Wouldst thou oppose thy forehead firm as brass, whilst thou art despicable in the eyes of all, and carry thy shame upon thy brow to thine own disgrace as thy fiercest foe? Having no sense of shame, art thou willing to become changed into a fool and insolent one?",
            "Yet thou needst have no fear of shame, when with the wise thou dost consort, to inquire of them what thou knowest not, though they be junior to thee in age; for they will teach thee what is truly right. Great indeed would be thy shame, should they once question thee, and thou wouldst have to say, \"I've heard it not\"; \"I've forgotten it.\"",
            "Fear God, and be ashamed in His presence, and be afraid of His fierce anger. How canst thou be ashamed of the verdict which man will pass upon thy actions, lest thou be lightly esteemed in his sight, and not be ashamed before God, before Whom all thy secret acts are revealed?"
        ],
        "On Pride and Meekness": [
            "F<small>EAR</small> God in righteousness and meekness, and let thy fear be whole and beautiful; and should thy heart beguile thee to mount on high, raising and exalting itself in pride, remember the steps of its birth whereby it came into existence, to reverse which availeth not.",
            "Should man, calling to mind the way of his entry into the world at birth, boast himself? Surely when he realises the days of his life, and remembers his toil therein, will not his heart grow weary when he remembereth that in the end his couch will be of worms, even though he may soar and mount on high?",
            "Know that meekness conquers the wrath of man, which rises to overwhelm him; it stills a king's anger, making his will like the dew upon the herb. How soon the cold stream will still the seething kettle, even though its smoke has risen!",
            "Wouldst thou boast thyself, would thy heart be exalted on the day when thou clothest thyself in the change of the raiment of power and pride; wouldst thou glory in thy stupid pride, so that thou shalt have a greater measure of glory and conceit? Then call to mind the day in which naked and bare thou shalt lie upon the dust, and become the object of lament.",
            "Wouldst thou raise up thy head to carry the crown and diadem of pride with a name of praise, understand, that the God who alone is clothed in the garment of excellency, unto whom alone greatness belongeth, bringeth low unto dust the high, and raiseth on high those who are low.",
            "Know that by meekness thou shalt stand upon the strong fort, upon the rocky crag and cliff; and if thy heart dwell in lowliness within thee, thy dwelling shall be in the topmost station without. See how oil, smooth in itself, rises to the surface, and is used for the anointing of kings and princes!",
            "Is that man wise who sees his heart ascending in the heights of pride? He will not bear with the disposition of meaner men, how then will they endure his senseless folly? Will he not dwell alone as the leper without friends, covered up to the upper lip?",
            "Will the man of pride escape by his greatness, by the boldness of his heart which is exalted on high? Verily he breaks the upper beam of the door of his house, when he lifts up his head, and draws himself up straight. Will the citadel and high tower stand firm, which is built in dust or unburnt brick?",
            "Be lowly in thine own sight, and thou shalt be high in the sight of others, and there will be hope when thou art in distress (<i>or</i>, and there will be no hope to thine enemy). As for the reviling curse of a man, bear it with meekness and lowliness; in its passing, it will not come unto thee. Thou wilt bend low thy head in face of sling-stones; and as for dart and spear, they will miss their mark.",
            "Know, too, that meekness will aid thee, even though they who fight against thee increase in strength; therefore humble thyself, rather than be humbled at the hand of those who rise up against thee. By its merit shall thy horn be exalted in glory, and thy step shall never slip."
        ],
        "On Endurance": [
            "F<small>EAR</small> God, and endure His judgments, believing He judges truthfully and righteously; and even though their taste be bitter to thy palate, are they not sweet and pleasant to thy soul? Canst thou ever heal the disease of a man's heart except by strong potions?",
            "Fear and endure God's decrees and judgments, and answer them not with arrogance and boldness; and then, being long-suffering, will He bear with thee in thy actions, and He will not suffer His anger to rise. Lift up thyself by prayer, if thou hast not prayed, and understand that this matter is not determined by thee.",
            "Bear with men, and God will bear with thee; in His mercies He will be long-suffering with thee. Bear with men, and they will bear with thee, and God will give thee strength from on high. Be like the ass crouching under its burden, even though it break its back and bones.",
            "Wouldst thou endure thy great men, and fearing them clothe thyself in terror at their exalted power, and not bear with thy smaller ones, and be afraid lest thou be found wanting and become rejected? Couldst thou throw off thy supports as mountain chaff? Would not their removal be hard as a weighty stone?",
            "Endure things; muzzle yourself, and be silent; for if you answer a fool, you will hear more things. 'Tis better that you should yourself in privacy tolerate unpleasantness than that others should hear it; your reply might only have the effect of disclosing some shady spot in your own career, which had hitherto been kept secret.",
            "Is it not better to endure that which you have neither strength nor the power to remove? What is better calculated to remove the worries and sorrows of a man than the power of endurance which comes to his aid? Herein lies the panacea for all mourning and grief, the healing of all the ills of the flesh."
        ],
        "On Humility": [
            "F<small>EAR</small> God both in public and in private, and walk in humility before Him. Do thy public work in a modest manner, and have concern for the mass and multitudes of men; and as for thy private affairs, do them with openness, knowing that God seeth thee from His habitation.",
            "Dost thou now inquire concerning the quality of humility, since thou desirest to understand it, so that thou mayest pursue thy secret matters in a manner that it may be well with thee in the end; so that thou mayest be held in esteem by anyone finding thee to be possessed of it, and thou mayest be lauded on account of this beautiful quality?",
            "Wouldst thou hide and conceal thy deeds from mankind who understand them not, and be ashamed and confused on their account, being afraid lest they might think lightly of thee? And shouldst thou not feel shame and fear before thy God, who understandeth thy secret actions and their obligations?",
            "Have fear, and do thy work in secret humility; why should man know it? Shouldst thou, however, find satisfaction in its publicity, surely thou canst reveal what is hidden. Why shouldst thou make things public, which thou canst not afterwards hide?",
            "Lo, how precious is the quality of humility to ensure peace of body and mind! Thereby is even the wise of heart rescued, when he falls into the hands of the godless; by its means he goes forth free. Does a slice of pomegranate become soiled, if it drop into thick mud and mire?",
            "Understand that humility is a delightful attribute, without stain or spot in its trail. Every noble man, every man of fame, rulers and princes, might be glorified, if they had but sufficient wisdom to do their work in secret.",
            "Ask him who runs after the approval of the crowd of men to regard the lily (<i>sic</i>) which is encased between thorns. Would the prickly thorn approach to hinder it, while its bud and leaf are yet hid in lowliness? Nevertheless, on the day that it appears in all the glory of its beauty, it nips it, and its splendid appearance vanishes.",
            "Be lowly, and conceal thy actions, the worth of which outsiders are unable to gauge; why be expected to disclose their motive, and to discover their origin? Be firm, and thou shalt find grace, favour, and good understanding in the eyes of God and man."
        ],
        "On Chastity": [

Can the potter join the fragments of earthenware once broken asunder, and can they be renewed when once destroyed?",
