            "Solomon was the wisest and greatest of all men. He was king over earthly and celestial beings. After he had seen every sort of activity, tried all things and made known all sorts of wisdom, he concluded all of his words by saying, \"The end of every matter is fear of the Lord.\" And thus he began, \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge\" (Prov. 1:7), and he ends, \"A woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised\" (Prov. 31:30). Were another man to admonish us regarding fear of the Lord, his words wouldn't be received favorably, as people would claim: \"this individual is disengaged, therefore he's admonishing regarding fear of the Lord\".
