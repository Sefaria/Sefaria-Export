            "\"God restores my soul\" This means that Israel said, God restores my soul with Torah, as it says, \"The Torah of Adonai is perfect, restoring the soul\" (Psalms 19:18).  \"God leads me in the paths of mercy\"--this means, to manna, to quail, to waters of the well, to clouds of glory; and these are given to me not because I have earned them but \"for the sake of God's name.\"  Even as I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, though I walk on the parched land of the wilderness, \"I will fear no evil for You are with me,\" as it says, \"Adonai went before them by day in a pillar of cloud (Exodus 13:21).  Your rod and your staff, they comfort me: the rod is Your chastisements; the staff, Your Torah. "
