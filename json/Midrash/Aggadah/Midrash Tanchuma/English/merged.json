        "Introduction": [
            "<b>T</b>he genre of Jewish literature known as Midrash has been poetically described as “the hammer that awakens the slumbering sparks on the anvil of the Bible.” The midrashic process utilizes a variety of methods, including expositions, explanations, gematria, plays on words, legends, and parables, to broaden our understanding of the full meaning of the biblical text. The conscientious application of this methodology has made the Midrash Tanhuma, and the other Midrashim, a vital source of influence on Jewish life and thought throughout the centuries. The “hammer” of the Midrash elicited new insights into the historic events depicted in Scripture and produced a fuller understanding and awareness of the spiritual, moral, and ethical truths and values stated laconically in the Pentateuch.",
            "By answering questions the Torah left unanswered, the Midrashim made the terse style of the biblical message more meaningful and relevant in the lives of those who heard them when they were first spoken on the Sabbath and festival days. Their impact was equally strong upon those who studied them and reflected upon them in the years that followed. Their ageless popularity is attested to by the considerable number of midrashic manuscripts in our possession and by the frequency with which midrashic works have been published and republished in more recent times. In fact, it may safely be said, the Midrashim served as the lifeline that made it possible for the Jewish people to survive the unceasing torrent of humiliation, hatred, and violence that flowed around them and over them through the centuries.",
            "Told and retold generation after generation, the Midrashim brought purpose, direction, and hope to the lives of the Jews, helping them to endure whatever trials they experienced. The Midrashim served as a balm for their aching hearts by making the concept of the world-to-come and the blessing it would bring a reality for them. The Sifré summarizes the ultimate goal and purpose of the Midrash when it tells us: “If you desire to know Him who spoke and the world came into being, learn the Aggadah, for from it you will come to know the Holy One, blessed be He, and cling to His ways.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifré on Deuteronomy 11:22.</i>",
            "The Midrash Tanhuma Yelammedenu is the only complete midrashic text on the Pentateuch that until now has not been translated into English, and that is why I undertook the task of providing an English rendering. The name Tanhuma Yelammedenu was assigned arbitrarily to this homiletical compilation and is found in a number of manuscripts and in several printed editions.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The earliest printed editions: Constantinople 1522, Venice 1545, Mantua 1562. The text I translated was printed in Vienna 1863.</i> The first half of the title, Tanhuma, was adopted from the name of Tanhuma bar Abba, one of the most prolific aggadists in Jewish literature, who lived in the fourth century C.E. Numerous sayings quoted in his name in the text account for the attribution of this work to him. The second half of the title, Yelammedenu, is, in fact, part of a formula, <i>yelammedenu rabbenu</i>, “may our master teach us,” which is repeated frequently in this Midrash. Scholars are in agreement that this formula was the title of a midrashic text that existed long before our Midrash was compiled. Though that work has been lost to us, quotations using the formula are to be found in a number of other Midrashim,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Buber’s Tanhuma text, Pesikta Rabbati, Numbers Rabbah, Deuteronomy Rabbah.</i> as well as in our Tanhuma Yelammedenu.",
            "There is, it seems to me, a possible explanation for the adoption of the word <i>yelammedenu</i> as part of the name of this work that has some merit. One of the manuscripts of our Midrash opens with the words <i>yelammedenu rabbenu;</i> it may very well be that the printer of the first edition utilized this manuscript in printing his text and, as a consequence, incorporated <i>yelammedenu</i> into the name. A facsimile of the title page is included in this volume.",
            "The arbitrariness of the choice of Tanhuma Yelammedenu as the work’s title is evidenced in the <i>Arukh,</i> the dictionary of the Talmud compiled by R. Nathan of Rome in the eleventh century, in which he credits some of the words he defines either to Tanhuma or to Yelammedenu. Similarly, Rashi, in his commentaries, refers to Tanhuma and Yelammedenu separately as the sources for certain of his comments.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Jewish Encyclopedia</i> 8:796. The author of the Yalkut had two collections before him, one called Tanhuma, the other Yelammedenu.</i> This fact clearly indicates that both Rashi and R. Nathan had two different texts before them, one entitled Tanhuma, and the other, Yelammedenu.",
            "To add to the confusion and uncertainty concerning the compiler of this Midrash and the time and place of its compilation, Solomon Buber, in 1885, published an edition of a Midrash Tanhuma based primarily upon an Oxford University manuscript, Opp. 20.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Buber in his introductory volume lists the manuscripts available to him. Since the publication of his edition, additional material containing midrashim similar to those in his edition or to the one I have translated have been found, and some of them have been translated.</i> In the introductory volume of his edition, he asserted that it was the oldest Midrash extant, preceding even Genesis Rabbah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Buber Tanhuma, vol. 1, p. 6.</i> That claim has been challenged by many scholars, among them Leopold Zunz, who maintain that Genesis Rabbah was compiled in the sixth century, soon after the completion of the Babylonian Talmud, and that it existed long before the Tanhuma edited by Buber.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See L. Zunz, <i>Vorträge der Juden;</i> M. Waxman, <i>Jewish Literature,</i> vol. 1, p. 139; H. Strack, <i>Introduction to the Talmud and Midrash,</i> p. 218.</i>",
            "The first half of Buber’s edition, Genesis and Exodus, differs to a considerable degree from our text. The second half of Buber’s edition, the books of Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, which are included in the third volume, is in part similar to our text, except that our Midrash contains additional sections, under a heading adopted from Ecclesiastes 1:10, “It hath been already,” indicating earlier sources not utilized by the compiler of the Buber Tanhuma. We find, as well, passages in our Midrash attributed to the Mekhilta of R. Ishmael, a tannaitic Midrash compiled prior to 200 C.E., that are not contained in Buber’s edition.",
            "The Midrash Tanhuma Yelammedenu is a homiletical Midrash divided according to the Palestinian practice of reading the Torah in a triennial cycle. This fact, together with the preponderance of sayings quoted in the name of Palestinian sages, has led some midrashic authorities to maintain that it was compiled in Palestine. Other scholars insist that the references to the Babylonian academies, the inclusion of passages from the <i>She’iltot</i> of Rav Ahai Gaon, who lived in Babylon when he wrote the <i>She’iltot,</i> and the quotation of a considerable number of earlier Babylonian teachers, indicate that the Tanhuma was produced in Babylon. Concerning the date of the completion of this text, we may assume from the inclusion of the <i>She’iltot</i> passages and the references to heretics (i.e., the Karaites) that the earliest manuscript of this text was completed in the late eighth or the ninth century.",
            "Three different types of homilies are apparent in Tanhuma Yelammedenu. In the first type, a verse from the weekly Torah reading is presented as the subject of the discourse. This is followed by a proem, or introductory verse, from some other portion of Scripture, either Pentateuch, Prophets, or Writings. At first glance some of the proems appear to have little, if any, relationship to the verse from the Torah reading, but after the homilist expands upon the proem, he arrives at a conclusion that confirms the subject of his homily.",
            "The second type of homily has as its proem a halakhic question, which is introduced with the formula <i>yelammedenu rabbenu</i>, “may our master teach us.” The speaker responds briefly to this query, since it is intended primarily to lead to the aggadic discourse that follows. The homily ultimately arrives at a conclusion that supports the opening verse.",
            "The third type of homily has no proem. In this instance, the speaker finds questions and concerns within the verse from the weekly reading that broaden its meaning. He then concludes with a peroration describing the blessings that await us in the world-to-come.",
            "It should be understood that these homilies are not as well organized or as consistent in structure as the preceding description might suggest. We must bear in mind as we read this Midrash and the others that they are not transcripts of sermons as actually preached. By the time the recension of the first Tanhuma Yelammedenu text took place, much had been lost in the transmission; and much was subsequently added by the scribes who copied the manuscripts. Some of the homilies ultimately became obscure and difficult to follow.",
            "The following illustrations provide an example of each of the homily types described above, and are based upon the same verse taken from the Torah reading: <i>And the Lord called unto Moses</i> (Lev. 1:1).",
            "The proem in the first type of homily is from the Book of Psalms: <i>Ye mighty in strength that fulfill His word, hearkening unto the voice of His word</i> (Ps. 103:20). R. Huna maintained that this verse refers to Israel, who became mighty when they hearkened to His voice and exclaimed: <i>We will do and we will hear</i> (Exod. 19:8). (They responded positively even before they knew God’s commands.) R. Isaac the smith said: Those who observe the Sabbatical year are <i>ye mighty in strength.</i> Why? Because they control their evil inclinations when their fields are open and available to those who would pick their crops from the corner of this field or during the Sabbatical year. Finally, the homilist informs us that Moses was mighty in strength, for he alone heard <i>the voice of His word</i> when God called unto him. <i>Ye mighty in strength,</i> the midrash is teaching us, are those who <i>fulfill His word.</i>",
            "The proem in the second type of homily, as stated above, is a halakhic question introduced by the formula <i>yelammedenu rabbenu</i>, “may our master teach us”: Is the one reciting the prayers (i.e., the Amidah, or “standing prayer”) before the ark permitted to repeat the prayers if he previously failed to recite the one that deals with heretics? Indeed, he must do so, lest the congregation come to the conclusion that he himself is a heretic (and therefore intentionally ignored the prayer about heretics). The repetition is also required if he should omit the prayer relating to the “builder of Jerusalem.” Otherwise, the congregation might think that he is a Samaritan (and therefore descended from those who opposed the rebuilding of Jerusalem after the Babylonian Exile). However, the reader of the prayers is not required to repeat any other prayer he may have omitted. The homilist then proceeds to discuss the treatment to be accorded to a prospective convert who is thoroughly familiar with the minutiae of both the Written Law (Torah) and the Oral Law (Talmud), but denies the Oneness of God. He must not be accepted into the congregation no matter how well informed in the Torah he may be. However, the stranger who abandons idolatry must be warmly welcomed into the congregation (though he may be uninformed in the Torah). Why?

However, He called only to Moses, for it was Moses who received (on Mount Sinai) the entire Torah. As a consequence of his willingness to accept the Torah, the Holy One, blessed be He, assures Moses that when the righteous enter their heavenly abode, he will lead them there. In this Midrash we are told that the righteous are promised the blessings of the world-to-come.",

How was the Torah written? It was written with letters of black fire on a surface of white fire, as is said: <i>His locks are curled and black as a raven</i> (Song 5:11). What is meant by <i>His locks are curled</i>?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>taltalim</i> (“curls”) is read as <i>tille tillim</i> (“heaps upon heaps”). Each letter in the Torah has numerous strokes upon it which, according to tradition, represent heaps upon heaps of laws. Cf. Leviticus Rabbah 19:2, Song of Songs Rabbah 5:11–12.</i> It means that each crowned stroke on the letters of the Torah contains heaps and heaps of law. For example, it is written in the Torah: <i>Profane not My Holy Name</i> (Lev. 22:2); but if you should change the <i>het</i> in the word <i>yehallelu</i> (“profane”) into a <i>heh,</i> the word would read “praise,” and you would thereby destroy the world. Conversely, where it is written <i>Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord</i> (Ps. 150:6), if you should alter the <i>heh</i> in the word <i>tehallel</i> (“praise”) into a <i>het,</i> the word would read “profane,” and you would thereby destroy the world.",

                "If a slight change in a single letter can produce such drastic consequences, how much more so the alteration of a complete word.

                "The Torah served as an artisan in all the work of creation, as it is said: <i>Then I was with Him, as a nursling (amon)</i> (Prov. 8:30). However, you do not read the word as <i>amon</i> (“nursling”), but as <i>uman</i> (“artisan”), since it was with the assistance of the Torah that God stretched out the heavens and established the earth, as it is said: <i>If My covenant be not with day and night, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth</i> (Jer. 33:25). With it, He bound up the sea lest it should go forth and overflow the world, as it is said: <i>Fear ye not Me? saith the Lord; nor will ye not tremble at My presence who have placed the sand for the bound of the sea</i> (ibid. 5:22). With it, also, He locked up the deep so that it might not inundate the world, as is written: <i>When He set a circle on the face of the deep</i> (Prov. 8:27). Similarly, He fashioned with it the sun and the moon, as is said: <i>The Lord giveth the sun to light the day, the ordinances of the moon and the stars to light the night. Who stirreth up the sea, that the waves thereof roar, the Lord of hosts is His name</i> (Jer. 31:35). Hence, you learn that the world was founded upon the Torah.",

Hence the sons of Korah exclaimed: <i>When the earth and the inhabitants thereof trembled, I Myself established the pillars of it</i> (Ps. 75:4).

Thereupon, he said to his disciples: “Happy are you who devote yourselves to the study of the Torah.” “Master,” they asked, “what is it that you have seen?” He replied, “The Holy One, blessed be He, gave me thirteen streams of balsam oil in reward for studying the Torah.” And then he went on to say, <i>Yet I have said, “In vain have I labored, I have spent my strength for nought and vanity; yet surely my right is with the Lord, and my recompense with my God</i>” (Isa. 49:4).",

Furthermore, the Merciful One declares: “Rest on the Sabbath day, just as I rested upon it,” as it is said: <i>And He rested on the seventh day, wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it</i> (Exod. 20:11).",

Hanina declared: With difficulty the sages permitted greetings to be exchanged on the Sabbath (to avoid the harmful consequences caused by resentment, etc.).",
                "However, we must inquire: Is one who desires to go to fulfill a religious obligation or to prayer or to the house of study permitted to trot hastily on the Sabbath? Is the performance of a religious duty superior, or is the honor of the Sabbath superior? Observe what R. Tanhuma stated in the name of R. Joshua the son of Levi: “A man must always hasten to fulfill a commandment, even if it is on the Sabbath.” R.

Tanhuma (in the name of R. Joshua the son of Levi), I also hastened, and I ascended in learning.” In fact, the merit earned by attending a lecture derives from one’s eagerness to hear it. Indeed, they insist that the phrase <i>from pursuing thy business</i> indicates that you are prohibited from pursuing your personal interests, but the question remains whether the interests of heaven are a religious duty (mitzvah) or not. Listen to what R. Eleazar said: “We may decide the allotment of charity to the poor on the Sabbath.” And R. Jacob the son of Idi stated that R.

Why did the Holy One, blessed be He, commence the account of the creation of His world with the letter <i>bet</i> rather than with the <i>alef,</i> the first letter of the alphabet? He did so because the <i>alef</i> is the first letter of the word <i>arur</i> (“cursed”), while the <i>bet</i> is the first letter of the word <i>barukh</i> (“blessed”). The Holy One, blessed be He, said: “I will begin the account of the creation of the world with the letter that symbolizes a blessing.” Even though the account of the creation of the world starts with a letter that symbolizes a blessing, mankind angered its Creator.

We learn from another verse that the distance from heaven to earth is no more than the palm of an angel, as it is written: <i>Then was the palm of the hand sent from before me, and this writing was inscribed</i> (Dan. 5:24).

However, if the one from whom he stole it has died, he is required to return the stolen property to his heirs before he is considered to have atoned. When a person returns a stolen article to its owner, the owner must forgive the guilty one lest he regret having repented. Our rabbis taught, however, “If a known thief or usurer desires to make restitution, one should not accept it, and if he does accept it, he is devoid of wisdom and piety.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For the interpretation of this statement, see Rashi, Bava Kama 94b, s.v. “ignorant of the law.”</i> This is the case only if the stolen object is not intact, but if it is intact, one may accept it.

It happened once that a man wanted to return some property which he had stolen, but his wife rebuked him, saying: “Fool, if you were to make complete restitution, even the girdle you are wearing would no longer belong to you.” He changed his mind and did not make restitution.

He explained: The robber equates the dignity of the servant with the dignity of the Master, while the thief does not equate the dignity of the servant to that of the Master. He (the thief) acts as though the eyes of the Almighty were unable to see him and His ears were incapable of hearing him. He moves about stealthily while perpetrating his thievery, as though he can be seen by man but not by God.

They had given birth to many children, as it is written: <i>Their seed is established</i> (<i>nakhon</i>) <i>in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes</i> (Job 21:8).

Some of them took their children and stuffed them unmercifully into the crevices through which the waters gushed. Hence, it is said: <i>The mercies of the wicked are cruel.</i> How do we know that they actually did that? Job declared: <i>The womb forgetteth him; the worm feedeth sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered, unrighteousness is broken as a tree</i> (ibid. 24:20). <i>The womb forgetteth him … he shall be no more remembered</i> signifies that they pressed their own offspring into these crevices.

How did they perish? It was through the birds, the beasts, and the animals. When at long last they realized that they were about to be destroyed, they attempted to overturn the ark.

But after he drinks a moderate amount of wine he believes himself to be as strong as a lion, boasting that no one in all the world is his equal. When he drinks more than he should, he behaves like a pig, wallowing about in urine and performing other base acts. After he becomes completely intoxicated, he behaves like an ape, dancing about, laughing hysterically, prattling foolishly, and is completely unaware of what he is doing.

And because he neglected to cover his naked father, he went about naked, with his prepuce extended. This happened to him because the Holy One, blessed be He, exacts retribution measure for measure.

Forthwith, a famine came into the world and when the famine reached the Land of Israel, Abraham said to his wife Sarah: “There is a famine in our land.” Our sages have maintained that no famine ever equaled it. He said to her: “Egypt is a pleasant land in which to dwell; let us go there, since there is a huge supply of bread and meat in that land.” Thereupon, the two of them departed for Egypt.

Now I have been separated from my father, my mother, and my husband, and this evil man will approach me and abuse me.

The officials, the officers, and all the members of his household were smitten by the angel simultaneously, as it is said: <i>And the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of the word of Sarai.</i> Every plague already known to man, and those yet to be experienced by mankind, descended upon him, his household, his many servants, the walls, the columns, the utensils, and all his possessions to fulfill the verse: <i>There shall no mischief befall the righteous, but the wicked are filled with evil</i> (Prov. 12:21).",

You find that some trees are not visible from a distance because they are short, but the palm and the cedar tree can be seen from afar because they are taller than other trees. Indeed, they are so tall that a man standing beneath them must raise his eyes to see their uppermost branches. Therefore, the righteous are compared to a palm tree and a cedar because the Holy One, blessed be He, causes them to be exalted in the world. The righteous are compared to a palm tree and a cedar for another reason. You find that when other trees grow old, they are hewn, and their sprouts, once planted, grow large quickly, but when the palm tree and the cedar are hewn down, another can be grown to replace it only after many years. Similarly, when the righteous man perishes, who can replace him immediately? Many years must first pass by. <i>Therefore, the righteous shall flourish like a palm tree,</i> etc."

Furthermore, it is written: <i>In the self-same day was Abraham circumcised</i> (ibid., v. 26). Scripture does not say “he circumcised himself” but he <i>was circumcised.</i>",

Because he is extremely bashful, he does not know how to declare his love for her, whether to do so himself or through another. The king realized what was in the young man’s heart and so he said to him: “I know what you desire; my daughter is already in your house.” Abraham was likewise bewildered when the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: <i>I will make My covenant between Me and thee,</i> and so he fell upon his face. While he was prostrate, he discovered that he was already circumcised. Forthwith, the Holy One, blessed be He, said: My covenant is made between Me and thee. Scripture says elsewhere in reference to the preceding verse: <i>The word of the Lord is tried</i> (Ps. 18:31). This implies that He tested Abraham’s offspring by bestowing upon them the precept of circumcision. Therefore, <i>He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in Him</i> (ibid.), to Israel who trust in Him.",

They sang it about Abraham, the fairest of Adam’s descendants. Who were the descendants of Adam? They were: Seth, Cain, Mahalalel, Jared, Enoch, Methuseleth, Lamech, Noah, and his sons.

What secret did He reveal to those who feared Him? The secret of circumcision. The Holy One, blessed be He, revealed to Abraham alone the mystery of circumcision. <i>The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him.</i> This alludes to Abraham, for it is written about him: <i>Thou art a God-fearing man</i> (Gen. 22:12). What is the meaning of the word <i>sod</i> (“secret”)? It may be explained arithmetically. In the word <i>sod,</i> the <i>samekh</i> is sixty, the <i>vav</i> six, and the <i>dalet</i> four—totaling seventy in all. Thus the Holy One, blessed be He, informed Abraham: I will produce from you seventy, as it is said: <i>Thy fathers descended to Egypt with threescore and ten persons</i> (Deut. 10:22); I will cause seventy elders to descend from them, as it is written: <i>Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel</i> (Num. 11:16); and I will also cause Moses to descend from you, and he will explain the Torah in seventy languages.

Who will descend to Gehenna? The verse that follows informs us that the Kenites, the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites, etc., will descend into Gehenna, since they were all uncircumcised. Ezekiel observed the uncircumcised descending to Gehenna, as it is said: <i>Son of man, wail for the multitudes of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, with the daughters of the mighty nations, unto the nether parts of the earth…. go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised. They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword….

Whence do we know that circumcision is called a law (<i>hoq</i>)? We know it from the verse <i>And He established it unto Jacob for a statute (hoq), and to Israel for an everlasting covenant</i> (Ps. 105:10). The Holy One, blessed be He, pulls down the foreskins of infidels and sinners in Israel who deny God and imitate the practices (<i>huqim</i>) of the nations, and even though they may be circumcised they descend to Gehenna, as is said: <i>He hath put forth his hands against them that were at peace with him; he hath profaned his covenant</i> (Ps. 55:21).",

What does this verse indicate? He saw how the men of Jerusalem provoked the Holy One, blessed be He, to anger, for even the priests who offered sacrificed in the Temple were uncircumcised, as it is said: <i>In that ye have brought in aliens, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in My sanctuary, to profane it, even My house, when ye offer My bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken My covenant, to add unto all your abominations</i> (Ezek. 44:7), and it is written elsewhere: <i>Thus saith the Lord God: No alien, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into My sanctuary, even any alien that is among the children of Israel</i> (ibid., v. 9).",

Jehoiakim extended his own foreskin (to hide his circumcision), as it is said: <i>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found upon him</i> (II Chron. 36:8). What is the meaning of <i>was found upon him?</i> It means that he stretched his foreskin. Others maintain that this verse indicates that he tattooed his skin. Hence, we learn that both the priests and the kings abrogated the covenant of circumcision. The Holy One, blessed be He, declared: “I informed Aaron and David that their offspring would survive forever, as it is said: <i>Ought you not to know that the Lord, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?</i> (ibid. 13:5).

When the Israelites heard this, they cried out: Woe unto us, <i>the two families which the Lord did choose, He cast them off</i> (ibid., v. 24). The Holy One, blessed be He, responded to them: <i>Consider thou not what this people have spoken, saying: The two families,</i> etc. (ibid.). And He asked: “When were they cast off?” At the time they abrogated the commandment mentioned in the verse that follows: <i>Thus saith the Lord, If My covenant be not with day and night,</i> etc. (ibid., v. 25), and it says: <i>Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion, put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the Holy City, for no more shall enter into thee henceforth the uncircumcised and the unclean</i> (Isa. 52:1).

However, if someone should insist that the patriarchs are actually mentioned nineteen times, since it is written: <i>God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac; the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it</i> (Gen. 28:13), inform him that this verse is not counted, since Jacob’s name is not included (in the verse).",

R. Simeon held: The eighteen benedictions correspond to the eighteen vertebrae in a man’s spinal column. When a man prays and genuflects, he is required to bow down until all the vertebrae in his spinal column are loosened, as it is said: <i>All my bones shall say, O Lord, who is like unto Thee</i> (Ps. 35:10).",

And thus it is said: The Lord will answer you in a day of trouble, as it is said at the end of Psalm eighteen: <i>The Lord will answer thee,</i> etc. R. Joshua the son of Levi maintained that the eighteen benedictions correspond to the eighteen times the Divine Name is mentioned in the psalm <i>Ascribe unto the Lord, O ye sons of might</i> (Ps. 29:1).",

It is for this reason that we do not say the eighteen benedictions on the Sabbath.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On Sabbaths and holy dayss the thirteen intervening blessings are omitted lest the holiness of the day be marred by references to mundane affairs; a single benediction describing the characteristic feature of the day is inserted, in their place.</i> For, if it should happen that a loved one was ill at home at the time of praying, the worshipper would be reminded of it while reciting the prayer “Who healeth the ills of His people” and would become depressed. Inasmuch as the Sabbath was given to Israel for sanctification, for joy and rest and not for sorrow, one must recite the first three blessings and the final three blessings (of the Amidah) and replace the intervening ones with the prayer of Rest. Hence, David proclaimed: <i>Seven times a day do I praise Thee, because of Thy righteous ordinances</i> (Ps. 119:164). The word <i>seven</i> in this verse refers to the seven benedictions recited on the Sabbath. What other day could this verse refer to, if not the day of rest, which is unlike any other?

Your new moons and your appointed seasons My soul hateth…. And when you spread forth your hands … even when you make ever so many prayers</i> (ibid. 1:11–15). From these verses we can logically conclude that prayer is more important than all the sacrifices. Even though man may not deserve to have his prayers answered or to be treated mercifully, yet if he should pray and plead for mercy, I will be merciful toward him, as it is written: <i>All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth</i> (Ps. 25:10).

Since you said <i>wash your feet,</i> I will wash away all the impurity of your descendants, as it is said: <i>When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughter of Zion</i> (Isa. 4:4). Because you did say: <i>Recline yourselves under a tree,</i> I will give them the precept of the sukkah, as it is written: <i>Go forth unto the mount and fetch olive branches</i> (Neh. 8:15).

Our masters teach us: One is forbidden to look into the Torah scroll while translating it, lest someone should contend that the translation is contained in the Torah scroll. Conversely, one who reads the Torah is forbidden to turn away from the scroll as he reads, for the Torah was given only in writing, as it is said: <i>And I will write upon the tables the words that were on the first tables</i> (Exod. 34:1). That is why anyone who is translating the Torah in public is forbidden to look into the Torah scroll while doing so. R. Judah the son of Pazzi declared: There is an entire verse in Scripture that deals with this subject: <i>Write thou these words, for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel</i> (ibid., v. 27). <i>Write thou these words</i> alludes to the Pentateuch, which was given in writing, while <i>The tenor of these words</i> refers to the translation of the Torah that was given orally.",

Why to this extent? Because the Oral Law contains the mysteries of the Holy One, blessed be He, and He reveals His mysteries only to the righteous, as it is said: <i>The counsel of the Lord is with them that fear Him</i> (Ps. 25:14).

The righteous, however, are loved by the Holy One, blessed be He, by the angels, and by all creatures. Whence do we know this to be so? You find that when the angel visited Daniel he called him <i>greatly beloved</i> three times: <i>And he said unto me: Daniel, thou man greatly beloved, give heed unto the words that I speak unto thee</i> (Dan. 10:11); <i>O man, greatly beloved, fear not!</i> (ibid., v. 19); and <i>And I come to declare it, for greatly beloved art thou</i> (ibid. 9:23). Why was he called <i>greatly beloved?</i> Happy indeed is the man who hears an angel calling unto him: <i>O man, greatly beloved,</i> for that man is beloved by the Holy One, blessed be He, extolled by the heavenly bodies, and adored by his generation. Similarly, Bezalel was loved by the Holy One, blessed be He, by those on high, and by those on earth, as is said: <i>See, I have called by name Bezalel</i> (Exod. 31:20), and it is written elsewhere: <i>See, the Lord hath called Bezalel by name</i> (ibid. 35:30). The word <i>see</i> in the latter verse refers to the heavenly beings, and the word <i>see</i> in the former verse alludes to the earthly beings.

Furthermore it says: <i>For Thou are not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness</i> (Ps. 5:4); and: <i>As I live, saith the Lord Eternal, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked</i> (Ezek. 33:11). What does the Holy One, blessed be He, take pleasure in doing? In proving the righteousness of His creatures, as it is said: <i>The Lord was pleased, for His righteousness’ sake</i> (Isa. 42:21). Proof of this is that even when mankind sins against the Holy One, blessed be He, and provokes him to anger, He relents and seeks an advocate to plead in their behalf. In fact, He suggests the arguments the advocate can employ.

Proof of the seriousness of unchastity is that it was punishable by death through fire. R. Joshua the son of Levi declared in the name of Bar Kappara that the Holy One, blessed be He, forgives everything but licentiousness. R. Judah the son of Nehemiah stated: The Holy One, blessed be He, rained fire and brimstone upon the inhabitants of Sodom, and burned them to death, because they committed acts of sexual immorality, as it is said: <i>And the Lord caused to rain down upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire</i> (Gen. 19:24).",

What is meant by <i>the fierceness of His anger</i>? R. Simeon the son of Yohai said: Five plagues resulted from His anger, as it is said: <i>How much more when I send My four judgments against Jerusalem, the sword and the famine and the wild beast and the pestilence</i> (Ezek. 14:21). What is the fifth plague? The drought. How do we know this? R. Simeon the son of Yohai explained: It is written: <i>The anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and He shut up the heavens, so that there shall be no rain</i> (Deut. 11:17).",
                "The word <i>wrath (avera)</i> indicates that He was filled with wrath against them, just as a pregnant woman (<i>uvara</i>) (is filled out).

                "However, even when the Holy One, blessed be He, is angry, He remains merciful. He remembered Lot and rescued him because of the merit of Abraham, as is said: <i>And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the Plain, that God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow</i> (Gen. 19:29). In the Mishnah it was said that one should save the Sefer Torah case as well as the Sefer Torah, and the tefillin case as well as the tefillin. It teaches us: Happy are the righteous and those who cling to them. Scripture states: <i>And God remembered Noah and every living thing and all the cattle</i> (ibid. 8:1), all because of the merit of Noah. Similarly, <i>God remembered Abraham and sent out Lot</i> (ibid. 19:29). Woe to the wicked and to those who cling to them, as it is said: <i>And He blotted out every living substance which was upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle</i> (ibid. 7:23). Furthermore, it states: <i>I will blot out man whom I have created</i> (ibid. 6:7). The angels of destruction came as the emissaries of the Holy One, blessed be He, in order to destroy Sodom."

Normally, a man would prefer to undergo death for the sake of his daughter or his wife; indeed he would willingly kill or be killed for their sake, but this man was willing to allow his daughters to be abused by men.

Or when He hath spoken, will He not make it good?</i> (Num. 23:19). R. Samuel the son of Nahman contended: The conclusion of this verse contradicts the beginning. It begins: <i>God is not a man that He should lie</i>, but subsequently it reverses itself by stating: <i>when He hath said, will He not do it?</i> What is meant by <i>God is not a man that He should lie?</i> It indicates that when the Holy One, blessed be He, promises to perform a good deed, He does so. For example: A mortal king may promise his son a gift, but if his son angers him, he will withdraw his promise. However, if the Holy One, blessed be He, promises to do a good deed, He will not retract His promise even though they sin against Him. Scripture states: <i>And He gave them the lands of the nations, and they took the labor of the peoples in possession; that they might keep His statutes and observe His Laws</i> (Ps. 105:44–45), and even though they neglected to keep His commandments and to observe His laws, He gave them the land.

Likewise, though He declared: <i>Now, therefore, let Me alone that My wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them</i> (ibid., v. 10), yet he did not do so.

Aha: This is proven by what occurred at the time Jeremiah said: <i>Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live</i> (Jer. 27:12). Hananiah the son of Azzur, the false prophet, had prophesied good tidings, as it is said: <i>And they have healed the hurt of the daughters of my people lightly, saying peace when there is no peace</i> (ibid. 8:11), and he had told them also: <i>Behold, the vessels of the house of the Lord shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon</i> (ibid. 27:16). Thereupon Jeremiah exclaimed: I prophesy evil in accordance with the word of the Holy One, blessed be He, while you prophesy good tidings falsely of your own accord. <i>Yet may it be that the Lord fulfill the words which thou hast prophesied, to bring back the vessels of the Lord’s house</i> (ibid. 28:6).",

And he did so (on himself). However, Hananiah removed them from Jeremiah’s neck and destroyed them, as it is said: <i>Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, and broke it. And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying: “Thus saith the Lord: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon”</i> (Jer. 28: 10–11). Jeremiah, thereupon, called out to Hananiah: There have been prophets before me and you, but <i>the prophet that prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the Lord hath truly sent him</i> (ibid., v. 9). I have prophesied misfortune, but if my prophecy does not come to pass, I shall not necessarily have lied, for the Holy One, blessed be He, may threaten to do evil and then retract.

Hence the words <i>God is not a man that He should lie</i> refer to His promises of good, and the words <i>When He hath said, will He not do it?</i> allude to His threats of misfortune. You know this is so also from what is written concerning the angels’ visit to Sarah: <i>I will certainly return to thee; and, lo, Sarah, thy wife, shall have a son</i> (Gen. 18:10).

                "<i>And He said: “Take now (na) thy son, thine only son”</i> (ibid.).

Forthwith, God replied: <i>Isaac</i>.",
                "<i>And get thee into the land of Moriah</i> (ibid., v. 2). What is suggested by the word <i>get thee</i>? It implies that the last trial was similar to the first.

                "<i>And he saw the place from afar off</i>. Abraham had asked himself: What shall I do? If I tell Sarah all about it, consider what may happen. After all, a woman’s mind becomes distraught over insignificant matters; how much more disturbed would she become if she heard something as shocking as this! However, if I tell her nothing at all, and simply steal him away from her when she is not looking, she will kill herself. What did he do? He said to Sarah: “Prepare some food and drink that we may eat and rejoice.” “But why is this day different from other days?” she asked. “What are you celebrating?” He replied: “When a couple our age has a son, it is fitting, indeed, that they should eat, drink, and rejoice.” Whereupon she prepared the food. While they were eating, he said to her: “When I was a child of three, I already knew my Creator, yet this child is growing up and still has had no instruction. There is a place a short distance away where children are being taught, I will take him there.” She answered: “Go in peace.”",

Why should an old man, who begets a son at the age of a hundred, destroy him? Have you not heard the parable of the man who destroyed his own possessions and then was forced to beg from others? If you believe that you will have another son, you are listening to the words of a seducer. And furthermore, if you destroy a soul, you will be held legally accountable for it.” Abraham answered: “It was not a seducer, but the Holy One, blessed be He, who told me what I must do, and I shall not listen to you.”",

He inquired: “Where are you going?” “To study the law,” Isaac replied. “Alive or dead?” he retorted. “Is it possible for a man to learn the law after he is dead?” Isaac queried. He said to him: “Oh, unfortunate son of an unhappy mother, many days your mother fasted before your birth, and now this demented old man is about to sacrifice you.” Isaac replied: “Even so, I will not disregard the will of my Creator, nor the command of my father.” He turned to his father and said: “Father, do you hear what this man has told me?” He replied: “Pay no heed to him, he has come only to torment us.” Forthwith, <i>And Isaac spoke</i> (ibid., v. 7).",
                "<i>On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes</i> (ibid., v. 4). Since the distance was extremely short, what delayed them three days? When Satan realized that they would not pay any attention to him, he went ahead and created a river in their path. When Abraham stepped into the river, it reached his knees. He ordered his young men to follow him, and they did so. But in the middle of the river the water reached his neck. Thereupon, Abraham lifted his eyes heavenward and cried out: Master of the Universe, You have chosen me; You have instructed me; You revealed Yourself to me; You have declared: I am one and You are one, and through You shall my name be made known in My world. You have ordered me: Offer, Isaac, thy son, as a sacrifice, and I did not refuse; but now, as I am about to fulfill Thy command, these waters endanger my life. If either I or my son, Isaac, should drown, who will fulfill Your decrees, and who will proclaim the Unity of Your Name? The Holy One, blessed be He, responded: Be assured that through you the Unity of My Name will be made known through the world. Thereupon the Holy One, blessed be He, rebuked the source of the water, and caused the river to dry up. Once again, they stood on dry land.",

He said to Abraham: “<i>Now a word was secretly brought to me</i> (Job 4:12); that is, I have heard from behind the heavenly curtain that a lamb will be sacrificed as a burnt offering instead of Isaac.” Abraham responded; “It is a liar’s fate that even though he should speak the truth, no one will believe him.”",

Thereupon, the Holy One, blessed be He, called upon the hills in the surrounding area to come together in order to make a fitting abode for the Shekhinah.

Immediately, an overpowering fear and violent trembling seized Isaac, for when he saw nothing to be sacrificed, he realized what was about to transpire. Yet he asked once again: “Where is the lamb for the burnt-offering?’ And Abraham responded: “Since you ask, the Holy One, blessed be He, has selected you.” “If he has chosen me,” Isaac replied, “I shall willingly surrender my soul to Him, but I am gravely concerned about my mother.” Nevertheless, <i>they went both of them together</i> (ibid., v. 8), of one mind: convinced that one was to slaughter and the other to be slaughtered.

Then Abraham asked, “Where am I fairer than the children of man? When I and my son enter a city, no one is capable of distinguishing between us.” (In those days) a man would live to be a hundred or two hundred years old without acquiring the distinguishing features of old age. “It is imperative, Master of the Universe, that You should distinguish between father and son, between old and young, so that the young may pay homage to the old.” The Holy One, blessed be He, replied: “Be assured I will begin to distinguish between young and old with you.” Abraham went to sleep, and when he arose in the morning he found that the hair of his head and beard had turned white. “Master of the Universe,” he exclaimed, “You have made me a public spectacle.” The Holy One, blessed be He, replied: <i>Thy hoary head is a crown of glory</i> (Prov. 16:31), and it says elsewhere: <i>And the beauty of men is the hoary head</i> (ibid. 20:29).

The seas mourn (<i>bohin</i>) to this very day because He slew the prince of the sea, as is said: <i>Hast thou entered into the springs (nibhe) of the sea?</i> (Job 38:16). Why did He slay him? Because a house that can accommodate a hundred living people can contain a thousand dead. That is why the ocean is called the Dead Sea.

The slave asks himself: “Perhaps my master meant that I should wait near the basilica, or the bathhouse, or the theater.” When they finally meet, the master slaps him on the face, and says: “I sent you to the gate of the duke’s palace.” Similarly, when the waters heard the decree, <i>Let the waters underneath the heavens gather in one place</i> (Gen. 1:9), they did not know whether (they were to go) to the north or the south. And so, they raced about, as it is said: <i>The mountains rose, the valley sank</i> (Ps. 104:8), until the Holy One, blessed be He, struck them, and declared: I ordered you to assemble at the place of the Leviathan, as is said: <i>There go the ships; there is the leviathan, whom Thou hast formed to sport therein</i> (ibid., v. 26).",

And thus it is said: <i>O Lord my God, Thou art very great</i> (ibid., v. 1). Another comment on <i>O Lord my God, Thou are very great: Thou art very great</i> refers to the wondrous deeds You performed for man when you gave him old age and a hoary head. If this had not been done, men would not know whom to honor. The word <i>very</i> alludes only to old age, as it is said: <i>Eli was very old</i> (I Sam. 2:22). <i>Thou art clothed with glory and majesty</i> (Ps. 104:1). <i>Glory</i> signifies the strength with which I clothed you at the sea, as is said: <i>The Lord is my strength and my song</i> (Exod. 15:2). R. Judah the son of Ilai said: He praised Me and I praised him (Israel). <i>Majesty</i> alludes to the majesty with which you were adorned through Me at Sinai above all the nations of the world. R. Judah the son of Simon stated: Because they declared: <i>All that the Lord hath spoken we will do and hear</i> (Exod. 24:7), Scripture speaks of them at that moment <i>As a lily between the thorns</i> (Song 2:22). Another comment on <i>Thou art clothed with majesty and glory</i>.

When David’s men returned and repeated Nabal’s words, he armed himself and his soldiers, and with their weapons started out to destroy Nabal. <i>But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying: “Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; but he hath spoken rudely to them”</i> (ibid., v. 14). As soon as she heard what had transpired, she prepared a gift which she took to David, as it is said: <i>Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of corn … and she said unto her men: “Go on before me; I come after you.” But she told not her husband Nabal</i> (ibid., vv. 18–19). Later on Scripture states: <i>And it came to pass about ten days later, that the Lord smote Nabal so that he died…. and David sent and spoke unto Abigail to take her to him to wife</i> (ibid. 38:39). After he had her brought to him, David stayed apart from her for three months to determine whether or not she had conceived with Nabal. After the third month, David had intercourse with her and she became pregnant. The scoffers in that generation asserted that she had actually conceived from Nabal. What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He ordered the angel in charge of the formation of embryos to fashion that embryo in the likeness of its father so that everyone would be forced to acknowledge that David was the father. We know that this is so from the verse <i>And his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and his second, Chileab, of Abigail, the wife of Nabal the Carmelite</i> (II Sam. 3:2). Why does Scripture call him Chileab (<i>khilav</i>)? Because he was completely like his father (<i>kulo av</i>), and everyone who saw him said: “David is this child’s father.”",

That is why he loved him. Thereupon, the Holy Spirit exclaimed: <i>When he speaketh fair believe him not; for there are seven abominations in his heart</i> (ibid. 26:25).

At the time that the prophet Iddo visited Jeroboam the son of Nabat: <i>And behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the Lord unto Beth-El; and Jeroboam was standing by the altar to offer. And he cried against the altar by the word of the Lord, and said: “O altar, altar, thus saith the Lord: Behold, a son shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he sacrifice the priests of the high places that offer upon thee, and men’s bones shall they burn upon thee”</i> (I Kings 13:1–2). Why is the word <i>altar</i> repeated in this verse? Because of the two altars, one at Beth-El and the other at Dan, at which golden calves were erected. <i>And men’s bones</i> is stated rather than “Jeroboam’s bones,” to emphasize that the prophet was respectful toward the government. Jeroboam said immediately: “This man is a fool.” Whereupon the prophet replied: <i>This is the sign … Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out</i> (ibid., v. 3). <i>And the altar was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given</i> (ibid., v. 5)",

When Jeroboam brought offerings to the idols, his hand did not dry up, but when he stretched forth his hand against the prophet, it did dry up. From this fact, you learn that the Holy One, blessed be He, was more concerned about the honor of that righteous man than about His own honor. The prophet exclaimed: “Do you believe that your hand is under your control?” Thereupon the king beseeched the man of God: <i>Entreat now the favor of the Lord thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me</i>, etc. (ibid., v. 6).",

There is a biblical verse that confirms this: <i>A man’s goings are of the Lord; how, then, can man look to his way?</i> (Prov. 20:24). Frequently, a man will depart upon a journey without knowing his ultimate destination; whether it will be for good or evil, for death or for life. Thus Elijah told the Arameans: <i>This is not the way, neither is this the city</i> (II Kings 6:19). The mouth likewise is not completely under man’s control. We learn this from the experience of Balaam and Isaac. Regarding Balaam, it is said: <i>Nevertheless, the Lord thy God would not hearken unto Balaam, but the Lord thy God turned the curse unto a blessing</i> (Deut. 23:6). In reference to Isaac we find that when Esau entered, Isaac began to tremble and was on the verge of saying: “Cursed shall he be.” The Holy One, blessed be He, called out to him: What do you intend to do? Do you believe that your mouth is under your control? Thereupon he reconsidered and said: <i>Blessed shall he be</i>.

Because he will be greater than the patriarchs, as is said: <i>Behold, My servant shall prosper, he shall be exalted and lifted up, and shall be very high</i> (Isa. 52:13). <i>He shall be exalted</i> above Abraham; <i>lifted up</i> above Isaac; and <i>shall be very high</i> above Jacob. <i>He shall be exalted</i> above Abraham, concerning whom it is said: <i>I have lifted up my hand unto the Lord</i> (Gen. 14:22); <i>lifted up</i> above Moses, of whom it is said: <i>That thou shouldst say unto me: Carry them in thy bosom</i> (Num. 11:12); and <i>shall be very high</i> like the ministering angels, concerning whom it is said: <i>As for their wings, they were high</i> (Ezek. 1:18). Hence Scripture says: <i>Who art thou, O great mountain?</i>",
                "From whom will the Messiah descend? From Zerubbabel. Why was he called Zerubbabel? Because he was born in Babel (Babylonia). From whom did Zerubbabel descend? From David, as it is said: <i>And Solomon’s son was Rehoboam; Abijah his son … and Delaiah, and Anani, seven</i> (I Chron. 3:10–24). To whom does <i>Anani</i> refer? To the Messiah, as is said: <i>For who hath despised the day of small things? Even they shall see with joy the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel, even these seven</i> (Zech. 4:10). And it is written elsewhere: <i>I saw in the night visions, and, behold, there came with clouds (ananei) of heaven, one like unto a son of man</i> (Dan. 7:13).",
                "<i>Even these seven</i>. What is indicated by the phrase <i>even these seven</i>? The word <i>seven</i> is explained by what is written concerning the King Messiah: <i>Who hath despised the day of small things? … even these seven</i> (Zech. 4:10). That is why it is said: <i>Who art thou, O great mountain</i>. Scripture states elsewhere concerning him: <i>But with righteousness shall he judge the poor</i> (Isa. 11:4), <i>and he shall bring forth the top stone with shoutings of “Grace, grace, unto it”</i> (Zech. 4:7). After that it is written: <i>And then was the iron, the clay, the brass … broken in pieces together … and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth</i> (Dan. 2:35). Thus it is said: <i>Who art thou, O great mountain?</i> From whence shall he come? He shall come by way of the mountain path, as is said: <i>How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger of good tidings</i> (Isa. 52:7). At that time, Israel will look upwards and say: <i>I will life up mine eyes unto the mountains: From whence shall my help come? My help cometh from the Lord, who made heaven and earth</i> (Ps. 121:1). Amen, and so may it be."

Whence do we know this to be so? R. Eleazar the son of Pedat said in the name of R. Yosé the son of Zimra: We know this from the verse <i>And the Lord said unto Abraham</i> (Gen. 13:14).

At the very moment he leaves him, I shall fulfill My promise and be with him. Jacob reflected upon this, saying to himself: Did He not promise me <i>I shall not forsake thee</i> (ibid.)? Thereupon the Holy One, blessed be He, replied: If you desire that I be with you, then depart from Laban’s house and <i>Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred, and I will be with thee</i> (ibid. 31:13)."

Samuel the son of Nahmani said: Observe what is written concerning Job: <i>I have made a covenant with my eyes; how then shall I look upon a maid?</i> (Job 31:1). Here indeed is evidence of Job’s righteousness. If (he would not look at) an unmarried woman, whom a man is permitted to look at, as he might marry her himself or match her with his son or his brothers, (then) all the more so would Job not look at a married woman. Hence a woman must remain in her home and not promenade about in the street lest she sin herself and cause men to sin through tempting them to look at the wife of another man. R. Judah the son of Shalum said: You know this to be so, as well, from the scriptural verse: <i>And God blessed them and said to them: “Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue her</i> (Gen. 1:39). The word <i>subdue her</i> is written (without a <i>vav</i>) as a singular imperative, for it is the male that subdues the female, while the female does not subdue the male. Similarly, the male subdues the earth and the female does not. Hence, a woman must not meander about lest tragedy befall her. That is what happened to Dinah, Jacob’s daughter. She wandered about alone and was disgraced. Whence do we know this? We know it from what we read in the portion <i>And Dinah went out</i>."

Ezekiel declared: <i>Behold, everyone that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying: As the mother, so her daughter</i> (Ezek. 16:44). <i>To see</i> should be read as “to be seen,” for though she went out to see, she was, in fact, seen, as it is said: <i>And Shechem the son of Hamor … saw her</i> (Gen. 34:2).",

Thus did our masters teach us: A man’s account book is opened three times: when he journeys alone upon a highway; when he resides in a dilapidated house; when he vows and fails to fulfill. R. Aha the son of Jacob deduced the first statement from the biblical verse <i>If harm befall him by the way</i> (Gen. 42:3). R. Eliezer the son of R. Yosé the Galilean stated: If you should discover that a righteous man is setting out on a journey, leave even three days earlier or three days later in order to travel with him. But if you should see a wicked man setting out on a journey, leave three days earlier or three days later in order not to go with him, as it is said: <i>Set thou a wicked man over him; and let an adversary stand at his right hand</i> (Ps. 109:6).

The words <i>after vows to make inquiry</i> signify that a man’s account book is opened and that angels testify against him by enumerating his sins. R. Samuel the son of Nahman stated: Everyone who borrows and fails to repay brings about the death of his wife, as it is said: <i>If thou hast not wherewith to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee?</i> (ibid. 22:27). Moses warned Israel about this, as is written: <i>When thou shalt vow a vow unto the Lord thy God, thou shalt not be slack to pay it; for the Lord thy God will surely require it of thee</i> (Deut. 23:22). Why is the word <i>require</i> repeated in this verse (i.e., written in the intensive form, <i>darash yidreshenu</i>)? It teaches us that He will require (i.e. inquire) of him with regard to what he has borrowed, and He will (also) require concerning his other sins, as it says: <i>And after vows to make inquiry</i> (Prov. 20:25).",

He asks: Where is that person who made a vow on a certain day? Observe that it is written concerning the time that Jacob went to Aram-naharaim: <i>And Jacob vowed a vow, saying: “If God be with me”</i> (Gen. 28:20). At first He granted his every request. He went there and became wealthy, but when he returned without fulfilling his vow, He turned Esau against him, and Esau sought to kill him. And though Esau took the two hundred she-goats from him, Jacob did not trouble to perform his vow. Whereupon He turned the angel against him and they wrestled together, but still he did not take note, as it is said: <i>And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him</i> (ibid. 32:26). It was Samael, Esau’s guardian angel, who wanted to kill him, as is said: <i>When he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh</i> (ibid., v. 27). When he still was not persuaded to fulfill his vow, the anguish occasioned by Dinah’s experience befell him, as is said: <i>And Dinah went out</i>. When he continued to refrain from carrying out his vow, the tragedy of Rachel’s death occurred, as it is said <i>And Rachel died and was buried</i> (ibid. 35:19). This confirms the opinion of R. Samuel the son of Nahman that one who vows and fails to fulfill his vow brings about the death of his wife, as it is said: <i>If thou hast not wherewith to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee</i>?

Judah was of the opinion that to make a vow and fulfill it was preferable to the other two, since it is said: <i>Vow, and pay unto the Lord your God</i> (Ps. 76:12).

Ben Sira taught: Before you make a vow, consider that vow carefully lest you go astray. <i>Suffer not thy mouth to bring thy flesh into guilt, neither say thou before the messenger, that it was an error; wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands?</i> (Eccles. 5:5). R.

When Jacob saw the chiefs of the sons of Esau, he was terrified. “Who will be able to withstand these chiefs?” he exclaimed. To what may this be compared? It may be compared to many camels laden with flax (in a certain place), and a blacksmith standing nearby asked in amazement: “Where will it be possible to store all this flax?” An observer responded: “Why do you wonder about that? After all, a single spark from your forge can consume it all.” Similarly, when our patriarch Jacob became terrified at the sight of Esau and the chiefs, and cried out: “Who will be able to assist me against them?” The Holy One, blessed be He, answered: A spark from you will consume them. And Joseph was that spark, as it is said: <i>And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them</i> (Obad. 1:18).

Did the Holy One, blessed be He, have nothing else to write about other than the chief of Timna, the chief of Lotan, etc.? He did so to teach us that from the very beginning of the creation of the world, the Holy One, blessed be He, concerned himself with the genealogies of the idolatrous nations so that it would not be left to them to describe for mankind their sterility and their degeneracy. How did He do that? When He came to the genealogy of the sons of Ham, He said: <i>The sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim … and Cush begot Nimrod</i> (Gen. 10:6–8); thus He indicated that they had become defiant, as it is said: <i>He began to be a mighty one in the earth</i> (ibid., v. 8). Similarly, when He said: <i>And Mizraim begot Ludim … whence went forth</i> (ibid., vv. 13–14), He did not say “he bore him” but <i>he went forth</i>, thereby informing us that he was the product of an incestuous relationship.",

And Timna</i> (ibid. 36:11), and elsewhere it states: <i>And Timna was concubine to Elephaz</i> (ibid., v. 12). This clearly informs us that Elephaz had sexual relations with his own daughter. How did that occur? He had sexual relations with Seir’s wife first and made her pregnant and begot Timna. Later he married Timna, as though she were Seir’s daughter, when in fact she was his own. That is why it says: <i>And the children of Seir: Lotan … and Timna was Lotan’s sister</i> (I Chron. 1:38–39).

However, Anah is elsewhere called the son of Zibeon: <i>And these are the children of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah</i> (ibid., v. 24). We learn from this that Zibeon had sexual relations with his own mother, and conceived and begot Anah by her. Consequently, (Anah) was both (Zibeon’s) brother and his son. Later he had intercourse with his daughter-in-law, the wife of Anah, and Oholibamah was their child, as it is said: <i>And these were the sons of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, Esau’s wife</i> (ibid., v. 14), and Esau took her as a wife.

Why did the Holy One, blessed be He, concern Himself from the very beginning of time with the genealogies of the nations? This may be likened to a king who dropped a pearl into sand and pebbles. The king was compelled to search the sand and the pebbles to recover the pearl. As soon as he recovered the pearl, however, he discarded the sand and the pebbles, for he was only interested in retrieving the pearl.",

However, they are not actually accounted as the firstborn in the genealogy of the people. Another explanation. <i>These are the generations of Jacob</i>. <i>Joseph</i>. You find that Joseph resembled his father in every way, and that everything that happened to Jacob also happened to Joseph. Jacob’s brother was envious of him, and Joseph’s brothers were envious of him; Jacob was exiled to Haran, and Joseph was exiled to Egypt; Jacob said: <i>Whether stolen by day or stolen by night</i> (Gen. 31:39), and Joseph said: <i>For indeed, I was stolen away</i> (ibid. 40:15)."

These (things) were the cloaks and the golden tongues from inside the mouths of the idols at Jericho, upon which an unclean (i.e., idolatrous) name had been engraved. Because he violated the pact of excommunication, thirty-six Israelites perished,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The members of Achan’s family. See B.

Israel hath sinned; yea, they have even transgressed My covenant which I commanded them; yea, they have even taken of the devoted thing; and have also stolen</i>, etc. (Josh. 7:10). Why is the word <i>gam</i> (variously translated “yea” and “also” in the preceding passage) repeated five times in this verse? To teach us that whosoever violates a vow of excommunication is considered to be transgressing against the Five Books of Moses. For all other sins, the guilty one is punished, but for the violation of an oath of excommunication the transgressor and all mankind are punished, as it is said: <i>Therefore doth the land mourn, and everyone that dwelleth therein doth languish</i> (Hos. 4:3), and elsewhere it states: <i>Therefore, hath a curse devoured the land, and they that dwell therein are found guilty</i> (Isa. 24:6). Similarly, you find that it is said about Achan: <i>Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass against the banned things, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel? And that man perished not alone in his iniquity</i> (Josh. 22:20).",
                "When the Holy One, blessed be He, told Joshua that Israel had sinned, he asked: “Who is the culprit? Am I an informer? He replied. Draw lots to discover the guilty one. Whereupon he drew lots and the lot fell up Achan. Achan cried out: “You decided that I was guilty simply by drawing lots, but if you had drawn lots between yourself and Elazar the priest, then one of you would have been proven guilty.” Then Joshua glanced at the twelve stones on the ephod that was suspended over the heart of the high priest, and observed that the stone of the tribe of Judah had grown dim. The stones always rendered their verdict in this way. When a tribe performed a meritorious deed, its stone would sparkle and glow brightly, but if a tribe transgressed, its stone grew dim. When Joshua saw this, he said to Achan: <i>My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, and make confession unto him</i> (Josh. 7:19). Immediately <i>Achan answered and said: “Of a truth I have sinned.” And Joshua said: “Why hast thou troubled us?

He examined the ephod and discovered that the stone of the tribe of Benjamin had grown dim. He cast lots between himself and his son Jonathan, and the lot indicated that Jonathan was responsible. He grasped his sword to slay him, as it is said: (Saul said:) “<i>God do so and more also; thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.” And the people said unto Saul: “Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel?”</i> (ibid., vv. 44–45).",

Whereupon he summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them: “During the years in which you dwelt in your land, wild beasts never devoured you; why is this happening now?” They whispered to each other: “Let us all give the same answer and perhaps he will permit us to return.” They told him: “That land welcomes no one who does not occupy himself with the Torah and is uncircumcised.” “Then select two men from among you,” he replied, “to go there and instruct them.” Since a king’s command may not be rescinded, they sent R.

Soon thereafter, one hundred and eighty thousand Samaritans attacked them. Were they actually Samaritans? Indeed not. They were, in fact, Cuthites, who were called Samaritans only because they lived in Samaria. Furthermore, they conspired to kill Nehemiah, as it is said: <i>Come, let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of One</i> (Neh. 6:2). They halted the work of rebuilding the Temple of the Holy One, blessed be He, for two years, as is said: <i>Then ceased the work of the House of God that was in Jerusalem; and it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius, king of Persia</i> (Ezra 4:24).",

As a result of this episode, our sages said that anyone who ate the bread of a Cuthite would be considered as eating the meat of a pig, and that no Cuthite could be admitted into the ranks of Israel, nor could they participate in the resurrection of the dead, as it is said: <i>It is not for you, but for us, to build the house of God</i> (Ezra 4:3), <i>And ye have no portion, no right, no memorial in Jerusalem</i> (Neh. 2:20).

Proof of this is that at the time when the Holy One, blessed be He, desired to fulfill the decree: <i>Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger</i> (Gen. 15:13), He selected as his emissary one from the smallest tribe.

If those creatures that dwell in the sea ascend onto dry land, they cannot survive, and if those that live on dry land descend into the sea, they cannot survive. Nevertheless Jonah descended into the sea and lived, as it is said: <i>So they took up Jonah and cast him into the sea</i> (Jonah 1:15). And the fish that swallowed him ascended to dry land and survived, as is said: <i>And God spoke to the fish, and he threw up Jonah onto dry land</i> (ibid. 2:11).

Yet Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah were hurled into the fire and went forth unscathed, as it is said: <i>Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came forth</i> (Dan. 3:26). The creature that thrives in fire but does not thrive in the air is the salamander. How do we know this? When glass blowers are about to fashion glass objects, they stoke their furnace for seven days and seven nights. When the fire becomes extremely hot, a creature similar to a lizard that is called a salamander comes out. If a man should smear his hand or any part of his body with its blood, fire will not affect that place, for the animal is created in fire. From this fact our sages taught that the fire of Gehenna does not affect the scholar, (deriving this) <i>a fortiori</i> from a salamander. For if the blood of a salamander, which is merely created in fire, can make a man’s body immune to fire, how much more so would the scholar, who observes the law, which is a fiery law, given by One who is a consuming fire, and of whose teacher (is said): <i>The house of Jacob shall be a fire</i> (Obad. 18), be immune from the fire of Gehenna.

After Moses rebuked the people, saying: <i>Hear now, ye rebels</i> (Num. 20:10), the Holy One, blessed be He, informed him: <i>Therefore ye shall not bring this assembly into the land</i> (ibid., v. 12).

The poor man who is entrusted with a deposit and is not suspected of withholding the deposit. No one is more faithful than he. And the bachelor who lives in a red-light district and does not sin. No one is more faithful than he. You find that no one was more faithful than Joseph, who, though only a lad of seventeen years, lived among Egyptians, concerning whom it is written: <i>Whose flesh is as the flesh of asses</i> (Ezek. 23:20). He was never suspected of immorality. What is more, the mistress of the house in which he lived endeavored every day to entice him by her comments and by changing her clothes three times a day. The clothes she put on in the morning, she would not wear in the afternoon, and those she wore in the afternoon she would not wear in the evening. Why did she do this? So that he should notice her.",

But before she summoned Joseph she gave each of them an ethrog and a knife. When they saw Joseph’s handsome countenance, they cut their hands. She said to them: “If this can happen to you, who see him only once, how much more so does it happen to me, who must look at him constantly.” Each day she strove to entice him with words, but he suppressed his evil inclination. Whence do we know this? From what we read in the section: <i>His master’s wife cast her eyes upon him</i> (Gen. 39:7)."

If the flesh of a pure animal that you kill is forbidden to us, how much more so is the flesh of a pig.” Similarly, Joseph told her: “If your virgins are forbidden to us, how much more so another man’s wife.” <i>He harkened not to her, to lie by her, or to be with her</i> (Gen. 39:10). <i>To lie by her</i> signifies in this world, and <i>to be with her</i> refers to Gehenna.

This verse suggests that the Holy One, blessed be He, will never abandon the righteous during a time of famine, neither they nor their descendants. In fact, when a disaster envelops the world, the Holy One, blessed be He, decrees how they will survive. You find this to be so in the case of Elijah, whom He told how to survive, as it is said: <i>Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Sidon, and dwell there; behold, I have commanded a widow there to sustain thee</i> (I Kings 17:9). Similarly you find: <i>Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan. And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there</i> (ibid., vv. 3–4). <i>And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine</i> (Gen. 26:1); <i>and there was a famine in the land; and Abraham descended</i> (ibid. 12:10). Similarly, when the famine came upon Jacob, the Holy One, blessed be He, revealed to him that Joseph would feed him in Egypt, as it is said: <i>And Joseph fed his father and his brothers</i> (Gen. 47:12). Hence, <i>Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt</i>.",

And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said</i> (Gen. 41:49–53).",
                "What does <i>according as Joseph had said</i> mean? R. Judah the son of Shalum explained: Apparently, fourteen years of famine were first destined to come to the world, for Joseph had said <i>seven poor cows and ill-favored</i>, signifying seven years, and <i>seven withered, thin ears of corn</i>, signifying an additional seven years. This totaled fourteen years in all. However, Joseph decreed that it was to last only seven years, as it is said: <i>There shall be seven years of famine</i> (ibid., v. 27).

Ten men also comprise a congregation, as is said: <i>How long shall I bear with this evil congregation</i> (Num. 14:27), and <i>God standeth in the congregation of God</i> (Ps. 82:1). Hence Scripture states: <i>Joseph’s ten brethren went down</i> (Gen. 42:3). Just as in the case of Sodom, Scripture speaks here of ten. <i>And the sons of Israel came to buy among those that came</i> (Gen. 42:5), in order that no one would recognize them. The Holy One, blessed be He, declared: Because you have said: <i>We shall see what will become of his dreams</i> (ibid. 37:20), his dream was fulfilled.

He said: ‘Go circumcise yourselves.’” “You fools,” he retorted, “did I not advise you at the very outset to serve him and to accumulate grain for yourselves at the same time? Did he not warn you repeatedly, through the years of plenty, that the famine was coming? Since you have neglected your own welfare, why do you complain to me? Why did you not store up grain in your homes during the past two or three or four years?” “All the grain we had in our homes,” they replied, “has rotted away.” “Have you no flour left even from yesterday?” he asked. “Even the bread in our baskets has become moldy,” they answered. Thereupon he told them: <i>Go unto Joseph: what he saieth to you, do</i> (ibid.). “If he is able to decree that our grain should rot and it does rot, we may well fear that if he should decree that we die, we will all die.” Hence, <i>what he saith to you, do.

Joseph said to himself: “If I should permit them to depart during the night, no one will be able to overcome them, since they have been likened to beasts, as it is said: <i>Judah is lion’s whelp</i> (Deut. 33:22), <i>Dan shall be a serpent in the way, a horned snake in the path</i> (Gen. 49:17), and <i>Naphtali is a hind let loose</i> (ibid., v. 21).” After they had journeyed but a short distance from the city, Joseph said (to his steward): “If they go a great distance, no one will be able to overcome them, so arise, and pursue them while the fear of the city is still upon them. When you reach them, reprimand them harshly at first and then gently, saying” <i>Is not this it in which my lord drinketh</i>, etc. (ibid., v. 5).",

Not one of them needed to help his companion. They arose, cudgeled Benjamin on his shoulders, and cried out: “O thief, son of a thief, you have disgraced us. You are, indeed, the son of your mother (Rachel), who likewise disgraced our father (by stealing Laban’s teraphim).” In reward for the blows struck upon his shoulders, the Shekhinah hovered between his shoulders, as it is said: <i>He covereth him all the day, and dwelleth between his shoulders</i> (Deut. 33:12)",

This fulfilled the verse <i>And behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars bowed down to me</i> (ibid. 37:9). Whereupon Joseph said to them: <i>What deed is this that ye have done? Know ye not that such a man as I will indeed divine</i> (ibid. 44:15). And he said to them also: “I will tell you why this youth stole it. He did so in order to divine through it and learn the whereabouts of his brother.” <i>And Judah said: “What shall we say unto my lord? What shall we speak?

Permit only the ones who attended me in my lifetime to attend to me when I die. During his lifetime, he resided for seventeen years in Sepphoris.

The word <i>sport</i> refers only to practicing idolatry, as it is said: <i>And the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to make sport</i> (Exod. 32:6). She said to him: <i>Abraham, cast out this bondwoman and her son</i> (Gen. 21:10), lest my son learn from his behavior.",
                "<i>And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight because of his son. And God said unto Abraham: “Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice”</i> (ibid. 21:11–12). You learn from this verse that Abraham was subordinate to Sarah in matters of prophecy. <i>Thereupon, Abraham arose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of wine</i> (ibid., v. 14). (This episode) teaches us that he hated Ishmael because he had gone astray, and as a result drove him and Hagar, his own wife, from his home empty-handed.",
                "Do you believe that Abraham, concerning whom it is written: <i>And Abraham was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold</i> (Gen. 13:2), would have driven his own wife and son from his home, without clothes or food, silver or cattle (for any other reason)? This (episode) simply teaches us that after Ishmael went astray, he was no longer concerned about him. But if this is so, what is meant by <i>And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight on account of his son</i>? It means that he was actually concerned (about the consequence of) Ishmael’s straying. You find that when Ishmael grew up, he would wait at the crossroads to murder and rob those who passed by, as it is said: <i>And he shall be a wild ass of a man; and his hand shall be against every man</i> (Gen. 16:12).",
                "Another example of this is stated in Scripture: <i>Now Isaac loved Esau</i> (ibid. 25:28). Apparently, Esau went astray because his father failed to chastise him. As we have learned, the wicked Esau committed five transgressions in one day: he slept with a betrothed maiden, killed a man, denied the concept of resurrection, rejected the essential principle of religion (i.e., became an atheist), and despised the birthright. All of these transgressions are indicated either specifically in verses in Scripture or by analogy with other verses in Scripture (<i>gezerah shavah</i>). Furthermore, he longed for his father’s death, so that he might slay his brother, as it is said: <i>Let the days of mourning for my father be at hand, then will I slay my brother, Jacob</i> (Gen. 27:41). He compelled Jacob to flee from his father’s house, while he went to Ishmael’s home to learn evil ways from him, and to add to the number of his wives, as it is said: <i>So Esau went unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives that he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son</i> (ibid. 28:9).",
                "Similarly, Absalom went astray because David failed to chastise and punish him. He tried to kill (his father), he slept with his father’s ten concubines, he forced his father to wander about barefoot and weeping, he brought about the slaughter of thousands of Israelites, and caused him innumerable trials, as it is written:, <i>A psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom, his son</i> (Ps. 3:1), and this is followed by: <i>Lord, how many are mine adversaries become</i>.",

                "David behaved similarly toward Adonijah. Because he did not reproach him or punish him he went astray, as it is written: <i>And his father had not grieved him all his life in saying: “Why hast thou done so?” … and he was born after Absalom</i> (I Kings 1:6). Was not Absalom actually the son of Micah, and Adonijah the son of Haggith? Why, then, does it say: <i>And he was born after Absalom</i>?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse gives the impression that they were born of the same mother.</i> To teach us that just as Absalom went astray because his father failed to chastise him, so did Adonijah, concerning whom it is written: <i>And his father had not grieved him all his life</i> (I Kings 1:2) by asking: “Why have you done such-and-such?” He went astray for the same reason. Hence Scripture states: <i>He that spareth his rod hateth his son</i>.",
                "<i>And he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes</i> (Prov. 13:24). This alludes to Abraham, who punished Isaac, taught him the law, and guided him in his ways, as it is written of him: <i>Because that Abraham harkened to My voice, and kept My charge</i> (Gen. 26:5). And it is also written elsewhere: <i>And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham begot Isaac</i> (ibid. 25:19). This teaches us that he resembled his father in every respect; in beauty, wisdom, strength, riches, and (the performance of) good deeds. You know this to be so from the fact that though Isaac, at the time of the sacrifice, was thirty-seven years of age, and Abraham was an old man, yet he bound him and tied him as though he were a sheep, and Isaac did not resist. Scripture states: <i>And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac, but unto the sons of the concubines that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts</i> (ibid., v. 5); that is to say, he distanced them from Isaac (so that he would have undisputed possession of the land). Hence, <i>And he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes</i>.",

According to Canticles Rabbah 1, he was surnamed Lemuel because he spoke against God in his heart. Lemuel is read as <i>lemu el</i> (“what is God?”). See Sanhedrin 70b.</i> R. Yosé the son of Hanina posed the question: What is meant by <i>The burden wherewith his mother corrected him</i>? It means that Bath-sheba turned him over a whipping post and punished him by beating him with a rod. What did she say to him as she did this? <i>What, my son? and what, O son of my womb? and what, O son of my vows?</i> (Prov. 31:2). With these words she was saying to him: “Everyone knows that your father is a God-fearing man, and if you should go astray, they will say that you are my son, and I am responsible for what you are.” <i>And what, O son of my womb?</i> “When the other women of your father’s house became pregnant, they saw the king’s face no more, but I went to him so that I might have a well-formed and powerful son.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It was believed that cohabitation during the last three months of pregnancy affected the embryo positively but the mother negatively.

That is to say, she was telling him: “What have you to do with kings who drink wine, become drunk, and say, <i>O Lemuel</i>, what is God to us? It is not for princes to say: <i>Where is strong drink?</i> (ibid.). Shall he, to whom all secrets of the world are revealed, drink wine and become drunk?” Therefore she chastised him, and <i>He was wiser than all men</i> (I Kings 5:11).",
                "It is taught that R. Simeon the son of Yohai stated: You find that the Holy One, blessed be He, bestowed three precious gifts upon Israel, but He gave them only through suffering: the law, the land of Israel, and the world-to-come. The law, for it is written: <i>Happy is the man whom Thou instructest, O Lord, and teachest out of Thy law</i> (Ps. 94:12). Concerning the land of Israel it is written: <i>You shall realize that the Lord your God chastises you as a man chastises his son</i> (Deut. 8:5). What is written afterward? <i>For the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land</i> (ibid., v. 7); and of the world-to-come it is written: <i>For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching is light, and reproofs of instruction are the way of life</i> (Prov. 6:23). Every father who chastises his son increases the child’s love and respect for his father, as it is written: <i>Chasten thy son, for there is hope; but set not thy heart on his destruction</i> (ibid. 19:18). Hence, <i>But he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes</i>."

David exclaimed: <i>Who can express the mighty acts of the Lord, or make all His praise be heard?</i> (Ps. 105:2), while Job declared: <i>Shall it be told Him that I speak? or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?</i> (Job 37:20).

Why was he beating him? This overseer was in charge of one hundred and twenty men, whom he would dispatch to their labors every morning, at the time of the crowing of the cock. Since he was wont to send them to their respective tasks, he would enter their homes. He noticed that Shelomith the daughter of Dibri was perfectly beautiful, without blemish, and he was anxious to possess her. (So one morning,) at the time of the crowing of the cock, after he (the Egyptian) had sent the Hebrew from his home, he had intercourse with the Hebrew’s wife, who thought that it was her husband who was still with her. Her husband returned (from his tasks) and observed the Egyptian leaving the house. He asked her: “Did he perhaps touch you?” “Yes, he did,” she replied, “but I thought it was you.” When the taskmaster learned that the man was angered by what had occurred, he forced him to work harder and would beat him.",

Obviously, he was aware that the Egyptian had violated the woman and was now smiting her husband. When he saw that there was no man there, (he knew) that the man was destined to die at his hands: <i>And he smote the Egyptian</i> (ibid., v. 12). With what did he smite him? Some say that he took a trowel full of clay and smashed his skull.

Likewise, they were the ones who went out to gather it up (on the Sabbath, which was forbidden), but were unable to find any (as Moses had warned).

That fact is that though Jethro had been the priest of idolaters, he always held idols in contempt. Jethro was convinced of their falseness and despised them. In fact he had decided to repent even prior to the arrival of Moses. He had summoned his townsmen and told them: “I have served you until now, but now I am old; select another priest.” Because he had returned the paraphernalia used in idolatrous worship, they were angry with him, and turned against him so violently that no one would speak to him, or work for him, or tend his flocks.

You learn from this that the shepherds were about to attack them, as is stated in the verse: <i>The betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her</i> (Deut. 22:27). <i>And when they came to Reuel, their father … they said: “An Egyptian saved us”</i> (Exod. 2:18).",

He said to them: “All that ye have told me concerning his drawing the water from the well and watering the flock is, indeed, a sign that he is a descendant of those who stood at the well, for the well recognized its master. <i>Call him, that he may eat bread</i> (ibid.), perhaps he will wed one of you,” as it is said: <i>He knew not aught save the bread which he did eat</i> (Gen. 39:6).

However, someone retorted: Is it not also written: <i>These are the generations of Terah, Terah</i> (Gen. 11:27). He replied: Even he had a portion in both worlds, for our patriarch Abraham was not buried until he was assured that his father, Terah, had repented, for it is said: <i>But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace</i> (ibid. 15:15). Abraham said to the Holy One, blessed be He: Master of the Universe: Shall I go to my fathers, though I have stored up good deeds in this world? The Holy One, blessed be He, answered: Be assured: Thy father hath repented. Hence his name was repeated."

Joshua the son of Karha held: <i>Here am I</i> implies: “I am ready for priesthood and for kingship.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said: You stand in the place of one of the pillars of the world, (for) Abraham has said <i>Here am I</i>, and now you are saying <i>Here am I. Draw not nigh hither</i> (ibid., v. 5). The word <i>hither</i> alludes to kingship, as it is said: <i>Whom am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that Thou hast brought me hither?</i> (II Sam. 7:18). Similarly it states: <i>Is there yet a man come hither?</i> (I Sam. 10:22). With reference to Joshua it is written: <i>Put off thy shoe from off thy foot</i> (Josh. 5:15), and it is also written concerning Moses: <i>Put off thy shoes from off thy feet</i> (Exod. 3:5). And He said: <i>I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham</i> (ibid., v. 6). He appeared to him through the voice of his father, Amram, lest he become frightened. Thereupon Moses rejoiced, exclaiming: “My father, Amram, still lives.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, I came to you enticingly so that you would not be terrified. Forthwith, Moses hid his face. Be assured, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, because you honored Me, I will cause you to be honored by all Israel. Hence, <i>they were afraid to come nigh him</i> (Exod. 34:30), for it is written of him: <i>For he was afraid</i> (ibid. 3:6). Because you did not wish to look—therefore <i>the similitude of the Lord doth he behold</i> (Num. 12:8). Because you hid your face, the children of Israel were afraid to look upon the face of Moses, for <i>The skin of his face sent forth beams, and they were afraid to come nigh him</i> (Exod. 34:30). <i>And now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come</i> (ibid. 3:9).

This is confirmed in the episode wherein Ben-hadad sent messengers to the king of Israel. “<i>Thus saith Ben-hadad: Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also, and thy children, even the goodliest are mine.” The king of Israel answered and said: “It is according to thy saying, my lord, O king; I am thine, and all that I have”</i> (I Kings 20:3). Later He sent another messenger to him saying: <i>But I will send my servants unto thee tomorrow about this time, and thy shall search thy house, and the houses of thy servants, and it shall be that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand and take it away</i> (I Kings 20:6). Does this verse imply that the things he (Ben-hadad) demanded at first were not desirable? He had asked for silver and gold, and surely they are desirable, as it is said: <i>And the choicest things of all nations shall come</i> (Hag. 2:7). He had demanded women, and that, indeed, is good to possess, as it is said: <i>Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes in a plague</i> (Ezek. 24:16).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel’s wife was taken from him.</i> He desired their children, and they surely are precious, as is said: <i>Yet will I slay the beloved fruit of their womb</i> (Hos. 9:6). The fact is that everything he wanted was desirable. What, then, is meant by <i>And it shall be that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes</i>? It refers to that which is most pleasant, the Torah, as it is said: <i>More to be desired are they then gold, yea, then much fine gold</i> (Ps. 19:11).",

He followed the advice of the elders, and <i>the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Arameans with a great slaughter</i> (ibid., v. 21).

No. We have learned that the Sanhedrin met in a semicircle, in order that each member might be able to see the others, while the two scribes sat before them to write down the testimony.

When one serpent is able to swallow other serpents, that is not unusual, but this serpent turned itself back into a rod again, as it is written: <i>But Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods</i> (ibid., v. 12). If a man made bundles out of the rods that were cast to the ground to become serpents, there would have been more than ten bundles, yet Aaron’s rod swallowed them all and it became no larger than it was previously.

The word <i>this</i> alludes to Pharaoh, who is compared to a snake, as is said: <i>The Lord with His sore and great and strong sword will punish leviathan the slant serpent</i> (Isa. 27:1).

The frogs, which had nothing pleasant about them, remained and made Egypt smell bad, but the beasts, whose skins were useful, did not remain. If they had been hornets and mosquitos, when they died, they too would have (made Egypt) smell bad. <i>And there came grievous swarms of beasts into the house of Pharaoh</i> (ibid., v. 20).

Therefore they were smitten with boils so that they would be unable to touch their own bodies (and derive any pleasure from such touch). R. Joshua the son of Levi declared that a great miracle took place in connection with the boils. If a man shoots an arrow upwards, it cannot travel more than a hundred cubits, yet Moses cast a handful of soot from a furnace heavenward, and though it is almost impossible to grasp a handful of soot, since it has no body, it soared upward until it reached the throne of glory. Another great miracle happened in connection with the boils. Moses took a handful of soot and filled Aaron’s hand as well as his own with it.

Hence it is said: <i>The fire flashing up amidst the hail</i>.

R.

                "Why was darkness inflicted upon them? Because the King of Kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, shows no partiality, and searches the heart and tries the kidneys of all. He brought darkness upon them because there were sinners in Israel who had Egyptian patrons, and enjoyed honor and wealth, and were unwilling to leave. And the Holy One, blessed be He, said: If I bring a plague upon them in broad daylight, from which they will die, the Egyptians will say that just as it passed over us, so does it pass over them. Hence, He brought darkness upon the Egyptians for three days, and <i>they saw not one another</i> (ibid., v. 23). The children of Israel had light in their dwellings, so that they could bury their dead without being seen by their enemies. <i>Even darkness which may be felt</i> (ibid., v. 21) is written. R. Abdimi the son of Hama said: The darkness was doubled and redoubled. An Egyptian who was standing was unable to sit, while one who was sitting was unable to stand, and one lying down could not rise. Three of the plagues were brought by Aaron, three by Moses, three by God, and one through the combined efforts of all of them. The blood, frogs, and gnats, which came from the earth, were brought by Aaron; the hail, locusts, and darkness, which came out of the air, were brought about by Moses, for he had power over earth and heaven; the swarms, the murrain, and the plague of the firstborn were brought about by God; while the boils were brought about by all of them.",

When an Israelite entered an Egyptian’s home and tried to borrow utensils of silver or gold, or garments, they would reply: “We have nothing to loan you.” Whereupon the Holy One, blessed be He, would illumine their dwellings, and the Israelite would say to them: “There it is, in that place.” This happened in order to fulfill the verse <i>And afterwards shall they come out with great substance</i> (Gen. 15:14)."

Similarly, before Jerusalem was chosen, the entire territory of Israel merited the revelation of the Divine Word, but after Jerusalem was selected, the Divine Word forsook the remainder of the land. Likewise, before the Temple was designated, the city of Jerusalem was considered suitable for the words of the Shekhinah, but after the establishment of the Temple, it removed itself from the rest of Jerusalem, as it is written: <i>For the Lord hath chosen Zion, He hath desired it for His habitation</i> (Ps. 132:13). And it says also: <i>That is My resting place forever; here will I dwell; for I have desired it</i> (ibid., v. 14). Prior to the selection of Aaron, every Israelite merited priesthood, as it is said: <i>It is an everlasting covenant of salt</i> (Num. 18:19), but after he was selected the other Israelites were deemed unfit for priesthood, as it is said: <i>And it shall be unto him, and to his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood</i> (ibid. 25:13). Before David was chosen, all Israelites were eligible for kingship, but after the selection of David, all Israelites lost the right of kingship, as it is said: <i>Ye have nothing to do with us to build a house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the Lord, the God of Israel</i> (Ezra 4:3).",

Do not be surprised at this, for even the dust that Moses hurled into the air soared about for forty days, as it is said: <i>And it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt</i> (Exod. 9:9). If the dust could spread over the whole of Egypt, which takes forty days to traverse, how much more likely it is that his voice could traverse forty parasangs. R.

Hence, just as the words <i>a sojourner and a hired servant</i>, etc., mentioned in the chapter on the paschal lamb disqualify an uncircumcised man from eating the paschal lamb, so does the phrase <i>A sojourner and a hired servant</i> used with reference to the <i>terumah</i> teach us that an uncircumcised man is disqualified from eating the <i>terumah</i> (the priest’s share of the crop).",

It may be interpreted to mean (that it may be eaten) by one group of people. How does it happen then that one may eat the paschal lamb in two places? For example, if men are seated inside a house when a beam splits above their heads, they are compelled to go outside to eat it, and if they are outside when it commences to rain, they are forced to go inside. Hence they may eat it in two places. If this (is so), what is meant by <i>Thou shalt not carry forth aught of the flesh abroad out of the house</i> (ibid., v. 46)? This means you may not carry it out from the group. <i>Thou shalt not carry forth aught of the flesh</i> refers to the meat on the outside of the bone and not to that which is within the bone (i.e., the marrow). <i>Neither shall ye break a bone thereof</i> (ibid.) indicates that you shall not break the bone of the paschal sacrifice, but that (does not apply) to the bones of any other sacrifices of less sanctity. It is not a transgression of the commandment: Neither shall you break a bone <i>thereof. All the congregation of Israel shall keep it</i> (ibid., v. 47). Why is this said? Since Scripture states: <i>Draw out, and take you lambs according to your families</i> (Exod. 12:21), (you might think that the paschal lamb can be brought [to the Temple] only by a family group. Nevertheless) this verse informs us that the Passover offering of subsequent generations may be brought by mixed groups.",

Does this mean that a stranger who is converted should offer a paschal sacrifice at the first opportunity? Yes, for Scripture says: <i>And he shall be as one that is born in the land</i> (ibid.). Therefore, just as one born in the land offers his sacrifice on the fourteenth day, so the proselyte should do so on the fourteenth day. If he is converted, however, between the two Passovers,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, between the fifteenth day of Nisan and the fourteenth day of Iyar, the second Passover (Num. 19:10).</i> he should offer the sacrifice on the second Passover. <i>Let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it</i> (ibid.).

If one wishes to perform the two rituals, the commandment of circumcision and the commandment of the paschal lamb, which takes precedence? <i>Let all his males be circumcised</i> is stated first, and that is followed by <i>And let him come near and keep it.

Since the word <i>set aside</i> is used in the former verse, just as in the latter verse, one may not sanctify the priests’ share of the offering except during the life of its mother, so in this instance one may not sanctify the priests’ share except during the lifetime of its mother. If this is so, then just as the latter verse refers only to male animals, so the former verse applies only to male animals. Hence, when Scripture says <i>Whatsoever passeth under the rod</i>, it means (to include) male and female. <i>All that openeth the womb</i> indicates that a prematurely born offspring is exempted from the law of the firstborn. The one that is born after the premature offspring is also considered not to be the firstborn.",

But when another general statement follows the preceding verse, <i>The firstborn of man shalt thou redeem</i> (Num. 18:15), we have an instance of a general statement and a particular one followed by another general statement, which must be considered to include anything resembling that which is stated in the particular.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The sixth of Rabbi Ishmael’s thirteen rules.</i> In this case the particular statement stipulates movable property that has no permanency, and so the general statement must refer to movable property that has no permanency.

If a man has five wives who were virgins, and they gave birth to five sons, must he redeem them all? Yes, for <i>All that openeth the womb that is a male—thou shalt redeem</i>. The Holy One, blessed be He, said: The firstlings are the priest’s property and are not considered as a gift. Why did Scripture need to say: <i>All the firstborn among thy sons thou shalt redeem?</i> To point out that if a man’s father did not redeem him, he must redeem himself.

Where is that located? The school of R. Yannai said: It is the place on the child’s head where the child’s brain is seen to pulsate. The four passages included in the phylacteries are mentioned in Scripture. They are: <i>Sanctify unto me</i> (Exod. 13:2), <i>And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee</i> (ibid. 13:11), <i>Hear, O Israel</i> (Deut. 6:4), <i>And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken</i> (ibid. 11:13).

These four are included also in the phylactery that is placed on the forehead, but they are written on four separate slips of parchment. Whence do we know that four separate slips of parchment are necessary? From the word <i>totafot. Tot</i> is a Coptic word meaning “two”; and <i>fot</i> is an African word meaning “two,” thus making four for the head phylactery, and a total of five parchments in all. How do we know that the arm phylactery contains (only) one (parchment)? Since it is written: <i>And it shall be for a sign upon thy hand</i> (the word <i>your hand</i> is spelled with an extra <i>heh</i>, which has a numerical value of five) and so so there are five (parchments) in all. Hence you learn that the phylactery containing the four verses on separate pieces of parchment is placed upon the head, and the phylactery with the one parchment, containing the same four verses, is placed upon the arm. It might be possible to maintain that the phylactery with the four parchments is placed upon the arm, and so Scripture says: <i>And it shall be for a sign upon thy hand</i>. Where is it placed on the hand? You might maintain that it is placed on the arch of the hand just as it is placed on the arch of the head. Therefore, Scripture says: <i>And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart</i> (Deut. 6:6). From this statement they concluded: One must place the phylactery on the part of the arm opposite the heart. You might contend that the phylacteries are to be put on at night. Hence Scripture says: <i>In its season from day to day</i> (Exod. 13:10), namely, in the daytime and not at night. You might maintain: Perhaps they are to be donned on the Sabbath or the holy days. Therefore Scripture says: <i>From day to day</i>, implying that there are days on which a man dons them and days on which he does not. The days on which he does not don them are the Sabbath and the holy days. You might say: Perhaps he should place the phylacteries on his right hand. Scripture, therefore, says: <i>Upon thy hand</i>, and the word <i>thy hand</i> is used only in reference to the left hand, as it is said: <i>Yea, My hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand hath spread out the heavens</i> (Isa. 48:13). Scripture likewise says; <i>Her hand she put to the tentpin, and her right hand to the workman’s hammer</i> (Judg. 5:26).",
                "How do we know that the passages are to be on one roll of parchment?

R. Rami the son of Abba stated that R. Simeon the son of Lakish said: It is the size of the snapping finger. Which is the snapping finger? The middle finger. And its width is that of the thickness of barley corn. The law enjoins one to put the hand phylactery on first, and then pronounce the blessing: “Our God, who sanctifies us by His commandments and has commanded us to put on the phylacteries.” After that one dons the head phylactery while offering the blessing: “Our God, King of the Universe, who sanctifies us and has commanded us concerning the law of the phylacteries.” However, if he speaks in between the hand phylactery and the head phylactery, he is guilty of a transgression for which he must return home from the battlefront.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As laid down in Deut. 20:8, according to the rabbis; one who has a transgression on his conscience should not remain on the battlefield of a war of conquest, aside from Joshua’s wars.

However, if one should interrupt the blessings of the phylacteries in order to respond with the words “His great name” or the Kedushah, he has canceled the first blessing and must recite both of them again. Surely it is not necessary to state that if he discusses secular matters during that time, he is guilty of a serious transgression. When he takes off the phylacteries he must remove the head phylactery first and then the hand phylactery.",
                "One might think that the law about the phylacteries applies, likewise, to women. Hence Scripture says: <i>That the law of the Lord may be in thy mouth</i> (Exod. 13:9). And who are they that study the law? Men. Therefore women are exempt from so doing, for they do not devote themselves to the law. It may be possible to conclude that the law of phylacteries applies to children. Therefore Scripture says: <i>And Thou shalt keep it;</i> and that applies to all who are diligent in the study of the Torah and in the performance of good deeds. Hence a child is exempt. But if a child is a Bar Mitzvah or well informed, he must fulfill the law. It is possible that one may neglect to examine the phylacteries, and so Scripture says: <i>from year to year</i>. From this statement they conclude that a man should examine his phylacteries at least once every twelve months. <i>From year to year</i> is mentioned in this verse, and further on <i>For a full year shall he have the right of redemption</i> (Lev. 25:29) is stated. Just as in the former case a year means twelve months, so also in the latter instance a year implies twelve months. This is the opinion of the School of Hillel. The School of Shammai, however, argues: One need not examine them ever after. So Shammai said: “These are the phylacteries of my mother’s father.”",

Why, then, does Scripture say: <i>And the Lord went before them</i>? In order to reveal to the nations of the world the extent of His love for Israel, so that they would pay homage to them. However, not only did they not pay homage to them, but they slaughtered them most cruelly. Because of that it says: <i>I will gather all the nations, and will bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat; and I will enter into judgment with them there for My people and for My heritage Israel, whom they scattered among the nations</i> (Joel 4:2). It does not say “Because they committed idolatry” or “committed sexual crimes” or (were guilty) “of shedding blood,” but rather: <i>For My people and for My heritage Israel whom they have scattered among the nations</i>.

Likewise, since Scripture states: <i>And they smote the men that were at the door with blindness, both small and great</i> (ibid. 19:11), they smote the least important ones first and then the greater ones. Likewise, in accordance with the verse <i>I will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast</i>, man was punished first and then the beast. Another illustration is in the verse <i>Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword</i> (Deut. 13:16). He smote the inhabitants of the city with the sword, and then he slew the cattle. Similarly, <i>And her belly shall swell</i> (Num. 5:27) is followed by <i>And her thighs shall fall away</i>. That is, the part of the body that sinned first was punished first.

To teach us that just as a worm has only a soft and tender mouth with which to strike at a hard cedar tree, so Israel has only its prayers. Idolaters are likened to a cedar, as Scripture states: <i>Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon</i> (Exod. 31:3). <i>And yea, the Lord breaketh in pieces the cedars in Lebanon</i> (Ps. 29:5). Whenever their enemies overpowered them, the Israelites would become penitent and would plead and pray. Hence it says: <i>I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren which I took out of the hand of the Amorites, with my sword and with my bow</i> (Gen 48:29). Did he actually seize it with his sword and his bow? Has it not already been said: <i>For I trust not in my bow, neither can my sword save me</i> (Ps. 44:7)? This implies that <i>my sword</i> refers to prayer and <i>my bow</i> to beseeching. Scripture says: <i>And this for Judah, and he said: “Hear Lord, the voice of Judah,”</i> etc. (Deut. 33:7). Similarly, David said: <i>Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin; but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast taunted</i> (I Sam. 17:45). It says also: <i>Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we will make mention of the name of the Lord his God</i> (Ps. 20:8), and it is said: <i>There is none beside Thee to help, between the mighty and him that hath no strength; help us, O Lord our God; for we rely on Thee, and in Thy name are we come against this multitude. Thou art the Lord our God; let not man prevail against thee</i> (II Chron. 14:10). Concerning Moses it states: <i>And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom … how our fathers went down into Egypt, and when we cried unto the Lord, He heard our voice</i> (Num. 20:14–15). He said to them: Ye exalt yourselves because of your fathers’ legacy to you, but <i>the voice is the voice of Jacob, and the hands are the hands of Esau</i> (Gen. 27:40). Thus the verse <i>The children of Israel cried out unto the Lord</i> indicates that they followed the practices of their fathers.

As he continued along, a second member of his family was swallowed up and then a third. King Shapur was deeply saddened, but he did not know what to do. His counselors advised him: “Summon ten mighty men to fill the place with a layer of straw.” He summoned them and they did so. They placed straw around the serpent, and he swallowed it. Then they placed more straw around him, and he swallowed it as well. This continued until his belly swelled up, and they killed him. Hence, <i>Who led thee through the great and dreadful wilderness, wherein were serpents, fiery serpents, and scorpions, and thirsty ground where was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint</i> (Deut. 8:15). It says also: <i>The burden of the beasts of the south. Through the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the lioness and the lion, the viper and the flying serpent</i> (Isa. 30:6). The word <i>ef’eh</i> is employed with reference to a viper. They say that when a viper looks at the shadow of a bird flying through the air, the bird immediately becomes entranced and falls apart. Nevertheless, they did not say: <i>Where is the Lord that brought us out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought and of the shadow of death</i> (Jer. 2:6).

Why does the Scripture say <i>and found no water</i>? Because there was no water even in their water containers, as is said in the verse: <i>And the nobles send their lads for water; they come to the pits, and find no water; they are ashamed and confounded, and cover their heads</i> (Jer. 14:3).

Scripture teaches this in the verses <i>And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken</i> (Jer. 17:24), and <i>It shall be, too, if thou shalt forget</i> (Deut. 8:19). How is that? If a man desires to hear only that which is to his advantage, he will hear that which is not to his advantage as well; and if he wishes to forget when it is to his advantage to do so, he will forget even when it is not to his advantage to do so. The power to choose is given to man. <i>If it concerneth the scorners, He scorneth them, but unto the humble He giveth grace</i> (Prov. 3:34). If a man hearkens to one command, he will be caused to hearken to many; but if he desires to forget even one commandment, he will be caused to forget many. Therefore it is written: <i>If thou shalt begin to forget, thou wilt in time forget</i>. Others reach this conclusion from the verse <i>If thou at all take thy neighbor’s garment to pledge</i> (Exod. 22:25); that is, if you should seize one garment as a pledge, you will ultimately take many pledges because of it."

It is possible to explain every instance in which this phrase occurs in accordance with this statement. Hence the verse <i>Now these are the ordinances</i> adds praise to earlier generations, as it is said: <i>There he made for them a statute and an ordinance</i> (Exod. 15:25).

Because it is forbidden (for Jews) to argue before them? Scripture states: <i>Which thou shalt set before them</i>. That is, before the children of Israel and not before the Cuthites. For anyone who shuns Israel’s judges and testifies before an idolatrous judge renounces the Holy One, blessed be He, first, and later renounces Israel’s law, as it is said: <i>For their rock is not our Rock, and our enemies’ judge</i> (Deut. 32:31). To what may this be compared? To a patient examined by a doctor. He tells the members of (the patient’s) household: “Give him whatever food he desires, withhold nothing from him.” (Later) he visits another patient and advises his household: “Be careful that he does not eat or drink certain things.” They remonstrate with him, saying, “One patient you permit to eat whatever he wishes, while the other you advise not to eat certain things.” Thereupon he replied: “The first patient will not survive, and that is why I told them not to deny him anything, for whether he eats or not, he will die. However, the other patient will live, and so I advised him to eat only certain things lest his illness be aggravated.” So, too, are the ordinances of the idolaters, as is said: <i>For the statutes of the people were vanity</i> (Jer. 10:3), and it is written elsewhere: <i>Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and ordinances whereby they should not live</i> (Ezek. 20:25). However, to Israel I gave commandments and desirable statutes, as it is said: <i>Ye shall therefore keep My statutes, and My ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live by them</i> (Lev. 18:5).",

If a judge acts differentially toward a particular witness and perverts the law because of him, the Shekhinah departs (from him), for it is written: <i>The Lord is good to all</i> (Ps. 145:9).

Daniel went to him, trembling, as is said: <i>Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was appalled for a while, and his thoughts affrighted him. The king spoke and said: “Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation, affright thee”</i> (ibid., v. 16). <i>Belteshazzar answered and said: “My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine adversaries”</i> (ibid.).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse seems to suggest that Daniel is cursing Israel, when in fact he is threatening Nebuchadnezzar.</i> Who was Nebuchadnezzar’s hater?

Then Daniel raised his eyes heavenward and said: “My Master, My Lord, let the dream and its explanation be fulfilled against Nebuchadnezzar, your enemy and your adversary.” When Nebuchadnezzar beheld the dream and heard the explanation, he inquired of Daniel: “What do you advise me to do?” He replied: “The unhappy ones whom you have exiled from your land are starving, thirsty, and naked. Open your storehouses and feed them if you would counteract the dream,” as is said: <i>Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by almsgiving, and thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; that there may be a lengthening of thy prosperity</i> (ibid., v. 24).",
                "Do not believe for a moment that the righteous Daniel would have offered such advice to Nebuchadnezzar, who hated the Omnipotent One, if he had not known that Israel was wasting away from hunger as it wandered about in exile. Hence he gave this advice to him because of his concern for them, and because he knew that ultimately Nebuchadnezzar’s soul would suffer. The wicked one immediately opened his storehouses and distributed their contents to them for twelve months. However, at the end of the twelve months the wicked one forgot his dream (and stopped feeding them). While walking about his palace one day, he heard the tumultuous uproar of the poor crying before his storehouses, and He asked his servants: “What is this noise I hear?” They informed him: “The poor whom you carried into exile are pleading for food.” A wicked thought entered his heart at once: <i>The king spoke and said: “Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for a royal dwelling-place, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?”</i> (ibid., v. 27). Then he added: “Were it not for the wealth I possessed, how could I have built this country?” He commanded that they be stopped, as it is written: <i>While the word was in the king’s mouth</i> (ibid., v. 28). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Why were you untroubled during the past twelve months? Was it not because of the righteous deeds you were performing?

Heaven and earth borrow from each other, as it is said: <i>The Lord will open unto thee His good treasure the heaven</i> (Deut. 28:12). The Torah and the commandments, likewise, borrow from each other, as is said: <i>Keep My commandments and live</i> (Prov. 7:2).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Torah is a source of life, and so too are the commandments.</i>",
                "All the creations of the Holy One, blessed be He, borrow from each other yet live at peace with each other; only man borrows form his fellow man and the lender seeks to devour the borrower through interest and robbery. One who takes interest is actually saying to the Holy One, blessed be He: Do You not take payment from Your world in which Your creatures reside? Payment from the earth which You water, from the flowers which You cause to grow, from the light You make shine, from the soul which You breathe (into us), from the body which You protect? The Holy One, blessed be He, replied: See how much I have loaned, yet I do not take interest, and see how much the earth has loaned you for which it does not take interest. I take only the principal which I have loaned, and the earth takes back only her principal, as it is said: <i>And the dust returneth to the earth as it was, and the spirit returneth unto God who gave it</i> (Eccles. 12:7).",
                "What is written about one who takes interest? <i>He that hath given forth upon interest, and hath taken increase; shall he then live? He shall not live</i> (Exod. 18:13). This may be compared to a king who makes his treasures available to a certain individual who later begins to oppress the poor, kill the widows, embarrass the needy, despoil the naked, do violence and theft, indulge in falsehood, and squander the king’s treasures. Similarly, the Holy One, blessed be He, opens His treasure to the wealthy, with all that He possesses in it, as it is said: <i>Mine is the silver, and Mine the gold</i> (Hag. 2:8). Then the rich man begins to loan money on interest. And he starts to taunt the widows and oppress them with interest, to embarrass the poor, and to humiliate the naked who seek charity from him, even though the Holy One, blessed be He, had declared: <i>Whoso mocketh the poor blasphemeth his Maker</i> (Prov. 17:5). If a man’s neighbor is in debt to him for a hundred zuzim, he beats him, strips him, does violence to him, steals from him, and destroys the pledges he entrusted to him. Then the Holy One, blessed be He, says: <i>Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou was not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! When thou hast ceased to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled</i> (Isa. 33:1). The Holy One, blessed be He, gave him wealth from His treasure house, which was a treasure house of truth, and he made it into a treasure house of falsehood, as it is said: <i>Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity, ye have eaten the fruit of lies, for thou didst trust</i> (Hos. 10:13). Hence, <i>when the whirlwind passeth, the wicked is not more</i> (Prov. 10:25).

You find that Korah and his followers would not have been destroyed had they not embarrassed Moses and Aaron. Similarly, the men of Jerusalem were stricken only because they despised the words of the prophets, as it is said: <i>That they mocked the messengers of God, and despised His words; until the wrath of the Lord arose against His people, till there was no remedy</i> (II Chron. 36:16). It is also written: <i>They have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return</i> (Jer. 5:3). Thus the Holy One, blessed be He, reminded the Israelites concerning the respect due to elders, who had warned Israel against idolatry, as it is said: <i>And in all things that I have said unto you take ye heed; and make no mention of the name of other gods</i> (Exod. 23:13).",

The Holy One, blessed be He, established the festival of unleavened bread, on which He performed miracles in their behalf in Egypt; the harvest festival (Shavuot), on which He gave them the Torah, the fruits of which they were to enjoy in this world and their interest in the world-to-come, as it is said: <i>My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and My produce than choice silver</i> (Prov. 8:19); and the feast of ingathering (Sukkoth), on which the Holy One, blessed be He, fills their homes with blessings, as is said: <i>Honor the Lord with thy substance, and with the first-fruits of all thine increase; so shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy vats shall overflow with new wine</i> (Prov. 3:9–10).

When a man performs one precept, one angel is assigned to guard him; when he performs two precepts, two angels are given to him; when he performs all the precepts, many angels are assigned to him, as it is said: <i>For He will give His angels charge over thee</i>. Who are these angels? They are the beings who will protect him from demons, as it is said: <i>A thousand may fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand</i> (ibid., v. 7). What is meant by <i>may fall</i>? It means that they force (their opponents) to surrender to him, as it is said in the Book of Chronicles: <i>Of Manasseh also there fell away some to David</i> (I Chron. 12:20), and it is written as well: <i>As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh</i> (ibid., v. 29).",

Levi said: The demons wear masks similar to those on a miller’s ass, but when (a man’s) sins cause the mask to fall off the demon, the man becomes mad (at the sight). However, as long as the angel cries out, the man is safe; but if he is silent, the man is affected at once. The angel says: So-and-so must die, as it is said: <i>Yea, his soul draweth near unto the pit, and his life to the destroyers</i> (Job 33:22). “To death” is not written here, but rather <i>to the destroyers</i>, namely, to those angels of destruction to whom man is handed over.",

At that time <i>He is gracious unto him, and saith: “Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom”</i> (Job 33:23–24). Thus if a man fulfills many precepts, ten thousand and a thousand angels guard him, but if he is perfect in understanding the Torah and in the performance of good deeds, the Holy One, blessed be He, Himself guards him, as it is said: <i>The Lord is thy keeper; the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand</i> (Ps. 121:5).",

Prior to the erection of the Temple, the idolatrous nations, upon hearing the voice of the Lord, became panic-stricken within their tents. The Holy One, blessed be He, therefore, said to Moses: <i>Make Me a Sanctuary, that I may speak with thee in it</i>. Furthermore, I am anxious to dwell among My children. When the ministering angels heard that, they began to cry out: Master of the Universe, why do you leave the heavenly spheres in order to descend to the lower spheres? <i>O Lord, our God, how glorious is Thy name in all the earth!

You may know that this is so from the scriptural verse: <i>And thou shalt make curtains of goats’ hair, and the length of each curtain shall be thirty cubits</i> (ibid., v. 8). How else could one possibly obtain a curtain thirty cubits in length (other than from a miraculous creation)? From this you learn that it must have been as R. Nehemiah stated. However, you must not be of the opinion that the curtains alone came from a miraculous event, for the cedar beams did likewise. Where did the cedar beams come from? Jacob our patriarch planted them at the time he descended to Egypt. He told his children: My sons, ultimately you will be redeemed from this place, and the Holy One, blessed be He, will say to you: “You will be redeemed,” so that you may build a Sanctuary for Him. Therefore, go plant cedar trees now so that when He commands you to erect a Sanctuary for Him, beams of cedar will be available. Forthwith they arose and planted as he had commanded them to do.",

Whence do we know that they sang a song? Because it is written: <i>Then shall all the trees of the world sing for joy before the Lord</i> (Ps. 96:12). The word <i>then</i> is employed in reference to a song, as is said: <i>Then sang Moses</i> (Exod. 15:1). When did that occur? At the time the Sanctuary was erected from them. The Holy One, blessed be He, commanded Moses concerning the Tabernacle: <i>And thou shalt make the boards for the Tabernacle of acacia wood, standing up</i> (ibid. 26:15). “Thou shalt make boards” is not written here, but rather <i>Thou shalt make</i> the <i>boards standing</i>, that is, they should use those boards that their fathers had previously prepared for them.

You find that they did not leave that place until Phinehas arose and turned away His wrath, as it is said: <i>Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned My wrath away from the children of Israel</i> (ibid., v. 11). The Holy One, blessed be He, declared: In the world-to-come I will heal at Shittim, as it is said: <i>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the brooks of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the Lord, and shall water the valley of Shittim</i> (Joel 4:18)."

The congregation of Israel said to the Holy One, blessed be He, Master of the Universe: You will call, and I will respond.

He said: All the chiefs of the tribes brought a dedicatory offering, but I have had no share in the sacrifices. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Be assured, all the other tribes will bring only one offering, but you alone will perform the dedication before the veil, which is <i>without the curtain of testimony in the Tent of Meeting, for Aaron and his sons shall set it in order</i> (Exod. 27:21).

However, Scripture reserves pure olive oil for the light, but not for the meal-offering. R. Hanina, chief of the priests, said: I used to minister in the Temple, and there was a miraculous thing which occurred with the lamp. When they lit the lamp at the beginning of the year, it did not go out until the following year. But once, it happened that the olives did not provide sufficient pure olive oil, and the priests began to weep. Then R. Hanina, chief of the priests, continued: I was in the Temple at that time, and I discovered that the lamp was burning more brightly than at any time during the year. That, indeed, was a miracle, and that is why Scripture specifies pounded pure olive oil beaten for the light, but not for the meal-offering. Why is that so? Since the Holy One, blessed be He, has decreed that they should light the lamp only once a year, they must burn pure pounded olive oil in the lamp, but inasmuch as the meal-offering was sacrificed every day, <i>pure oil pounded</i> was not specified. Our sages of blessed memory said: When they lit the lamp, all the courtyards in Jerusalem were illumined by them.

That evening the man who could see said to the blind man: “Go, light a lamp for us.” The other replied: “All day long, you led me through darkness, because I could not see even myself, and now you tell me to light the lamp.” The seeing man symbolizes the Holy One, blessed be He, concerning whom it is written: <i>Which are the eyes of the Lord, that run to and fro through the whole earth</i> (Zech. 4:10), and the blind man symbolizes Israel, about whom it is said: <i>We grope for the wall like the blind, yea, as they have no eyes do we grope; we stumble at noonday as in the twilight; we are in dark places like the dead</i> (Isa. 59:10).",

What does Scripture say: <i>And Moses said to Aaron: “What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought a great sin upon them?”</i> (ibid. 32:21). Obviously they must have killed Hur.",

He took the gold nose rings and cast them into the fire, as it is said: <i>I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf</i> (ibid., v. 24). Aaron was afraid that the Holy One, blessed be He, was angry with him, and so the Holy One, blessed be He, told Moses: <i>And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them</i> (Exod. 29:1); that is, elevate Aaron and his sons to the high priesthood, to make it known that Aaron had acted only out of fear.

What is the meaning of <i>may cover</i>? It is an expression that indicates forgiveness, as in the verse <i>Thou hast covered up all their sins</i> (Ps. 85:3). Whenever the cloud of incense ascended and spiraled upward, like a cluster of grapes, on the Day of Atonement, he knew that Israel’s sins were forgiven, as it is said: <i>My beloved is unto me as a cluster of henna in the vineyards of En-gedi</i> (Song 1:14). If the smoke of the incense resembled a cluster and rose straight upward, he knew that Israel was forgiven and his service was acceptable, but if the smoke of the incense did not cover the ark-cover he knew that he would die, as it is said: <i>That the cloud of the incense may cover the ark-cover that is upon the testimony, that he die not</i> (Lev. 16:13).

The Holy One, blessed be He, said: The sacrifices that you offer to Me are as desirable as incense. You know that all the sacrifices exist to meet the needs of Israel. How is that so? The sin-offering is brought because of sin and guilt; the burnt offering is brought because of a thought in one’s heart; the peace-offerings are brought to atone for violations of a positive commandment, while incense is brought, not because of sin or transgression or guilt, but only out of sheer joy.

Just as the thorns from a bush that cling to a man’s garment will cling to another part of the garment when he tries to brush them off, so the government of Esau (Rome), while still collecting a crop tax from Israel, would impose a head tax. And even before the head tax was fully collected, it would impose a levy for the care of its soldiers. The Holy One, blessed be He, did not do that: <i>For the path of the upright is even</i>, made level before Israel.",

For example, a man is extremely anxious to enter his bridal chamber, for no day is dearer to him than that day. It is the day on which he rejoices with his bride. What does he do? He spends a considerable amount of money to set up the bridal chamber and he comes to have intercourse with her.

What compelled him to turn from her? Was it a snake biting him, a scorpion stinging him, or a thorn between them? No, only the words of the Torah, since it is said: <i>And thou shalt not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is impure by her uncleanness</i> (Lev. 18:19). Hence it is written: <i>Set about like lilies</i>.",

If their sins could do that, how much more so would their meritorious deeds. You find that when Jacob sent Joseph to his brethren, they watched him approach and said to one another: <i>Behold, this dreamer cometh. Come now, therefore, and let us slay him</i> (Gen. 37:19–20). They hurled him into the pit and said: Let us eat and drink, and then we will kill him. After eating and drinking, they were about to say grace when Judah said to them: We are planning to take a life, yet now we would bless God. If we should do this, we would be blaspheming against God and not blessing Him.

If despite their sin he could feed the world and cause it to endure, how much more beneficial would have been the result if they had acted meritoriously. Similarly, observe what happened to the tribes in the chapter Shekalim, when they were permitted to atone for the incident of the golden calf.

Tanhuma the son of Abba began the discussions with the verse <i>Sweet is the sleep of a laboring man, whether he eat little or much; but the satiety of the rich will not suffer him to sleep</i> (Eccles. 5:11). They said to Solomon after he spoke these words: Surely you must be jesting, inasmuch as it is written concerning you: <i>For he was wiser than all men</i> (I Kings 5:11). And now you say: <i>Sweet is the sleep of a laboring man, whether he eat little or much</i>. Is it not a fact that anyone who is hungry because he ate only a little cannot sleep, while one who eats much sleeps well? He replied: I am speaking here only of righteous men and those who labor in (study) of the law. For example, a man who lives only thirty years may have devoted himself from his tenth year until the day of his death to the law and the commandments, while another man, who lives eighty years, may have devoted himself to the law and the commandments from his tenth year to the day of his death. You might say: Woe to the first one, who labored only twenty years in the law, while the other devoted himself to it for seventy years. Surely the Holy One, blessed be He, will give him a greater reward than He will give to him who labored in the law only twenty years. Hence I said: <i>Whether he eat little or much</i>. For the one who had devoted twenty years to the Torah might well say to the Holy One, blessed be He: “If you had not removed me from this world in the prime of my life, I would have had additional years to devote to the law and the commandments.” Therefore I repeat: <i>Whether he eat little or much</i>, the reward of one is equal to the reward of the other.",

If the king should say to him: “You worked with the others for only two hours; go finish your time,” he could reply: “If you had not interrupted and taken me from my work, my pay would have been even greater than theirs.” Similarly the Holy One, blessed be He, may His name be blessed, is a King, and those who labor in the Torah are His workers. One who has devoted himself to the Torah for fifty or thirty or twenty years is able to say: “If you had not taken me from this world, I would still be occupied in the study of the Torah.” Hence Solomon said: <i>Whether he eat little or much</i> his reward is the same.",

In fact, a man sated with food falls asleep more quickly (than others). Solomon replied: I was speaking about those who possess the riches of the Torah and not material possessions. For example, a man who is distinguished and wealthy in the knowledge of the Torah will teach many students and disseminate his knowledge among the masses, and he is satisfied (in his knowledge) of Torah.

What He has been doing since the time of creation, I can do easily in one hour.” “It may appear a simple matter to you,” he replied, “but to Him it is as difficult as splitting the Red Sea, for it is written: <i>God maketh the solitary to dwell in a house</i> (Ps. 68:7).”",

Moses replied: <i>It is not the voice of them that shout after a victory, neither is it the voice of them that cry after being overcome, but the noise of them that sing do I hear</i> (ibid.). What is the meaning of <i>The noise of them that sing do I hear</i>? It means: I hear the voice of those who are reproaching and blaspheming. Hence it is written: <i>And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted</i>.",

Is there anything lacking in Scripture that it should add: <i>And wrought great provocations</i>? They were reproaching and blaspheming as they sated themselves with the manna and brought some of it as an offering to the calf. They blasphemed with all their strength and indulged in revelry, but nevertheless: <i>Thou withholdest not Thy manna from their mouth</i> (ibid., v. 20). Hence, <i>Unto Thee O Lord belongeth righteousness</i>. R. Levi said: While Israel remained on the ground fashioning a calf, as it is said: <i>And he received it at their hand, and fashioned it with an engraving tool</i> (Exod. 32:4), the Holy One, blessed be He, was above them engraving the life-giving words on the tablets, as it is said: <i>And He gave unto Moses when He had made an end of speaking</i>."

The gift a man gives out of his own possessions resounds to his advantage, as is told about Abun Ramaah,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Deut.

That is why he was called Abun, the deceiver. What did our rabbis do after that? They sat him amongst themselves to fulfill what is written: <i>A man’s gift maketh room for him</i>. Another explanation of <i>And He gave unto Moses</i> is contained in the verse: <i>Thou hast also given me Thy shield of salvation, and Thy right hand hath holden me up; and Thy condescension hath made me great</i> (Ps. 18:26). <i>Thou hast given me Thy shield of salvation</i> refers to the Israelites, who trust in the Holy One, blessed be He; <i>Thy right hand hath holden me up</i> alludes to the Torah, as it says: <i>At His right hand a fiery law unto them</i> (Deut. 33:2); <i>And Thy condescension hath made me great</i> relates to the condescension of the Holy One, blessed be He.",
                "Is there any condescension greater than that shown by the Holy One, blessed be He? R.

This tells us that the Holy One, blessed be He, permitted him to depart first. Is there an example of condescension greater than this? Similarly it is expressed in the verse <i>Moses spoke, and God answered him loudly</i> (Exod. 19:19). Should not the verse say: “The Holy One, blessed be He, spoke, and Moses answered him loudly”? And it is written elsewhere: <i>And the Lord said unto me: “This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, neither shall any man enter it, for the Lord, the God of Israel hath entered in by it”</i> (Ezek. 44:1). <i>But on the Sabbath day it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened</i> (ibid. 46:1). The honor of a human king demands that he enter through the largest gate rather than through a small one, but the Holy One, blessed be He, entered through the smallest gate.",

Normally, if a pupil is ill and his master intends to visit him, his fellow students visit him first and the master comes later.

However, the Holy One, blessed be He, mentioned his deeds first and then His name, as in the verse: <i>In the beginning created God</i>. Is there any humility greater than this? Ordinarily, a king will set aside supplies and precious gifts for the legionaries who are loyal to him, and he will divide the plunder with them. If they should rebel, however, he no longer feels any obligation to them. Though the Israelites fashioned a golden calf, the Holy One, blessed be He, was concerned with saving their lives, as it is said: <i>For that is thy life and the length of thy days</i> (Deut. 30:20)."

On that day He said to him: <i>I have pardoned according to thy word</i> (Num. 14:20). Then the Holy One, blessed be He, established that day as the day of forgiveness and pardon for the future generations (Yom Kippur), as it is said: <i>For on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you</i> (Lev. 16:30).

However, if he should put it on beneath his other garments, without the mixed material touching his body, he is permitted to do so, for it is said: <i>Neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together</i>.

Now this one is being given the authority to build the Sanctuary! Moses seeks to elevate him by giving him this great honor.” Moses attempted to explain.

Why were they commanded to do that? Because the astrologers had told him: “The redeemer of Israel will be born on that day, but we do not know whether he will be born to an Egyptian woman or an Israelite.” At the time he assembled every Egyptian and said to them: “Loan me your sons for a day,” as is said: <i>Every son that is born ye shall cast</i> (ibid., v. 22).

This alludes to the students of the Torah, for just as the wood was greatly adorned by the gold that overlaid it, so the students of the Torah are adorned by the Torah within their hearts. Just as men speak of pure gold, so the Torah purifies the heart and the kidneys of the scholar, as it is written: <i>More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold</i> (Ps. 19:11).<i> And Bezalel made the ark</i>. We find that when the Holy One, blessed be he, told Moses to construct the Tabernacle, He described every detail to him, saying: <i>Thou shalt do</i>, but with reference to the ark, He said simply: <i>Make Me</i>. Why? The Holy One, blessed be He, commanded all the Israelites to make it, so that not one of them would be able to humiliate his fellow Israelite by saying: “I contributed more for the building of the ark than you, therefore I am more learned and have a greater right to it than you do. And since you contributed little to the ark, you will have no portion in the Torah.” That is why the Torah is likened to water, as it is said: <i>Ho, everyone that thirsteth, come you for water</i> (Isa. 55:1). Just as no one should be ashamed to say to his companion: “Give me a drink of water,” no one should be ashamed to say to a person younger than himself: “Teach me the law, instruct me in this matter.” And just as one who desires to drink should be able to drink without cost, so all who desire to learn the law should be able to learn without cost and without price, as it is said: <i>Yea, come without money and without price</i> (ibid.).",

Also, lest a man should say: “I am a student of the law that was given to me and my ancestors, while you and your ancestors are not students of the law; your ancestors were strangers”; hence it is written: <i>An inheritance of the congregation of Jacob</i> (Deut. 33:4). This tells us that the law was an inheritance for all who associate themselves with Jacob. Even outsiders who devote themselves to the law are equal to the high priest, as it is said: <i>Which if a man do, he shall live by them: I am the Lord</i> (Lev. 18:5). It does not refer to priest or Levite or Israelite but merely to <i>man</i>. Thus, <i>One law and one ordinance shall be both for you and for the stranger that sojourneth with you</i> (Num. 15:16). Observe what is written concerning the sons of Jethro: <i>And the families of the scribes that dwelt at Jabez: the Tirathites, the Shimeathites, the Succathites</i> (I Chron. 2:55). The name <i>Tirathites</i> (understood as derived from Aramaic <i>tar’a</i>, “gate”) indicates that they sat at the gate to the inner chamber of the Temple; <i>Shimeathites</i> (which includes the letters of the word <i>shema</i>, “hear”) implies that all the Israelites heard the law from their lips; and <i>Succathites</i> (which includes the word <i>sukkah</i>, “covered by”) suggests that they were enveloped by the Holy Spirit. Who were these? They were Kenites who came from <i>The father of the house of Rechab</i> (ibid.). The father-in-law of Moses was a Kenite, and Shemaiah and Abtalion and the descendants of Sisera were also Kenites. They studied the law in public like the men of the Great Synagogue. Why was that? Because the law was given to all Israel. Therefore it is written: <i>These words that the Lord spoke unto all your assembly</i> (Deut. 5:19).",

It is written concerning the ark: <i>And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold</i> (ibid., v. 11); we know about the crown of priesthood because it is written concerning the altar: <i>A crown of gold</i> (Exod. 37:26); and we know about the crown of kingship from the fact that it is written concerning the table: <i>And made thereto a crown of gold</i> (ibid., v. 11). Why is the word (in the preceding verse) written as <i>zar</i> (“stranger”) but read as <i>zer</i> (“crown”)? To teach us that if a man is worthy, it is his crown of gold, but if he is unworthy, he is to be considered a stranger among you.",

And it states also: <i>And their charge the ark, and the table, and the candlesticks, and the altar</i> (Num. 3:31) to teach you that no-one is more important for you than one who devotes himself to the law."

He said: <i>Let them make Me a Sanctuary that I may dwell among them</i> (Exod. 25:8). Then all the inhabitants of the world will know that I have pardoned Israel.

He placed a lighted candle at his head, as it is said: <i>Oh, that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me; when His light shined over my head</i> (Job 29:2).",
                "He looked about and peered from one end of the world to the other. The angel took him and led him into the Garden of Eden and showed him the righteous ones sitting there in honor, with crowns on their heads. The angel said to him: “O soul, do you know who these are?” And the soul replied: “No, my master.” Whereupon the angel told him: “These that you see were formed at first, like you, in the womb of their mothers, and then went out into the world. They observed the Torah and the commandments, and therefore were deserving and were selected for this beautiful place that you see. Know that when you leave this world, if you are worthy and keep the law of the Holy One, blessed be He, you will merit sitting among these. But if not, be assured, you will be assigned to another place.”",
                "That evening he led him to the netherworld and showed him the wicked ones whom the demons were smiting with brands of fire and who were crying: “Woe is me, woe is me,” and none had mercy for them. The angel then said to the soul: “Do you know who these are?” And he replied: “No, my master.” Whereupon the angel told him: “These are the ones who will be consumed. They were formed like you and went out into the world, but they did not keep the Torah and the statutes of the Holy One, blessed be He, and that is why they have come to this disgraceful end that you are witnessing. Be assured that you will ultimately leave this world, but if you are righteous and not wicked, you will be worthy to enjoy life in the world-to-come.” How do we know that this is so? From the fact that it is said: <i>For I was a son unto my father, tender and an only one in the sight of my mother. And he taught me, and said unto me: “Let thy heart hold fast upon My words, keep My commandments and live”</i> (Prov. 4:3–4).",
                "<i>For I was a son unto my father</i> indicates that before I left my mother’s womb I was the son of the Holy One, blessed be He, who rebuked me as a father rebukes his son. <i>Tender and an only one in the sight of my mother</i> alludes to the time I was tender and alone and no one was with me in my mother’s womb. Then the angel instructed me and told me: “Take my words to heart, keep my commandments and it shall be as described above.” The Holy One, blessed be He, then warned him concerning everything that would transpire, and the angel led him about from morning until evening. He showed him where he would die and where he would be buried. Then he led him about and walked with him through the world, showing him the righteous and the wicked and everything else. In the evening he brought him back to his mother’s womb. The Holy One, blessed be He, fashioned <i>bolts and doors</i> (Job 38:10) before him, as it is said: <i>Or who shut up the sea with the doors?</i> (ibid., v. 8), and <i>I have put My words in thy mouth, and have covered thee in the shadow of My hand</i> (Isa. 51:6). Then He said to him: <i>Thus far shalt you come, but no farther</i> (Job 38:11).",
                "The child remains in the womb of his mother for nine months. The first three months the child dwells in the lowest part of the mother’s womb; the next three months he dwells in the middle part; and the last three months he dwells in the upper part. When the time arrives for him to enter the light of the world, he rolls downward and descends in a single moment from the upper to the middle and from the middle to the lower part of the womb. He eats and drinks what his mother eats and drinks from the very beginning, so that he will not depart from her hungry. Hence Scripture says: <i>Who doeth great things and unsearchable, marvelous things without number</i> (Job 5:9).",
                "When at last the time arrives for his entrance into the world, the angel comes to him and says: “At a certain hour your time will come to enter the light of the world.” He pleads with him, saying: “Why do you wish me to go out into the light of the world?” The angel replies: “You know, my son, that you were formed against your will; against your will you will be born; against your will you will die; and against your will you are destined to give an accounting before the King of Kings, the Holy One, blessed be He”. Nevertheless, he remained unwilling to leave, and so the angel struck him with the candle that was burning at his head. Thereupon he went out into the light of the world, though against his will. Upon going out the infant forgot everything he had witnessed and everything he knew. Why does the child cry out on leaving his mother’s womb? Because the place wherein he had been at rest and at ease was irretrievable and because of the condition of the world into which he must enter.",
                "Then the seven stages in the life of man begin for him. In the first stage he is like a king, for everyone inquires about his health and is eager to look at him. They hug him and kiss him, since he is only one year old. In the second stage he is like a swine that grovels in dunghills, for a child waddles in the dirt when he is two years old. In the third stage he is like a kid who skips about in the pasture. He is a delight in the eyes of his mother and a joy to his father. He skips about here and there, while laughing, and everyone takes delight in him. In the fourth stage he acts like a horse about to run in a race. When is that? At the time of maturity, when he is eighteen years old. Just as the horse prances about and preens himself, so the youth preens himself before his companions. In the fifth stage he is like an ass upon which a saddle has been placed. Men place a saddle upon him by giving him a wife who bears him sons and daughters. He roams hither and yon to obtain food and sustenance for his children. They pile additional burdens upon him, and he is overwhelmed with problems because of his sons and daughters. When is that? When he is forty years old. In the sixth stage he is like a dog, who intrudes here and there, and takes from one and gives to another and is not embarrassed. In the seventh stage he resembles a monkey, who is different from all other creatures. He asks about everything, he eats and drinks like a youngster and laughs like a child. He returns to his childish ways in discernment but not in other things. Even his children and the men of his household mock him, curse him, and hate him. When he offers an opinion they say: “Ignore him, for he is an old fool.” He behaves like an ape in all situations and in whatever he says. Even the children laugh at him and mock him, and the wild birds can awaken him from his sleep.",
                "Finally, as his end draws near, the angel comes to him and asks: “Do you not recognize me?” And he answers: “Yes, but why do you come to me on this day of all days?” The angel replies: “To take you from this world; the time of your departure has come.” He begins to cry out immediately, and his voice can be heard from one end of the earth to the other, but no one recognizes or heeds his voice except a crowing cock. He says to the angel: “Have you not already taken me out of two worlds and brought me into this one?” And the angel responds: “Did I not tell you that you were formed against your will, that you were born against your will, that you would live against your will, and that ultimately you will have to render an accounting before the Holy One, blessed be He, against your will?”",
                "These are the four camps that the Holy One, blessed be He, revealed to Elijah of blessed memory, as it is said: <i>Go forth, and stand upon the mountain before the Lord and behold</i>, etc. (I Kings 19:11). Elijah said to Him: “What are they?” These are the four camps that you will see. He told Him: “Master of the Universe, I do not know what they are.” The Holy One, blessed be He, replied: These are the four experiences a man undergoes. They are: The strong and mighty winds of this world, for man’s days are as a wind that passeth by. After the wind comes the earthquake, which corresponds to the day of death, for death is like an earthquake, causing the body of man to quake. After the earthquake comes fire, and after death comes the judgment of the netherworld, which is composed of fire. Following the fire there is a still, small voice, and after the judgment of the netherworld there is this great day of judgment, as is said. <i>For great is the day of the Lord</i> (Joel 2:11). And none shall remain in His world except the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is said: <i>And the Lord alone shall be exalted on that day</i> (Isa. 2:11).",

                "Another comment on <i>Curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth</i>. Blessed be He, who fashioned man with wisdom just as He created the earth with wisdom, as is said: <i>The Lord with wisdom founded the earth</i> (Prov. 3:19). Concerning Bezalel it is stated: <i>He hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom and understanding, and in knowledge</i> (Exod. 35:31). The very attributes with which the Holy One, blessed be he, created His world and fashioned man were possessed by Bezalel. And he constructed the Tabernacle. Furthermore it is stated: <i>The Lord by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding He established the heavens; by His knowledge the depths were broken up</i> (Prov. 3:19–20). And about Bezalel it is written: <i>And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom and in understanding, and in knowledge</i> (Exod. 35:31). The three attributes mentioned in the verse are referred to in the other: <i>Therefore who doeth great things and unsearchable, marvelous things without number</i> (Job 5:9).",
                "When the Holy One, blessed be he, contemplated fashioning man, he said to the Torah: <i>Let us make man</i> (Gen. 1:26). It replied: Master of the Universe, the man You wish to make <i>is of few days, and full of trouble</i> (Job 14:1), and he will sin. If You are not forbearing with him, it would be better that he should not come into the world. He retorted: Is it for nothing that I am described as <i>Slow to anger and plenteous in loving-kindness</i> (Num. 17:18)? Whereupon He began to collect the dust for the body of the first man from the four corners of the earth, so that no one part of the earth might say: “The dust of the body of man is mine.” If he took the dust from the east and the man passed away to the west, the earth of the west might say: “The dust of your body did not come from me, I will not welcome you.” Therefore He took the dust from the four corners of the world, so that wherever man man passes away the earth would welcome him, as it is written: <i>For dust thou art</i> (Gen. 3:19).",
                "There were twelve hours in that day. During the first hour He collected the dust for the body of man; in the second hour He kneaded the dust of the east and the west together, as it is said: <i>Thou hast hemmed me in behind and before</i> (Ps. 139:4). <i>Behind</i> refers to the west, and <i>before</i> to the east, as is said: <i>Before the east side</i> (Exod. 38:13). The creatures of the earth saw him and feared him. They believed that he was their creator. They came and bowed down before him, and he said to them: “Why do you come to bow before me?” “All of us have come because we have seen all the creatures that the Holy One, blessed be he, has created.” And his heart was filled with wonder. He began to praise and extol his Creator, saying: <i>Oh, how abundant is Thy goodness, which Thou hast laid up for those that fear Thee</i> (Ps. 31:20), and also <i>How manifold are Thy works, O Lord</i> (Ps. 104:24). He arose and had the appearance and the likeness of God; he was tall in stature and was clothed with majesty and glory, and he ruled over them for His creator. And they said: <i>The Lord reigneth; he is clothed in majesty</i> (Ps. 93:1)."

                "<b>A new vessel filled with old wine.</b> Another explanation of <i>The Tabernacle of the testimony</i> (Exod. 38:21). R. Simeon the son of Yohai said: There is no testimony other than the Torah, as it is said: <i>These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances</i> (Deut. 4:45). This may be compared to a king who has a daughter for whom he builds a palace. He sets it in the midst of seven other palaces and then decrees: “Anyone who approaches my daughter will be considered as though he were approaching me.” The Tabernacle was called by two names: <i>The Tabernacle of the testimony</i>, which is the Torah, and elsewhere: <i>A Tabernacle of the Lord</i> (Lev. 17:4). The Holy One, blessed be He, said: Anyone who despises My daughter is considered as though he were despising Me. That is, if a man enters the synagogue and disparages My Torah, it is as though he arose and were disparaging My honor. You know this to be so from the fact that R. Simeon the son of Yohai said: When Hadrian entered the Temple he reviled and blasphemed against God. David said: Master of the world, it should be counted against them as though they had hewn cedars and built ladders in order to ascend into the firmament to wage war against You, as it is said: <i>It seemed as when men wield upwards axes in a thicket of trees</i> (Ps. 74:5). Since they are unable to accomplish this, they turned on You and attacked us, as it said: <i>O God, the heathen are come into Thine inheritance; they have defiled Thy holy temple</i> (Ps. 79:1). All of this transpired because the Temple was seized on account of our sins.",

They may be compared to a man who hates the king and decides to rebel against him, but is unable to do so. What does he do? He goes to the king’s statue and tries to topple it. However, he becomes fearful that the king might kill him. What does he do then? He takes an iron digging tool and wedges it beneath the statue. He says to himself: “If I weaken the base of the statue, it will topple.” Similarly, when the heathens sought to do battle with the Holy One, blessed be He, they were not able to do so, and so they attacked Israel. David said: <i>The kings of the earth stand up</i> (Ps. 2:2); that is to say, One who is unable to smite the ass smites the saddle. That was the case with the idolatrous nations. When they were unable to ascend to attack God, they turned against Israel. When did that occur? When they had nothing to serve as a pledge (Temple). However, now the Tabernacle is their pledge, as it is said: <i>These are the accounts of the Tabernacle, even the Tabernacle of the testimony</i>."

Yet Moses alone was in charge of the Tabernacle treasury. At the time that the Holy One, blessed be He, told Moses: <i>Let them make Me a Sanctuary, that I may dwell among them</i> (Exod. 25:8), it is written: <i>And Moses assembled all the congregation and said: “Take ye from among you an offering unto the Lord”</i> (Exod. 35:1, 5).",

Her neighbors ridicule her, saying: “Repent or your husband will not return to you.” After some time he returned to her palace and ate and drank with her. Still her neighbors were not convinced that the king had become reconciled with her. However, after they experienced the fragrance of spices ascending from the house, all of them realized that he had become reconciled with her. Similarly the Holy One, blessed be He, loved Israel and gave them the Torah and called then a holy nation: <i>A kingdom of priests and a holy nation</i> (Exod. 19:6). But when they sinned after forty days, the nations exclaimed: “He will not return to them.” Moses arose then and pleaded for mercy in their behalf. And He replied: <i>I have pardoned according to thy word</i> (Num. 14:20). Moses asked: Who will make it known to the nations? And He replied to him: <i>Let them make Me a Sanctuary</i>.

A proof of this is that after the Tabernacle was erected, though everything was done according to numbers and weights, as it is written: <i>The whole by number and by weight; and all the weight was written at that time</i> (Ezra 8:34), they became contentious, as is said: <i>And the people spoke against God, and against Moses</i> (Num. 21:15).

Those who contended that six were born based it on the words: <i>Were fruitful and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceedingly mighty</i> (ibid.), that is, six. Those who say that twelve were born argue that the words in this verse are in plural form, thus making twelve in all. Those who said six hundred thousand did so because it is written about fishes: <i>Let the waters swarm abundantly</i> (Gen. 1:20), and here it is written: <i>Increased abundantly</i>.",

What purpose do these mirrors serve? The Holy One, blessed be He, called out to Moses: Moses, do you mistreat them because of these? These very mirrors produced the hosts in Egypt. Take them and make a basin of brass and its base for the priests, that they may sanctify the priests from it, as it is said: <i>And he made the laver of brass, and base thereof of brass, of the mirrors of the serving women that did service</i> (ibid. 38:8), for they had produced all the hosts.

At the time that Moses came and told the Israelites: <i>Take ye from among ye an offering unto the Lord</i> (Exod. 35:5), they rejoiced exceedingly and brought their free-will offering with joy and eagerness. Notice that it is written: <i>And they came both men and women</i> (ibid., v. 22); that is to say, in their eagerness they pressed against each other. The men and women came as a huge throng when they brought their gifts, as it is said: <i>All the women that were wise-hearted</i> (ibid., v. 25).",
                "They brought all that was required in two mornings. Hence it is written: <i>For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work</i> (ibid. 36:7). And He said to Moses: Tell the multitude to bring their gifts. This tells you that the Israelites were extremely eager to participate in the work of the Tabernacle. After two days the wise-hearted men, who desired to bring their gifts, were not permitted to do so, since He had already said: <i>Let neither man nor woman make any more work</i> (ibid., v. 6). The leaders were deeply distressed by not having been privileged to bring anything to the work of the Sanctuary. They said: “Since we did not merit to participate in the offerings for the Tabernacle, let us give the garments for the priesthood.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said: Since My sons were so painstaking and conscientious concerning the Tabernacle, let their praise be inscribed in the Torah with reference to the Tabernacle.

And the women spun the purple curtains, as is said: <i>And all the women whose hearts stirred them up in wisdom spun the goats’ hair</i> (ibid. 35:26).",

However, they were distressed because the Shekhinah failed to hover over it. What did they do then? They went to the wise-hearted men and said to them: “Why do you sit by idly? Erect the Tabernacle and the Shekhinah will come to rest among us.” They tried to erect the Tabernacle, but did not know how. They were unable to make it stand. Whenever they thought they had assembled it, it would fall apart. They went to Bezalel and Oholiab and said: “Come, erect the Tabernacle that you have constructed, perhaps you will be worthy to erect it.” They too tried to assemble it but were unable to do so. They began muttering and complaining, saying: “See what the Son of Amram<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A disrespectful reference to Moses.</i> did to us when he took our possessions for this Tabernacle, and made us assume this burden while promising us that the Holy One, blessed be He, would descend from the heavenly sphere and would dwell within the curtain of goats’ hair, as is said: <i>That I may dwell among them</i> (Exod. 25:8).”",
                "Why were they unable to erect it? Because of the fact that Moses was distressed at not having participated in the construction of the Tabernacle. Why did that happen? The offerings were given by the Israelites, and the work was performed by Bezalel, Oholiab, and the wise-hearted. Because Moses was distressed, the Holy One, blessed be He, concealed the way to erect it from them, and that is why they were unable to do so. After they had tried in every way to do so and still were unable to set it up, all the Israelites approached Moses saying: “Moses, our master, everything you told us we have done, and everything you asked us to bring and to give, we have given: <i>Behold, all the work of the Tabernacle</i> (Exod. 39:32). Perhaps we have overlooked something, or perhaps something else should be added to what you told us.

                "They said to him: “Did you not tell us to do such-and-such?” He replied: “Yes, indeed.” And so they pointed to everything that had been done. They said: “If that is so, why does it not stand? We tried to have Bezalel, Oholiab, and the wise-hearted erect it, but they were unable to do so.” Moses was troubled by all this until the Holy One, blessed be He, told him: Moses, because you were unhappy over the fact that you did not share in the work of the building of the Tabernacle, these wise men are not able to erect it. Now Israel will know that if you do not erect it, it will never be set up. Have I not written previously that it would be done by you, as it is said: <i>And Moses reared up the Tabernacle</i> (Exod. 40:18)? And it says also: <i>And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying: And the first day of the first month</i> (Nisan) <i>shalt thou rear up the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting</i> (ibid., v. 2). Moses replied: Master of the Universe, I do not know how to erect it either. He said to him: Apply yourself to it and it will stand up of itself, for I have written concerning you that you will raise it, as is said: <i>And it came to pass in the first month in the second year on the first day of the month, that the Tabernacle was reared up</i> (ibid., v. 17).

Hiyya the son of Joseph stated: Throughout the seven days of dedication, Moses took it apart and assembled it twice each day, as is indicated in those verses by the words <i>reared up</i> and <i>it was reared</i>. R. Hanina held that he did so three time each day, since it is said: <i>Reared up, thou shalt rear up</i>, and <i>it was reared</i>. How do we know that they showed him everything? Because it is said: <i>And they brought the Tabernacle unto Moses</i> (Exod. 39:32). Hence, <i>He draweth not His eyes from the righteous</i> (Job 36:7). And Scripture adds: <i>And Moses saw all the work</i> (Exod. 39:43). It does not say “all the work of the Tabernacle” but rather <i>all the work</i>, for the words <i>all the work of the Tabernacle</i> would be equal to the work of creation itself, as is stated above.",
                "He blessed them forthwith, as is said: <i>And Moses blessed them</i> (ibid.). What blessing did he confer upon them? Our sages said: <i>O Lord, God of our fathers</i>, etc. (Deut. 1:11). R. Meir held that he said: “May it be His will that the Shekhinah will rest within the labors of your hands,” and (that) they replied: <i>And let the graciousness of the Lord our God be upon us</i> (Ps. 90:17). Why is it stated so many times: <i>According to all the Lord commanded Moses</i> (Exod. 39:1)? Because the Israelites criticized Moses at the time they strove to erect the Tabernacle but could not do so. They said: “Perhaps the Holy One, blessed be He, told Moses some simple thing to do to erect the Tabernacle, and (thus) Moses alone is responsible for all this difficulty.” Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, said: Since you have criticized him, I will attach My name to whatever I command him. Thus it is written: <i>According to all the Lord commanded Moses</i>.",
                "The Holy One, blessed be He, declared: If a man criticizes him, he will in fact be criticizing Me, since I told him to do all this: <i>Make Me a Sanctuary</i> (Exod. 25:8).",
                "When did he tell Moses to make the Sanctuary? It was on the Day of Atonement, the tenth day of Tishri. It happened then because he ascended the mountain three times and spent one hundred and twenty days there; that is, from the sixth day of Sivan to the Day of Atonement, the tenth day of Tishri. That is the day of which it is said: <i>And the Lord repented of the evil which he said He would do unto His people</i> (Exod. 32:14) because of the episode of the golden calf. It was the day He said to him: <i>I have pardoned according to thy words</i> (Num. 14:20); it was the day He said: <i>Let them make Me a Sanctuary</i>; it was the day he asked: <i>And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Thine inheritance</i> (Exod. 34:5); on this day may You grant pardon to future generations; it was the day the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: <i>For on this day shall atonement be made for you</i> (Lev. 16:30). Hence they constructed the Tabernacle with joy and gladness.",
                "How many months were required to complete the work of the Tabernacle? R. Samuel the son of Nahman held that the work of the Tabernacle was completed in three months, Tishri, Marheshvan, and Kislev, and it remained unassembled through Tevet, Shevat, and Adar. It finally was erected on the first day of Nisan, as it is said: <i>On the first day of the first month shalt thou rear up the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting</i> (Exod. 40:2). R. Hanina held: The work on the Tabernacle was completed by the first day of Adar. Why? Because the work that can be accomplished on one day in the summer is equal to two days work in the winter.",
                "If what R. Samuel the son of Nahman said is correct, and the Tabernacle was completed in three months, then why was it not erected immediately? Because the Holy One, blessed be He, wished to combine the festivities of the erection of the Tabernacle with the celebration of the birthday of our patriarch Isaac. Isaac was born on the first day of Nisan. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Himself: I will combine the celebrations. The scoffers in that generation grumbled and complained, saying: “The work of the Tabernacle has already been completed and it still has not been set up.” They were not aware of the plan and the intention of the Holy One, blessed be He. Because of this King David declared: <i>For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through Thy work; I will exult in the works of Thy hands</i> (Ps. 92:5).",
                "<i>For Thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy work</i> alludes to the Tent of Meeting. <i>I will exult in the works of Thy hands</i> refers to the building of the Temple, may it be rebuilt speedily in our time. <i>How great are thy works, O Lord: Thy thoughts are very deep</i> (ibid., v. 6) relates to the fact that You decided to combine the celebration of the erection of the Tabernacle with the celebration of the birthday of our patriarch Isaac.

See Strack, <i>Introduction to Talmud and Midrash</i>, p. 225. The ten crowns are ten events that occurred on that day. See the lis tin Ginzberg, <i>Legends</i>, vol. III, p. 181..</i> Therefore it says: <i>A brutish man knoweth not, neither doth a food understand this</i> (ibid., v. 7). <i>A brutish man knoweth not</i> alludes to the scoffers and fools of that generation, who did not know the thoughts of the Holy One, blessed be He. <i>Neither doth a fool understand</i> refers to those who do not realize that none of them would be able to rear it, neither Bezalel nor Oholiab nor the wise men who had performed the work. Only Moses would come and do his part, since he was troubled by the fact that he had not participated at all in the work done on the Tabernacle. Therefore Moses reared the Tabernacle, and neither Bezalel nor Oholiab nor the wise could do it. And it is written: <i>And it came to pass on that day that Moses made an end of setting up the Tabernacle</i> (Num. 7:1). When the Tabernacle was set up, the Shekhinah descended into it immediately, as it is said: <i>And Moses was not able to enter into the Tent of Meeting, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle</i> (Exod. 40:35). It is written elsewhere: <i>For the cloud of the Lord was upon the Tabernacle by day</i> (ibid., v. 38) to fulfill what is written: <i>Surely His salvation is nigh them that fear Him; that glory may dwell in our land</i> (Ps. 85:10). The Holy One, blessed be He, said: In this world My Shekhinah will dwell among you and within your sight, as it is said: <i>And the appearance of the glory of the Lord</i> (Exod. 24:1), but in the future the Shekhinah will never depart from you, as it is said: <i>In that day I will dwell therein among the children of Israel and will not forsake My people Israel</i> (I Kings 6:13).

When [such a one] sees his field abandoned, his trees abandoned, his fences breached, and sees his fruit trees eaten, he suppresses his drive (like one mighty in strength) and does not speak.” And thus have our masters taught (in <i>Avot</i> 4:1): And who is mighty? One who subdues his drive.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Also <i>Tamid</i> 32a.</i> R. Tanhum ben Hanila'i says (Ps. 103:20), “’Mighty in strength.’ This is Moses because no one is as mighty in strength as Moses. When Israel stood before Mount Sinai, they were not capable of hearing the divinely spoken word, as stated (in Deut. 5:22), ‘if we continue hearing the voice of the Lord our God any longer, we shall die.’ But Moses was not harmed.” [This is ] in order to teach you that the righteous ones are greater than the ministering angels, since the ministering angels are not able to hear His voice. Rather they stand with excitement and dismay, while the righteous are able to hear His voice. It is so stated (in Joel 2:11), “The Lord shouts aloud before His army, for His host is very great, for mighty is the one who fulfills His word.” “His host” denotes angels, since it is stated (regarding angels in Gen. 32:3), “This is God's host.” And so it says (in Dan. 7:10), “thousands upon thousands ministered to Him.” And who is stronger than them? The righteous, of whom it is stated (in Joel 2:11), “for mighty is the one who fulfills His word,” i.e., a righteous person who does His bidding. And who is this? This is Moses, to whom the Holy One, blessed be He, said, “Make a tabernacle.” So he was hurried and made it. Then he stood alone outside, because he was afraid to enter the tent of meeting, as stated (in Exod. 40:35), “Now Moses could not enter the tent of meeting.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “It is not right for Moses, since he made the tabernacle, to stand outside while I stand inside; so look, I am calling upon him to enter.” It is therefore written (in Lev. 1:1), “Then [the Lord] called unto Moses.” Ergo, greater is the strength of the righteous, in that they are able to hear His voice! So also it is written concerning Samuel (in I Sam. 3:10), “Then the Lord came, and stood there, and He called as at other times, ‘Samuel, Samuel’; so Samuel said, ‘Speak, for Your servant is listening.’” Therefore David has said (in Ps. 103:20), “mighty in strength who fulfill His word.” Now if you say that, when He spoke with Moses, He spoke in a low voice, [and] for that reason he was able to hear, He only spoke in the voice [used in] the giving of Torah. [That was] when they heard His voice and were dying at the first utterance. It is so stated (in Deut. 5:22), “if we continue [hearing the voice of the Lord our God any longer, we shall die].” And so it says (in Cant. 5:6), “my soul departed when He spoke.” And where is it shown that He spoke with the voice [used in] the giving of Torah? Where it says (in Ps. 29:4), “The voice of the Lord has power.” It also says so (in Numb. 7:89), “When Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with Him, he would hear the voice speaking unto him,” the voice which he heard in the giving of Torah. He also spoke thus for each and every utterance and for each and every saying, as it is stated (Ps. 29:5), “The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars.” Perhaps you will say that Israel heard the voice from outside.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sifra</i> to Lev. 1:1, (2: <i>Wayyiqra</i>, Pereq 2).</i> The text (of Numb. 7:89) reads, “he would hear the voice.” He alone heard the voice. But since He spoke in a loud voice, why did they not hear? Because the Holy One, blessed be He, decreed over the utterance, that it would go forth and come to Moses. So the Holy One, blessed be He, made a path for it by which the utterance went forth until it reached Moses, but it was not heard here and there. It is so stated (in Job 28:25), “To fix a weight for the wind.” Thus, when each saying went forth from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He, every one had a [fixed] weight. And so it says (in Job 28:26), “and a way for the thunder of voices,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash requires this literal translation. A more idiomatic translation would read: A WAY FOR THUNDERSTORMS.</i> in that the Holy One, blessed be He, made a way for that voice, because it was going forth to Moses alone. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 1:1), “Then [the Lord] called unto Moses and spoke unto him.” It was heard by him and not by another. It is therefore stated (in Ps. 103:20), “mighty in strength who fulfill His word.” (Lev. 1:1:) “Then [the Lord] called unto Moses [and spoke unto him].” This text is related (to Prov. 25:7), “For it is better that you be told, ‘Come up here,’ than that you be put down before a prince, whom your eyes have seen.” R. Tanhum says, “Keep two or three places distance from your [rightful] place so that they will say to you, ‘Come up higher.’ So do not come up, lest they tell you, ‘Go down.’” R. Tanhuma says (Prov. 20:15), “’There is gold and a multitude of jewels, but lips with knowledge are a precious object.’ The proverb says, ‘If you lack knowledge, what do you possess?

Saul fled from authority when he came to reign, as stated (in I Sam. 10:22), “So they inquired of the Lord again, ‘Has anyone else come [here]?’ And the Lord said, ‘Here he is hiding among the baggage.’” What does it (the word “baggage”) mean? When they came and brought him word of his kingship, he told them, “I am not worthy of kingship. Rather inquire by means of <i>urim</i> and <i>thummim</i> whether I am worthy; and if not, leave me alone.” Immediately (ibid.), “So they inquired of the Lord again (i.e., this second time),” [and] immediately he hid himself until they had inquired of <i>urim</i> and <i>thummim</i>. (Ibid. cont.:) “And the Lord said, ‘here he is hiding among the baggage (literally: instruments).’” Thus have our masters taught: These instruments were <i>urim</i> and <i>thummim</i>. This man fled from authority, and it pursued him, as stated (in I Sam. 10:24), “Do you see the one whom the Lord has chosen, that there is no one like him among all of this people?” But Abimelech ben Jerubbaal pursued authority, and it fled from him, as stated (in Jud. 9:1), “But Abimelech ben Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's brothers…,” and killed them all upon one stone and ruled over the masters of Shechem. But in the end (according to Jud. 9:23), “Then [God] sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the masters of Shechem,” and a woman killed him. Moses also fled from authority when the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him (in Exod. 3:10), “Come, I will send you unto Pharaoh, (Exod. 14:13) “But he said, ‘Pray Lord, please make someone else Your agent.” R.

(Exod. 6:11:) ‘Go and speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt.’” And so too for each and every oracle (as in Exod. 7:15), “Go unto pharaoh”; (and Exod. 8:16) “Rise up early in the morning.” [These verses are] to teach you that he fled from authority. In the end he led them forth, divided the sea for them, brought them into the desert, brought down the manna for them, brought up the well for them, brought over the quails for them, and made the tabernacle. Then he said, “From now on what is there for me to do?” He got ready and sat down. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “By your life, now you have a greater work than any that you have done, [i.e.,] to teach My children clean and unclean, to enlighten them on how to offer sacrifices to Me,” as stated (in Lev. 1:1–2), “Then [the Lord] called unto Moses […], ‘Speak unto the Children of Israel […], “When one of you presents an offering.”’” Moshe fled from authority and it pursued him, in fulfillment of what is stated (in Prov. 29:23), “One's pride will bring him low, but the low in spirit will obtain honor.” This is Moses, of whom it is stated (in Ps. 8:6), “For You have made him a little less than divine, and crowned him with glory and majesty.” (Lev. 1:1:) “Then [the Lord] called unto Moses.” This text is related (to Ps. 89:20), “Then you spoke to Your saints in a vision and said, ‘I have conferred help upon one who is mighty; I have exalted one chosen from the people.’” Although the Holy One, blessed be He, spoke with the first Adam and commanded him concerning the tree of knowledge, he was alone in the world. So also in the case of Noah; although He spoke with him, he [alone] “was upright in his generations.” And so it was in the case of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They were unique in the world. But in the case of Moses, how many righteous ones [were in the world]? Seventy elders, Bezalel, Uri, Aaron and his sons, and the [tribal] princes. Yet of them all, He called only Moses. Ergo, it says (in Ps. 89:20), “I have exalted one chosen from the people.” This is Moses, as stated (in Ps. 106:23), “had not Moses His chosen one […].”"

(Eccl. 3:16:) “Thither [came] wickedness”; “When a soul sins,” for the soul is placed next to judgment (Lev. 4:2:) .

R. 4:3; Eccl. R. 12:14:1.</i> How so? There were two stores before him, one belonging to a stranger and one belonging to Israel. If he entered the one belonging to the stranger without knowing, it is not good. If he entered deliberately, he is called a sinner, as stated (in Prov. 19:2), “and one who hastens with the feet is a sinner.” Rav Isaac bar Samuel bar Martha said, “There were two ways before him, one long and one short. The short one was full of pebbles, but the long one did not have a pebble in it. He left the long one and went by the short one on the Sabbath. Concerning him it was stated (in Prov. 19:2), ‘and one who hastens with the feet is a sinner.’” Our masters have taught (in <i>Avot</i>. 4:2): One good deed/commandment (mitzvah) leads to another, and one transgression leads to another. A person should not worry about a sin which he commits by mistake, but rather that an opening has been made for him to sin [again], even deliberately.

About him it has been stated, “and one who hastens with the feet is a sinner.” So also (in Prov. 6:16-19), “Six things the Lord hates…: Haughty eyes, …. A heart plotting thoughts of deceit, feet quick to run to evil, […]” This refers to Ahab ben Kolaiah and Zedekiah ben Maaseiah (the false prophets of Jer. 29:21-23), who sinned in Jerusalem.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sanh</i>. 93a; <i>PRK</i> 24:15.</i> And that was not enough for them, but after they had gone into exile in Babylon, they added to their sin. And what had they done in Jerusalem? They were false prophets. Moreover, they did not forsake their trade in Babylon. Now they would pimp for each other. Ahab would go to visit [one of] the great ones in the kingdom and would say to him, “I am so-and-so, a prophet. The Holy One, blessed be He, has sent me to say something to your wife.” [So his interlocutor] would say to him, “Here she is before you. Go on in.” When he was alone with her, he would say to her, “The Holy One, blessed be He, wants to raise up prophets from you. Simply go, have intercourse with Zedekiah, and give birth to prophets from him.” So he would come and have intercourse with her. Then Zedekiah would similarly pimp for Ahab. And this was their trade for several years. Come and see how wicked they were: They gave themselves a reputation in Babylon for being great prophets. When some woman became pregnant and saw one of them, she would say to him, “If you are a prophet, what is in my womb? A male or a female?” He would say, “A male.” Then he would go to her neighbors and say, “So-and-so will bear a female.” If she bore a male, she would say, “So-and-so, the prophet, told me.” If it was a female, the neighbors would say, “Thus did so-and-so, the prophet, tell us; but he did not want to worry you.” Now they acted in this way until they came to Shemirah, the wife of Nebuchadnezzar. Zedekiah said to her, “The Holy One, blessed be He, has sent me to you. Simply go, have intercourse with Ahab, and give birth to prophets from him.” She said to him, “I may not do [this] without the agreement of my husband. Rather, let him come and let him inform us that he wants this thing.” She went to her husband and told [the matter] to Nebuchadnezzar. [So] he called for them and they both came. And he said to them, “Is this what you said to my wife?” They said, “Yes, as the Holy One, blessed be He, wants to raise prophets from her.” He said to them, “But have I not heard about your God that He hates licentiousness; and that as a result of that which Zimri breached sexual mores, twenty-four thousand [men] fell? And you tell me this? Perhaps He recanted? I don’t know if you are false prophets or true prophets, but I have already tested Hannaniah, Mishael and Azariah and I burned the fiery finance for them for seven days and threw them inside, and they came out alive and well. But for you, I will only burn it for one day and throw you inside. If you are saved from the furnace, I will know that you are certainly true prophets and we will do whatever you say, according to your testimony.” They said to him, “Hannaniah, Mishael and Azariah were three and we are two; and the miracle is [only] done for three.” He said to them, “Is there a third [person] like you?” They said, Yehosuha the High Priest,” thinking in their hearts that they would be saved by his merit. They brought Yehoshua the High Priest and threw him into the furnace with them. The two of them were burnt [to death], and Yehoshua the High Priest was saved, as stated (Zech. 3:2), “Is this not a brand pulled out of the fire?” (Jer. 29:22:) “And from Ahav and Zedekiah, a curse was taken for all of the exile of Judah in Babylon, saying, ‘May God make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon consigned to the flames!‘“3 Who caused these wicked ones to be burned? It was because they ran with their feet towards abominations and sins. It is therefore stated (in Prov. 19:2), “and one who hastens with the feet is a sinner.” Nevertheless (ibid.,) “Also, a soul without knowledge is not good.” Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “Say unto Israel (in Lev. 4:2), ‘When a soul sins by mistake’” – the soul sins. The verse (Eccl. 3:16) says, “[….] to the place of justice (<i>tsedeq</i>), thither [came] wickedness.” The place is [the source of] the soul, which has been given out of righteousness (<i>tsedeq</i>), [i.e.] out of a place where there is no iniquity or sin.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exod. R. 4:1.</i> [When] it does sins, the verse (Lev. 4:2) cries out in surprise, “When a soul sins by mistake?” (Eccl. 3:16:) “To the place of justice (<i>tsedeq</i>), thither [came] wickedness.” To what is the matter comparable? To two people who sinned against the king. One was a country bumpkin, and one a person from the palace.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lat.: <i>palatium;</i> Gk.: <i>palation</i>.</i> [When] he saw that both of them had committed a single offense, he released the country bumpkin but rendered a [guilty] verdict<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>apophasis</i>.</i> against the person from the palace. His palace people said to him, “Both of them committed a single offense; [yet] you released the country bumpkin [and] gave a verdict against the person from the palace.” He said to them, “I released the country bumpkin because he did not know the laws<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk. <i>nomos</i>.</i> of the kingdom, but the person from the palace is with me every day and knows what the laws of the kingdom are, and what verdict will be pronounced against one who sins towards me?” So also the body is a country bumpkin, (according to Gen. 2:7) “Then the Lord God formed the human out of dust from the ground.” But the soul is a palace person from above, (according to ibid., cont.) “and blew into his nostrils the breath of life.” Yet both of them sinned. Why? Because it impossible for the body to exist without the soul.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. Lev. R. 4:5.</i> Thus, if there is no soul, there is no body, and if there is no body, there is no soul. So both of them sinned, as stated (in Ezek. 18:20), “the soul that sins shall die.” Therefore the verse (Lev. 4:2) wonders, “When a soul sins by mistake against any of the Lord's commandments?” What is the significance of “by mistake (rt.: <i>sh</i>gg) [against any of the Lord's commandments]?” [It is] to teach you that when anyone sins by mistake, [it is as if] one transgresses [intentionally] against the Lord's commandments. And so it says (in Numb. 15:22), “And when you sin unintentionally (rt.: <i>sh</i>gg) and do not fulfill all these commandments….”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The next verses explain how atonement is made.</i> So also David has said (in Ps. 19:13–14), “Who can discern mistakes? Cleanse me from hidden faults. Also restrain Your servant from willful sins…, and I shall be clean of great transgression,” [i.e.] from the great sin which I have committed. But if you do so act (according to Ps. 19:15), “Let the words of my mouth be acceptable.” From here you learn that everyone who sins, even by mistake, is called a sinner. Our masters have said, “A mistake in study is accounted as willful sin.” It is therefore written (in Lev. 4:2), “When a soul sins,” because it is from [man’s soul, which is from] above; and it is not written, \"[when] a person (<i>Adam</i>).\" In the world to come the Holy One, blessed be He, will bring in the soul and say to it, “Why have you transgressed against the commandments?” Then it will say, “The body transgressed against the commandments. From the day that I left it, have I ever sinned?” [Then] He will go back and say to the body, “For what reason did you transgress the commandments?” It will say to Him, “The soul sinned. Since the soul left me, have I ever sinned?” What will the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He will bring them both in and judge them as one. To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had an orchard in which were ripened grapes, figs and pomegranates.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sanh</i>. 91ab; Lev.

He [therefore] posted two guards, one lame and one blind. They stayed and watched the orchard. They smelled the ripened fruit. The lame one said to the blind one, “I see lovely ripened fruit in the orchard. Come and give me a ride, so we can get them and eat them.” The lame one rode upon the back of the blind one, so that he got them, and they ate them. One day the king came. He sought the ripened fruit, but he did not find any. He said to the blind one, “Did you eat them?” He [answered], “Do I have any eyes?” He said to the lame one. “Have you eaten them?” He said, “Do I have any feet?” He [therefore] mounted the lame person on the blind person's back and judged them as one. So the Holy One, blessed be He, will take a soul and toss it into a body, as stated (in Ps. 50:4), “He summoned the heavens above,” i.e., the soul; “and the earth to judge His people,” i.e., the body.” David foresaw how the Holy One, blessed be He, would judge His creatures. [So] he began to seek mercy for his soul. He said, “Master of the world, when you judge Your creatures, do not judge me like them. [(Ps. 143:2), ‘And do not enter into judgment with Your servant, for no one living shall be justified before You.’ Rather act charitably with me, as stated (in Ps. 17:15), ‘As for me, I will behold Your face in charity.’” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “In this world because the evil drive rules in you, you have sinned; but in the world to come I will root it out from you, as stated (in Ezek. 36:26), ‘I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.’”"

See what is written about offerings (in Lev. 1:2), “When one of you presents an offering to the Lord.” It does not say \"to the Lord, an offering,\" but “an offering to the Lord” (so that who changes his mind about an offering in mid-sentence not mention God’s name for no reason).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tanh</i>.

It is therefore stated (in Eccl. 5:1), “Do not be rash with your mouth…. for God is in heaven and you are on earth.” For who would say that God is not in heaven and that people are not on earth? [Accordingly], Solomon has said, “Every time that the weakest of the weak is above, he defeats the warrior below.” Go and learn from Abimelech (in Jud. 9:53), “But a certain woman dropped an upper millstone on Abimelech's head and cracked his skull.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the woman was above the warrior Abimelech in the tower of Thebez, her killing him is an example of a relatively weak person defeating a warrior from above.</i> And if he was a warrior among warriors and there was none like him, and [yet] a woman [was able to] kill him from above, how much the more so in the case of the Holy One, blessed be He! See what is written about Him (in Dan. 4:32), “All the inhabitants of the earth are of no account, and He does as He wishes [with the host of heaven and with the inhabitants of the earth].” It is also written (in Ps. 47:3), “For the Lord most high is awesome, a great King over all the earth,” and people are below. (Eccl. 5:1:) “Therefore let your words be few.” So what is there for you to do? To put your hand upon your mouth and upon your ear in order to neither speak nor hear. Ergo (in Lev. 5:1), “If a soul sins.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These words also appear in Lev. 5:21 [6:2].</i> (Lev. 5:1:) [“And if a soul sins in that it hears a voice swearing,] when he is a witness to what he has either seen or come to know, [if he does not speak out, he shall bear his iniquity].” This text is related (to Prov. 29:24), “The one who shares with a thief hates his own soul; he hears swearing and does not speak out.” What has caused anyone to say of him, “If a soul sins?” [It is] simply because he did not come and tell a sage, “So-and-so blasphemed the name of the Holy One, blessed be He.” He therefore shares his iniquities with him, as stated (in Lev. 5:1), “if he does not speak out, he shall bear his iniquity.” Therefore Solomon has said (in Prov. 29:24), “The one who shares with a thief hates his own soul.” Just as when the thief is caught, his partner is convicted along with him;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. Lev. R. 6:2.</i> so whoever hears blasphemy of the Holy One, blessed be He, and does not speak out is convicted along with him. And let no one say, “What denunciation (lashon hara’ah) do I say?” The Holy One, blessed be He, has said (in Lev. 5:1ff.), “’On every matter,’ there is a denunciation in it. [But] with cursing the name, there is no denunciation.” Why? Because [it is] just like a case of a person cursing his companion. When he hears him, it is of no concern to him. But if he has cursed his father in his presence, he puts his life on the line and says, “You have cursed my father.” Moses said (in Deut. 32:6), “Is He not your Father who created you?” (Lev. 5:1:) [“And if a soul sins in that it hears a voice swearing,] when he is a witness to what he has seen.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “If you want to bear witness, bear witness; but if not, I will bear witness.” Thus it is stated (ibid.), “when he (He) is a witness.” And where is it shown that the Holy One, blessed be He, is called a witness? Where it is stated (in Jer. 29:23), “I am the One who knows and bears witness, says the Lord.” Come and see. All the <i>parashioth</i> written in this book have “mistake” written in them, except for this <i>parashah</i>, in which “mistake” is not mentioned.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In fact, MISTAKE (<i>shegagah</i>), i.e., UNINTENTIONAL SIN, does appear in this <i>parashah</i> (in 5:15, 18). Elsewhere in Lev. the word only appears in 4:2, 22, 27; 22:4.)</i> About him Solomon has said (in Eccl. 5:5), “Do not let your mouth cause your flesh to sin, and do not say before the angel that it was a mistake,” (in Eccl. 5:1), “for God is in the heavens.” It is comparable to two people who threw stones at an image of a king.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>eikonion</i>, a diminutive form of <i>eikon</i>.</i> One was drunk, and one was in possession of his senses.

So it is in the case of whoever sins. It is concerning him that “mistake” is written (in Lev. 4:2) – “When a soul sins by mistake (rt.: <i>sh</i>gg) [against any of the Lord's commandments]….”; (and likewise in Lev. 4:13) “And if the whole congregation of Israel should err (rt.: <i>sh</i>gg).” And [about] all of them; because they sinned by mistake, they bring an offering and it shall be forgiven them. It is so stated (in Numb. 15:26), “The whole congregation of the Children of Israel and the stranger who resides in their midst shall be forgiven because [it happened] to all the people by mistake.” But the one who blasphemes receives a [guilty] verdict, as stated (in Lev. 24:16) “And the one who blasphemes the name of the Lord shall surely be put to death.” It is also written (in Jer. 4:2), “And you shall swear, ‘As the Lord lives,’ in truth, in justice, and in righteousness; then shall nations bless themselves in Him, and Him shall they glory.” Scripture also says (in Deut. 10:20), “The Lord your God you shall fear, Him you shall serve, to Him you shall hold fast”; then after that, “and by Him you shall swear.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Tanh</i>.

R. 9:1.</i> (Ibid.:) “The Lord your God you shall fear,” so that you will be like those three of whom it is written, “he feared God (<i>yr</i>' '<i>lhym</i>)”: Abraham, Joseph and Job. About Abraham it is written (in Gen. 22:12), “for now I know that you fear God (<i>yr</i>' '<i>lhym</i>).” About Joseph it is written (in Gen. 42:18), “I fear (<i>yr</i>') God ('<i>lhym</i>).” About Job it is written (in Job 1:2), “he feared God (<i>yr</i>' '<i>lhym</i>) and shunned evil.” (Deut. 10:20, cont.:) “Him you shall serve,” in that you will be busy with the Torah and with [fulfilling] the commandments. (Ibid. cont.:) “To him you shall hold fast,” in that you will honor the Torah scholars and benefit them with your property. Moses said to Israel, “Do not think that I have allowed you to swear by His name, even in truth. It is only, if all these conditions (mentioned earlier in the verse) abide with you, that you are entitled to swear; and if not, you are not entitled to swear [by His name], even in truth.” You shall not be like those of whom it is written (in Jer. 7:9), “[Will you …] swear falsely and sacrifice to Baal?” Rather, fulfill all these conditions and after that you are Mine, as stated (in Jer. 4:1), “If you return, O Israel, says the Lord, if you return unto Me [….]” Then after that [it says] (in vs. 2), “And you shall swear, ‘as the Lord lives’….” Our masters have said, “Even in truth one cannot swear.” Why? Thus have our masters taught (in <i>Dem</i>. 2:3): Let not someone from Israel be unrestrained in vows<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See also <i>Ned</i>. 20a.</i> or in jesting, (or to lead one's companion astray with an oath by saying it is not an oath).

(Buber), Numb. 9:1; Numb. R. 9:1; cf. also <i>Git</i>. 57a.</i> Now if one who swears in truth has this happen, how much the more so in the case of one who swears to a lie? How did they act? One would utter an oath to his companion that he was going to such and such a place to eat and drink. Then they would go and act to fulfill their oath. It is therefore stated (in Lev. 5:1), “If a soul sins in that it hears a voice swearing.” Now when the Holy One, blessed be He, comes to judge all people in the world to come, He will judge them along with sorcerers and adulterers. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Mal. 3:5), “Then I will draw near to you in judgment; and I will be a swift witness against sorcerers, against adulterers, against those who swear to a lie (in My name).” And I am finding them guilty and bringing them down to <i>Gehinnom</i>. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “With the mouth that I gave you to be praising and glorifying My name, you are reproaching, blaspheming, and swearing to a lie in My name? Since I created all people to praise Me, as stated (in Prov. 16:4), “The Lord has made everything for His own purpose.” So is it not enough for you that you do not praise Me, but [that] you blaspheme [Me as well]! The Scripture has said (in Is. 57:20), “But the wicked are like the troubled sea, [for it cannot rest (rt.: <i>shqt</i>)].” [They are] just like this [kind of] sea which has waves in its midst exalting themselves upward. When each and every one of them reaches the sand, it is broken and returns (<i>hozer</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word also means “repents.”</i> And its companion also looks at it breaking, and [yet] exalts itself upward without repenting (<i>hozer</i>). So are the wicked, who look at one another and exalt themselves. Therefore, they are likened to the sea, as stated (in Is. 57:20), “But the wicked are like the troubled sea….” So did all the generations, the generation of Enosh, the generation of the flood, and the generation of the dispersion (i.e., of the Tower of Babel), not learn from each other. Instead they were exalting themselves. Therefore they are compared to the sea (in Is. 57:20), “But the wicked are like the troubled sea.” (Is. 57:20, cont.:) “For it cannot rest (rt.: <i>shqt</i>).” The wicked have no rest in the world, but the righteous have serenity (<i>shqt</i>), as stated (in Jer. 30:10), “and Jacob shall again have peace (<i>shqt</i>) and quiet with none to make him afraid.” Another interpretation (of Is. 57:20), “But the wicked are like the troubled sea.” Just as the sea has its dirt and mud in its mouth, so the wicked have their stench in their mouth. Thus it is stated (at the end of Is. 57:20), “and its waters toss up slime and mud.” It is not from choice that one hears blasphemies and invectives, but from the midst of the sins which are within him. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 5:1), “If a soul sins and hears a voice swearing….”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Most translations equate the sinning with the swearing.

                "<b>And He called to Moshe:</b> And why does it say, \"And He called?\" Rather it is is because it stated above (Exodus 40:35), \"and Moshe could not come to the Tent of Meeting\" - when the Divine Presence rested upon the Tent of Meeting. And he could not come since the cloud [of glory] was resting upon it. Hence the Holy One, blessed be He, called him. \"Saying\": What is \"saying?\" To say to the Children of Israel. \"A man from you that brings a sacrifice\": Why does it state, \"a man (<i>adam</i>)\" and it does not say, \"<i>eesh</i>?\" It wants to say, when a man sins like Adam (the first man) started to sin - he should bring a sacrifice. Why does it state, \"from the beast,\" when it [also] states, \"from the cattle or the sheep?\" Rather, it wanted to say [that we should] distinguish them from the beast; that his soul does not descend to the lowest pit like the beast, the soul of which descends below to the earth - as it is stated (Ecclesiastes 3:21), \"Who knows if the [soul] of man ascends above, and the [soul] of the beast is the one that descends below.\" And truly does a man not know? Rather it is like the verse stated (Joel 2:14), \"Who knows, [God] may turn and regret\" - and this is its understanding: He \"who knows\" that he is a sinner, should \"turn\" to \"God,\" and He will atone for him for all of his iniquities. What is \"and regret?\" Rather, He will relent about the bad that He planned to do to him. And likewise it is saying [here], \"Who is the one that knows and understands and has intelligence and understanding - he will understand and know that the soul of man ascends above to the place from which it was fashioned, and the spirit of the beast descends below to earth.\" As so did King Shlomo, peace be upon him, state (Ecclesiastes 12:7), \"and the spirit returns to God who gave it.\" And which spirit returns to \"God who gave it?\" These are the spirits of the righteous ones, the pious ones and the penitents who stand in front of Him in great stature. And that is the life that has no death with it, and the good which has [nothing] bad with it. This is the [meaning of] that which is written in the Torah (Deuteronomy 22:7), \"so that it shall be good for you,\" forever. And we learned from the heard tradition, \"'so that is shall be good to you,' in the world that is completely good; 'and you shall have length of days,' in the world that is completely long.\" And the reward of the righteous is that they will merit and live for the good. Happy is the man that merited good and delight; may the Omnipresent have us merit it with the righteous! And the early sages have already informed us that man does not have the ability to investigate and speak [about] the goodnesses of the world to come, as it has no measure, nor comparison nor model. And so did the verse state (Isaiah 64:3), \"no eye has seen, God, but You, who acts for those who wait for Him\" - meaning to say, the good that no eye has seen besides You, God. And that which they called it, \"the world to come,\" is not because it is not found now. [Rather,] for us who are in this world now, it is [still] to come. And hence he says, the world to come - after a man leaves this world. And one who says that [first] this world is destroyed, and afterwards comes the world to come - the matter is not like that. Rather, when the righteous depart from the world, they immediately ascend and stand in this stature, as it is stated (Psalms 31:20), \"How great is Your goodness that You have stored for those that fear You, that You have done for those that take refuge in You.\" But [the souls] of the evildoers float throughout the whole world and do not find rest for the soles of their feet. And they only ascend to the place from which they were fashioned [after] twelve months. What does it do [during this time]? It goes to the grave and comes back, and its seeing the body rotten and that it is maggots and worms is difficult for it. To what is the thing comparable? To a man that had a nice house and it fell. He goes to see it every day, that thorns are growing on it, brambles are covering its face and its stone fence is destroyed - and he cries and mourns over it, since he sees it like this. And so is the spirit floating throughout all of the world and coming back to the grave. And so did our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, say (Berakhot 18b), \"Maggots are as harsh for the dead as a needle for the flesh of the living.\" And from where [do we know] that the soul mourns over it? As it is stated (Job 14:22), \"But his flesh pains him, and his soul mourns over it.\" That is [the meaning of] \"the beast\" - and it is destroyed like a beast. And therefore it stated, \"from the beast,\" and it stated \"from the cattle and from the sheep\" - since they will offer from the cattle and from the sheep, so that his soul not descend below like a beast. And why do we offer sacrifices from fowl, from lambs, from sheep and from goats, but not from fish - as it is stated, \"if from the fowl is his burnt-offering sacrifice?\" Rather, since they are flesh and blood like man and they come out of the belly of their mothers like man, [so too, do] they atone for a man. But fish are eggs - they come out of them and live. Our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said \"Any image that the Holy One, blessed be He, created on the dry land, He [also] created in the ocean with fish.\" Rabbi Tarfon said, \"The fish was designated from the six days of creation to swallow Yonah, as it is stated (Jonah 2:1), 'And the Lord designated a great fish.'\" Yonah fled from his God on the fifth day. And why did he flee? Rather the first time, [God] sent him to restore the border of Israel; and his words were fulfilled, as it is stated (II Kings 14:25), \"He restored the border of Israel.\" The second time, He sent him to Jerusalem to destroy it; but the Holy One, blessed be He, worked up His great mercies and relented from the bad, and did not destroy it. And [so] they would call him a false prophet. The third time, He sent him to Nineveh to destroy it. Yonah judged the case between him and himself - Yonah said: I know that the [other] nations are close to repentance. Now if I go on my mission, they will repent immediately and the Holy One, blessed be He, is long-suffering and of great kindness - at the time that they repent, He will immediately have mercy [on them]. And the Holy One, blessed be He will [resultantly] become enraged towards Israel, as He did at the time of Sancheriv. When Ravshakeh came to blaspheme the living God, he said, \"You are saying that mere words of the lips is counsel and valor for war; now, on whom are you relying, that you have rebelled against me? And if you tell me, 'we are relying on the Lord, our God,' He is the one whose shrines and altars Hizkiyahu did away with\" (II Kings 18:20, 22) - what did Hizkiyahu do at that time? \"And Hizkiyahu prayed to the Lord and said, 'Lord, God of Israel, enthroned on the cherubs - You alone are God of all the kingdoms of the earth; You made the heavens and the earth. Lord, incline Your ear and hear; open Your eyes and see - hear the words that Sancheriv has sent to blaspheme the living God!' And Yishayahu son of Amots sent to Hizkiyahu, saying, 'Thus said the Lord, God of Israel, \"I have heard that which you prayed to Me concerning King Sancheriv of Assyria. I will [delude] him, etc.\"' (II Kings 19:15-16, 20, 7).\" And four hundred angels armed with swords and spears came and drove him away, etc. - \"And it was on that night that an angel of the Lord went out and smote one hundred and eighty-five thousand in the Assyrian camp, and the following morning behold, they were all dead corpses. And King Sancheriv of Assyria moved and went and returned, and he stayed in Nineveh\" (II Kings 19:25-26). He said to [his] sages, \"Why is the love of the Holy One, blessed be He, with Israel more than all the nations of the world?\" They said to him, \"They had an ancient father and his name was Avraham, and he went to slaughter his son to bring up as a burnt-offering.\" He said to them, \"Did he slaughter him?\" They said to him, \"No.\" He said to them, \"[With] him, it was because it was his will to slaughter [his son, that] there was [such] love between him and his God.\" He said, \"I will [then actually] slaughter my son and bring him up as a burnt-offering.\" And so did he do, as it is stated (II Kings 3:27), \"And he took his first-born son, who was to reign in his place, and brought him up as a burnt-offering.\" [So] the Holy One, blessed be He, said, \"How much do the nations of the world, to whom I did not give statutes and judgments, do for My name; as it is stated (Malachi 1:11), 'and everywhere incense is presented for My name.'\" [And] immediately, \"and a great wrath came upon Israel\" (II Kings 3:27). Therefore Yonah said, \"The nations will repent and the anger of the Holy One, blessed be He, will be upon Israel; as He will say, 'The nations, to whom I did not give statutes and judgments - when I make a decree upon them and they know [about it], they immediately repent. But Israel is not like this, as I send them My prophets all the time, yet they are stiff-necked.' And therefore, 'a great wrath [will come] upon Israel.'\" And not only does Israel call him a false prophet, but even the nations of the world [will] call him so. Yonah said, \"I am fleeing from in front of Him to a place where His glory is not [found]. What shall I do? If I ascend to the heavens, His glory is there, as it is stated (Psalms 113:4), 'upon the heavens is His glory.' And if upon the earth, His glory is there [too], as it is stated (Isaiah 6:3), 'the whole earth is full of His glory.' Behold, I will flee to the sea, as His glory is not stated there.\" [So] he went down to Jaffa, but he did not find a ship to board there. And the ship that Yonah would board upon was two days' journey away from Jaffa, in order to test Yonah. What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He brought a great storm in the sea and brought [the ship quickly] to Jaffa. And Yonah saw this and rejoiced in his heart and said, \"Now, I know that my path is straight in front of me.\" And he did not know that the Holy One, blessed be He, was causing the thing to let him know that His glory was there (in the sea). He said to [the boatsmen], \"I will come with you.\" And the way of all ships is that when a man exits from them, he gives his payment. But in the joy of Yonah's heart, He preceded and gave his wage [right away], as it is stated (Jonah 1:3), \"And Yonah arose to flee to Tarshish from in front of the Lord [... and he gave its pay].\" And they traveled the distance of a day, and a great storm came upon them in the sea from their right and from their left. And the way of all ships is to come and go in peace and quiet. And the ship upon which Yonah boarded was in great distress to break apart, as it is stated (Jonah 1:4), \"And the Lord placed a great wind upon the sea.\" Rabbi Chaninah said, \"[Men of all] the seventy languages were in the ship, and each and every one had his god in his hand.\" They said, \"The god that answers and saves us from this distress, he is the [true] God.\" And they stood and each man cried out in the name of his god, but they did not help. [Meanwhile,] Yonah dozed off and was sleeping in the distress of his soul; and the captain came to him. He said to him, \"Behold, we are standing between death and life, and you are dozing off? From which people are you?\" He said to them, \"I am a Hebrew.\" They said to him, \"And have we not heard that the God of the Hebrews is great? 'Cry out to your God' (Jonah 1:6). Maybe He will do for us like all of His wonders at the Red Sea.\" He said to them, \"This distress has come upon you because of me, as I am fleeing from in front of Him, as I thought that His glory was not in the sea, and now I see that His glory is on the dry land and in the sea.\" He said to them, \"Because of me; 'Lift me and put me in the sea, and the sea will be quiet upon you' (Jonah 1:12).\" Rabbi Shimon said, \"The men did not accept from Yonah to drop him into the sea; and [so] they cast lots, as it is stated (Jonah 2:7), 'and they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Yonah.'\" What did they do? They took the vessels that were on the ship and threw them to the sea to make themselves lighter, but it did not help a bit. They sought to return to dry land, but they were not able, as it is stated (Jonah 1:13), \"And the men rowed, etc.\" What did they do? They took Yonah and stood him upon the edge of the ship and said, \"God of the world, Lord, 'do not put innocent blood upon us' (Jonah 1:14), as we do not know what is the nature of this man; yet he says to us with his mouth, 'because of me has this distress come upon you.'\" They placed him [into the sea] until his knees, and the sea stopped from its fury. They [then] took him back towards them, and the sea stormed against them. They placed him [into the sea] until his navel, and the sea stopped from its fury. They [then] took him back towards them, and it stormed against them. They placed him completely [in the sea, and] the sea was immediately quiet from its fury, as it is stated (Jonah 1:15), \"And they lifted Yonah and placed him, etc.\" \"And the Lord designated a great fish to swallow Yonah, and Yonah was in the innards of the fish three days and three nights\"(Jonah 2:1) - and Yonah entered its mouth, like a man that enters a large synagogue, and the two eyes of the fish were like opened windows giving light to Yonah. Rabbi Meir said, \"A pearl was hanging in the innards of the fish, and it would give light to Yonah, like the sun lights up in its strength in the afternoon. And Yonah could see everything that was in the sea and that was in the depths, as it is stated (Psalms 97:11), \"Light is planted for the righteous, and joy for the righteous of heart.\" The fish said to Yonah, \"Do you not know that my time has come to be eaten into the mouth of the Leviathan?\" He said to it, \"Take me there and I will save you, and my soul.\" It took him to the Leviathan. He said to the Leviathan, \"Because of you have I come to see your dwelling place in the sea. And not only that, but in the future I will come down to put a rope on your neck and to bring you up for the great meal of the righteous ones.\" He showed it his seal from Avraham, our father (his circumcision). The Leviathan saw it and fled the journey of two days from before Yonah. He said to the fish, \"Behold, I saved you from the mouth of the Leviathan; [now] show me all that is in the sea and in the depths.\" And [so] it showed him the great river of the waters of the ocean, as it is stated (Yonah 2:6), \"up to my soul was the deep.\" And it showed him the paths of the Red (literally Reed) Sea, as it is stated, \"reeds are twined around my head.\" And it showed him the place from where the breakers of the sea and its waves go out, as it is stated (Yonah 2:4), \"all Your breakers and waves passed over me.\" And it showed him the pillars of the Earth in its foundation, as it is stated (Jonah 2:7), \"the bars of the earth were around me forever.\" And it showed him <i>Geihinnom</i>, as it is written (Jonah 2:3), \"from the belly of the pit I cried out; You heard my voice.\" And it showed him under the Chamber of God, as it is stated (Jonah 2:7), \"I descended to the bases of the mountains.\" From here we learn that Jerusalem stands on seven mountains. And he saw the Stone of the Foundation there, set in the depths. And he saw the sons of Korach, standing and praying upon it. It said to Yonah, \"Behold, you are standing under the Chamber of the Lord; pray and you shall be answered.\" Immediately Yonah said to the fish, \"Stand in the place that you are standing, as I would like to recite a prayer.\" And the fish stopped. And Yonah began to pray in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, \"Master of the Universe, You have been called the One that brings down and raises up - behold, I have gone down, [now] raise me up; You have been called the One that brings death and that brings life - behold, my soul has reached death, [now] bring me life.\" And he was not answered until [this] came out from his mouth (Jonah 2:10): \"that which I have vowed, I will fulfill, etc.\" - \"That which I have vowed\" to bring up the Leviathan in front of You, \"I will fulfill\" on the day of Israel's salvation, as it is stated, \"But I, with loud thanksgiving, will sacrifice to You that which I have vowed.\" And immediately the Holy One, blessed be He, indicated [to the fish], and it spewed Yonah out to the dry land, as it is stated (Jonah 2:11), \"And the Lord said to the fish, and it spewed Jonah out to the dry land.\" When the sailors saw all of the great miracles, signs and wonders that the Holy One, blessed be He, did with Yonah, they got up and every man cast away his god, as it is stated (Jonah 2:9), \"They who preserve the vanities of emptiness forsake their kindness.\" And they went back to Jaffa and went up to Jerusalem, and they circumcised the flesh of their foreskin, as it is stated (Jonah 1:15), \"And the men feared a great fear of the Lord, and they slaughtered a sacrifice to the Lord and they made vows\" - and did they slaughter a sacrifice? Rather, [this was] circumcision, which is like the blood of a sacrifice. And each man of them vowed to bring his children and everything  that he had to the God of Yonah.

                "(Lev. 6:2:) “This is the law of the burnt offering.” This text is related (to Ps. 89:7), “For who in the skies is comparable to the Lord, is like the Lord among the children of the powerful ones?” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “If I had [merely] desired an offering, would I not have told (the angel) Michael to bring me an offering? From whom do I desire sacrifice? From Israel.” And so it says about the shewbread (in Lev. 24:8), “on every Sabbath day shall he arrange it.” But it is written (in Micah 6:7), “Does the Lord want thousands of rams?” Balaam the wicked was an advocate<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>synegoros.</i></i> for the nations of the world. It is in reference to the nations that that [Scripture] speaks (in Micah 6:7), “Does the Lord want thousands of rams with ten thousands of rivers of oil?” He wants what you offer to Him, [i.e.] a <i>log</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A <i>log</i> is a liquid measure that equals the contents of six eggs.</i> of oil. We (gentiles) offer Him ten thousand times ten thousands rivers of oil. What did Abraham offer to Him? Was it not one ram? It is so stated (in Gen. 22:13), “Then [Abraham] lifted his eyes to look and there was a ram behind….” If He wants, we should offer Him thousands of rams; but what did Abraham offer Him? His son. I might offer Him my son and daughter, as stated (in Micah 6:7, cont.), “shall I give my first-born for my transgression,” this is my first-born son; “the fruit of my belly for the sin of my soul,” this is my daughter. See how crafty Balaam the wicked was! He began to say (in Numb. 23:4), “I have prepared the seven altars [and offered a ram and a bull on each altar].” He did not say, \"seven altars,\" but, “the [seven] altars.” These are [all of the] seven altars, [which] they had built since the first Adam was created up to now. Now I am offering seven corresponding to the seven of them. And what did they offer? Twelve cakes, as stated (in Lev. 24:5), “Then you shall take fine white flour and bake it into twelve cakes.” When the Holy One, blessed be He, appeared to him, He said to him, “O wicked one, what are you doing?” He said to Him (in Numb. 23:4) “I have prepared the seven altars.” To whom is this wicked one comparable? To a butcher who sold [meat] in the market. When his store was full of meat, thieves saw [him] and looked at the meat. [When] that butcher saw that he was looking at the meat, he said to him, “Sir, I have already sent provisions<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>opsonion</i>.</i> to your house.” So it was with Balaam. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “O wicked one, what are you doing here?” He said to Him (in Numb. 23:4), “I have prepared the seven altars with a bull and a ram on each altar.” He said to Him (in Micah 6:7), “Does the Lord want thousands of rams?” He said to Him (ibid., cont.), “Shall I give my first-born for my transgression?” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “O evil one, if I had desired an offering, I would have spoken to Michael and Gabriel, and they would have presented offerings to me.” It is so stated (in Ps. 89:7), “For who in the skies is comparable to the Lord, is like the Lord among the children of the powerful ones?” This is [referring to] Balaam, who desired to imitate [what is done by] the children of the powerful ones to the Holy One, blessed be He. [“Among the children of the powerful ones” is referring to] the children of Abraham [which] are Isaac and Jacob. [These are the ones] who are the rams of the world. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “What do you desire? To deceive yourself before Me? [To persuade] Me to accept offerings from the gentiles? You are not able. It is an oath (in the words of Lev. 24:8, cont.), ‘an everlasting covenant on the part of the Children of Israel.’ It is a stipulation that I only accept offerings from Israel.” It is so stated (in Lev. 6:2), “Command Aaron and his children, saying.” When the nations said, “What is this, whereby Israel is presenting offerings and sacrificing?” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them (ibid.), “This is the law of the burnt offering (rt.: '<i>lh</i>),” [referring to (Cant. 3:6),] “Who is this that comes up (rt.: '<i>lh</i>) from the desert?” (Exod. 19:3:) “Then Moses went up (rt.: '<i>lh</i>) unto God.” Another interpretation (of Lev. 6:1-2) “Then the Lord spoke…, ‘Command Aaron…, “This is the law of the burnt offering”’”: The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “Fulfill what is written above on the matter. Then after that [comes,] ‘This is the law of the burnt offering.’” Why? (Is. 61:8) “Because I the Lord love justice, I hate robbery with a burnt offering,” [meaning] even with a burnt offering. What is written above on the matter (in Lev. 5:23)? “And it shall come to pass that, when one has sinned and is guilty, he shall restore the stolen goods which he robbed.” Then after that (in Lev. 6:2), “This is the law of the burnt offering.” If you desire to present an offering, you shall not rob anyone. Why? “Because I the Lord love justice, I hate robbery with a burnt offering.” So when do you present a burnt offering so that I accept it? When your hands are clean of robbery. David said (in Ps. 24:3-4), “Who may ascend (rt.: '<i>lh</i>) the hill of the Lord, and who may stand in His holy place? One with clean hands and a pure heart.” “This is the law of the burnt offering,” the one who has hands clean of robbery, he “may stand in His holy place.” “From the beginning of [this book on] offerings you learn (in Lev. 1:2), “Speak unto the Children of Israel and say unto them, ‘When one (<i>adam</i>) of you presents an offering.” Why is Adam mentioned? It is simply that the Holy One, blessed be He, said, “When you sacrifice to Me, you shall be like the first Adam in that he did not rob from others, since he was alone in the world. So also you shall not rob people. Why? (Is. 61:8:) ‘Because I the Lord love justice, I hate robbery with a burnt offering.’” Another interpretation (of Lev. 6:2), “This is the Torah of the burnt offering”: Why is it named a burnt offering ('<i>olah</i>, rt.: '<i>lh</i>)? Because it is the highest (rt.: '<i>lh</i>) of all the offerings. It is that which ascends ('<i>olah</i>, rt.: '<i>lh</i>). You should know that when someone brings a sin offering, the priest takes it, and likewise the meal offering. Moreover, the peace offerings belong to their owners and a guilt offering belongs to the priest. In the case of the burnt offering, however, no creature tastes it. Rather all of it belongs to the Holy One, blessed be He. Therefore, it is called burnt offering ('<i>olah</i>, rt.: '<i>lh</i>), because it ascends ('<i>olah</i>) to the Holy One, blessed be He, who is [the] Most High (rt.: '<i>lh</i>)."

                "Another interpretation (of Lev. 6:2), “Command Aaron.” What is the function of Aaron here? Israel was bringing offerings whereas Aaron is mentioned, and Scripture says here, “Command Aaron.” But note, it is written (in Numb. 28:2), “Command the Children of Israel, and say unto them, ‘My offering, My bread,’” but here it says (in Lev. 6:2), “Command Aaron […], ‘This is the Torah of the one who ascends (<i>h'lh</i>).’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The masoretic text vocalizes this word as <i>ha’olah</i>, which means, THE BURNT OFFERING, but the midrash interprets the word as though it were vocalized <i>ha’oleh</i>, which means, “The one who ascends,” with the ascending implying self-exaltation. So also Lev. R. 7:6.</i> The Holy One, blessed be He, said (to warn Aaron and his sons), “Whenever someone raises (rt.: '<i>lh</i>) himself up, his end is to go in the fire.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">M.Ps. 11:5.</i> It is so stated (in Lev. 6:2, cont.), “that is the one which ascends upon the burning place.” The generation of the flood [suffered] because of what they said (in Job 21:15), “What is the Omnipresent that we should serve Him?” For that reason they were sentenced to the fire (of <i>Gehinnom</i>), as stated (Job 6:17), “at the time that they were heated, they were burnt in His heat,” and it is written (Job 22:20), “and the fire consumed their remnant.” And likewise the Sodomites, [as stated] (in Gen. 19:24), “Then the Lord rained down upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire.” When Pharaoh said (in Exod. 5:2), “Who is the Lord, [that I should heed His voice],” he exalted (rt.: '<i>lh</i>) himself and said (in Ezek. 29:3), “my Nile is my own and I made it myself.” [He is] therefore (in the words of Lev. 6:2) “upon the burning place.” For so it says (in Ps. 18:14), “The Lord thundered in the heavens,” (Ps. 18:13), \"From the illumination in front of Him, His clouds were pierced by hail and coals of fire.” And also when Sennacherib exalted (rt.: '<i>lh</i>) himself and said (in II Kings 19:23 = Is. 37:24), “it is I who have ascended (rt.: '<i>lh</i>) the mountain heights to the remotest parts of Lebanon.” And what happened to him? (II Kings 19:35:) “The angel of the Lord went out and smote [one hundred and eighty-thousand] in the camp of Assyria.” He had blasphemed (according to II Kings 19:23: cf. 18:17–35) through a messenger (<i>mal'akh</i>);<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The parallel in Is. 37:24 reads “servant” instead of “messenger.”</i> therefore (in II Kings 19:35 = Is. 37:36 // II Chron. 32:21) “the angel (<i>mal'akh</i>) of the Lord went out and smote.” What did he do to him? (Is. 10:16), “And under his glory there shall burn a burning like the burning of fire.” What is the meaning of “under his glory?” That it burned them from within and left alone their clothes on the outside, since a person's glory is his garment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Sanh</i>. 94a.</i> And why did the Holy One, blessed be He, leave their clothes behind? Because they were descendants of Shem, as stated (in Gen. 10:22), “The sons of Shem are Elam, Asshur (Assyria)….” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “I am indebted to their father Shem, because he took the garment and covered his father's nakedness, as stated (in Gen. 9:23), “Then Shem and Japheth took the garment… [and they covered their father's nakedness].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Tanh</i>. (Buber), Gen. 2:21, which interprets the verse to show that Shem took the lead in this act.</i> Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, left their clothes alone and burned [only] their body. This is as it is written (Lev. 6:2), “that (i.e. the person who exalts himself) is the one which ascends (<i>ha'oleh</i>) upon the burning place.” And so too Nebuchadnezzar exalted (rt.: '<i>lh</i>) himself and said (in Is. 14:14), “I will ascend (rt.: '<i>lh</i>) upon the heights of a cloud; I will become like the Most High (rt.: '<i>lh</i>).” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “Upon your life, was it not enough that you said in your heart (in vs. 13), “I will ascend (rt.: '<i>lh</i>) to the heavens; above the stars of God I will set my throne,” but that you should say (in vs. 14), “I will ascend (rt.: '<i>lh</i>) upon the heights of a cloud, I will become like the Most High (rt.: '<i>lh</i>)?” And so he (i.e., Nebuchadnezzar) said to Hananiah and his friends (in Dan. 3:15), “’Now who is the God who shall deliver you out of my hand?’ I have burned His house and exiled His people. He did not stand against me in His house; so will He overcome me in my house?” What did he do? He threw them into the fiery furnace. What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He gave a sign to the furnace and it became a highway.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">PLTYA, from the Gk.: <i>plateia.</i> Buber suggests emending to <i>PLNTYH</i>, from the Gk.: <i>planetes</i>, i.e., “planets.”</i> Whoever was designated to be burned was not burned and whoever was not designated to be burned was burned. So the fire went forth and burned half of the peoples. Thus you find, when they assembled for the dedication of the image, at first there were eight peoples, as stated (in Dan. 3:3), “Then the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the provincial officials assembled.” That makes eight peoples; but when they came in to see Hananiah and his friends, there were only four peoples written there (in vs. 27), “The satraps, the prefects, the governors, and the royal companions assembled.” So where were [the other] four peoples?] It is simply that (in vs. 22) “the flame of the fire slew them.” Now Nebuchadnezzar also was burned by the fire, and the fright (i.e., repulsiveness) of [a body disfigured by] burning was put upon him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For this interpretation, Jastrow, s.v., ‘<i>immus</i>.</i> Why was all of him not burned? The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “Leave this evil man half of himself so that he may know against Whom he blasphemed.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “O wicked one, did you not say, ‘I do not want to live with the children of Adam, but (in Is. 14:14), “I will ascend (rt.: '<i>lh</i>) upon the heights of a cloud?”’ By your life, (according to Dan. 4:22) ‘You shall be driven away from humans and your domicile will be with the wild animals outside.’” Just as He brought the plagues upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt, so did He bring [punishment] upon Nebuchadnezzar. It is so stated (in Dan. 3:32), “The signs and wonders which the most high God has worked for me [it seemed good to me to make known].” This fright of [a body disfigured by] burning fell upon him. Therefore it is stated (in Lev. 6:2), “that is the one which ascends (<i>h'lh</i>) upon the burning place.” (Lev. 6.2) “That is the one which ascends upon the burning place.” This is the kingdom of Edom (Rome), which exalted (rt.: '<i>lh</i>) itself, as stated (in Obad. 1:4), “Though you make [your abode] as high as the eagle, and though [your nest is set] among the stars,” and will be judged by fire, as stated (in Dan. 7:11), “I looked on until the beast was slain and its body destroyed, given over for burning in the fire.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said (in Obad. 1:18), “The House of Jacob shall be fire, and the House of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau shall be straw; [… for the Lord has spoken].” And what did he say? Through Moses (in Lev. 6:2), “that is the one which ascends (<i>ha'olah</i>, rt.: '<i>lh</i>) upon the burning place.” Then after that [Scripture says] (in Obad. 1:21), “Then saviors shall come up on Mount Zion to judge the Mountain of Esau.” Sisera also [was punished by fire] because he blasphemed.

It is so stated, (in Obad. 1:4), “and though your nest is set among the stars.” Stars can only mean Israel, since it is stated (in Gen. 15:5), “look toward the heavens and count the stars …; so shall your seed be.” Jacob says to him, “My brother ('<i>hy</i>), you shall not be like me.” Thus it is stated (in Hos. 13:14), “my brother ('<i>hy</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The unemended reading below, given in braces, shows that the midrash is reading the <i>he</i> in ‘<i>HY</i> as a <i>het</i>, so that the WHERE of the Masoretic Text cited here is to be interpreted as MY BROTHER.</i> your words<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Devarekha.</i> YOUR WORDS is the translation required by the midrash.

Ergo (in Hos. 13:14), “my brother, your words are death.” (Ibid., cont.) “My brother ('<i>hy</i>), your descent (<i>qtb</i>) is to <i>Sheol</i>.” [Q<i>tb</i>] is a Hellenistic<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From the Gk. adverb: <i>Hellenisti.</i></i> word, meaning to descend to <i>Sheol</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus <i>QTB</i> is understood as coming from the Greek, <i>kataba</i>, an aorist imperative meaning, “descend.”</i> When Esau descends to <i>Sheol</i>, Jacob will remain by himself.

(Lev. 7:11:) “This is the law of the sacrifice for peace offerings.” Why was [it worded], “the sacrifice for peace offerings?” Because it makes peace among the altar, the priests, and Israel.

Two verses contradict each other. One text says (in Ezek. 33:11), “Do I desire the death of the wicked?” The other text says (in I Sam. 2:25), “for the Lord took pleasure in slaying them.” How has He not taken pleasure in the death of the wicked? It is simply that before their verdict was sealed, He did not take pleasure; after a verdict was sealed, the Lord took pleasure in slaying them. And so Daniel said (in Dan. 10:21), “However, I will tell you what is inscribed in the record of truth.” Our masters have said, “There was a story about our Holy Rabbi (i.e., about R.

It is simply that for the idolaters, [He is one] “who does not lift up His face,” but for Israel, “The Lord lift up His face unto you.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “Just as Israel [favors] me, so do I [favor] them.

It is therefore stated (in Lev. 7:12), “If he offers it for a thanksgiving” (as the word for thanksgiving can also be understood as confession)."

                "(Lev. 7:11:) “This is the law of the sacrifice for peace offerings.” You find that all of the [other] sacrifices that they would bring, they would bring for sins. In the case of the guilt offerings, they would sacrifice them for sins, as stated (in Ezra 10:19), “And they gave their word (literally, their hand) that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, [they gave] a ram of the flock for their guilt.” Now the sin offering [took place] for the unintentional sin, as stated (in Numb. 15:25), “and their sin offering before the Lord for their unintentional sin.” A burnt offering took place for a thought of the heart. Thus it is stated (in Job 1:5), “and rising early in the morning, he would offer burnt offerings, one for each of them, for Job said, ‘Perhaps my children have sinned and blasphemed God in their hearts.’” But when the thank offering took place, it took place on account of their gratitude. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “This is the dearest to Me of all the offerings.” David said (in Ps. 50:23), “Whoever sacrifices a thank offering honors Me (<i>ykbdnni</i>).” It does not say <i>ykbdni</i> but <i>ykbdnni</i>, [spelled with <i>n</i>] two times, [once] for this world and [once] for the world to come.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lev.

(In Ps. 41:14), ‘Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting (literally: from the world and unto the world); <i>amen</i> and <i>amen</i>.’ What is the meaning of ‘<i>amen</i> and <i>amen</i>?’ <i>Amen</i> in this world and <i>amen</i> in the world to come.” Ergo (in Ps. 50:23), “Whoever sacrifices a thank offering honors Me.” R. Aqiva said, “Whoever speaks songs [of praise] in this world merits speaking songs [of praise] in the world to come, as stated (Exodus 15:1), ‘Then Moshe sang (literally, will sing).’ It does not say, ‘Then he sang,’ but rather, ‘Then he will sing.’ Ergo, whoever speaks songs [of praise] in this world merits speaking songs [of praise] in the world to come.” Therefore, it is stated, (in Ps. 50:23), “Whoever sacrifices a thank offering honors Me.” (Lev. 7:11:) “This is the law of the sacrifice for peace offerings.” Peace offerings are great because they make peace between Israel and their Father in heaven.

Levi says, “Peace is great, because there is no conclusion to the priestly blessing other than peace, as stated (in Numb. 6:26), ‘and grant you peace.’” R.

See how great is the power of peace!” And so you find in the case of Sarah, when the ministering angels came to Abraham and said to him (in Gen. 18:14), ‘At the set time I will return unto you, at the time that life is due.’ At that time (according to Gen. 18:12), ‘Sarah laughed to herself, saying, “… and my husband is an old man.”’ The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Abraham (in vs. 13), ‘[But] why did Sarah laugh, saying, “Is it true that I also shall bear [a child] when I am old?”’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus for the sake of peace the Holy One hid from Abraham the fact that Sarah had called him an old man.</i> Now why all this?

Come and see [concerning] Jethro. The Holy One, blessed be He, brought him near, but He did not choose him. In the case of Rahab the Harlot, He brought her near but did not choose her. Aaron was doubly fortunate because the Holy One, blessed be He, chose him and brought him near. Where is it shown that He chose him? Where it is stated (in I Sam. 2:28), “And I chose him from all the tribes of Israel to be My priest.” And where is it shown that He brought him near?

Since at the time that Avraham made the sacrifice of the ram - as it is stated (Genesis 22:13), \"And Avraham raised his eyes and he saw, and behold there was a ram after\" - what is [the meaning of] \"after?\" Rather, [it is to say that] after the Holy One, blessed be He, saw that [Avraham] came to sacrifice his son, Yitzchak, as a burnt-offering with all of his heart and with all of his soul, He sent him a ram [as a replacement]. The Sages said that the ram to be offered instead of Yitzchak was created from the six days of creation. And that is [the meaning of] that which is written, \"and behold there was a ram after, etc.\" \"And he took the ram, etc.\" (Genesis 22:13) - there the Holy One, blessed be He, promised him that at the time when his children would offer burnt-offerings, they would be immediately accepted. The Sages, may their memory be blessed, said, \"Were it not that Avraham delayed to check the knife, Yitzchak would have been slaughtered. But he did delay to check the knife. Immediately, the mercy of the Holy One, blessed be He, was aroused for Yitzchak. And the Holy One, blessed be He, said to His retinue, 'See how alacritous this righteous one is to fulfill the words of My statement.' Immediately, He told an angel to rescue him, as it is stated (Genesis 22:11), 'And he said, \"Avraham, Avraham,\" and he said, \"Here I am.\"'\" And why did he say, \"Avraham, Avraham,\" twice? Since it was [Avraham's] will to slaughter him and do the will of his Maker, the angel was hurrying and said, \"Avraham, Avraham.\" And from where [do we know] that he checked the knife?

And from where [do we know this]? As it is stated (I Samuel 14:34), \"and you shall slaughter with this (<i>zeh</i>)\" - <i>zeh</i> has a numerical value (<i>gematria</i>) of twelve. And what is [the meaning of] (Leviticus 6:1), \"And the Lord spoke to Moshe, saying?\" [That it should be said] to Aharon. From here we learn that Moshe only said that which the Holy One, blessed be He, would tell him. And therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, said to his credit (Numbers 12:7), \"Not so My servant Moshe; in all of My house, he is faithful.\" And so does it state to Shmuel's credit (I Samuel 3:20), \"And all of Israel, from Dan to Beersheva, knew that Shmuel was faithful as a prophet for the Lord.\" You find that [prophecy] began to come to him when the sons of Eli sinned in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is stated (I Samuel 3:3), \"The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Shmuel was laying in the chamber of the Lord.\" And was he [really] laying in the chamber of the Lord? Rather this is its explanation: The lamp of God had not yet gone out in the chamber of the Lord in which was the ark of the Lord, and Shmuel was laying in his place, [which was] in a different place. \"And the Lord called to Shmuel, and he said, 'Here I am'\" (I Samuel 3:4) - but he did not understand who was calling him, since he was [still] a youth, as it is stated (I Samuel 2:26), \"And Shmuel the youth proceeded to grow in favor with the Lord, as well as with people.\" \"And he ran to Eli and he said, 'Here I am, as you have called me'\" (I Samuel 3:5) - as he thought that [it was Eli that] had called him -  \"and he said, 'I did not call you my son, return and lay down.'\" \"And the Lord called Shmuel again, a third time, and he rose and went to Eli and said, 'Here I am, as you have called me'; and Eli understood that the Lord was calling to the youth. And Eli said to Shmuel, 'Go lay down, and if He calls to you, say, \"Speak, Lord, for Your servant is listening\"'\" (I Samuel 3:8-9) - but he did not say, \"Speak, Lord,\" but [only] (I Samuel 3:10), \"Speak.\" As he said in his heart, \"I do not know if it is the Lord or an angel or something else.\" And he is equated with Moshe: [About] Moshe, the Holy One, blessed be He, said, (Numbers 12:7), \"Not so My servant Moshe; in all of My house, he is faithful\"; and [about] Shmuel He said (I Samuel 3:20), \"And all of Israel, from Dan to Beersheva, knew that Shmuel was faithful as a prophet for the Lord.\" Therefore the verse states (Jeremiah 15:1), \"Even if Moshe and Shmuel would stand in front of me, My soul would not be towards this people.\" And he was equated to Moshe and Aharon [together], as stated (Psalms 99:6), \"Moshe and Aaron among His priests, and Shmuel among those who call His name.\" [Shmuel] would brighten the eyes of Israel, as it is stated (I Samuel 3:3), \"The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Shmuel was laying in the chamber of the Lord.\" Moshe and Shmuel were not like Yechezkel, as he said everything that he saw, and as it is stated [it appears that the next section is corrupted, and that the reference is meant to be from Ezekiel 1 - see Etz Yosef] (Isaiah 6:1), \"In the year that King Uzziah died, I beheld the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne; and the skirts of His robe filled the Temple.\" And therefore Scripture calls him, \"Son of Man.\" Four are living but Scripture calls them dead, and these are them: the destitute, the <i>metsora</i> (one stricken with a spiritual skin disease), the blind and one with no children. From where [do I know this about] the <i>metsora</i>? As it is stated, \"In the year that King Uzziah died.\" And why does the verse call him dead (given that he had not yet died)? Rather, because he had become a <i>metsora</i>.  As it is stated, \"In the year that King Uzziah died,\" [meaning] that he had become a <i>metsora</i>. \"Seraphs stood above Him\" (Isaiah 6:2) - in the heavens to serve Him - [\"Each of them had six wings:] with two he covered his face\" - from modesty that his body should not show before His body - \"with two he covered his legs\" - so that he not see and peer towards the side of the Divine Presence - \"and with two he would fly.\" And does he [really] fly with the wings? Rather, it is as a result of this that they, may their memory be blessed, ordained that a man should hover on his feet when the prayer leader says (Isaiah 6:3), \"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts.\" And Tanchuma said, \"The covering of the feet was because their heel is like the heel of the calf, such that they would not remind [God] about Israel's sin with the calf.\" \"And one called to the other and said\" (Isaiah 6:4) - they would get permission from one another, so that one not preempt the other and begin [alone], and [so] become liable for burning; rather they all started as one, and answered, etc. - \"and the measure of the doorposts shook\" - these were the doorposts of the chamber - \"from the voice of the caller\" - from the voice of the angels calling. This was the day of the earthquake, about which it is stated (Zechariah 14:5), \"it shall be stopped up as it was stopped up as a result of the earthquake in the days of Uzziah, the king of Yehudah.\" As on the day that Uzziah stood to offer incense in the [Temple] chamber, the heavens and the earth shook and the Seraphs came to burn him (<i>lesorfo</i>) with burning (<i>serefah</i>), as it is stated (Numbers 16:35), \"And fire went out from the Lord, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men offering the incense,\" because they offered a foreign fire. And this is [why] it calls them Seraphs, as they came to burn him. And the heavens also came to burn him. And the earth [came] to swallow him, as it thought that his judgement was to be swallowed like Korach, who dissented about the priesthood. [So] a heavenly voice emerged and said, \"A reminder for the Children of Israel [...], and not be like Korach and like his assembly who dissented about the priesthood\" (Numbers 17:5) - \"not be like Korach,\" with swallowing; \"and not like his assembly,\" with burning. But rather \"like the Lord spoke through the hand of Moshe, saying to him\" - through the hand of Moshe at the bush, as it is stated (Exodus 4:6), \"'Put your hand into your bosom and  take it out,' and behold his hand was afflicted with <i>tsaraat</i> like snow.\" [This is] meaning to say that the dissenter be afflicted with <i>tsaraat</i>. And the <i>tsaraat</i> even broke out on his forehead. And [so] he was considered as if he were dead. And so [too,] do you find with Miriam, as it is stated, \"Go out, the three of you\" (Numbers 12:4). There was no need for Moshe to go out, as he did not say anything to [Aharon]. Rather it was so that he would be available to pray for Miriam, [in order] to heal her. \"And He called Aharon and Miriam\" (Numbers 12:5) - why did He call them and leave Moshe. As we [only] say part of a person's praise in front of them, but all of it not in front of him. And so [too,] do we find with Noach. Not in front of him, [God] said, \"A perfectly righteous man\" (Genesis 6:9); but in front of him, He said, \"as I have seen you to be righteous in front of Me\" (Genesis 7:1). Another interpretation of [why Moshe was not called]: So that he not hear the redressing of Aharon. He said, \"Hear <i>nah</i> My words\" (Numbers 12:6) - <i>nah</i> is always an expression of pleading - \"if you have a prophet of God, I will make Myself known to him though a vision to him\" - My Divine Presence will not be revealed to him through a clear lens, but rather through a dream or a trance.\" And why [were they disciplined]? Because they spoke [badly] about Moshe, as it is stated (Numbers 12:6), \"And Miriam and Aharon spoke (<i>tedaber</i>) about Moshe.\" And <i>dibbur</i> is only a harsh expression in each place.\" And so it states (Genesis 42:30), \"The man, the master of the land spoke (<i>deeber</i>) harsh things to us.\" [Whereas] <i>ameera</i> is only an expression of supplication. And so it states (Genesis 19:7), \"And He said (<i>vayomer</i>), 'Do not act evilly, my brothers.'\" \"And He said, 'Hear <i>nah</i> My words'\" (Numbers 12:6) - all <i>nah</i> is an expression of pleading. And why did it say Miriam first and Aharon afterwards? However it was because she started first, and therefore the verse mentioned her first. And what did they say? \"But was it only to Moshe that God spoke?\" (Numbers 12:2) That is to say did He only speak to Moshe, that he separated from his wife? \"Did he not also speak to us?\" (Numbers 12:2) In the same way did He speak to us and we have not separated from the way of the world (marital relations). And how did Miriam know that Moshe separated from the woman? Rabbi Natan said, \"Miriam was alongside Tsipporah when they said to Moshe, 'Eldad and Meidad are prophesying in the camp' (Numbers 11:27); and when Tsipporah heard, she said, 'Woe to the wives of these [men]!' And from what time did Moshe separate? In fact, when the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moshe at Sinai before the giving of the Torah that he should sanctify the people, and say to them, 'for three days do not come close to a woman' (Exodus 19:15). They [then] separated from their wives and Moshe separated from his wife. And after the giving of the Torah, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, 'Go tell them, \"You return to your tents,\" but you stay here with me' (Deuteronomy 5:27-28) - and do not go back to the way of the world. And [so Miriam knew] when Tsipporah said, 'Woe to the wives of these - they are called to prophecy [and] will be separating from their wives just like my husband separated from me.' And from then, Miriam knew and told Aharon. And if Miriam who did not have intention to disgrace Moshe was punished, all the more so with one who recounts the disgrace of his fellow with evil speech, will that person be punished with <i>tsaraat</i>.\" \"As he took a Cushite (Ethopian) woman\" (Numbers 12:1) - the numerical value of Cushite is [equal to that of] beautiful looks. The tally of this one is like the tally for that one. \"The Cushite woman\" tells [us] that everybody concedes about her beauty, in the same way as everyone speaks about the blackness of a Cushite. \"About the matter of the woman\" (Numbers 12:1) - about the matter of her divorce. \"As he took a Cushite woman\" (Numbers 12:1) - what do we learn to say [from here]? Rather, there is a woman who is pleasant in her looks but unpleasant in her deeds, or pleasant in her deeds but unpleasant in her looks, but this one was pleasant in everything.  And now he divorced her? And she is called a Cushite because of her pleasantness; in the same way as a man will call his pleasant son, Cushite, so that the [evil] eye not [come to] overpower him. \"And the man Moshe was very humble (<i>anav</i>)\" (Numbers 12:3) - humble, [meaning] lowly and patient. Another interpretation: \"Very <i>anav</i>\" is from the expression of answering (<i>oneh</i>), meaning to say that if he had heard these words, he would have known to answer and respond with appropriate arguments. \"And the Lord said suddenly\" (Numbers 12:4) - when he revealed Himself to them suddenly and they were impure [as a result of] the way of the world, they yelled out, \"Water, water.\" [This was] to show that Moshe acted properly when he separated from his wife, since the Divine Presence was constantly revealed to him, and there was no set time for speaking [with God]. And so did He say to them, \"I speak to him face to face\" (Numbers 12:8) - face to face did I tell him to separate from the woman - \"and a (clear) vision and not with riddles\" - and this vision is a vision of speech. And perhaps it is a vision of the Divine Presence? [Hence] we learn to say (Exodus 33:20), \"You are not able to see My face.\" And if you ask, \"Behold, it is written (Numbers 12:8), 'and he sees the picture of the Lord?'\" [The answer is] that is a vision 'from the back,' like the matter that is stated (Exodus 33:23), \"and you shall see My back.\" \"Why were you not afraid to to speak about My servant, about Moshe?\" (Numbers 12:8) It does not state, \"about My servant, Moshe,\" but rather \"about My servant, about Moshe.\" [This is] meaning to say, about My servant, even if it is not Moshe; and about Moshe, even if he is not My servant - it would be worthwhile to be afraid in front of him. And all the more so, since he is My servant, and the servant of a king is [like] the king. And you should have said, \"The King does not love him for nothing.\" And if you say that [the King] does not know about [Moshe's] deeds, that is more grievous than the first [mistake of not associating him with the King]! \"And the Lord waxed angry at them and left\" (Numbers 12:9) - teaches that [only] after He let them know their foulness did He proclaim their excommunication. All the more so with flesh and blood, should a person not get angry with his fellow until after he makes [the other's] foulness known to him. \"And the cloud left the tent\" - and afterwards - and behold, Miriam was inflicted with <i>tsaraat</i> like snow\" (Numbers 12:10). There is a [relevant] parable about a king who said to [his son's] pedagogue, \"Strike my child, but do not strike him until I go away from you, as my mercy is upon him.\" \"Please do not place the sin upon us that we sinned and that we blundered. Let her not be like a dead\" (Numbers 12:11-12) - just like a dead body transmits impurity through intercourse, so does a <i>metsora</i> transmit impurity through intercourse. \"About which upon its exit from its mother's womb\" (Numbers 12:12) - it should have stated, \"from our mother's womb,\" but so did Scripture phrase it. And so [too, instead of] \"half of its flesh,\" it should have stated, \"half of our flesh.\" But according to its understanding, it appears to me thus: It is not fitting to leave our sister to be like the dead. Since she exited the womb of the mother of this one (Moshe) that has it in his ability to help, and [yet] doesn't help, behold half of his flesh will be eaten away - as [Aharon's] brother is his flesh. Another interpretation: \"Let her not be like the dead\" - if you do not heal her with prayer, who will quarantine her, and who will render her impure? As it is impossible for me to observe her, since I am a relative - and a relative may not examine scabs - and there is no other priest in the world. This is [the meaning of] that which is stated, \"about which upon its exit from its mother's womb.\" \"God, please, heal her please\" (Numbers 12:12) - the verse came to teach you the way of the world (manners), such that one requesting a thing must first say two or three words of supplication, and then make his requests afterwards. \"Saying\" - what do we learn to say [from here]? [Moshe] said to Him, \"Answer me if You will heal her or not,\" so that He answered him, \"And if her father spit in her face [...]\" (Numbers 12:14). And why did Moshe not prolong this prayer? So that Israel not say, \"His sister is given over to distress and he prolongs his prayer?\" \"Let her be quarantined for seven days and afterwards she will be gathered\" (Numbers 12:14) - and I say that all expressions of gathering that exist with a <i>metsora</i> are because he is sent out from the camps. And when he is healed, he is gathered to the camp; [and] all gathering is an expressions of bringing in. \"And the people did not travel until Miriam was gathered\" (Numbers 12:15) - the Omnipresent awarded her this honor for the sake of one hour that she delayed for Moshe, when he was sent out to the Nile, as it is stated (Exodus 2:4), \"And his sister stood from a distance.\" She delayed for an hour and all of Israel delayed for her sake for seven days. [The comparison that the Torah nonetheless makes between Miriam when she is struck by <i>tsaraat</i> and a dead body shows that] a <i>metsora</i> is considered like dead. And from where [do we know] that one who does not have children [is considered like dead]? From Rachel, as she said to Yaakov (Genesis 30:1), \"Give me children or I am dead.\" And from where [do we know] that one blind is considered like dead? As it is stated (Lamentations 3:6), \"He has made me sit in the darkness, like the dead of yore.\" And from where [do we know] that one destitute [is considered like dead]? As it is stated (Exodus 4:19), \"for all of the men that are seeking your soul (to kill you) are dead.\" Another interpretation: \"This is the law of the burnt-offering, etc.\" So did our Rabbis teach: The burnt-offering was complete holiness, as it did not come for iniquities. The guilt-offering was brought for thefts. But the burnt-offering was not brought for a sin nor for theft, but it rather came for a thought of the heart. And so one who would have a thought in his heart about something would bring a sacrifice of a burnt-offering, as it is stated (Ezekiel 20:32), \"And what goes up (which can also be read as a burnt-offering) upon your spirits.\"And know that a burnt-offering only comes for a thought of the heart. You learn it from Job, who would sacrifice for his sons, as it is stated (Job 1:5), \"And after a round of feasting days, Job sent and prepared them; and rising early in the morning, he would offer burnt-offerings.\" They said to him, \"Job, why are you doing this?\" And he would say (Job 1:5), \"Perhaps my children have sinned and blasphemed God in their hearts.\" Hence you find that he arranged atonement for them for the thought of the heart. And this is [how to understand] the sacrifice of the burnt-offering."
            ],
            [
                "Another interpretation: \"Command Aharon [...]\" (Leviticus 6:2) This is what is written (Psalms 51:20), \"With Your will, do good to Zion,\" and afterwards (Psalms 51:21), \"Then You will desire sacrifices of righteousness, a burnt-offering and a whole-offering.\"  That is to say, if Israel does not offer a burnt-offering before the Holy One, blessed be He, Zion and Jerusalem will not be built. As they are only built through the merit of the burnt-offering which Israel would offer before the Holy One, blessed be He. And why is the burnt-offering different, [so that it is] better than all of the other offerings? Because it is called \"sacrifices of righteousness,\" as it is stated, \"Then You will desire sacrifices of righteousness, a burnt-offering and a whole-offering.\" The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moshe, \"On account of this,  the burnt-offering is so beloved to Me. Hence, 'Command Aharon and his sons,' that they be careful with it, to offer it before Me.\" Why does it state, \"This is the law (Torah) of the burnt-offering?\" It means to say, the reading of the Torah. See how beloved the reading of the Torah is in front of the Holy One, blessed be He. As there is an obligation upon a man to give all of his money to teach Torah to himself and his sons, as it is stated, \"Command Aharon and his sons, saying\" - meaning, that they should say it to the Children of Israel, such that they occupy themselves with the reading of the burnt-offering. As even though they [actually] offer a burnt-offering, they would [also] be occupied with its reading, so that they would get merit in the sacrifice and in its reading. And so did Rav Shmuel bar Abba say, \"The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, 'Even though the Temple is destined to be destroyed in the future and the sacrifices to be nullified, do not [allow] yourselves to forget the order of the sacrifices; but rather be careful to read about them and review them. And if you occupy yourselves with them, I will count it for you as if you were occupied with the sacrifices [themselves].'\" And if you want to know [that this is so], come and see that when the Holy One, blessed be He, showed Yechezkel the form of the [Temple], what did He say? \"Describe the [Temple] to the House of Israel; let them be ashamed of their iniquities, and measure the plan\" (Ezekiel 43:10). Yehezkel [responded] to the Holy One, blessed be He, \"Until now, we are put into exile in the land of our enemies; and You say to me to go and inform Israel [about] the form of the [Temple], and 'write [it] in their eyes, and they should preserve its form and all of its statutes [and do them]' (Ezekiel 43:11). And are they able to do [them]? Leave them until they emerge from the exile, and afterwards, I will go and tell them.\" [So] the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Yechezkel, \"And because My children are in exile, the building of My [Temple] should be idle?\" The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, \"Its reading in the Torah is as great as its building. Go and say it to them, and they will occupy themselves to read the form of the [Temple] in the Torah. And in reward for its reading, that they occupy themselves to read about it, I count it for them as if they were occupied with the building of the [Temple].\" And fortunate is the man who involves himself in Torah and gives his money to teach Torah to his son. As on account of the money that he gives to teach, he merits life in the world to come, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 30:20), \"as it is your life and the length of your days\" - your life, in the world to come; and length of your days, in the world that is long. And know that it is so. Rabbi Assia said, \"Why do the infants of the master's schoolhouse begin by studying the book of Leviticus? Rather it is because all the sacrifices are written in it; and because [the infants] are pure until now and do not know what is the taste of sin and iniquity. Hence, the Holy One, blessed be He, said, 'Let them begin first with the order of the sacrifices - let  the pure ones come and occupy themselves with the acts of purification. Hence I count it for them as if they were standing and offering sacrifices in front of Me.' And He is informing you that even though the Temple is destroyed and sacrifices are not practiced, were it not for the infants that read the order of the sacrifices, the world would not stand.\" Hence, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, \"My children, even thought the Temple is destroyed and the sacrifices are annulled and the sacrifice of the burnt-offering is not practiced, if you occupy yourselves and read the section of the burnt-offering and study the section about sacrifices, I count it for you as if you are offering a sacrifice of a burnt-offering in front of Me, as it is stated, 'This is the Torah of a burnt-offering'\" - meaning to say, one who occupies himself with the Torah of the burnt-offering merits life in the world to come. What is written above? \"A soul that sins and violates a violation of the Lord, and denies against his kinsman, etc.\" (Leviticus 5:21); and afterwards, \"This is the law of the burnt-offering.\" Isaiah said (Isaiah 61:8), \"Since I the Lord love justice, hate theft in a burnt-offering.\" The Holy One, blessed be He, said, \"Do not say, 'I will steal and extort, and [then I will] bring a burnt-offering and it will atone for me.' As I hate theft, even with a burnt-offering made for the theft. And if the world wants that I should accept a burnt-offering, return the theft to its master; and afterwards, if he bring up a burnt-offering for it, I will accept it, as it is stated, 'Since I the Lord [...] hate theft in a burnt-offering' - hate the burnt-offering when the theft is still in his hand.\" And one who reads the Torah of the burnt-offering is as if he brings up and offers a burnt-offering in front of the Holy One, blessed be He. And therefore, fortunate is the one teaches himself Torah and gives his money to teach himself and his sons, as it is stated (Leviticus 7:11), \"This is the law of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings\" (here read as \"This is the Torah of the sacrifice of payments\"). Israel said in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, \"Master of the world, behold You command us that we bring all of these sacrifices. When the Temple was still in existence, a man that sins brings a sacrifice and it is atoned for him. And so [too], he brings a meal-offering and it is accepted for him. But now that the Temple was destroyed, what can we do about our sins and about our guilt?\" [So] the Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, \"If you want that they should be atoned for you, keep My laws, and I will count it for you as if you did a sacrifice in front of Me.\" And from where [do we know this]? \"This is the law (Torah) for the burnt-offering, for the meal-offering, for the sin-offering, for the guilt-offering, for the induction-offerings and for the sacrifice of the peace-offerings\" (Leviticus 7:37) - do not read it so, but rather, \"This is the Torah; not for the burnt-offering, not for the meal-offering, not for the sin-offering, not for the guilt-offering, not for the induction-offerings and not for the sacrifice of the peace-offerings.\" Rather, occupy yourselves with Torah, and it will be considered in front of Me, as if you offered all of the sacrifices in front of Me.  Hence, David stated (Psalms 119:97), \"How much have I loved Your Torah, it is my speech all of the day.\" Since I know that occupation with Your Torah atones for iniquities - therefore I have loved Your Torah. What is [the understanding of] \"upon its burning on the altar all of the night\" (Leviticus 6:2)? This is that they would burn the fats and the limbs the whole entire night, and the prayers were instituted corresponding to the sacrifices. Now that we do not have burnt-offerings, nor sacrifices, nor meal-offerings, nor guilt offerings, they instituted them as prayers. And the evening prayer can be brought the whole night, just as we bring limbs and fats the whole entire night. But the forefathers instituted the prayers, and this means to say, its burning is on the altar all of the night. And why was the burning on the altar and not in another place? Rather the verse states (Exodus 20:21), \"Make an altar of earth (<i>adamah</i>) for Me\" - why of earth? Because man (Adam) was created from the earth, and his name was called Adam, because he was taken from the <i>adamah</i>. And we bring up burnt-offerings and sacrifices on that altar which is made of earth to atone for the body that is taken from the earth. And from where [do we know] that it atones for the soul? As it is written (Leviticus 17:14), \"As the soul of all flesh, its blood is in its soul.\" And it also states (Leviticus 17:11), \"as the blood atones for the soul.\" \"And they shall throw the blood on the altar\" (Leviticus 1:5) - meaning to say, they shall throw the blood - which is the soul - upon the altar - which is from earth like the body - and it shall atone for the soul. \"A permanent fire shall burn upon the altar; you shall not extinguish\" (Leviticus 6:6); but it [also] states (Isaiah 66:24), \"They shall go out and gaze on the corpses of the men who rebelled against Me, their worms shall not die, nor their fire be extinguished, etc.\" [That is referring to] those that deny the Omnipresent. But the fire that is permanently burning on the altar atones for the sins of Israel. And what is [the understanding of] \"altar\" (<i>mizbeach</i>)? [It is an acronym:] <i>Mem</i> is <i>mechilah</i> (pardon), as it pardons their sins; <i>zayin</i> is <i>zechut</i> (merit), as it gives them merit for the world to come; <i>bet</i> is <i>berakha</i> (blessing), as the Holy One, blessed be He, gives them blessing [through it] in the deeds of their hands; <i>chet</i> is <i>chaim</i> (life), as they merit [through it] to life in the world to come. One who leaves all of these - pardon, merit, blessing and life - and goes and worships idolatry, is burned by His great fire, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 4:24), \"As the Lord, your God, is a consuming fire, He is a jealous God.\" How is He jealous? As it is stated (Hosea 2:22), \"And I will betroth you in faith.\" [Hence,] just as a husband is jealous about his wife, so too is the Holy One, blessed be He, jealous, as it is stated (Isaiah 62:5), \"and the joy of the groom towards the bride, etc.\" One who leaves all these will be burnt by His great fire, as it is stated (Isaiah 66:24), \"as their worms shall not die, nor their fire be extinguished, and they will be a disgrace for all flesh.\" But if he repents, the fire burning on the altar atones for him and expiates the fire of <i>Geihinnom</i>. Moreover, every one of Israel that is circumcised enters the Garden of Eden, since the Holy One, blessed be He, places His name on the Israelite so that he can enter the Garden of Eden. And what is the name and the seal that He places upon them? It is <i>Shaddai</i> (the Omnipotent): The <i>shin</i> He placed in the nose; the <i>dalet</i> in the hand; and the <i>yod</i> in the circumcision. And therefore at the time that an Israelite goes to his final home, there is an appointed angel in the Garden of Eden who takes every son of Israel that is circumcised and brings him to the Garden of Eden. But those that are not circumcised; even though they have two letters of the name of <i>Shaddai</i> - as they have the <i>shin</i> of the nose and the <i>dalet</i> of the hand - they do not have the <i>yod</i> of <i>Shaddai</i>, [and so, the letters they have form] the expression, <i>sheid</i> (demon), meaning to say that a demon brings him to <i>Geihinnom</i>. And an Israelite who is circumcised but worships idolatry [also] goes to enter the Garden of Eden, but the Holy One, blessed be He, commands the angel, such that he pulls his foreskin and makes his foreskin appear as it it were never circumcised, such that he not enter the Garden of Eden but rather <i>Geihinnom</i>. And circumcision is a great thing and beloved in front of the Holy One, blessed be He. And all the creatures of the world - whether people, beasts, animals or crawling things, all of them - fear an Israelite when he is circumcised. And so do you find with Yonah. As he fled from his God on the fifth day. And why did he flee? Rather the first time, [God] sent him to restore the border of Israel. The second time, He sent him to Jerusalem to destroy it; but the Holy One, blessed be He, worked up His great mercies and relented from the bad. And [so] they called him a false prophet. The third time, He sent him to Nineveh to destroy it. Yonah judged the case between him and himself - Yonah said, \"I know that the [other] nations are close to repentance. Now they will repent and the Holy One, blessed be He, will [resultantly] send His rage towards Israel. Moreover, Israel will will call me a false prophet\" (etc. in Midrash Tanchuma, Vayikra 8). \"And the men feared a great fear\" (Jonah 1:8) - [this] teaches that fear is greater than wisdom and understanding. As one who has wisdom and understanding, but does not have fear is not anything. As so did King Shlomo, peace be upon him, state (Ecclesiastes 12:13), \"At the end of the matter when all is heard; fear God and observe His commandments, as this is all of man.\""

                "(Lev. 9:1) “And it came to pass on the eighth day….” This text is related to [the verse] (in Eccl. 8:5), “Whoever observes a commandment shall not know anything evil.” Who is this?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Tanh.</i> (Buber), Gen. 2:4.</i> Aaron, of whom it is said (in Lev. 8:33, 35), “And you (i.e., you and your sons) shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting for seven days […]. And you shall remain at the door of the tent of meeting day and night for seven days.” Moses said to them, “Observe mourning for seven days, before it comes to you.” (Lev. 8:35, cont.) “And you shall observe the charge of the Lord.” Moses said to them, “Observe the charge of the Lord, for so did the Holy One, blessed be He, observe seven days of mourning before He brought the flood.” Where is it shown that He mourned [before the flood]? Where it is stated (in Gen. 6:6), “Then the Lord regretted that He had made humanity on the earth, and He was grieving in his heart.” [The expression] “He was grieving” can only mean, He mourned. For so it says concerning David (in II Sam. 19:3), “And the victory [on that day] was turned into mourning for all the people because [on that day they heard it being said,] ‘The king was grieving over his son.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tanh.</i> (Buber), Gen. 2:4; Gen. R. 27:4.</i> So also Ezra said to Israel when they were weeping, each one for his brother and each one for his child (in Neh. 8:10), “Go, eat choice foods and drink sweet drinks…. Do not be grieving, for the joy of the Lord is your strength.” It is therefore stated (in Gen. 6:6), “and He was grieving in his heart.” At that time the Holy One, blessed be He, observed the seven days of mourning, before He brought the flood. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 7:10), “And it came to pass after seven days [that the waters of the flood came upon the earth].” And so Moses was saying to Aaron the priest and to his sons, “Just as the Holy One, blessed be He, mourned over His world before He brought the flood, so [you are to] observe the [required] mourning before it touches (i.e., harms) you.” So they observed [the mourning], but they did not know for what reason they were observing it. Why? (Eccl. 8:5:) “Whoever observes a commandment shall not know anything evil.” (Eccl. 8:5, cont.:) “And a wise heart shall know [there is] a time of judgment.” This is Moses, to whom the Holy One, blessed be He, had already said (in Exod. 29:43), “And there I will meet with the Children of Israel, and there shall be sanctification<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This translation leaves in doubt who or what is sanctified. A more traditional translation would read, “It (i.e., the door of the Tabernacle) shall be sanctified.”</i> through My glory.” [In other words,] I (the Holy One, blessed be He,) will be sanctified there through My glory. Now Moses ministered during the seven days of priestly ordination, but he was afraid, saying, “Perhaps divine judgment will strike him (i.e., Aaron).” Thus it is stated (ibid.), “and there shall be sanctification through My glory.” Still he did not act, but said to Aaron, “Observe seven days of mourning.” [Aaron] said to him, “Why?” [Moses] said to him, “For so the Holy One, blessed be He, has told me – (in Lev. 8:35) “for so I have been commanded.” When they had observed the seven days of mourning and [when] the eighth day had come, Nadab and Abihu went in to make an offering (rt.: <i>qrb</i>). Divine judgment struck them, and they were destroyed by fire. It is so stated (in Lev. 10:2), “So fire came forth from before the Lord and consumed them, so that they died before the Lord.” Moses came and said to Aaron (in Lev. 10:3), “This is what the Lord spoke, ‘Through those who are near (rt.: <i>qrb</i>) to Me, I will be sanctified.” Where did he speak? In the Sinai Desert. (Exod. 29:43), “And there I will meet with the Children of Israel, and there shall be sanctification through My glory.” And so did Moses say to Aaron, “The time that He said to me, ‘Through those who are near to Me, I will be sanctified,’ I thought that He would strike me or you. But now I know that they are greater than I and than you.” (Lev 9:3:) “And Aaron was silent” – the thing was consolation for him. Ergo (Eccl. 8:5), “Whoever observes a commandment shall not know anything evil.”"

                "(Lev. 9:1) “And it came to pass on the eighth day….” This text is related (to Ps. 75:5), “I say to the merrymakers, ‘Do not make merry….’” What is the meaning of [the words], “I say to the merrymakers (rt.: <i>hll</i>), ‘do not make merry (rt.: <i>hll</i>)?’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This root can also mean “act with abandon” and is to be taken in that sense here. For another interpretation of the word, see Lev. R. 20:2.</i> [The verse refers] to whoever sings in a <i>mahanaim</i> dance (<i>mahol</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As in Cant. 7:1 [6:13]. In comparing these two words, the midrash assumes that both words come from the root <i>HLL</i> and ignores the fact that in the first case the <i>H</i> is a <i>he</i> while in the second case the <i>H</i> is a <i>het.</i></i> and so it says (in Jud. 21:21), “to dance (<i>lehol</i>) in the dances.” [Because no happiness endures for a mortal] (Ps. 75:5), “I say to the merrymakers, ‘Do not make merry (rt.: <i>hll</i>).’” Why? The one who is happy today shall not be happy tomorrow; and the one who is depressed today shall not be depressed tomorrow. And so it says (in Eccl. 2:2), “Of laughter I said, ‘It is mad (rt.: <i>hll</i>)….’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>PRK</i> 26:2–3.</i> Are you willing to understand? As behold, even the happiness of the Holy One, blessed be He, did not endure. When? When the Holy One, blessed be He, created His world. He was very happy, as stated (in Ps. 104:31), “the Lord shall be happy in His works.” It also says (in Gen. 1:31), “Then God saw everything which He had made; and behold, it was very good.” [These verses are] to teach you that the Holy One, blessed be He, found pleasure in and took pride in His works. Then He gave the first Adam an easy commandment, but he did not fulfill it. Immediately He rendered him a verdict<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>apophasis.</i></i> [of death], as stated (in Gen. 3:19), “for dust you are, and unto dust you shall return.” So He, as it were, did not remain in His happiness but said, “I created everything only for the human, and now he dies. What pleasure is there for Me? [Now surely if the Holy One, blessed be He,] did not remain [happy], how much the less shall people [remain happy! It is therefore stated (in Ps. 75:5), “I say to the merrymakers, ‘do not make merry.’”] How happy Abraham was! He was blessed in the world, magnified, slew some kings and handed over heaven and earth to the Holy One, blessed be He. Also when the Holy One, blessed be He, gave him a son at age one hundred, he circumcised him and reared him. Then finally he was told (in Gen. 22:2), “Please take your son, your only son…, [and go unto the land of Moriah,] and offer him there as a burnt offering.” So he made a three-day journey, as stated (in Gen. 22:4), “On the third day….” When he returned from Mount Moriah, he buried Sarah. He did not find a place to bury her until he bought one for four hundred silver shekels. Then after that, old age came upon him. Now surely if such was the case with Abraham the righteous, how much the more is it the case with the wicked! Isaac did not remain in his happiness: He escaped from the sword and from the men of Gerar. And [God] informed them about who he was, so that they came to him. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 26:26, 28), “Then Abimelech came unto him from Gerar […. And they said, ‘We have clearly seen that the Lord is with you.’]” But he did not remain in his happiness. Rather (according to Gen. 27:1), “Now it came to pass, that when Isaac was old and his eyes were too weak to see.” So just as [this loss of happiness] happened in the case of Isaac the burnt offering of the Holy One, blessed be He, (according to Gen. 22:2), how much the more does it happen in the case of the wicked! Jacob was the first-born of the Holy One, blessed be He, as stated (in Exod. 4:22), “Israel is My first-born son.” How happy he was! He saw a ladder, and (according to Gen. 28:12-13) “the angels of god were ascending and descending [….] And behold, the Lord stood upon it and said, I am the Lord….” Then he went to Laban, fled from Esau, became Laban's servant for twenty years and in the end became wealthy, sired children and returned in peace. He also met Esau and was saved from him, and paid his vow. But in the end he did not remain in his happiness. Instead (according to Gen. 34:1), “Now Dinah [the daughter whom Leah had borne to Jacob] went out…,” and was raped]. There also came upon him the trouble over Joseph. Now surely if Jacob the righteous – one to whom the Holy One, blessed be He, had said, “In whom I will be glorified,” as stated (in Is. 49:3), “Israel, in whom I will be glorified” – did not remain in his happiness, how much the less will the wicked [so remain! It is therefore stated (in Ps. 75:5), “I say to the merrymakers, ‘Do not make merry.’”] How happy Joshua was! He slew thirty-one kings, gave Israel the land to possess, and distributed it. In addition all Israel gave him a [helping] hand and said (in Josh. 1:18), “Anyone who disobeys your command… [shall be put to death.” Such an honor was] something of which [even] Moses our master did not merit. Still he (i.e., Joshua) did not remain in his happiness, but rather died childless. It is therefore stated (in Ps. 75:5), “I say to the merrymakers, ‘Do not make merry.’” How happy Eli was, when he was king, chief justice, and high priest! It is so stated (in I Sam. 1:9), “now Eli [the priest] was sitting on the throne by the doorpost of the Temple of the Lord.” “Now Eli the priest was sitting on the throne,” because he was king. [He was] “by the doorpost of the Temple of the Lord,” because he was chief justice. Still he did not remain in his happiness. Instead (according to I Sam. 4:18), “And it came to pass that when he (i.e., a messenger) mentioned the ark of God, he (i.e., Eli) fell backward from off the throne….” Moreover, his two sons, Hophni and Phinehas died. So just as this [shift in fortune] happened with Eli the righteous, how much the more [does it happen with] the wicked! You find neither man nor woman who saw joys like Elisheba bat Amminadab, [the wife of Aaron, as stated (in Exod. 6:23), “And Aaron took for a wife Elisheba bat Amminadab”].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>PRK</i> 26:2; <i>Zev.</i> 102a; <i>Tanh</i>. (Buber), Lev. 6:2.</i> She saw her husband become high priest serving in the high priesthood and [as a] prophet. In addition, Moses, her husband's brother, was king and prophet. Moreover, her sons were deputies [to the high priest] in the priesthood, and her brother Nahshon was head of all of the princes of Israel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Numb. 10:13, Nahshon was in command of the troops of Judah, and the troops of Judah headed those of the other tribes. See also Numb. 2:3; I Chron. 2:10.</i> Still she did not remain in her happiness. Rather, when two of her sons went in to offer a sacrifice, (according to Lev. 10:2,) “Fire came forth from before the Lord and consumed them, so that they died before the Lord.” It is therefore stated (in Ps. 75:5), “I say to the merrymakers, ‘Do not make merry.’” And so Solomon said (in Eccl. 2:2), “Of laughter I said, ‘It is mad.’” There is a story about one of the great Babylonian [scholars], who married off his son,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>PRK</i> 26:2; Lev. R. 20:2.</i> and made a great banquet for the sages. He said to his son, “Go up and bring us a jar of such and such a wine from the attic.” He went up to the attic. [There] a snake [from] among the jars bit him, and he died. His father remained with those who were reclining [at his table]. So he delayed and did not come. [Finally,] his father said, “Let me go up and see what my son is doing.” His father went up [and] found him cast down dead among the jars. What did that saint do? He waited by himself until the guests had eaten and drunk sufficiently. When they had finished, he said, “You came to say a bridegrooms' blessing over my son. [But instead] say a mourners' blessing over him. You came to bring my son to the wedding canopy. [Instead] bring him to [his] grave.” They said about R. Zakkay of Kabul and they opened about him (in the words of Eccl. 2:2), “Of laughter I said, ‘It is mad; and what does joy do?’”",

So it was in the case of Aaron. He planted and sprouts came up. These were Aaron's sons (i.e., according to I Chron. 6:35-36), “his son Eleazar, his son Phinehas, his son Abishua, [his son Bukki…].” (Ps. 92:13), “The righteous one shall flourish (rt.: <i>prh</i>) like the palm.” Where did he plant [them]? (Ps. 92:14), “[They are] planted in the house of the Lord.” (Lev. 8:33), “And you shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting [for seven days].” It is therefore stated (in Lev. 9:1), “And it came to pass on the eighth day.” (Lev. 9:1), “And it came to pass on the eighth day Moses called [Aaron and his sons]….” Our masters have said: All seven days when Moses was at the thornbush, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “Go on My mission”; but he was saying (in Exod. 4:13), “Please make someone else Your agent.” So was it the first and second day. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “I say to you, ‘Go,’ and you say to Me, ‘Please make someone else Your agent?’ By your life, I am paying you back. Someday soon when that tabernacle is being made, you will be thinking privately that you should serve in the high priesthood; but I am telling you, ‘Call Aaron to serve.’” It is therefore stated (in Lev. 9:1), “Moses called Aaron and his sons.” There is a calling which is for abundance [and there is] a calling for famine. Where is it shown [that there is a calling] for abundance? Where it is stated (in Ezek. 36:29), “I will call for the grain and increase it.” And where is it shown [that there is a calling] for famine? [Where it is stated (in II Kings 8:1),] “for the Lord has called for a famine… [for seven years].” There is a calling for greatness, as stated (in Lev. 9:1), “Moses called [Aaron].” Moses said to him, “The Holy One, blessed be He, has told me to ordain you as high priest.” Aaron said to him, “You have labored on the tabernacle; so shall I be made high priest?” He said to him, “By your life, even though you are being made high priest, it is as if I were being made [high priest];<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, Exod. 1:24.</i> for just as you were glad for me in my greatness, so I am glad for you in your greatness.” Now when was he glad for him? When the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him (in Exod. 3:10), “So come now, I will send you unto Pharaoh.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “Go, keep this commandment.” Moses said to Him (in Exod. 4:10, 13), “Pray (<i>bi</i>) – Lord, You are doing me wrong. My brother is older than I; yet I am going ahead of him.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “[By your life], you have spoken rightly; nevertheless (according to Exod. 4:14), when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.” R. Simeon ben Yohay said, “The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, ‘That heart which is glad for his brother's greatness shall have those precious stones (of Exod. 28:17-21) laid upon it.’” Therefore, all those seven days that Moses was busy in the tabernacle, he was sprinkling the blood and performing the sacrificial burning of the choice pieces. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, “What do you think? That you are high priest? Call your brother so that he may serve as high priest.” Ergo (in Lev. 9:1), “And it came to pass on the eighth day Moses called [Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel].” Why the elders of Israel? In order to promote him in the presence of the elders.

He converses with a woman in the market place where he talks obscenely and says evil things in a drunken state without being ashamed, because he is confused and knows neither what he is saying nor what he is doing. (Prov. 23:32) “In the end it will bite like a snake.” When the snake bites a person, he does not feel it for a time; but after he goes home, [the poison in] the wound permeates him. “In the end it will bite like a snake,” most certainly like a snake. Just as in the case of the snake, [the Holy One, blessed be He,] cursed the land on account of it, as stated (in Gen. 3:17), “cursed is the land because of you”; so in the case of wine, Canaan, who was a third of the world was cursed on account of it, as stated (in Gen. 9:24-25), “Then Noah awoke from his wine…, [And he said, ‘Cursed be Canaan].’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As Enoch Zundel explains in his commentary on <i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 3:5, Canaan’s curse comes through his father Ham, upon whom the curse actually fell. Since Ham represented a third of Noah’s sons, a third of the world came from him. So also Numb. R. 10:2.</i> Ergo (in Prov. 23:32), “In the end it will bite like a snake….” (Vs. 33) “Your eyes will see strange things.” See what wine causes one who drinks it! “Your eyes will see strange things” [is a reference to], (Ps. 81:10) “There shall not be a strange god with you.” It causes him to serve idols. So it says (in Is. 28:7), “These also reel with wine and stagger with strong drink.” What is the meaning of these? [These of] which it is spoken (in Exod. 32:4), “These are your gods, O Israel.” Thus it is stated (in Exod. 32:6), “and the people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to engage in amorous sport.” [It was] because of wine that they said (in Exod. 32:4), “These are your gods, O Israel.” Therefore (in Prov. 23:33), “and your heart will speak deceitful things.” Thus it causes four things: idolatry, uncovering of nakedness, shedding of blood, and evil speech. See how strong wine is! So it is written (in Hab. 2:5), “And moreover, wine betrays an arrogant man.” It is also written (in Prov. 21:24), “An insolent and arrogant one, scorner is his name.” Now “insolent” must mean idolatry. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 119:21), “You rebuke the cursed insolent ones.” Moreover, “insolent ones” must [also] refer to the uncovering of nakedness. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 86:14), “O God, insolent ones have risen up over against me…”; and it says (in Ps. 19:14), “Also keep your servant from insolent ones.” Moreover, when one drinks and transgresses, he sees the whole world as a ship. It is so stated (in Prov. 23:34), “You will be like one who lies down in the midst of the sea.” When he lies down they smite him, but he does not feel it. Thus it is stated (in vs. 35), “They struck me, but I felt no hurt; they beat me, but I did not know it.” So when he is unknowing and unashamed, he uncovers himself. Then afterwards he returns and seeks it (i.e., wine). [Thus it is stated (ibid.),] “when I wake up, I seek it yet again.” See how evil is the end of those who drink wine. [Isaiah said (in Is. 5:11),] “Woe to those who rise early in the morning to pursue strong drink; who remain behind in the evening for wine to inflame them.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “Inasmuch as wine causes such [evils], it is right for Me to command the priests not to drink wine when they minister before Me. Ergo (in Lev. 10:9:), “Drink no wine or intoxicating liquor.” Solomon said (in Prov. 23:20), “Do not be among those who imbibe wine.” Do not cause yourself to drink [wine (<i>yyn</i>), which implies] seventy. Then you would face seventy [judges of the Sanhedrin] and fall into the hands of death. <i>Y</i> (= 10) plus <i>y</i> (= 10), for a subtotal of 20, plus <i>n</i> (= 50) results in seventy.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Sanh</i>. 38a.</i> So you would face seventy [members of] the Sanhedrin<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>Synedrion</i>.</i> and cause your own death. See what is written (in Deut. 21:18-19), “If one has a defiant and rebellious son…, his father and mother shall take hold of him [and bring him out unto the elders of his town]….” Then the sentence shall be passed over him; and (in vs. 21) “[All the people of his own town] shall stone him [to death] with stones.” Why? Because he is (according to vs. 20) “a glutton and a drunkard.” So Solomon has said (in Prov. 23:20), “Do not be among those who imbibe wine, who gorge themselves on meat,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See also Prov. 23:22, which adds an admonition to obey parents.</i> lest you bring stoning upon yourself, the most weighty of the executions.<br>R. Judah bar Shallum the Levite said, “In the Hebrew language the name [for wine] is <i>yyn</i>, and in the Aramaic language its name is <i>hmr</i>.

The wine enters into each and every limb, so that the body becomes weakened and knowledge becomes confounded. When wine enters, knowledge departs.” And so Eleazar Haqappar has taught, “Wine (<i>yyn</i>), with a numerical value of seventy enters; and secrets (<i>swd</i>), with a numerical value of seventy,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>S</i> (= 60), <i>W</i> (= 6), and <i>D</i> (= 4) add up to 70.</i> depart.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Sanh</i>. 38a, which attributes the teaching to R. Hiyya.</i> Therefore, the high priest was commanded not to drink wine during the time of the service, lest it confound his knowledge; for he preserves the Torah (and preserves the service) and the knowledge. Thus it is stated (in Mal. 2:6), “The true Torah was in his mouth, and no injustice was found on his lips.” It also says (in vs. 7), “For the lips of a priest preserve knowledge.” Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded Aaron (in Lev. 10:9), “Drink no wine or intoxicating liquor, you and your children as well.” And do [not] think that I may have commanded you [only] for the past in the beginning, at a time when the Temple was standing and you were ministering in it, since it is stated (ibid., cont.), “when you come unto the tent of witness….” [Rather,] you shall also keep yourselves from wine forever, as stated (ibid., cont.), “it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.” Therefore, keep yourselves from wine, because wine is a sign<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>semeion</i>.</i> of a curse. In the case of Noah, what is written about him? (In Gen. 9:21), “Then he drank of the wine and became drunk.” Cham entered and saw his nakedness. What did [Noah] say to him? He cursed his son (in vs. 25), “And he said, ‘Cursed be Canaan.’” Therefore (in Lev. 10:9), “Drink no wine or intoxicating liquor.” And so you find that the ten tribes went into exile only from wine.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. Lev. 5:3; Numb. 10:3.</i> See what [scripture] says (in Amos 6:1), “Woe to those who are at ease in Zion,” because they were dwelling at ease in pleasure palaces.

The peoples of the world would sit and talk. They would say, “Who is the mightiest in Israel?” And they would answer, “Samson.” Then again they would say, “Who is the mightiest among the gentiles?” And they would answer, “Goliath,” about whom it is written (in I Sam. 17:4), “his height was six cubits and a span.” Ergo (in Amos 6:1), “The notables of the leading nation, the ones to whom the House of Israel comes.” Then again they would say, “Who is the wealthiest among the peoples of the world?” And they would answer, “Hadrian.” Then, “Who is the wealthiest in Israel?” And they would answer, “Solomon.” And these would agree with those that Solomon was the wealthiest, as stated (in I Kings 10:27), “And the king made silver [in Jerusalem as plentiful as stones].” Come and see, each and every tribe had its own May festival.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk. <i>Maioumas</i>.</i> When one wanted to go to his May festival, he would take his herd with him, so that he would eat fatlings from his flock. It is so stated (in Amos 6:4, 6), “and they would eat lambs from the flock…. Those who drink [straight] from the wine bowls….” What is their end? (Amos 6:7) “Therefore they shall now go at the head of the exiles.” Why? Because they had a passion for wine. For this reason he warns Aaron (in Lev. 10:9), “Drink no wine or intoxicating liquor.” Blessed is the one who does not have a passion for wine, for you find such to be the case with the children of Jonadab ben Rechab, in that their ancestor had commanded them, “Do not drink wine, you and your children forever” (Jer. 35:6). But what was his reason for saying, “Do not drink wine, you and your children?” It is simply that he had heard Jeremiah prophesying that the Temple would be destroyed. He said to them, “From now on, (Jer. 35:6-7), ‘Do not drink wine… You shall not build a house, sow seed, plant a vineyard, [or own such things]; but you shall dwell in tents all your days.” Now they had mourned and observed the commandments of their ancestor; but when Jeremiah was prophesying to Israel [and] telling them to repent, they were not doing so. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Jeremiah, “You are telling them to repent, and they are not doing so. Now in the case of the children of Jonadab ben Rechab, when their ancestor gave them a simple commandment, they observed it; but when I tell Israel to repent, they do not observe [My commandment].” It is so stated (in Jer. 35:14), “The words of Jonadab ben Rechab have been upheld. He commanded his children not to drink wine, and to this day they have not drunk it…. But I spoke to you from early morning to late evening, [and you did not hearken unto me].” What is written there? The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Jeremiah, “Say to them, ‘By your life, whereas you have heeded this commandment, your lineage shall never disappear from before Me, even as it is written (in vs. 19), “Therefore, thus says the Lord [of hosts, the God of Israel], ‘Someone belonging to Jonadab ben Rechab shall not (ever) be cut off [from standing] before Me for ever.’”’” He therefore enlightens them concerning wine (in Lev. 10:9), “Drink no wine or intoxicating liquor.” Isaiah said (in is. 24:11), “There is a cry over wine in the streets; all gladness is obscured.” What is the meaning of “all gladness is obscured (rt.: '<i>rb</i>)?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Exod. 11:8.</i> [That ] all gladness has become dark, just as you say (in Gen. 1:5),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Also Gen. 1:8, 13, 19, 23, 31.</i> “and there was evening ('rb).” (Is. 24:11, cont.:) “The joy of the earth has [departed], because Zion has come to an end.” Thus it is written (in Ps. 48:3), “Beauteous landscape, joy of the whole earth, [even Mount Zion].” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “In this world wine is a sign of a curse, but in the world to come I will make it into fresh grape juice. Thus it is stated (in Joel 4:18), “And it shall come to pass on that day the mountains shall flow with fresh grape juice….”"

If it had not been for Israel accepting it, the world would have returned to the measurements of His waters. [It is] just as you say (in Is. 40:12), “Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand?” But when Israel accepted it, the earth was still, as stated (in Ps. 76:9), “the earth was afraid and was still.” So it is from there (i.e., from Sinai) that the gentiles received their judgement,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>apophasis</i>.</i> as stated (Hab. 3:6, cont.), “He looked and made nations tremble (rt.: <i>ntr</i>).” R.

But in the case of Israel, because they are [destined] for life, He has said to them (in Lev. 11:44), “and be holy, for I am holy”; (in Lev. 11:43) “You shall not make yourselves loathsome.” This you may eat and this you may not eat.

Thus have our masters taught: There are ten beasts: “The deer, the gazelle, the roebuck, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope, the mountain sheep”; (Deut. 14:5) “the ox, the sheep and the goat” (Deut. 14:4). There are no more than these in the world. Said the Holy One, blessed be He, “Guard yourselves, not to defile yourselves with an impure beast and with an impure swarming creature.” So did David say (in II Sam. 22:31 = Ps. 18:31), “As for God, His way is perfect, the word of the Lord is pure (rt.: <i>tsrp</i>).” Thus, the commandments were given only to purify (rt.: <i>tsrp</i>) [mortals] through them. They said to him. “Rabbi, what does the Holy One, blessed be He, care whether one ritually slaughters cattle and eats [the meat] or whether one slaughters cattle by stabbing and eats it? Will some such thing benefit Him (i.e., the Holy One, blessed be He,) or harm Him?” Know that this ritual slaughter was given only to purify (rt.: <i>tsrp</i>) Israel. As in the future to come, the Holy One, blessed be He, will make a meal for the righteous from the behemoth and the leviathan, and there is no ritual slaughter there. Know that the leviathan is an unusual creature, and the angels fear him, as stated (in Job 41:17), “From his rising do the powers fear.” And if they throw many spears of iron upon him, he considers them like straw, as stated (in Job 41:19), “He considers iron like straw.” And also the behemoths of my fields are harsh, as it crouches on a thousand mountains as stated (in Psalms 50:10), “the behemoths on a thousand mountains.” And [so] how are they slaughtered? Rather, they come and fight, one with the other, as stated (in Job 41:8), “One approaches to the other.” The behemoths approach the leviathan and hold him by his horn and split him, and the leviathan’s death [that he inflicts] will be the opposite, as he smites him with his tail and kills him.

Then He said to him (in Numb. 8:4), “This is the making of the menorah.” This teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, showed him with a finger. But nevertheless, [Moses] found it difficult. What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He engraved it on the palm of Moses’ hand. He said to him, “Go down and make it just as I have engraved it on your hand.” Thus it is stated (in Exod. 25:40), “Observe and make them [by means of] their pattern.” Even so, he found it difficult and said (in Exod. 25:31), “with difficulty (<i>mqshh</i>)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">While this meaning, so understood by the midrash, is possible, a more usual English translation would read, HAMMERED WORK, or something similar.</i> will the menorah be made,” meaning to say, how difficult it was to make. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “Cast the gold into the fire, and it will be made automatically.” So it is stated, “with difficulty will the menorah be made” [be made (a reflexive form, in the niph'al) is what is written, i.e.,] was made of its own accord. This teaches that Moshe had difficulty with the menorah, and the Holy One, blessed be He, showed it to him with a finger, as stated (in Numb. 8:4), “this.” In reference to the moon (<i>yareah</i>), where is it shown [that Moses had difficulty]? (Exod. 12:1-2) “Then the Lord spoke unto Moses…, ‘This month (<i>hodesh</i>) for you.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Hodesh</i> also means “new moon.”</i> He said to him, “In the month of Nissan, you will see like this and like that and [you shall] sanctify [it].” This teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, showed him with a finger. In reference to creeping things, where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Lev. 11:29), “Now this shall be unclean for you from among the swarming things which swarm on the earth.” The Holy One, blessed be He, caught each and every species, showed them to Moses, and said to him, “This you may eat, and this you may not eat.” [Thus it is stated (in Lev. 11:2, 4),] “This is the creature that you may eat …. However this you may not eat.” Moreover, do not be surprised over [this] thing, since it is a fact that the Holy One, blessed be He, showed all creatures to the first Adam, and he gave them names. And where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Gen. 2:19), “and all that man called the soul ….” After he had given names to all of them, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “And I, what is My name?” He said to him, “It is Y____.” Thus it is written (in Is. 42:8), “I am Y____; that is My name,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Below, Numb. 6:12.</i> this My name, which the first Adam gave Me.

But if so, why did He not so command the first Adam? The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “When I ordained an easy commandment for him, he transgressed against it.

R. 29:1; cf. <i>Sanh</i>. 38b; <i>ARN</i>, A, 1; <i>PRE</i> 11.</i> In the second He consulted with the ministering angels and said (in Gen. 1:26), ‘Let us make man in our image.’ In the third He gathered his dust. In the fourth He kneaded him. In the fifth He shaped him. In the sixth He stood him up as a <i>golem</i>. In the seventh He blew breath into him. In the eighth He brought him into the Garden of Eden. In the ninth He commanded him, ‘Eat of this, and do not eat of that.’ In the tenth [Adam] sinned. In the eleventh he was judged. In the twelfth he was expelled.” Thus you must conclude that he did not remain obedient to the commandment for even a single hour. R. Judah ben Pedayah said, “Would that someone remove the dust from your eyes, O first Adam, you who could not persevere in your temptation for even a single hour, while here your children are keeping all the commandments which were given to them and persevering in them!”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. R. 21:7; cf. Lev. R. 25:2.</i> One of them rises to plant, till, weed, prune, take pains to irrigate, and see the fruits of his plantings when they produce first fruits. Then he folds his hands and does not taste them, in order to fulfill what is stated (in Lev. 19:23), “three years it shall be [forbidden] to you….” But in the case of the first Adam, it was told him, “Eat of this, and do not eat of that,” and he was not able to remain obedient to the commandment for a single hour. Instead (according to Gen. 3:6), “then she also gave some to her husband, and he ate,” but [when] your children were commanded to eat this and not to eat that, [they remained obedient to those commandments]. And [this obedience is] especially [evident] when someone from Israel takes a bovine, an ox, or a lamb, slaughters it ritually, skins it, washes it, and inspects its health. When it is found to be unfit, he holds back and does not eat it. Ergo (in II Sam. 22:31 = Ps. 18:31, cont.), “the word of the Lord is pure.” For that reason, the first Adam was not commanded, because it was revealed to the Holy One, blessed be He, that he could not remain obedient to many commandments; as behold, he was commanded [only] one commandment, and he did not persevere with it. But in the case of Israel, when the Holy One, blessed be He, gave them many commandments, they observed them. He therefore expanded the Torah and commandments for them, and said to them (in Lev. 11:2-7), “These are the creatures that you may eat…. These, however, you may not eat…: the camel […]; the rock badger […]; the hare […]; and the pig.” Another interpretation of (Lev. 11:4-7). The camel (rt.: <i>gml</i>) represents the kingdom of Babylon, since it is stated (in Ps. 137:8), “O Daughter of Babylon, who are to be destroyed, fortunate is the one who repays you the recompense (rt.: <i>gml</i>) [with which you recompensed (rt.: <i>gml</i>) us].” The rock badger represents the kingdom of Media, since it made Israel into a corner and ownerless (as in Esth. 3:6), “to exterminate, to kill and to destroy all [the Jews]…”;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The exact relation of the rock badger (<i>ha’arnevet</i>) to Media is unclear. One possibility is suggested by Lev. 11:6, according to which the rock badger has marks of both uncleanness and cleanness. Lev. R. 13:5 reports two versions of such an interpretation. The Rabbis interpreted this mix to mean that Media produced a righteous as well as a wicked person (perhaps Haman and Mordecai or Haman and Darius the Mede of Dan. 11:1). According to R. Judah b. R. Simon, the last Darius was clean on the side of his mother Esther and unclean on his father’s side.</i> and likewise, the name of Ptolemy’s wife was rock badger (<i>arnevet</i>). The hare alludes to Greece, since it brought low the Torah from the mouth of the prophets.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Probably because prophecy ceased under Greek rule; but according to Lev. R. 13:5, “hare” alludes to the Greek kingdom, because Ptolemy’s mother was named “Hare.” Cf. <i>yMeg</i>. 1:11 (71d), according to which the Greek translators of Lev. 11:6 emended “hare” to “short-legged one” for the same reason. Cf. also <i>Meg</i>. 90b, according to which it was Ptolemy’s wife who was named Hare. In actuality the person named “Hare” (Gk.: <i>Lagos</i>) was Ptolemy’s father.</i> As it is stated (in Amos 8:11), “Behold days are coming says the Lord, God, and I will send a hunger…”; and it is written (in Amos 8:12), “And they shall wander from sea to sea….” How is this? In the future to come the Holy One, blessed be He, will issue a proclamation: Whoever has been engaged in such and such a commandment may come and receive his reward. Then the gentiles also will say, “Give us our reward, for we have performed a commandment.” The Holy One, blessed be He, [however] has said, “Whoever has observed the [commandments of the] Torah may come and receive his reward.”"

                "<b>And it was on the eighth day:</b> Rabbi Tanchuma, Rabbi Chiya, Rabbah and Rabbi Berakhiya in the name of Rabbi Elazar [all] said, \"Any place that it is stated, 'and it was (<i>vayehi</i>),' it is nothing but a term of grief [hinting to the sound, (<i>vay</i>), meaning woe].\" Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani said in the name of Rabbi Natan, \"This midrash came up to our hands from the exile - 'Any place that it is stated, \"and it was in the days of,\" it is nothing but a term of grief.'\" And there are five: (1) \"And it was in the days of Amrafel\" (Genesis 14:1). What grief was there over there? They made a war to kill Avraham, our father, as it is stated (Genesis  14:2), \"made war.\" [It is comparable] to a dear friend of a king who entered a province, and on his account was the king [concerned] about that whole province. [Then people] came and grappled with him with words. And when he wanted to leave, they all said to him, \"Woe that the king will no longer be concerned about the province as he was.\" So [too,] was Avraham a dear friend of the Holy One, blessed be He - as it is written about him (Isaiah 41:8), \"the seed of Avraham, My dear one\"; and it is written (Genesis 12:3), \"and through you shall all the families of the world be blessed.\" And when the kings came and grappled with him, they all said, \"Woe that the Holy One, blessed be He, will not be concerned with the world as He was; since He was concerned with the world for his sake.\" This is [the meaning of] that which the verse stated (Genesis 14:7), \"And they came to Ein Mishpat (which can be understand as the eye of justice)\" - Rabbi Acha said, \"They sought to grapple with no less than the eyeball of the world.\" They said, \"They sought to blind the eye that [suppressed] the trait of [strict] judgment in the world.\" [The verse continues -] \"It (<i>hee</i>) is Kadesh,\" [but] it is written, \"he (<i>hu</i>) is Kadesh\"; meaning to say, he sanctified (<i>hu kidesh</i>) the name of the Holy One, blessed be He and went down to the fiery furnace. When they saw that the things were like this, they cried out. (2) \"And it was in the days of Achaz the son of Yoshiah, King of Yehudah\" (Isaiah 7:1). What grief was there over there? \"It is what is stated by the verse (Isaiah 9:11), \"Aram is in front and the Philistines are behind, etc.\" [It is comparable] to a king that gave his son over to a mentor, and the mentor hated him. He said, \"If I kill him, I will become liable for death. Rather, I will take away his nourishment from him and he will die on his own.\" So did the evil Achaz say, \"If there are no goats, there will be no rams; if there is no flock, there will be no shepherd, [and] where will the world be?\" So did he say, \"If there are no masters, there will be no students; if there are no students, there will be no sages; if there is no Torah, there will be no synagogues and study halls.\" What did he do? He passed all the synagogues and study halls and sealed them. And this [is the meaning of] that which the verse states (Isaiah 8:16), \"Bind up the message; seal the instruction with My disciples.\" And when they saw that the things were like this, they all started to cry out, \"Woe that the world is being destroyed\" - when [study of] the Torah was negated, that was in the days of Achaz. (3) \"And it was in the days of Yehoyakim the son of Yoshiyahu\" (Jeremiah 1:3). What grief was there over there? \"I looked at the earth, and behold it was empty and void; at the heavens and their light was not\" (Jeremiah 4:23), [It is comparable] to edicts of the kings that were brought to the provinces of the kingdom. In each and every province, when it came to their hands, everyone would stand on their feet, uncover their heads and read them with fear, trembling and perspiration. But when they were brought to the province of the king, they tore them up and burned them: When the Holy One, blessed be He, sends His messenger to the nations of the world, they repent, cover themselves in sackcloth and fast - as did the people of Nineveh, as it is stated (Jonah 3:7), \"from the order of the king and his principals, etc.\" They, may their memory be blessed, said, \"One who had a beam or a stone that was stolen in his house would destroy the house and remove it and return the theft.\" And because of this did Yonah fear to prophesy to Nineveh. As Rabbi Tarfon said, \"The fish was designated, etc.\" And the nations of the world are afraid in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, and [so, they are] close to repentance, whereas Israel is stiff-necked. This is what the verse stated (Jeremiah 36:23), \"And it was when Yehudi would read three columns or four\" - meaning to say, he read four verses - and in the fifth verse, he read, \"And her tormentors became the head\" (Lamentations 1:5) - and it is is written (Jeremiah 36:23), \"he would tear it with a scribe's blade and throw it into the fire until the end of all of the scroll.\" And when they saw this, everyone began to cry out, \"Woe for the decree that is hanging over us.\" And the other (4) - \"And it was in the days of Achashverosh\" (Esther 1:1). What grief was there over there? [It is comparable] to a king that had a vineyard, and he had three enemies. What did they do? One cut the small berries, the second ripped the clusters and the third uprooted the vines: The king is King of the kings of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He; His vineyard is Israel, as it is stated (Isaiah 5:7), \"For a vineyard of the Lord of Hosts is the House of Israel\"; [And] their three enemies are Pharaoh, Nevukhadnetsar and Haman. Pharaoh began with the small berries, as it is stated (Exodus 1:22), \"Any son that is born, throw him into the river.\" Nevukhadnetsar ripped the clusters, as it is stated (Jeremiah 29:2), \"the craftsmen and the smiths.\" Who are the craftsmen (<i>charash</i>)? These are the ones that pray the mute prayer silently, and are victorious with their prayer over all the nations of the world. The smiths?  That all the nations of the world come in a vice in front of them but [then] flee, as they put a vice on all the nations - and Nevukhadnetsar come to destroy them; and he destroyed the craftsmen and the smiths, and exiled them. The evil Haman [then] came [to] uproot the vines, as it is stated (Esther 3:13), \"to annihilate, to kill and to destroy.\" Everyone began to cry out, \"Woe,\" and they mourned in front of the Omnipresent. (5) \"And it was in the days when the judges ruled\" (Ruth 1:1) - there was famine there; and what grief is greater than famine? And from where [do we know] that there was famine? As it is stated (Ruth 1:1), \"and there was a famine in the land.\" And why was there a famine? Because Israel and the judges were not judging true judgement; as it is is stated, \"And it was in the days when the judges ruled\" - [and] we find [following it], \"he\", which indicates evildoers. [As] so do we find, \"he was Datan and Aviram\" (Numbers 26:9); \"he was Achashverosh\" (Esther 1:1); \"he was [...] Achaz\" (II Chronicles 28:22). So too were the judges. And to what is the matter comparable? To a province that was liable a tax to the king. [So] he sent collectors to collect it. The people of the province rose and smote the collectors and hung them. The judgment that they were liable - as they appointed other judges for themselves - they did to the collectors. So did they do at that time, as Elimelekh would judge the judges; [since] he was a strongman and there were many men below him. He saw the distress and the famine, but he did not warn the sinners to repent from their evil. And he stopped living in Beit Lechem for himself to live in the field of Moav - to sustain his soul during the famine, and the soul of his wife during the famine, and the soul of his sons; and he did not know that [it is] the Torah that sustains its masters and not the vanities of the world. And he was one who was important, as it is stated (Ruth 1:1), \"and a man went from Beit Lechem, Yehudah.\" And we only say, \"man,\" about an important man, as it is stated (Numbers 12:3), \"And the man, Moshe, was very humble.\" As Elimelekh was an important man, as they would consider him [so] in his place - and [yet] he went to save his soul and the soul of his household, and did not trouble himself about the matters of the community; even as he was an important man and they would have believed his words, [such as] to make them repent from their evil and bring them to repentance. And therefore, it occurred to him as it is written in the verse (Ruth 1:3), \"And Elimelekh, the husband of Naomi died.\" And so [too,] his sons died, as it is stated (Ruth 1:5), \"And [...his] two [sons,] Machlon and Khilyon died, and the woman survived her two children and her husband.\" As so were they judging their judges, like Sodom. Rabbi Shimon ben Abba said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, \"Any place that it is stated, 'and it was (<i>vayehi</i>),' it is used for grief and it is used for joy. And when for grief, there is no grief like it, and when for joy, there is no joy like it.\" (The text is missing the following integral part of the midrash, found in Bereishit Rabbah 42:3 and other places: Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachman came and divided it, \"Any place that it is stated 'it will be,' it is used for joy; [but] 'and it was' [is for] grief.\") The Sages responded, \"Behold 'And God said, \"<i>Vayehi</i> (here used as a command form, and not past tense) light\"' [is] joy!\" He said to them, \"It too is not of joy, as the world did not merit to use that light. As so did Rabbi Yehudah bar Simon say, '[Regarding] the light that the Holy One, blessed be He, created on the first day, Adam [could] look and observe from [one] end of the world to the [other] end. [But] since the Holy One, blessed be He, saw the deeds of the generation of Enosh and the generation of the flood, He arose and hid it from them. That is [the meaning of] what the verse states (Job 38:15), \"From the wicked is their light withheld.\" And to where is it hidden? [It is] in the Garden of Eden, for the righteous ones, as it is stated (Psalms 97:11), \"Light is sown for the righteous, and joy for the straight-hearted.\"'\" They responded to him further, \"It states, 'And it was evening and it was morning, one day.'\" He said to them, \"On that day too, it is not of joy, as all the acts of the first day are destined to wither, as it is stated (Isaiah 51:6), 'when the heavens melt away like smoke and the earth wither like a garment.'\" They responded to him, \"Behold, the [acts of] the second day, the third day, the fourth day, the fifth day, the sixth day.\" He said to them, \"They too are not of joy, as all the acts of the six days of creation require further action - for example, wheat needs to be ground; mustard needs to be mellowed; lupine need to be mellowed.\" They responded to him, \"[And what about,] 'And it was that the Lord was with Yosef and he was a successful man' (Genesis 39:7)?\" He said to them, \"It too is not of joy, as that 'bear' chanced upon him from this, as it is stated in the verse, 'after' - 'And it was after these things, and the wife of his master raised, etc.' (Genesis 39:7).\" They responded to him, \"[And what about,] 'And it was that the Lord was with Yehoshua, and his reputation was in all the land' (Joshua 6:27)?\" He said to them, \"It too is not of joy, as Yair the son of Menashe, whose weight corresponded to the majority of the Sanhedrin, fell at that time; as it is stated (Joshua 7:5), 'And the men of Ai smote of them, like thirty-six men' - and the master said, 'That is Yair the son of Menashe, whose weight corresponded to the majority of the Sanhedrin.'\" They responded to him, \"And is it not written (I Samuel 18:14), 'And it was that David was successful in all of his ways and the Lord was with him'?\" He said to them, \"It too is not of joy, as enmity descended into the heart of Shaul from this, as it is stated (I Samuel 18:9), 'And it was that Shaul eyed David.'\" They responded to him, \"And is it not written (II Samuel 7:1), 'And it was when the king sat in his house and the Lord allowed him rest from all of his enemies'?\" He said to them, \"It too is not of joy, as on that same day, Natan the prophet came to David and said to him, 'However you will not build the House' (I Kings 8:19).\" They said to him, \"Behold, we have said what is ours; [now] say what is yours - that 'and it will be' is joy.\" He said to them, \"'And it will be on that day that the mountains will drip with nectar' (Joel 4:18), that will be in the days of the messiah, and there will be great joy for Israel. And so [too,] 'And it will be on that day that a man shall save alive a heifer of the herd and two sheep' (Isaiah 7:21). And so [too,] 'And it will be on that day that living waters will come out from Jerusalem' (Zechariah 14:8). And so [too,] 'And he will be like a tree planted over streams of water' (Psalms 1:3). And so [too,] 'And the remnant of Yaakov will be among many nations' (Micah 5:6).\" They said to him, \"But behold, it is written (Jeremiah 38:28), '<i>vahaya</i> (here used in the past tense, and not like the other examples) when Jerusalem was captured'!\" He said to them, \"It too is not of grief, as on that day was the verdict of Israel for their sins taken; as so is it written (Lamentations 4:22), 'Your sin has been completed, Daughter of Zion, He will not again exile you.'\""

                "<b>And to the elders of Israel:</b> Rabbi Akiva said, \"Israel is compared to a bird - just like a bird cannot fly without wings, so [too,] Israel cannot do anything without elders. Rabbi Yose bar Chalafta said, \"Great is old age - as if they are elders, they are beloved; and if they are youths, the Holy One, blessed be He, makes old age spring upon them [early].\" Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai said, \"Not [only] in one place, nor in two or three places do we find that the Omnipresent dispenses honor to the elders: In Egypt, as it is stated (Exodus 3:18), 'And they will listen to your voice and you will come, you and the elders of Israel'; at the [burning] bush, 'Go and collect the elders of Israel' (Exodus 3:16); at Sinai, 'you and Aharon, Nadav and Avihu and seventy of the elders of Isreal' (Exodus 24:10); at the tent of meeting, 'to Aharon and to his sons and to the elders of Israel. So [too,] in the future to come, the Holy One, blessed be He, dispenses honor to the elders, as it is stated (Isaiah 24:23), 'And the moon will be embarrassed and the sun ashamed, since the King, the Lord of hosts [will be] on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem and across from His elders will be honor.'\" The Sages, may their memory be blessed, said, \"The Holy One, blessed be He, will in the future make an assembly of His elders. And that is what the verse states, 'since the King, the Lord of hosts [will be] on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem and across from His elders will be honor.'\" And the Holy One, blessed be He, honors the righteous ones and the pious ones, but any time that a mistake comes from them, He chastises them. See that which is written about the sons of Aharon, as they were assistant priests and erred with wine, as so did they, may their memory be blessed, say - that they were inebriated with wine; and hence the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded after their death, to warn about wine, as it is stated, \"Wine and strong drink shall you not drink, you and your sons with you.\" The Holy One, blessed be He, said, \"Be careful with wine. See that which Noach did, as he began to err with it, as it is stated (Genesis 9:20), 'And Noah, the man of the earth, began to plant a vineyard,' and it is written (Genesis 9:21), 'And he drank from the wine and he became drunk and he revealed himself.' What caused him to become disgraced? The wine. And it caused him to bring a curse upon his seed, as it is stated (Genesis 9:25), 'And he said, \"Cursed is Canaan.\"' And hence, be warned about wine, since wine brings a person to all the sins in the world - to licentiousness, to the spilling of blood, to theft and to all the [other] sins in the world.\" And does it not gladden the heart of man; and the verse praise it like one reading in the Torah? As it is stated,  (Psalms 104:15), \"And wine gladdens the heart of a man,\" and it states (Pslams 19:9), \"The precepts of the Lord, gladdening the heart.\" And further, He bequeaths the Garden of Eden to those occupied with Torah and its precepts, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 30:20), \"as it is your life and the length of your days\"; and a drunk - when the wine is still with him - sits happily, as if he was sitting in the Garden of Eden. [The resolution is] like [the story of] that student who was a pious man, and he had a father that drank heavily. And each time he would fall in the marketplace [from drinking], people would come and hit him with stones and pebbles. And they would yell and call out behind him, \"Look at the drunkard.\" And when his son the pious man saw, he was embarrassed and wished for his soul to die. And every day, he would say to [his father,] \"I will order [it] and they will bring you from every wine that they sell in the province to your house, and [just] don't go to drink in the tavern, such that you make a disgrace of yourself and of me.\" And he [would] say this to him once or twice every day, until his father said that he would do this, as he said, not to go to drink in the tavern. And so did the pious man do, that he would make food and drink for him every day and every night and put him to sleep in his bed, and then leave. One time, rain was falling and that pious man went out to the marketplace and was walking to the synagogue for prayer. And he saw a drunkard laying in the marketplace and a puddle of water was falling on him. And the young men and the youths were hitting him with stones and pebbles and throwing clay in his face and into his mouth. When this pious man saw, he said in his heart, \"I will go to father and bring him to here, and I will show him this drunkard and the disgrace that the young men and youths make out of him; maybe he will prevent his mouth from drinking in the tavern and from getting drunk.\" And so did he do, he brought him to there and showed [the drunkard] to him. What did his old father do? He walked over to the drunkard and asked him in which [tavern] he drank that wine from which he became drunk. His pious son said to him, \"Father, for this did I call you? Rather to see the disgrace they make out of him, as so do they do to you at the time that you drink - maybe you will prevent your mouth from drinking in the tavern?\" He said to him, \"My son, I have no enjoyment and Garden of Eden in my life besides this.\" When the pious man heard, he left with a bitter spirit. But the precepts and the Torah are not [just like] the joy of wine - since when the wine leaves his body, sorrow comes into his heart, 'this one leaves and that one comes'; but the Torah and the commandments are a delight and joy in this world and in the world to come, as it is stated,  \"as it is your life and the length of your days\" - in this world and in the world to come, which is completely long. And you will find further with the sacrifices that it states about the lambs, \"two one-year old unblemished lambs\" (Numbers 28:9); about the bread, two <i>issaron</i>; but about the wine, [only] a quarter of a <i>hin</i>. So little would they offer [of the wine] to make known proper action (<i>derekh erets</i>). As much wine brings a person to sin, to great grief and to loss of the purse, as it is stated (Proverbs 23:31), \"Do not ogle that red wine, as it lends its color to the cup, as it flows on smoothly\" - in his home, such that there not be with what to cook, since he sells and gives everything for the sake of wine. Another [understanding]: Do not read it [as] \"to the cup (<i>kos</i>),\" but rather \"to the purse (<i>kis</i>),\" as he puts an evil eye into his purse. And so do you find with the Children of Ephraim, as it states (Hosea 7:11), \"But Ephraim was like a silly dove, with no heart.\" Why? Because they drink much wine; and it states (Isaiah 28:1), \"Woe, the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim.\" And we have also found with a man and a woman that the verse states to take out their son to pelt him with stones, as it is stated (Deuteronomy  21:18), \"And if a man has a son that is wild and rebellious,\" and it states (Deuteronomy 21:19), \"And his father and his mother shall grab him.\" And why all of this? Because he went out to bad culture, such that he will spend his money, steal and do sins, and become liable for the death penalty. And before he becomes liable for death, \"And his father and his mother shall grab him, etc. And all of the people of his city shall pelt him, etc.\" (Deuteronomy 21:19-21). And know [from this], that there is great evil in drinking much wine. And how much meat does he eat more than another man, for which he is liable for death? One <i>litra</i>. And another verse states, \"Do not be of those who guzzle wine, or glut themselves on meat to them\" (Proverbs 23:20). What is [the meaning of] \"to them?\" Meaning to say, to them do they do the evil - as they spend [all] their money and come to disgrace; and in the end, they become liable for death in this world and in the world to come.

He said, “’O that I were as in the months of old,’ and would that I had the days which I had when I was in my mother's belly!” “As in the days when God watched over me!” [These words] teach that the infant is watched over while it is in its mother's belly.

(Job 29:4:) “When I was in the days of my youth (<i>horef</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Horef</i> also means “winter.” Buber notes here that in the following simile, the infant in the womb is being protected in the womb as the winter rain protects the soil.</i> when God's company was over my tent.” [These words teach about the infant.] Just as the rain is at work in the soil for it to become muddy, so the infant is muddy in its mother's womb. Another interpretation [of] “when God's company was over my tent”: These words teach about the infant. Just as the infant gets muddy, so is a person muddied by sins, so that misfortunes come upon him. At that time [Job] said (in Job 29:2), “’O that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me,’ and would that I had the days which I had when I was in my mother's belly!” What does he finally say (in vs. 4)? “When I was in the days of my youth.” R.

Judah said, “The rod had a weight of forty <i>seah</i> and was [made] of sapphire;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>sappheirinon</i>, an adj. meaning “of sapphire,” or “of lapsis lazuli.”</i> it also had ten plagues (<i>makkot</i>) inscribed upon it with the acronym<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>notarikon.</i></i> <i>dtsk 'dsh b'hb</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">D = <i>dam</i> (“blood”), <i>Ts</i> = <i>Tsefardia</i>‘ (“frogs”), K= <i>kinnim</i> (“gnats”), ‘ = ‘<i>arov</i> (“flies”), <i>D</i> = <i>dever</i> (“cattle pestilence”), <i>Sh</i> = <i>shehin</i> (“boils”), <i>B</i> = <i>barad</i> (“hail”), ‘ = ‘<i>arbeh</i> (“locusts”), <i>H</i> = <i>hoshekh</i> (“darkness”), <i>B</i> = <i>bekhorot</i> (“first-born”).</i> Then Moses, when he had looked at the rod and seen the punishment (<i>makkah</i>) which had been appointed to come, brought it upon Pharaoh. Ergo (in Hab. 1:7), “Terrible and dreadful [is that one],” this refers to Pharaoh; “his justice and his dignity proceed from himself,” this refers to Moses. And also the messiah, who in the future will take retribution from Gog and Magog and all of its troops, grew up with them in the city, as stated (Isaiah 27:10), “there shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down and consume the branches thereof.” Another interpretation (of Hab. 1:7), “Terrible and dreadful [is that one]”: This refers to Edom, of which it is stated (in Dan. 7:7), “frightful, dreadful, and [exceedingly] strong.” (Hab. 1:7, cont.), “His justice and his dignity proceed from himself.” This refers to Obadiah since he was an Edomite proselyte and he also prophesied [against] him (i.e., against Edom, in Obad. 1:1), “The vision of Obadiah; thus says the Lord God to Edom […].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. Sanh. 39b.</i> Ergo (in Hab. 1:7), “Terrible and dreadful,” this refers to Edom; “his justice and his dignity proceed from himself,” this refers to Obadiah.Another interpretation (of Hab. 1:7), “Terrible and dreadful”: This refers to Sennacherib, since it is stated (in II Kings 19:24), “with the sole of my feet I have dried up all the streams of Egypt.” He also said (in II Kings 18:35 = Is. 36:20 // II Chron. 32:14), “Who are there among all the gods of the lands which have saved their land from my hand?” And it also says (in Is. 8:8), “and the radial bones<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For this translation of <i>muttah</i>, see Jastrow, s.v. In the context of Scripture, a more normal translation of <i>muttah</i> would be “spread.”</i> of his wings (i.e., the army of Sennacherib) shall fill the breadth of your land, O Immanu-El].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. M. Pss. 79:1.</i> One sixtieth of the troops<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>ochlos.</i></i> had been sufficient for the Land of Israel, since it is stated (ibid.), “and the radial bone of his wings.” This radial bone of a cock is one sixtieth of its wings. When he came to enter Jerusalem, he said to his troops, “You sleep, and in the morning we shall throw our rings into its midst and stone them with them.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, Sennacherib believed that his army was so large and Jerusalem so small that his army could bury the city in their rings. Cf. <i>Sanh</i>. 95a, according to some renderings of which, each soldier would use as much mortar as necessary to seal a letter with a signet ring. So Levi, in his Talmud and Midrash lexicon, s.v., <i>gulmohrag.</i> See also Rashi on this passage, according to whom the army would use stones easily dislodged from the wall of Jerusalem.</i> Ergo (in Hab. 1:7), “Terrible and dreadful is he.” (Ibid., cont.:), “His justice and his dignity proceed from himself.” These refer to his children. When he went up to destroy Jerusalem, he did not succeed. [It is so stated (in II Kings 19:35 = Is. 37:36),] “the angel of the Lord went out and smote [one hundred and eighty-thousand] in the camp of Assyria….” It is also written (in II Chron. 32:21), “so he returned shamefaced to his own land, and when he came into the house of his god, [some of those who came out of his own belly struck him down there with the sword].” Ergo (in Hab. 1:7), “Terrible and dreadful is he,” this refers to Sennacherib; “his justice and his dignity proceed from himself,” this refers to his children, who killed him. Another interpretation (of Hab. 1:7), “Terrible and dreadful is he”: This refers to Nebuchadnezzar, of whom it is stated (in Is. 14:13), “And I will ascend to the heavens; [above the stars of God I will set my throne].” (Hab. 1:7, cont.:) “His justice and his dignity proceed from himself.” This refers to Evil-merodach (his son). Our masters have said, “When Nebuchadnezzar was driven away, just as it is written (in Dan. 4:29), ‘You shall be driven away from humankind’; all that time Evil-merodach served in his place.” Then when he returned, he put him in prison. Now whoever was imprisoned by him never emerged from the prison until the day of his death. Thus it is stated (in Is. 14:17), “he never released his prisoners to their homes.” When Nebuchadnezzar died, they wanted to make Evil-merodach king. They approached him, but he did not accept. He said to them, “I listened to you the first time. For that reason I was imprisoned. So now I shall not listen to you. Perhaps he is alive. Then he will rise up against me and kill me.” They stood over Nebuchadnezzar, dragged him from his grave, and brought him out. Then he saw that he was dead, and they made him king. [This act was] to fulfill what is stated (in Is. 14:19), “And you have been cast from your grave like a detestable offshoot.” Ergo (Hab. 1:7), “Terrible and dreadful is he,” this refers to Nebuchadnezzar; “his justice and his dignity proceed from himself,” this refers to Evil-merodach. Another interpretation (of Hab. 1:7), “Terrible and dreadful is he”: This refers to the human race, which rules over all which the Holy One, blessed be He, has created in His world. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 8:7), “You have set him as ruler over the [works] of Your hands [….].” (Hab. 1:7, cont.) “His justice and his dignity proceed from him.” Thus when he sins, the Holy One, blessed be He, brings torments upon him from his [own body]. Why? Because His ways are not like the ways of flesh and blood. When [a person of] flesh and blood wants to punish his slaves, he brings [whips] and fetters to punish them and cause them pain; but the Holy One, blessed be He, is not like that. Rather it is from a person's whole body that He punishes and beats him. And from where is it shown? From what is written about the matter (in Lev. 13:2), “When anyone has on the skin of his flesh [a swelling or a sore or a bright spot, and it becomes on the skin of his flesh the plague of leprosy, he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest].” One verse says (in Is. 46:10), “My plan shall come to pass, and I will accomplish all My desire.” But another verse says (in Ezek. 33:11), “As I live, says the Lord, [it is not my delight for the wicked to die].” This is what is written about the matter, (in Lev. 13:2), “When anyone has on the skin of his flesh ….”; and it is [yet also] written (in Ps. 5:5), “For You are not a God who delights in wickedness; evil may not abide with You.”"
            ],
            [
                "(Lev. 13:2), “When anyone has on the skin of his flesh.” This text is related (to Ps. 5:5), “For You are not a God who delights in wickedness. [This verse is] to teach you that the Holy One, blessed be He, does not delight in convicting a person, as stated (in Ezek. 33:11), “As I live, says the Lord, it is not My delight for the wicked to die.” In what does He delight? In vindicating (rt.: <i>tsdq</i>) His people. Thus it is stated (in Is. 42:21), “The Lord was delighted because of His [servant's] vindication (<i>tsdq</i>)…,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the interpretation of the midrash and of the new JPS translation.</i> [i.e.] because of His people's vindication (<i>tsdq</i>)] and not [their] conviction. So also you find that in the case of the first Adam, when he created him, He set him in the Garden of Eden. Then He gave him a command and said to him, “Eat this, but do not eat from this, for (according to Gen. 2:17) ‘on the day that you eat from it, you shall surely die.’” [When] he transgressed, he brought a sentence<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>apophasis.</i></i> upon himself. [And then] the Sabbath came, and He acquitted him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb.: <i>pinnahu.</i> This word means “removed him” as well as “acquitted him.” In other words, Adam’s acquittal meant that his sentence was reduced from death to removal from the Garden. So M. Pss. 92:3.</i> He began to talk with him [about] whether he would repent. It is so stated (in Gen. 3:9), “The Lord God called unto Adam and said, ‘Where are you?’” [This means, “What is your state?”] The Lord can only mean the quality of mercy, as stated (in Exod. 34:6), “The Lord, the Lord is a merciful and gracious God.” For him He had the quality of mercy precede the quality of strict justice. Ergo (in Ps. 5:5), “For You are not a God who delights in wickedness,” in that He does not delight in convicting a person. He began to talk with him, as stated (in Gen. 3:11-12), “Who told you that you were naked? Then the man said, ‘The woman….’” He left Adam alone and began to talk with the woman, as stated (in vs. 13), “Then the Lord God said to the woman….” But when He came to the serpent He did not talk with him. Instead He immediately gave him a sentence, as stated (in vss. 14–15), “So the Lord God said unto the serpent, ‘Because you have done this …. I will put enmity between you [and the woman]….’” [Then] He returned to the woman and said to her (in vs. 16), “I will greatly multiply your pain in pregnancy.” And when He returned to the man, He did not convict him. Rather He intimated to him that he should repent. Where is it shown? R. Berekhyah said in the name of R. Levi, “When He said to him (in vs. 19), ‘By the sweat of your brow shall you eat bread, [until you return …].’ ‘You return’ can only be mean repentance, since it is stated (in Hos. 14:2), ‘Return O Israel, to the Lord your God, as you have stumbled in your iniquity.’” When [Adam] did not repent, He expelled him from the Garden of Eden, as stated [(in Gen. 3:24), “And He drove out the man.” Ergo I would say (in Ps. 5:5), “For you are not a God who delights in wickedness.” What is the meaning of (ibid., cont.), “evil may not abide with You.” R. Tanhuma bar Hanila'i in the name of R. Berekhyah said in the name of R. Johanan, “Before the Holy One, blessed be He, stand only angels of peace and angels of mercy, but the angels of wrath are far from Him. It is so stated (in Numb. 14:15), ‘the Lord, of long patience.’ Do we not already know that He is of long patience? But rather what is the meaning of He is ‘of long patience?’ That the angels of wrath are far from Him, as stated (in Is. 13:5), ‘They come from a far land from the end of the heavens, even the Lord and the weapons of his wrath.’” Another interpretation (of Ps. 5:5, cont.), “evil may not abide with You”: R. Johanan said, “If you do not pursue evil, evil will not pursue you, nor will it dwell with you. Ergo, (Ps. 5:5, cont.), ‘evil may not abide with You,’ as ‘abide with You,’ can only mean dwelling, as stated (Exodus 2:48), ‘And if a stranger dwells with you.’” Another interpretation (of Ps. 5:5, cont.), “evil may not abide with You”: R. Eleazar ben Pedat said in the name of R. Johanan, “The name of the Holy One, blessed be He, is not mentioned in connection with evil but only in connection with good.” You know that it is so. When the Holy One, blessed be He, created the light and the darkness and gave them names, [Scripture] mentioned His name in connection with the light but did not mention His name in connection with the darkness.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. R. 1:6.</i> Thus it is stated (in Gen. 1:5), “And God called the light day, and the darkness He called night.” Behold, it mentioned His name with the light; but when it comes to the dark it doesn’t say, “and God called the darkness night,” but “He called [the darkness] night.” So also you find that, when He created Adam and Eve, [Scripture] mentioned His name in connection with them, as stated (in Gen. 1:28), “Then God blessed them…”; but when He cursed them, it did not mention His name in connection with them. [Thus it is stated] (in Gen. 3:16-17), “And unto the woman <i>He</i> said […]. And unto Adam <i>He</i> said.” Now if you say [that] behold, [Scripture] mentioned [His name] in connection with the serpent when He cursed him, since it is written (in Gen. 3:14), “So the Lord God said unto the serpent, ‘Because you have done this, more cursed shall you be’”; the sages have taught thus: The Holy One, blessed be He, has mentioned His name in connection with three things, even though they stood for evil: In connection with the inciter, i.e., the serpent, since he incited the woman and said (in Gen. 3:5), “’For God knows that on the day that you eat from it, your eyes shall be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil,’ like Him. Just like He created His world, you [two] will be able to create worlds like Him. [But He doesn’t want this,] as every artisan hates his fellow [artisan].” So because he incited her and spoke slander, [Scripture] mentions His name in connection with [the serpent]. In connection with one who transgresses the words of the sages, as is stated (in Jer. 11:3), “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, ‘Cursed is the one who does not heed the words of this covenant.’” In connection with one who puts his trust in flesh and blood, as stated (in Jer. 17:5), “Thus says the Lord, ‘Cursed is the man who trusts in a human being, who makes flesh his strength and whose heart turns from the Lord.’”<br>So also you find in the case of Noah, [that Scripture used (God’s) name] when he blessed his sons, as stated (in Gen. 9:26), “And he said, ‘blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem…;’” but when he cursed Canaan, [Scripture did not mention the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He, in connection with him], as stated (in vs. 25), “And he said, ‘Cursed be Canaan….’” So also you find in the case of Elisha the prophet, that when the king of Aram came to fight against Israel, he consulted with his servants and made pits [to trap] them. He said, “When Israel comes to fight against us, they will fall into the pits,” as stated (in II Kings 6:8-9), “When the king of Aram was fighting against Israel, [he consulted with his servants, saying, ‘My camp shall be in such and such a place.’ But the man of God sent unto the king of Israel [saying], ‘Take care [not to pass this place, because the Aramaeans are camping there.]’” So the Holy One, blessed be He, does nothing (according to Amos 3:7) without having revealed His purpose unto His servants the prophets. When Israel passed by once and twice without falling in, the king of Aram took notice and said to his servants (in II Kings 6:11), “Will you not tell me which of us is for the king of Israel?” His servants said to him (in vs. 12-14), “’[It is because] Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words which you speak in your bedroom.’ So he said, ‘Go and see [where he is, so that I can send and seize him,’ and it was told to him, saying, ‘Behold he is in Dothan.’ Then he sent horses and chariots and a heavy force there.” Immediately Elisha’s youth rose and saw that horses, riders and a force encircled the city. Immediately he cried out (in vss. 15-16), “and said [unto him], ‘Alas, my Lord, what shall we do?’ Then he said, ‘Fear not, for there are more with us than with them.’” Immediately Elisha prayed and mentioned the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, as stated (in vs. 17), “Then Elisha prayed and said, ‘Lord, please open his eyes and let him see’; so the Lord opened the eyes of the servant and he saw, and there was the hill full of fiery horses and chariots round about Elisha!” Immediately Elisha arose and cursed the Aramaeans (in vs. 18), and he said, “’Please smite this nation with a blinding light’; so He smote them with a blinding light according to the word of Elisha.” Now [Scripture] did not mention the name, but when [Elisha] prayed over them again for their eyes to be opened, he said (in vs. 20), “O Lord, open the eyes of these men that they may see.” Ergo, the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, is mentioned in connection with good, but not with evil. So also you find that when the prophet saw the four chariots that were compared to the four kingdoms (that would rule over Israel), [it states (in Zech. 6:1),] “and I lifted my eyes, and behold, four chariots were coming out between the two mountains….” But when it spoke about the redemption, [it states (in Zech. 2:3),] “Then the Lord showed me four smiths.” So also you find that when the five angels of destruction came to destroy Jerusalem, as stated (in Ezek. 9:2), “And here were six persons coming by way of the upper gate [which faces north, each with his weapon of destruction in his hand]”; Gabriel was sent with them, as it is written (in Ezek. 10:2), “Then He spoke unto the person clothed in linen and said, ‘Go in among the wheelwork.’” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Gabriel, “Fill your hands with coals of fire from among the cherubim and scatter them over the city,” as it is written (in Ezek. 10:2), “Then He spoke unto the person clothed in linen and said, ‘Go in among the wheelwork [under the cherub, and fill your hands with coals of fire from among the cherubim, and scatter them over the city].’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. below, Lev. 8:5.</i> Gabriel came and stood at the wheel. The cherub said to him, “What do you desire?” He said to him, “Thus and so has the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded me.” He said to him, “Take [them].” He said to him, “You put them in my hand.” Immediately (according to Ezek. 10:7), “Then the cherub stretched out his hand from among the cherubim [unto the fire that was among the cherubim…].” R. Johanan said in the name of R. Simeon ben Johay, “If the coals had not been cooled off [while passing] from the hand of a cherub to the hand of Gabriel, there would not have remained of the enemies of Israel (a euphemism, meaning Israel) a [single] survivor or refugee.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yoma</i> 77a. For more details, see Lam. R. 1:13 (41).</i> So the Holy One, blessed be He, wanted to do what was evil, not by Himself, but through an angel. In the age to come, however, He will do what is good by Himself, as stated (in Ezek. 36:25), “I will sprinkle pure water upon you….” Ergo (in Ps. 5:5), “For You are not a God who delights in wickedness; evil may not abide with You.” What is the meaning of (Ps. 5:5) “and evil may not abide with You?” [It is] that [Scripture] does not cause the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, to rest upon evil, except for two [evil] sayings upon which the Holy One, blessed be He, did cause His name to rest. These are the following: (The first one is Dan. 9:14:) “So the <i>Lord</i> watched over evil and brought it upon us, because the Lord our God is righteous.” Was it because the Lord our God is righteous (<i>tsaddik</i>), that He brought the evil? It is simply that the Holy One, blessed be He, was charitable (<i>tzekekah</i>) to us when He first brought about the exile to Babylon of Jeconiah before the exile of Tsidikiyah. And what was charitable? That He first brought about the exile of Jeconiah to Babylon along with the artisans, the smiths, and all the valiant men. Now [those] descended to Babylon and they established a [framework] for Torah [study]. For if it had not happened like that, the Torah would have been forgotten in the exile. It is simply that those who believed in the words of Jeremiah went forth with the Torah. [They included (according to II Kings 24:16)] “a thousand artisans and smiths.” What is the meaning of “artisans (<i>hrsh</i>)?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Git</i>. 88a; <i>Sanh.</i> 38a; <i>Yalqut Shim‘oni</i>, Dan., 1066.</i> When they opened with words of Torah, all [present] became as those who are (deaf-)mute (<i>hrsh</i>). [And what is the meaning of] “smiths (rt.: <i>sgr</i>)?” After they closed (rt.: <i>sgr</i>) it, there was no one in all Israel who was able to open it. Ergo (in Dan. 9:14), “because the Lord our God is righteous.” So He acted justly during that exile in that He watched over it, and He still performed a great kindness for Israel [with reference to that exile]. How? In [the month of] Tebet they were scheduled to go into exile from Jerusalem, for so does [Scripture] say (in Ezek. 24:1-2), “[Then the word of the Lord came unto me in the ninth year of the tenth month on the tenth day of the month, saying,] ‘Son of man, write down the name of the day, [this very day;] on this very day [the king of Babylon laid siege to Jerusalem].’” What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He said, “If they go forth now in the cold, they will die.” What did He do for them? He waited for them and sent them into exile during the summer. This is what the prophet says (in Jer. 8:13), “I will utterly gather them, says the Lord.” \"Gather\" ('<i>sp</i>) can only mean \"exile,\" since it is stated (in Micah 2:12), “I will gather Jacob, all of you.” Hence, this too was a great kindness. Now, the second [evil saying associated with the name of the Holy One, blessed be He] is (Ezek. 9:4:) “And the Lord said unto him, ‘Pass through the midst of the city, [through the midst of Jerusalem and mark (the letter) <i>taw<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The last letter of the Hebrew alphabet. For various interpretations of its meaning, see the parallel version in <i>Shab.</i> 55a.</i></i> on the foreheads of those people who moan and groan over all the abominations] ….’” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Gabriel, “Go and write an ink <i>taw</i> upon the foreheads of the righteous, so that the angels of destruction will have no dominion over them. Then upon the foreheads of the wicked write a blood <i>taw</i> so that the angels of destruction will have dominion over them.” [The] prosecution<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>kategoria</i>, i.e., “accusation,” “charge.” Here the concept is hypostatized as a separate being.</i> came in before the Holy One, blessed be He, [and said to him], “Master of the world, how do the former differ from the latter?” He said to it, “The former are completely righteous, and the latter are completely wicked.” It said to Him, “It was in their power to protest, but they did not protest.” He said to it, “It was revealed and known to Me that, if they had protested, [the sinners] would not have accepted their [protest].” It said to Him, “Master of the world, if it was revealed and known in front of You, was if revealed in front of them? Hence they should have protested against them and demeaned themselves for the sanctification of Your name and take beatings from Israel upon themselves, just as the prophets endured [them].” So look at how many woes Jeremiah suffered from Israel; also Isaiah, of whom it is written (in Is. 50:6), “I gave my back to the smiters and my cheeks to the tearers of hair.” And [so with] the rest of the prophets. Immediately (in Ezek. 9:6) He spoke again to the angels of destruction, “[Kill off] old folk, youth ….” This also was a kindness, in that the Holy One, blessed be He, mitigated His wrath [by striking out] against Jerusalem, as stated (in Lam. 4:11), “The Lord has completed (<i>klh</i>) His wrath.” For if He had not done so, all Israel would have received a verdict of destruction (<i>klyh</i>). Ergo (in Ps. 5:5), “and evil may not abide with You,” because the Holy One, blessed be He, does not cause His name to rest upon evil. So also even in the case of the wicked of Israel, He allotted them glory and did not mention them for evil. When He came to the offerings, He said to Moses (in Lev. 1:2), “Speak unto the Children of Israel and say unto them, ‘When one of you presents an offering to the Lord,’” [i.e.] “from Israel” and not from the idolaters. However, when He came to mention leprosy spots, He said (in Lev. 13:2), “When anyone has,” only saying “anyone.” Ergo (in Ps. 5:5), “and evil may not abide with you.”"

What is written there (in Is. 3:16)? “Moreover, the Lord said, ‘Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with extended neck [and roving eyes] ….’” What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do to them? He struck them with leprosy, as stated (in vs. 17), “And the Lord will smite with sores (<i>sph</i>) the scalps of the daughters of Zion.” Smite with sores (<i>sph</i>) must mean \"with leprosy,\" since it is stated (with reference to leprosy in Lev. 13:2), “a swelling or a sore (rt.: <i>sph</i>) […].” Hence it says (Lev. 13: 2), “When anyone has on the skin of his flesh a swelling or a sore (rt.: sph) […. (Lev. 13:2), “When anyone has on the skin of his flesh a swelling or a sore or a bright spot, and it becomes… the plague of leprosy.”] The verse is speaking about [the four] empires.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lev.

The plague of leprosy represents the empire of Edom (i.e., of Rome), because the Holy One, blessed be He, afflicted it and its guarding angel with leprosy, as stated (in Jer. 46:15), “Why has <i>abbireka</i> been washed away?

R. 13:5.</i> Another interpretation (of Is. 47:6, cont.), “upon the aged you made your yoke exceedingly heavy”: Because they made their yoke as heavy on the aged as upon the youth. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Babylon, “By your life, I am sitting over you in judgment to judge you and convict you.” Thus it is stated (in Is. 47:1), “Come down and sit upon the dust, O maiden daughter of Babylon; sit on the earth, not a throne.” Since she formerly sat upon a throne, now [she is told,] “Sit on the earth, not a throne; (Is. 47:1, cont.) for you shall no more be called [tender and delicate].” What shall I do to you? I will exact retribution from your guarding angel first and smite him with leprosy. Then after that, I will exact retribution from you. You should not say, “On this empire [only]”; but even upon Gog, since he vaunts himself upward in the world. I will smite him with leprosy, as stated (in Zech. 14:12) “And this shall be the plague [with which the Lord will smite all the peoples who have warred against Jerusalem]: their flesh shall rot away while they stand on their feet.” For what reason? Because they engaged in battle with Israel. And so is it stated (Zech 14:12), “and this shall be the plague,” because they came against Israel. And do not be surprised, as behold the Lord exacts heavy retribution in leprosy from those who hate them even in this world. And who was [such a one]? This was Naaman, of whom it is stated (in II Kings 5:1), “Now Naaman, the commander of the army of the king of Aram…; but the man, though a valiant warrior, was a leper.” For what reason was he a leper? Because he had taken a little girl captive from the Land of Israel. In this world He struck the idolaters with leprosy. And also in the world to come the Holy One, blessed be He, will afflict them with leprosy, as stated (in Zech. 14:12), “And this shall be the plague with which the Lord will smite ….” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “Because you have called my children unclean, I am making you unclean with a great uncleanness through leprosy.” Where is it shown that they called Israel unclean? Where it is stated (in Lam. 4:15) “Away, unclean, they cried at them….” [So] you will be leprous and impure, but Israel, I will sanctify, purify, and redeem them from among you, as stated (in Is. 62:12), “And they shall call them the holy people, the redeemed of the Lord; and you shall be called, sought out, a city not forsaken.” So also King Solomon has said (in Cant. 4:7), “You are beautiful all over, my beloved, and there is no blemish in you.”"

Fire from the heavens came and destroyed their benches. [The heavenly voice] returned and said (according to Job 34:33), ‘Should He repay as you would, when you have refused?’” All the same, why did they so teach?

And Solomon did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord.” (<i>Sanh.</i> 10:2, at the end:) The four commoners are Balaam, Doeg, Ahithophel and Gehazi. You find that these were condemned to <i>Geihinnom</i> on account of the words of their mouths. In the case of Balaam, he was driven into <i>Geihinnom</i> because of his speech, as stated (in Numb. 23:7), “From Aram has Balak brought me, the king of Moab,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numb.

When? When David fled to Nob, the city of priests where Ahimelech received him, Saul noticed and gathered all his servants. He said to them, “A fine way you are treating me! For David does whatever he wishes, and not one of you has put a word in my ear.” It is so stated (in I Sam. 22:8), “Is that why all of you have conspired against me? For no one is putting a word in my ear when my son is making a deal with the son of Jesse….” Doeg began to utter evil speech, as stated (in vs. 9), “Then Doeg the Edomite, who was standing among the servants of Saul, answered and said, ‘I saw the son of Jesse come to Nob….’” It was also by his hand that eighty-five priests who wear the ephod and Ahimelech the High Priest were slain. “And he smote Nob the city of priests with the edge of the sword” (I Samuel 22:19). R. Eleazar said, “Anyone who becomes merciful upon the cruel one will end by being cruel to the merciful: It is written (I Samuel 15:9), ‘But Saul had pity upon Agag and upon the best of the sheep and the cattle’; and it is [also] written (I Samuel 22:19) about Nob the city of priest, ‘And he smote Nob the city of priests with the edge of the sword.’“ So also was Ahithophel banished because of his speech. Thus it is stated (in II Sam. 17:23), “So when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not heeded… and he set his house in order and hanged himself.” Gehazi also was banished on account of his speech. When Naaman became leprous and was healed at the hands of Elisha, Naaman began to give silver, gold and gifts<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>dora.</i></i> to Elisha, but he did not want to accept them. Now Gehazi was ministering to Elisha. He saw the silver, the gold, and the clothes; so he said (in II Kings 5:20), “My Lord has spared that Aramean Naaman without accepting what he brought; as the Lord lives, I will run after him and get something from him.” Certainly he took [something; he took] his deformity. Thus it is stated (in vs. 27), “And the leprosy of Naaman shall cleave to you and to your seed forever.” Why [did Elisha not want anything]? Because it is stated (in Deut. 13:18), “And let nothing cleave to your hand of that which is devoted.” Now Naaman and the king of Aram served idols; and it is written (in Deut. 7:26), “Do not bring an abomination unto your house.” R. Pedat said, “The Holy One, blessed be He, has made a covenant with the world that anyone who utters evil speech receives leprosy.” Where is it shown? From what is written on the matter (in Lev. 14:2), “This shall be the law of the leper (<i>hametsora</i>'),” [ i.e. ] the one who proclaims evil (<i>hamotsi' ra</i>').<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Below, 5:5; <i>ySot.</i> 2:1 (17d); ‘<i>Arakh.</i> 15b; Cf. Lev. R. 16:1.</i> Our masters have said, “Plagues only affect a person on account of the evil speech which comes out of his mouth.” So the holy spirit cries out (in Eccl. 5:5), “Do not let your mouth cause your flesh to sin,” [ i.e. ] to afflict your body; (ibid., cont.) “and do not say before the angel that it was a mistake,” [ i.e. ] and do not say before the angel who is appointed over you, “By mistake I brought forth the word from my mouth.” For every word which issues from your mouth, whether good, evil, by mistake, or on purpose, is written in a book. Where is it shown that it is so? Where it is stated (in Mal. 3:16), “Then those who feared the Lord spoke with one another; the Lord has hearkened and listened, and a book of remembrance has been written before Him […].” And so with the trait of calamity, David said (in Ps. 139:2), “You know when I sit down and when I stand up, You discern my thoughts from afar.” Job also said (in Job 14:16), “For You count my footsteps,” and (Job 13:27) “You look closely over the treading of my feet.” (Eccl. 5:5, cont.:) “Why should God be angry over your voice and destroy the work of your hands?” These are the hands and the body when they are afflicted by leprosy. Another interpretation (of Eccl. 5:5), “Do not let your mouth cause your flesh to sin”: The Torah has spoken to you euphemistically. If your wife has told you that she is menstruating (<i>niddah</i>), do not cause your body to sin by touching her. Do not say before the angel who is appointed over the formation of the fetus, “’I made a mistake and did not know.” (Ibid., cont.:) “Why should God be angry over your voice and destroy the work of your hands?” This refers to the children who are afflicted with leprosy. R. Aha said, “If a man has intercourse with his wife when she is menstruating, the children will be afflicted with leprosy. How? [If] he has intercourse on the first day of her menstruating, the child which is born shall be afflicted after ten years. [If] he has intercourse with her on the second day, it shall be afflicted after twenty years. On the third day it shall be afflicted after thirty years. On the fourth day it shall be afflicted after forty years. On the fifth day it shall be afflicted after fifty years. On the sixth day it shall be afflicted after sixty years. On the seventh day it shall be afflicted after seventy years, corresponding to the seven days of her menstruation. Moreover, he shall not depart from the world before he has seen his fruit spoiled. Now the days of a person's life are only seventy years, for so David says (in Ps. 90:10), ‘The days of our life comprise seventy years, and’ [only if] one merited, ‘eighty.’ Therefore if a man has intercourse with a menstruating woman on the seventh day, the fetus is afflicted at seventy years of age, so that he does not depart from the world until he has seen his fruit spoiled. This punishment, as it were, does not come from Me. I have already testified to you and told you (in Lev. 14:2,) ‘This shall be the law of the leper.’” Another interpretation (of Eccl. 5:5), “Do not let your mouth [cause your flesh to sin, and do not say before the angel (<i>mal'akh</i>) that it was a mistake]”: If you have acted with malice aforethought and led astray a high priest, who is called an angel (<i>mal'akh</i>), as stated (in Mal. 2:7), “For the lips of a priest preserve knowledge, and they should seek Torah from his mouth; for he is the messenger (<i>mal'akh</i>) of the Lord of hosts”; then do not say, “I sinned by mistake,” [ i.e. ] (in Eccl. 5:5), “ do not say before the angel (i.e., before the high priest) that it was a mistake.” Why? You are leading yourself astray. You are afflicting yourself. The voice which you send forth from your mouth will destroy the work of your hands. (Eccl. 5:5) “Why should God be angry over your voice [and destroy the work of your hands]?” This refers to the children who are afflicted with leprosy."

                "(Lev. 14:2:) “This shall be the law of the leper.” This text is related (to Prov. 18:21), “Death and life are in the power of the tongue.” Everything depends on the tongue. [If] one is acquitted, he is acquitted for life; [if] one is not acquitted, he is condemned to death. [If] one is engaged in Torah with his tongue, he is acquitted for life, inasmuch as the Torah is a tree of life, as stated (in Prov. 3:18), “[Wisdom] is a tree of life to those who take hold of it.” It (i.e., the Torah) is also one's healing for the evil tongue (i.e., slander), as stated (in Prov. 15:4), “A healing tongue is a tree of life.” But if one is occupied with slander, his soul is condemned to death, since slander is more harmful than the shedding of blood. Thus whoever kills takes only one life, but the one who speaks slander kills three people: the one who tells it, the one who accepts it, and the one about whom it is told.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>PRK</i> 4:2; Lev.

Now death throes (<i>shbts</i>) can only denote priesthood, since it is stated (in Exod. 28:13 with reference to high-priestly dress), “And you shall make gold brocade (rt.: <i>shbts</i>).” Doeg also was uprooted (<i>shrsh</i>) from the life of this world and from all life in the world to come. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 52:7), “God will also tear you down for ever; He will seize you, tear you away from your tent, and uproot (<i>shrsh</i>) you from the land of the living. Selah,” [i.e., He will uproot you] from life in the world to come. Who is more severe? One who smites with the sword or [one who] smites with the dart? Say the one who smites with the dart. The one who smites with the sword is only able to kill his companion if he draws near to him and touches him; but in the case of one who smites with the dart, it is not so. Rather one throws the dart wherever he sees him. Therefore, one who speaks slander is comparable to the dart, as stated (in Jer. 9:7), “Their tongue is a sharpened dart; it speaks deceit.” It also says (in Ps. 57:5), “people, whose teeth are spears and darts, and whose tongue a sharp sword.” See how harmful slander is, in that it is more harmful than adultery, shedding blood and idolatry.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">M. Pss. 52:2.</i> Of adultery it is written (in Gen. 39:9, where Joseph is addressing Potiphar's wife), “then how shall I do this great evil and sin against God?” Of shedding blood it is written (in Gen. 4:13), “My sin is greater than I can bear.” Of idolatry it is written (in Exod. 32:31, with reference to the golden calf), “Alas, this people has sinned a great sin.” But when it (i.e., Scripture) mentions slander, it does not say \"great\" (in the masculine singular, as in Gen. 4:13), or \"great\" (in the feminine singular, as in Gen. 39:9 and Exod. 32:31), but \"great\" (in the feminine plural). Thus it is written (in Ps. 12:4), “The Lord shall cut off all flattering lips, [every] tongue speaking great things (in the feminine plural).” It is therefore stated (in Prov. 18:21), “Death and life are in the power of the tongue.” [Another interpretation (of Prov. 18:21), “Death and life are in the power of the tongue”: Do not say, “Since I have license to speak, I am therefore speaking whatever I want.” See, the Torah has already warned you (in Ps. 34:14), “Keep your tongue from evil [and your lips from speaking deceit].” Perhaps you will say that you are suffering a loss. Are you not profiting instead? So the holy spirit proclaims (in Prov. 21:23), “The one who guards his mouth and his tongue guards his soul from trouble (<i>tsarot</i>).” Do not read this as “from trouble.” Instead [read it as], \"from leprosy (<i>tsar'at</i>).” Another interpretation (of Prov. 18:21), “Death and life are in the power of the tongue”: Slander is so harmful that one does not produce it from his mouth without denying the Holy One, blessed be He.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">M. Ps. 52:2.</i> Thus it is stated (in Ps. 12:5), “Those who say, ‘By our tongues we shall prevail; our lips are with us, who is to be our Lord?’” The Holy One, blessed be He, as it were, cried out against those who speak slander (in Ps. 94:16), “Who will stand for Me against evildoers…?” Who can stand against them? And who will stand against them? <i>Geihinnom</i>? But <i>Geihinnom</i> also cries out, “I am unable to stand against them.” [Then] the Holy One, blessed be He, said, “I [will come at them] from above and you (<i>Geihinnom</i>), from below. I will hurl darts from above; and you will turn on them with burning coals from below.” Thus it is stated (in Ps. 120:4), “Sharp darts of the warrior along with burning coals of broom wood.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “Do you want to be delivered from <i>Geihinnom</i>? Keep yourselves far away from the deceitful tongue. Then you will be acquitted in this world and in the world to come.” Thus it is stated (in Ps. 34:13), “Who is the one who desires life….” And it is [then] written (in vs. 14), “Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking deceit […].” Thus it is stated (in Lev. 14:2), “This shall be the law of the leper,” to teach you that one who speaks slander will have blemishes come to him, as it is stated, “This shall be the law of the leper (<i>metsora</i>'),” [i.e.] the one who proclaims evil (<i>motsi' ra'</i>)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 5:1; <i>ySot.</i> 2:1 (17d); ‘<i>Arakh</i>. 15b; Cf.

See what is written about Miriam (in Numb. 12:1), “Then Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses.” Therefore (in vs. 10), “then Aaron turned unto Miriam, and there was [Miriam] with leprosy like the snow.” What is written elsewhere (in Deut. 24:9)? “Remember what the Lord your God did to Miriam […].” And is it not all the more so? For if Miriam had this happen, when she only spoke against her beloved brother when he was absent<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., she spoke privately to Aaron with no desire to be hostile to Moses. Cf. <i>Sifre</i>, Numb. 12:1 (99:2).</i> and was only intending to return him to his wife, how much the more so in the case of one who utters slander against his colleague? What is written above on the matter (in Deut. 24:8)? “Take care with the plague of leprosy [to watch diligently and do according to all that the priests and Levites shall teach…].” So the hand of the Holy One, blessed be He, also afflicted with it Aaron, who was high priest. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 12:9), “And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them, [i.e.] against Aaron and against Miriam.” Aaron, however, was healed immediately; but Miriam, after seven days, as stated (in Numb. 12:15), “So Miriam was shut up [outside of the camp] for seven days.” Ergo (in Lev. 14:2), “This shall be the law of the leper (<i>metsora'</i>).” The one who proclaims evil (<i>motsi' ra</i>') is the one who finds evil (<i>motse' ra</i>').

Therefore the Lord will smite with sores (<i>sph</i>) the scalps [of the daughters of Zion].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Vs. 17 differs here from the Masoretic Text by replacing the divine name with <i>Adonay</i> (LORD).</i> Now sores (<i>sph</i>) can only be leprosy, as stated (in Lev. 14:56), “For a swelling and for a sore (rt.: <i>sph</i>) and for a bright spot.” How is it shown for theft? Where it is stated (in Zech. 5:4), “I have sent it (i.e., the curse of the flying scroll in vs. 1) forth, says the Lord of hosts; and it shall come unto the house of the thief.” Hence, for theft. How is it shown for swearing falsely? Where it is stated (in Zech. 5:4, cont.), “and unto the house of the one who swears falsely in My name; and it shall lodge within his house; and it shall consume it, [even] with its timbers and stones.” What is a thing which consumes timbers and stones? Rabbi says, “This is leprosy, since it is written (concerning a house infested with leprosy (in Lev. 14:45), ‘And he shall break down the house with its timbers and stones.’” And how is it shown for slander? From Miriam [of whom] it is written (in Numb. 12:10), “so when Aaron turned unto Miriam, there she was, stricken with leprosy.” It is written (in Lev. 14:1), “This shall be the law of the leper (<i>hametsora</i>'),” [i.e.] the one who puts forth evil (<i>hamotsi ra</i>'). And how is it shown for those who bear false witness? Where Israel testified falsely and said (in Exod. 32:4), “These are your gods, O Israel,” they were struck with leprosy, as stated, “Instruct the Israelites to remove from the camp….” It also states (Exodus 32:25), “Now Moses saw that the people were riotous (<i>parua</i>').”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. above in this section, where parua‘ in this verse is related to Lev. 13:45, according to which the leper’s HEAD SHALL BE UNKEMPT (<i>parua</i>‘).</i> And [how is it shown] for the judge who perverts justice? Where it is stated (of unjust judges in Is. 5:24), “And it shall be that as a tongue of fire consumes straw, and as chaff sinks down in a flame, their root shall be like the rot, and their blossom shall rise up like the dust; for they have rejected the law of the Lord of hosts.” Their blossom (<i>prh</i>) can only refer to leprosy, since it is stated (in Lev. 13:12), “If the leprosy should blossom out widely (rt.: <i>prh</i>).” And how is it shown for one who enters a domain which is not his? From Uzziah, who entered the domain of the priesthood. It is so stated (of him in II Chron. 26:19), “then leprosy appeared on his forehead.” And how is it shown for one who instigates quarrels among brothers? From Pharaoh, as stated (in Gen. 12:17), “Then the Lord afflicted Pharaoh,” because he had taken Sarah from Abraham. And [how is it shown] for the evil eye (i.e., for being miserly)? R. Isaac said, “When someone's eye is too evil (i.e., when someone is too miserly) to lend out his possessions. When someone comes and says to him, ‘Lend me your scythe, lend me your ax, or any object,’ he says to him, ‘Cursed is the one who has a scythe, cursed is the one has an axe’ (meaning, ‘I do not have one’). What does the Holy One, blessed be He, do?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Yoma</i> 11b.</i> He afflicts [his house] with leprosy. When he comes to the priest and says to him, ‘Something like a plague has appeared in the house belonging to me,’ he commands (according to Lev. 14:45), ‘Let him break down the house with its timbers and stones.’ Then everybody will see his implements, when they lug them and bring them outside. So they publicize<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Mepharsemin</i>, from <i>PRSM</i>, a verb related to the Greek, <i>parresiazesthai</i> (“to speak freely”).</i> his implements, and they all say, ‘Did he not say, “I do not have a scythe; I do not have an ax?” See, he does have such and such an object, but he did not want to lend it.’ So his eye is evil (i.e., he is miserly), to lend.” (Leviticus 14:37:) “And [the priest] says, ‘[The walls are] deeply colored (<i>shkarurot</i>).’” Do not read it [such], but rather read it as he brought down curses (<i>shaka arurot</i>). As he said, “Cursed,” and he brought down his house. And everyone saw his curses, as stated (in Job 20:28), “The produce of his house shall depart, poured out in the day of His wrath.” [Moreover,] there are also some who say, [leprosy] also [comes] for haughtiness. How is it shown? From Naaman, as stated (in II Kings 5:1), “Now Naaman, the commander of the army of the king of Aram […] a valiant warrior, was a leper,” because he was haughty. [Leprosy] also [comes] upon the one who says something against his colleague that is not true about him. Thus you find it so in the case of Moses our master, when he said (in Exod. 4:1), “But [surely] they shall not believe me.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “They are believers [and] children of believers”: [Believers] (in Exod. 4:31), “And the people believed”; the children of believers, as stated (in Gen. 15:6), “And he (Abram) believed in the Lord.” However, it is necessary [for you] to be afflicted, since the one who suspects the innocent is afflicted in his body. It is so stated (in Exod. 4:6), “Then [the Lord…] said, ‘Please put your hand in your bosom’; so he put his hand in his bosom, and when he withdrew it, behold, it was leprous as snow.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “Look at the difference between you and the peoples of the world. When they sin, I afflict them first in their bodies and after that in their houses, as stated (in Gen. 12:17), ‘Then the Lord afflicted Pharaoh with great plagues,’ and afterwards, ‘and his house.’ But if you sin, I afflict your houses first.” Where is it shown? From what they read on the matter (in Lev. 14:34), “and I put a plague of leprosy in a house of the land you possess.” (Lev. 14:34:) “And I put a plague of leprosy in a house of the land you possess.” How has the land sinned, that it should be afflicted? It is simply that the land is afflicted for human sin, as stated (in Ps. 107:[32-]34), “[He turns….] A fruitful land into a salt marsh because of the evil [of those who dwell in it].” Why? Because of the evil [of the people]. And so does it state (Isaiah 26:9), “with Your judgements upon the earth, so will those that dwell in the inhabitation learn justice.” Why do punishments come upon the world? For the creatures, so that they would look, consider, and say, “Whoever sins is afflicted, and whoever does not sin is not afflicted.” So why are the trees, the stones and the walls afflicted? So that their owners will look [at them] and repent. And so you find that when Israel sinned, the Holy One, blessed be He, intended to exile them at once before the [other] nations. But He said, “If I exile them at the start, they will become a shame and a disgrace to all the nations.” What did he do? He brought Sennacherib the wicked upon all the [other] nations and exiled them. Thus it is stated (in Is. 10:14), “My hand (the hand of Sennacherib) has found the wealth of the peoples like a nest.” It is also written (in vs. 13), “and I (Sennacherib) have removed the borders of peoples.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “When Israel sees that I have exiled the nations of the world, they will repent and fear My judgment.” It is so stated (in Zeph. 3:6), “I have rooted out the nations; their corner towers are desolate.” And after it is written (in vs. 7), “I said, ‘Surely you will fear Me, they will learn rebuke!’” When they did not repent, they immediately went into exile. Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, warns them and [first] afflicts their houses, so that they will repent. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 14:34), “and I put a plague of leprosy in a house of the land you possess.” For him to repent is preferable; but if not, he is afflicted in his body, as stated (in Lev. 15:2), “When any man has a discharge issuing from his flesh….” Hence, the stones are struck first. For him to repent is preferable; but if not, his clothes are afflicted, as stated (in Lev. 13:47), “When the plague of leprosy is in a garment.” Then if he does not repent, he is afflicted in his body. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 13:40), “When someone's head becomes hairless [so that he is bald, he is clean]”; but still with a balding of the head there is a substantial doubt whether he is unclean or clean. For him to repent is preferable, but if not, he is afflicted with boils, as stated (in Lev. 13:18), “And when one has boils on the skin of his flesh and is healed.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verses that follow explain that the boils may then become leprous.</i> Boils is [worse] than balding of the head. For him to repent is preferable, but if not, he is afflicted with five scourges: swelling, sore, bright spot, scab, and plague spot. And why all this? Because he did not repent.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numb. R. 14:4.</i> Scripture has said (in Prov. 19:29), “Judgments are ready for scoffers; and stripes for the back of fools.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “Before I created the human, I prepared all these for him.” [The situation] is comparable to an evil slave who was about to be sold. When his master went to buy him, he knew that he was a bad salve. [So] he took along chains and whips so that if he rebelled, he might subdue him with them. When he did rebel, he brought out the chains and chained him. He brought out the whips and beat him. The slave said to him, “Did you not know that I was a bad slave? Why did you buy me?” He said to him, “Because I knew that you are difficult, I prepared chains and whips for you, so that if you rebelled, I might subdue you with them.” So too the Holy One, blessed be He [and] blessed be His name forever, before He created the human one, He prepared afflictions for him, because (according to Gen. 8:21) He knows that<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb.: <i>Ki.</i> Although in the biblical context the word must mean “for,” or its equivalent, the midrash understands the word with the alternate meaning of “that.”</i> “the instinct of one's heart is evil from his youth.” He therefore prepared all these for him, so that if he rebelled, He would subdue him, as stated (in Prov. 19:29), “Judgments are ready for scoffers; and stripes (<i>mahalumot)</i> for the back of fools.” What are <i>mahalumot</i>? <i>Mahah lamoot</i> (strike to death). Warn him first; it is preferable if he repents. But if not, strike his body. How is it shown? From that which we read about the matter (in Lev. 14:34), “and I put a plague of leprosy in a house of the land you possess.”"

                "(Lev. 15:25:) “And when a woman has had a discharge of blood [for many days].” Thus did R. Hiya teach: Any place where [Scripture] says, “days,” it is two days; and any place where it says, “many days,” it is three days. How so? The woman is unclean from menstruation for seven days and becomes clean on the eighth day. [If] she sees blood on that day, she observes a day [like the rest] and becomes clean. [If] she sees it again on the ninth day, she observes that day and becomes clean. [If] she sees it again on the tenth day, she observes that one and is clean. Ergo, three days which are “many days.” However, if she sees blood on day eleven, which is the fourth day of her cleansing, she returns to her uncleanness, and observes her seven days of menstruation from the beginning. For so have the sages taught: There are eleven days between one menstrual period and another; therefore, the woman has to keep fifteen days. How does she do so? She keeps seven days of her menstrual period. Then after that she counts seven clean days and becomes clean on the eighth day. Then she performs a strict immersion after sunset, and she is lawful for her husband. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 15:28), “And when she is clean from her discharge, she shall count off seven days, and after that she shall be clean.”"
            ],
            [
                "That there are eleven days between one menstrual period and another is a law from Moshe at Sinai. Its explanation is that the law transmitted to Moshe at Sinai is like this: From the beginning of any woman's seeing menstrual blood, her law is to count for all of her days, seven days of menstruation (<i>niddah</i>) from the beginning of her seeing. And after these seven days of menstruation, [she counts] eleven days, and they are called the days of flow (<i>zivah</i>). And after these eleven days that are days of flow, she goes back to the seven days of menstruation. And after them eleven days of flow, and continuing like this. And so is it fitting to count in this way all of her days. And these seven days of menstruation are whether she saw one day or even one hour, or even if she saw all of the entire seven days of menstruation. In the evening, she immerses [in the <i>mikveh</i> and is permitted to her husband, and does not require clean [days]. As it is stated (Leviticus 15:19), \"seven days shall she be in her menstruation\" - she shall be in her menstruation all seven. But on these eleven days between [one] menstruation and [another] menstruation, any day that she sees blood, she observes one day corresponding to that day, and that is [the law of] a small flow. And if she did not see on the second day, she immerses and becomes pure. But if she saw also on the second day, she observes a day corresponding to the two days that she saw. And if she did not see on the third day, she immerses and becomes pure. But if she saw also on the third day that she is observing, she saw three consecutive days. [Hence] she is [in the category of] a large flow. And [so] she needs to sit seven complete (twenty-four hour) days after the blood has ceased from her. And she does not count the day that the blood ceases for the count of clean days. And this is the law in the days of flow: Any time she saw one day, she counts [another] day corresponding to it; and so [too,] two days, she counts one day for them. [But if] she saw three consecutive days, she observes seven days."

                "(Lev. 15:25:) “And when a woman has had a discharge of blood for many days.” Why a woman and not a man? Previously it applied to men and women. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 15:2), “When any man has a discharge issuing from his flesh.” R. Meir says, “The man's uncleanness was more serious than the woman's uncleanness. Why? Because the uncleanness of women is a sign of children; however, that of a man is [a sign] of suffering.

Therefore (in Exod. 15:25), “And when a woman has had a discharge of blood.” (Lev. 15:25:) “And when a woman has had a discharge of blood for many days.” Thus have our masters taught (in <i>Shab.</i> 2:6): Women die at the time of their childbirth for three transgressions:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tanh</i>.

Now the three of them are from the Torah. [Where is it shown about] menstruation? (Lev. 15:25:) “And when a woman has had a discharge of her blood.” [Where is it shown about] the <i>hallah</i>? (Numb. 15:20:) “[You shall set aside] the first of your dough as a <i>hallah</i> offering.” [Where is it shown] in regard to the lighting of the [Sabbath] lamp? As our masters taught, “Where is it shown that a person is to be zealous and diligent in the lighting of the [Sabbath] lamp? Where it is stated (in Is. 58:13), ‘and you call the Sabbath a delight.’ This refers to the lighting of the lamp.” And why were [these commandments] transmitted to the woman?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. R. 17:8; <i>yShab</i>. 2:4 (5b).</i> The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “She extinguished the lamp of the world….” In regard to menstruation, the Holy One, blessed be He, said, “She shed the blood of Adam, and she was sentenced to have her own blood shed, since it is stated (in Gen. 9:6), ‘Whoever sheds human blood [by a human will his blood be shed].’ She shall observe her menstrual period to atone for the blood that she shed.” Ergo (in Lev. 15:25), “And when a woman has had a discharge of blood.” Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, compares the uncleanness of Israel to the uncleanness of the menstrual period, when [a woman] is unclean and [then] purified. So the Holy One, blessed be He, is going to purify Israel, as stated (in Ezek. 36:25), “I will sprinkle pure water upon you, and you shall be pure.” Another interpretation: (Ezek. 36:17:) “Their way before Me was like the uncleanness of a menstruant woman”; like the uncleanness of a menstruant woman, and not like the uncleanness of a corpse. With a corpse in the house, a high priest does not enter there; but in the case of a menstruant woman, a high priest enters into the house with her and sits [with her] on the couch,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">‘<i>YSTWW</i>’, probably from the Gk.: <i>histion</i>, which means “something woven.”</i> but on condition that it not shake (when they sit on it). So if Israel were compared to the impurity of death, the Divine Presence would never return upon them; however, they are compared to the menstruant because there is cleansing for her in a <i>mikveh</i>, so that the priest may be with her in the house and not be afraid. Thus the Divine Presence dwells with Israel, even though they are unclean, as stated (in Lev. 16:16), “which dwells with them in the midst of their uncleannesses.” R. Levy said, “When Israel was in Egypt, the women did not see menstrual blood, because the fear of Egypt was upon them. And also after Israel left Egypt, they did not see menstruation in the desert, because the Divine Presence was among them.” [Moreover,] the women accepted the Torah first.

It is so stated (in Is. 3:13), “The Lord stands up to plead a cause, and rises to judge peoples.” It also says (in Dan. 7:9), “I looked until thrones were set in place [or thrown down] (<i>remiw</i>).”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Aramaic word can mean both WERE SET IN PLACE and WERE THROWN DOWN.

In the age to come the Holy One, blessed be He, will sit down, and the angels will place thrones for the great ones of Israel for them to sit down, so that the Holy One, blessed be He, will be sitting with them like the president of the court (<i>av bet din</i>).

These are the thrones of the house of David and the elders of Israel, as stated (in Ps. 122:5), “There stood the thrones of judgment, thrones of the House of David.” R. Pinhas said in the name of R. Hilqiyah the Southerner (i.e., from Judah), [who said] in the name of R. Reuben, “If you say, ‘When thrones stand there for judgment,’ [that] they are thrones of the House of David; then what is [the meaning of (Dan. 7:9), ‘and the Ancient of days (God) took His seat?’ That He sits among them like the president of the court, and with them He judges the nations. It is therefore written (ibid.), ‘until thrones were set in place.’” What is the meaning of (ibid., cont.), “and the hair of his head was like clean wool?” When the Holy One, blessed be He, cleanses Himself from the worshippers of idolatry; He gives them compensation for the easy commandments which they have observed in this world. [He does so] in order to judge them and convict them in the world to come, so that they will have no excuse and have no merit found for them.

At that time the Holy One, blessed be He, becomes exalted in his world, as stated (in Is. 5:16), “The Lord of hosts is exalted in judgment.” What is the meaning of (ibid.), “and the holy God is sanctified in justice (<i>tsedekah</i>, which also means charity)?” That He is sanctified in His world in justice, because He advocates for the defense concerning Israel, as stated (in Is. 63:1), “it is I who speaks in justice (<i>tsedekah</i>), mighty to save.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “In the future, I will be sanctified in you, as stated (in Is. 29:23), ‘For when [Jacob] sees his children in his midst, the work of My hands, they shall sanctify My name.’” And so it says (in Is. 49:3), “Israel in whom I will be glorified.” So you are sanctified in Me, and I am sanctified in you, as stated (in Lev. 11:44; cf. 19:2), “so you shall sanctify yourselves and be holy.”"

Because you are my wife.” Thus the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “Go and sanctify (i.e., go and betroth) Israel,” as stated (in Exod. 19:10), “and sanctify (rt.: <i>qdsh</i>) them today and tomorrow.” The Holy One, blessed be He, sanctified them and said to them (in Exod. 19:6), “But you shall be for Me a kingdom of priests, a holy (rt.: <i>qdsh</i>) nation.” Why?

Rather, just as he found, one should still continue to plant even though he is old. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “Learn from Me. Do I need [fruits], as it were?” [And yet] it states (Gen. 2:8), “And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden, in the east.”"

He thought [about] the land of [Israel], and He gave it to him, as stated (in Gen. 15:7), “I am the Lord who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldees [to give you this land as a possession].” Abraham said to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the world, You have given me permission to speak in front of You, as stated (in vs. 8), “And he said, ‘Lord God, how shall I know that I shall possess it?” He replied and said to him (in vs. 13), “Know full well [that your seed shall be aliens in a land not theirs where they shall serve them and be oppressed by them].” Woe to that person who brings something out of his mouth without knowing how he brought it out.

When Rabbi would reach this verse (Amos 4:13), he would cry: “Hate evil and love good, and establish justice in the gate; perhaps the Lord, the God of hosts, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.” He said, “So much, and [only] ‘perhaps?’” [Similar is (Zeph. 2:3),] “Seek the Lord, all you humble of the land who have fulfilled His law, seek righteousness, seek humility; perhaps you will find shelter on the day of the Lord’s anger.” R. Haggai said, “[Similarly (in Lamentations 3:29),] ‘Let him put his mouth to the dirt, perhaps there is hope.’” [Similar is the verse (in Lamentations 12:14),] “For God will call every creature to account for everything unknown.” (I Sam. 28:15, cont.:) “And Saul said, ‘I am very distressed […], He (i.e., the Holy One, blessed be He) no longer answers me either through prophets or in dreams….” Why did he not [also] say to him, \"[Or] by <i>Urim</i> and <i>Thummim</i>\"?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to vs. 6, the Holy One had also failed to answer Saul through this medium.</i> R.

Now, however, I am in the world of truth, you will only hear words of truth from me. He did not do this thing to you for no reason. Rather (according to I Sam. 28:18-19), ‘Because you did not hearken to the voice of the Lord and did not carry out his wrath against Amalek…. Moreover, the Lord will deliver Israel along with you into the hand of the Philistines; and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me.’”” With me,” [means] in my section [of heaven]. When he heard this, (according to vs. 20), “Immediately Saul fell full length to the ground, for he was terrified because of Samuel's words.” Abner and Amasa said to him, “What did [Samuel] say to you?” He said to them, “He said to me, ‘Tomorrow you will go down to battle and be victorious. In addition, your sons will be appointed to be great leaders’”. Resh Laqish said, “At that time the Holy One, blessed be He, called the ministering angels. He said to them, ‘Come and see the creature that I have created in My world. By universal custom when one goes to a banquet house, he does not take his children with him for fear of the evil eye; but this one, when he is going down to battle and knows that he will be killed, takes his sons with him and is happy over the divine justice that is striking him.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">M.

So now, if he is missing (according to vs. 42), it will be your life for his life and your people for his people.” [Similarly (in Ezek. 10:2),] “Then he said unto the person clothed in linen, and said, ‘Go in among the wheel work, [under the cherub].’” The Holy One, blessed be He, said unto the angel, and the angel said to the cherub. He said to him, “The Holy One, blessed be He, has commanded me, but I do not have the authority to enter your section [of heaven]; so do me a favor and give me two burning coals.” Immediately (in vs. 7), “he took some and put them into the hands of the one who was clothed in linen.” R.

Ergo, “say […,]” and “say.” Since in this world, a priest becomes unclean for an unclaimed corpse, but in the future you will not become unclean at all. Why? As there will be no death in the future.

In regard to strength, because he was powerful in strength. Come and consider Aaron. When he waved the Levites (as in a wave offering), he waved twenty-two thousand in one day. How did he wave them? Back and forth, up and down. Ergo, he was highest in strength. With regard to wealth, where would it come from? If he was not wealthy, his brother high priests would magnify (rt.: <i>gdl</i>) him. There is a story about Phineas the Stonecutter. When they appointed him high priest, his brother priests went out and saw him cutting stone. So they filled the quarry before him with gold dinars.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lat.: <i>denarii.</i></i> And where is it shown that if he had nothing, his brother high priests would magnify (rt.: <i>gdl</i>) him? Where it is stated (in an alternate translation of Lev. 21:10), “And the priest that is highest (rt.: <i>gdl</i>) because of his brothers.” And [this rule applies] not to the high priest alone, but to the king as well. And so you find in the case of David, when he went to fight with Goliath the Philistine, Saul said to him (in I Sam. 17:33), “You cannot go unto this Philistine […].” David said to him (in vs. 34-36), “Your servant tended his father's sheep; and when a lion or a bear came and carried off a lamb from the flock, I would go out after it, smite it, and deliver it out of its mouth…. Your servant smote both the lion and the bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them.” Saul said to him, “And who told you that you could slay him?” Immediately David replied, (vs. 37), “The Lord who delivered me from the paw of the lion will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.” Immediately (we read in vs. 38), “Saul clothed David with his military garments.” Now it is written (in I Sam. 9:2), “he was a head taller<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">More literally: TALLER FROM HIS SHOULDERS ON UP.</i> than any of the people.” When he had clothed him in his garments and seen that they were fit for him, he immediately cast a jaundiced eye at him. When David saw that he had offended Saul, he said to him (in I Sam. 17:39), “I cannot go in these, for I am not used to them.” Here you learn that even though a person may be short, when he is appointed king, he becomes tall. Why? Because as soon as he is anointed with the anointing oil, he becomes superior to his brothers. David said, “I rejoiced over the anointing oil with which I was anointed.” It is so stated (in Ps. 16:9), “So my heart rejoices, and my glory exalts; my flesh also dwells in safety.”"

And do not testify (against your neighbor falsely), and receive a settlement of accounts.” R. Samuel bar Nahman said, “On three occasions the Holy One, blessed be He, came to dispute with Israel, when the nations of the world rejoiced: At that time, when He said to them (in Is. 1:18), ‘Please come and let us dispute together,’ they rejoiced and said, ‘Now He will finish them off.’ When the Holy One, blessed be He, saw that they were rejoicing, He reversed [the punishment] for the better. He said (ibid.), ‘though your sins be as scarlet, they shall become as white as snow […].’ When the nations of the world heard this, they were astonished and said, ‘Is this an answer; is this a rebuke?

Everyone came to see. They said, one to another, “See that this woman has brought her son to be killed in the case.” When the woman saw this and heard what they said, she reversed [her mind] to speak with different words. When she came before the judge, he said to her, “What has your son done to you?” She said to him, “When he was in my womb, he kicked me.” He said to her, “Has he done anything else to you?” She said, “No.” He said to her, “There is no legal offense at all.” Everyone was astonished and said, “Is this an answer; is this a rebuke? She only came to amuse herself with her son.” So they left with embarrassment on their faces. So too did the Holy One, blessed be He, go back and reverse His rebuke to love, and the nations of the world left confounded. (Micah 6:3:) “And how have I wearied you?” R.

                "(Lev. 22:27:) “When a bull or a sheep or a goat.” This text is related (to Ps. 27:6), “And now shall my head be lifted up over my enemies round about me and I will offer sacrifice in His tent with a loud cry.” When Israel carried out that deed (of the golden calf), the nations of the world said, “There will be no recovery for them, and He will never return to them.” When Israel heard that they would sacrifice a bull, their head was lifted up, as stated (ibid.), “And now shall my head be lifted up […].” Then they said, “Now we know that the Holy One, blessed be He, has been reconciled to us, as stated (ibid., cont.), “and I will offer sacrifice in his tent with a loud cry; I will sing and chant praise to the Lord.” (Lev. 22:27:) “When a bull or a sheep or a goat [is born].” Is there a bull that is born? Or a calf born to become a bull, that it should be stated, “to sacrifice a bull.” [So] why did [the Holy One, blessed be He], say to sacrifice a bull? To atone for the image of the bull, as stated (in Ps. 103:3), “Who forgives all your sins [...].” You should know this on your own. See what is written (in Ezek. 1:6), “Each had four faces, and each of them had four wings.” What is written there (in vs. 7), “And their legs became a straight leg, and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot.” Now it was for the atonement of Israel that He added two [more] wings to them. Thus it is stated (in Is. 6:2), “[each] of them had six wings.” Why? So that their feet would be covered, because they resembled the calf. [It was] so that, as it were, He would not see them and recall the incident of the calf. [Hence (in Is. 6:2, cont.),] “with two he covered his feet.” And why all this? Simply to atone for Israel. This is the meaning of (Ps. 103:3), “Who forgives all your sins.” You have no larger fowl than the eagle, so it became a face for the living angel, as stated (in Ezek. 1:10), “and the face of an eagle.” The largest among the animals is the lion, so it [also] became a face for the living angel, as stated (in Ezek. 10:14), “and the face of a lion.” And the bull is the largest among the beasts, so that He made it a face for the living angel, as stated (in Ezek. 1:10), “and the face of a bull on the left.” (Ibid.:) “And the face of a human.” But for the sake of Israel, the Holy One, blessed be He, blotted out the bull and put a cherub in its place. As you find that it only mentions a cherub there, as stated (in Ezek. 10:14), “the face of the one was the face of a cherub.” And why all this? To atone for Israel. Ergo (in Ps. 103:3), “Who forgives all your sins.” Why did the Holy One, blessed be He, remove the calf? So that Israel would be innocent before Him. And not only that, but when someone from Israel thinks about a transgression or something evil in his heart, the Holy One, blessed be He, does not connect it to a deed (to punish him for it). As therefore David says (in Ps. 66:18), “If I had perceived iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.” Now what does the Holy One, blessed be He, hear? [What is thought] when a person stands up to meditate in prayer. It is so stated (in Ps. 31:223) “truly God has listened; He has hearkened to the sound of my prayer.” And not only that, but when two people sit and occupy themselves with the Torah, the Holy One, blessed be He, hearkens and listens, as stated (in mal. 3:16), “Then those who feared the Lord spoke with one another; the Lord has hearkened and listened.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Avot</i> 3:2, 6; <i>Mekhilta deRabbi Ishmael, Bahodesh</i> 1; <i>Ber.</i> 62; <i>ARN</i>, A, 8.</i> The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “Through the merit of the Torah, when you occupy yourselves with it, I am hearkening and listening to your prayers; but in the future, before you [even] call to Me, I will answer you.” It is so stated (in Is. 65:24), “And it shall come to pass that before they cry out, I will answer.”"

Souter, A <i>Glossary of Later Latin to 600 A.D.</i> (Oxford: Clarendon, 1957).</i></i> [So it was] four hundred <i>centenaria</i> [that] Abraham piled up before Ephron.” When Ephron saw the silver, he moved quickly and hastily, as stated (in Gen. 23:6), “bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “You have moved quickly after money. By your life, you shall have a loss in the matter.” And what was his loss? R. Judah bar Shallum the Levite said, “Every [mention of] Ephron which is written here [in Scripture], before he took the silver from Abraham, is written plene as '<i>prwn</i> (i.e., with the vowel <i>o</i> represented by the Hebrew consonant <i>w</i>); but this [usage] (in Gen. 23:16) is deficient (<i>hsr</i>), ‘and Abraham weighed out the silver for Ephron ('<i>prn</i>). It is written with the <i>w</i> missing (<i>hsr</i>).” Another interpretation (of Prov. 28:22), “An evil-eyed person moves quickly after wealth”: This is the one who lends at interest, because he is anxious to become wealthy. He lends in order to receive interest from the borrower and becomes wealthy from the interest. But a curse is given through his riches, as stated (ibid., cont.), “and he does not know that loss will come to him.” Another interpretation (of Prov. 28:22), “An evil-eyed person moves quickly after wealth”: This represents those who engage in business in the sabbatical year, in that they move quickly to become rich. They do not observe the sabbatical year, and think they will become rich. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, “By your life, you shall have a loss in the matter.” Since he did not observe the sabbatical year, the curse began entering into his money, and he sells [all that he had]. What is written above the matter (in Lev. 25:2), “the land shall observe a Sabbath for the Lord.” And after that it is written (in vs. 14), “When you sell property.” R. Eleazar Haqappar said, “It is written (in Cant. 5:15), ‘His legs are pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold.’ This column has a capital above and a pedestal<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>basis</i>.</i> below.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Lev. R. 25:8.</i> R. Samuel ben Guriah said, “You have no section in the Torah which does not have a capital above and a pedestal below.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The parallel in Lev. R. 25:8 explains that each section can be expounded with reference to what precedes and follows it.</i> What is written above of the matter (in Lev. 25:1-2)? ‘Then the Lord spoke unto Moses on Mount Sinai, saying, “Speak unto the Children of Israel [….] ‘the land shall observe [a Sabbath for the Lord].’”’ Then after that [comes] the section on the jubilee (in vs. 8), ‘And you shall count seven [Sabbaths of years].’ If one has not observed the sabbatical year and the jubilee, or [even] one of them, in the end, I will make it that he will sell his land, [as stated] (in vs. 14), ‘When you sell property to your kinsman.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>T’Arakh</i>. 5:9; below, 9:8.</i> [If] he repents, [all] is well; but if not, he will end up selling his field, as stated (in vs. 25), ‘When your relative becomes poor and sells some of his property.’ [If] he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up selling his house, as stated (in vs. 29), ‘And when someone sells a dwelling house.’ [If] he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up going around [begging] at doorways, as stated (in vs. 35), ‘And when your relative becomes poor [… you shall maintain him as a foreigner and sojourner and let him live near you].’ [If] he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up being sold to you, as stated (in vs. 39), ‘And when your relative becomes poor] near you and is sold to you.’ [If] he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up being sold to the gentiles, as stated (in vs. 47), ‘And when a foreigner and a sojourner near you becomes wealthy, [while your relative near him becomes poor and is sold to a sojourning foreigner near you….].’ Now it is not merely the individual himself [at issue here], but that person and all Israel; for so you find in the days of Jeremiah, because they profaned the sabbatical year, they were sold to the gentiles, as stated (in II Chron. 36:17-18), ‘So He brought up the king of the Chaldeans upon them [….] And all the vessels of the house of God […] and the treasures of the house of the Lord […].’ Behold the case of [all] Israel.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “See how they will be sold to the gentiles because they profaned the sabbatical year.” He said to him, “Master of the world, did You not say this (in Lev. 25:35), ‘And when your relative becomes poor, and his strength fails near you, [you shall maintain him as a foreigner and sojourner and let him live near you]?’ Fulfill what You said to them and called them, ‘My relatives (<i>ah</i>) and friends,’ as stated (in Ps. 122:8), ‘For the sake of My relatives (<i>ah</i>) and friends’: (Lev. 25:35:) ‘And when your relative becomes poor, and his strength fails near you,’ [i.e.,] when their strength fails before Nebuchadnezzar, the Divine Presence, as it were, will be with them. It is so stated (in Is. 43:14), ‘for your sake I have sent to Babylon.’ (Lev. 25:35, cont.:) ‘You shall maintain (literally, hold on to) him.’ Hold them (i.e., Israel), lest they perish. But how? (Lev. 25:35, cont.:) ‘As a foreigner and sojourner and let him live near you.’ Although they became foreigners and sojourners in Babylon, if You do not give them grace, they will perish, [so just] ‘let him live near You.’” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “Because of their sins I have sold My house to the Chaldeans.” It is so stated (in Lev. 25:29), “And when someone sells a dwelling house.” This is the house of the Holy One, blessed be He, as stated (in Ps. 132:13), “For the Lord has chosen Zion; he has desired it for His dwelling.” And what happened [to it]? (II Kings 25:9 = Jer. 52:13:) And he burned the house of the Lord [...].” (Lev. 25:29, cont.:) “A walled city.” This is the city of the Holy One, blessed be He, as stated] (in II Chron. 36:19), “and they broke down the wall of Jerusalem […].” That is what the Holy One, blessed be He, says (in Lev. 25:47), “And when a foreigner and a sojourner [near you] becomes wealthy.” This wealthy foreigner is Nebuchadnezzar, and this sojourner is the Median Empire. (Ibid., cont.:) “And is sold to a sojourning foreigner.” This [sojourning foreigner] is the Greek Empire. (Ibid., cont.:) “Or to a foreigner's family.” This is the Edomite Empire (i.e., Rome). Moses said to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the world, why were they sold to these empires?” He said to him, “Because they profaned the sabbatical year.” It is so stated (in II Chron. 36:20–21), “Then he carried off unto Babylon those left from the sword,” and the end of the Scripture is “[until the land made up] its Sabbaths; as long as it lay desolate, it observed Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.” Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses at the end of all of these sections, “Is it your wish that they do not go into exile? [Then] warn them concerning the sabbatical years and the jubilees.” That is what He has said at the end of all the sections (in Lev. 26:2), “You shall observe My Sabbaths and reverence My sanctuary. I am the Lord.” What is the meaning of “I am the Lord?” I am the one who is going to give you a good reward, if you observe them; but if not, I am going to exact retribution from them through the Empires. Therefore, say to them to be careful about the sabbatical year. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 25:2), “the land shall observe a Sabbath for the Lord,” so that they do not attain [the punishments in] those sections written below (in Lev. 26:14-45). (Lev. 25:14:) “When you sell property to your kinsman or buy from your neighbor's hand, do not deceive.” [Thus] you shall not deceive one another. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “For I also sold the whole world to Abraham and did not deceive him. He [then went back and sold it to Me,” as stated (Genesis 14:19), “the Buyer<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Qoneh.</i> A more traditional rendering of this word here would be MAKER.</i> of heaven and earth.” When? When Abraham observed the commandments of the Holy One, blessed be He. Before the Torah was given to Israel, our father Abraham kept it [and observed all the commandments that are in the Torah]. R. Samuel bar Nahman said in the name of R. Alexandra, “Abraham even observed the [rabbinic precept of] <i>eruvim</i> of cooked foods.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Tanh</i>. (Buber), Gen. 3:1, and the notes there.</i> Thus it is stated (in Gen. 26:5), “Because ('<i>qb</i> '<i>shr</i>) Abraham heeded [My voice and kept My charge: My commandments, My statutes, and My Torahs].” What is the meaning of '<i>qb</i>?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. R. 95:3; Cant. R. 5:16:1; <i>PR</i> 21:12; cf. <i>Ned.</i> 32a.</i> R. Simeon ben Laqish said, “At the age of three years Abraham recognized the Holy One, blessed be He.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So also Numb. R. 18:21. According to other traditions Abraham recognized his creator at the age of forty-eight (Gen. R. 30:8; 46:2; Cant. R. 5:16:1), at the age of fifty (<i>PR</i> 21:12), or at the age of one (Gen. R. 95:3).</i> How is this shown? '<i>Qb</i> is a number. (I.e., '<i>ayin</i>) is seventy, <i>q</i> (i.e., <i>qof</i>) is one hundred, [and] <i>b</i> (i.e., <i>bet</i>) is two, for a total of one hundred seventy-two. Now (according to Gen. 25:7) Abraham lived one hundred seventy-five [years]. Deduct from them. [The result is] three, when he was little. Ergo, at the age of three years Abraham recognized the Holy One, blessed be He. When the Holy One, blessed be He, saw how Abraham loved the commandments, He began buying heavenly and earthly [places] for him, as stated (in Gen. 14:19), “Blessed be Abram of God most high, Buyer of heaven and earth.” So also it says (Gen. 13:15), “For all the land (or earth) which you see, to you I will give it.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “All the world is wholly Mine; and I bought it for Abraham, because he has observed My commandments. But you, through your sins, have caused him to be [like] an alien who rents a house from its owners, for so Jeremiah has said (in Jer. 14:8), ‘why are you like a foreigner in the land […]?’ When you sinned before Me, I sold you, as stated (in Ps. 44:13), ‘You shall sell Your people for no money […].’ For that reason, if someone has to sell a house, a field, or [some] article, you shall not deceive one another.” It is therefore written (in Lev. 25:14), “shall not deceive his brother.” (Lev. 25:15-18:) “According to the years after the jubilee […]. According to the multitude of years, you shall increase […]. A man shall not deceive his brother […]. So you shall carry out my statutes and judgements.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “Just as I sold my people and returned again to reinstate them, as stated (Jer. 3:14), ‘”Turn back, faithless children,” says the Lord; “for I am a master to you.”’ It is also written (in Is. 52:3), ‘For thus says the Lord, “You were sold for free, and you shall be redeemed for no money.”’ So too you should not sell the land absolutely, as stated (in Lev. 25:23), ‘[it] shall not be sold permanently.’ The Land [of Israel] is dear to me because I have made it holier than all the [other] lands in the world.” You yourself know, when the Land of Israel was distributed to the tribes, it did not pass from tribe to tribe. Rather [it was distributed] to each tribe separately. You yourself know. Look at how many lawsuits the daughters of Zelophehad brought, so that their inheritance would not pass from one tribe to another. Moreover the Holy One, blessed be He, conceded to their words, as stated (in Numb. 27:7), “The daughters of Zelophehad speak what is right.” (Numb. 36:9:) “Thus no inheritance shall be transferred from one tribe to another.” Therefore, if a redeemer is found for it, fine; but if not, whoever buys it acquires it until the jubilee. Then on the jubilee he releases it. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 25:41), “Then he shall depart from you, he and his children with him and he shall return to his family.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “When the year of the redemption draws near, I will redeem you, as stated (in Is. 63:4), ‘For a day of vengeance was in My heart, but there came My year of redemption.’”"

                "(Lev. 25:25,35:) “And when your relative becomes poor and sells some of his property […]. And when your relative becomes poor, and his strength fails.” This text is related (to Prov. 22:22-23), “Do not rob the impoverished because he is impoverished […]. For the Lord shall plead their cause.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “’Do not rob the impoverished because he is impoverished,’ for I have made him impoverished. [Hence] whoever robs him or mocks at him reproaches his Maker. [It is] as if he is mocking at Me, as stated (in Prov. 17:5), ‘One who mocks a poor person reproaches his Maker […].’” What is the meaning of (Prov. 22:22), “Do not rob the impoverished?” Is there someone robbing the impoverished? Of what does he rob him, when he does not have anything?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. Numb.

Ergo (in Prov. 22:22), “Do not rob the impoverished because he is impoverished”; but rather maintain him, because he has no other place [to turn]. (Ibid., cont.:) “And do not oppress the poor in the gate,” lest I stop up the heavens because of you; for the heavens also have a gate, as stated (in Gen. 28:17), “and this is the gate of the heavens.” (Prov. 22:23:) “For the Lord shall plead their cause.” I am pleading [their cause] with you, because I made him poor and you rich. I am inverting his charm<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>magganon.</i></i> and will make him rich and you poor. Thus it is stated (in Prov. 22:2), “Rich and poor meet; the Lord made them all.” Why? (Prov. 22:23:) “For the Lord shall plead their cause.” Why so much? Because you are reducing his spirit (<i>nefesh</i>), if you do not maintain him. Therefore (ibid., cont.), “and he will despoil the ones who despoil them of life (<i>nefesh</i>).”"

                "(Lev. 25:25:) ”When your relative becomes poor and sells some of his property, then his redeemer shall come.” Who is his redeemer? I am He, as stated (in Jer. 50:33-34), “The Children of Israel […] are oppressed […].

Lev. R. 34:6, followed by <i>Yalqut Shim‘oni</i>, Lev. 665, which reads <i>dal</i> (“impoverished”) here.</i> wretched (<i>misken</i>), and pauper (<i>evyon</i>). [(Lev. 25:25:) “When your relative becomes poor.”] This text is related (to Ps. 106:43), “Many times He delivered them, but they rebelled; so they became poor through their iniquity.” You find that in the days that the Judges judged, Israel served idols; so they were enslaved in the hands of the peoples of the world, as stated (in Jud. 3:7-8), “Then the Children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord…. So the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of Cushan.” What did they do (according to vs. 9)? “The Children of Israel cried unto the Lord, and the Lord raised up a savior for the Children of Israel [to save them, i.e.,] Othniel ben Kenaz.” They immediately repented and were redeemed. So [it happened] another time, as stated (in Jud. 3:12), “Then the Children of Israel again did evil….” They immediately repented; so the Lord raised up a redeemer for them, Ehud ben Gera the Binyaminite; and they were redeemed at his hands. Then they served idols again and were sold into the hands of Sisera, as stated (in Jud. 4:3), “and he oppressed the Children of Israel with might twenty years.” What is the meaning of “with might?” With blasphemies and with curses, just as you say (in Mal. 3:13), “Your words have been mighty against me.” When they repented, He raised up Barak and Deborah as redeemers for them; and they were redeemed at their hands. Ergo (in Ps. 106:43), “Many times He delivered them…; so they became poor through their iniquity.” What is the meaning of “so they became poor through their iniquity?” That they became impoverished in the midst of the nations, as stated (in Jud. 6:6), “And Israel became very impoverished….” What is the meaning of “and Israel became impoverished?” R. Isaac and R. Levi differed. One said, “They were impoverished (rt.: <i>dll</i>) from good works”; and the other said, “They did not have [enough] to bring even a poor person's (rt.: <i>dll</i>) offering, as stated (in Lev. 14:21), ‘If, however, he is poor (rt.: <i>dll</i>) and does not have the means.’” Ergo (in Ps. 106:43), “so they became poor through their iniquity,” as they had become impoverished (rt.: <i>dll</i>). Another interpretation (of Ps. 106:43), “Many times He delivered them”: [These words] speak about people. When trouble comes to one [of them] and he repents, the Holy One, blessed be He, delivers him. So it is the first time and the second. [If he repents, that is preferable; but if not, the Holy One, blessed be He, brings trouble upon him. And you yourself know that the Holy One, blessed be He, tests Israel to know if they will repent. First, He brings punishments against the [other] nations, as stated (Zeph. 3:6-7) “I wiped out nations: Their corner towers are desolate… I thought that she would fear Me, would learn a lesson.” [If] they repented, that is preferable; but if not, He destroys their money, as stated (Hos 7:9), “Strangers have consumed his strength….” [If they] repented, that is preferable; but if not, the Holy One blessed be He, brings evil upon one of the cities of Israel, as stated (Is. 42:25), “it blazed upon them all about… it burned among them.” [If] they repented, that is preferable; but if not, what is written (in Numbers 14:35)? “In this desert they will end, and there will they die.” And a person should not say, “The evil is not coming on my account.” He should know that he [too] will die, as stated (Amos 9:10), “All the sinners of My people shall perish [by the sword], who boast, ‘Never shall the evil overtake us or come near us.’” Come and see how difficult it is for the Holy One, blessed be He, to raise His hand against a human being. So what does He do to him? When he sins, He begins by raising His hand against his assets. From whom have you learned it? From Naomi, her sons, and Elimelech her husband, who was the head of [his] generation. When famine came, what did he do? He left the Land of Israel and went to the Land of Moab. Now the Holy One, blessed be He, was angry with him because he was prince (<i>nasi</i>) of [his] generation. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “These have abandoned My children and left the Land of Israel a wilderness.” What is written there (in Ruth 1:3)? “Then Naomi's husband Elimelech died,” but his sons were unable to learn from their father to return to the Land of Israel. And what did they do? (According to vs. 4) They also “took Moabite wives for themselves,” whom they neither immersed nor converted.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ruth R. 2:9.</i> (Ibid., cont.:) “The name of the one was Orpah ('<i>rph</i>) and the name of the second was Ruth”: Orpah ('<i>rph</i>), because she turned her back ('<i>rp</i>) on her mother-in-law; Ruth, because she esteemed (<i>r'th</i>) the words of her mother-in-law. (ibid., cont.:) “And they lived there about ten years.” All those ten years (in Moab) the Holy One, blessed be He, had been warning them, that they might repent and return to the Land of Israel. When He saw that they did not repent, he began to raise His hand against their camels and against their cattle.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lev. R. 17:4; Ruth R. 2:10; <i>PRK</i> 7:10; <i>PR</i> 17:6.</i> When He saw that they did not repent (literally, return in repentance), immediately (in vs. 5), “Both of them, Mahlon and Chilion, also died.” Thus [you may infer] that it is difficult for the Holy One, blessed be He, to raise His hand against [a human being]. So what does He do to them? He deprives them of their assets, and they sell them. When someone sins, what does the Holy One, blessed be He, do to him first? He brings poverty upon him, so that he sells his field. If he repents, then fine; but if not he sells his house. If he repents, then fine; but if not he sells himself. How is this shown? So is it written (in Lev. 25:25), “When your relative becomes poor.” If he repents, then fine; but if not, see what is written in the second section; (in Lev. 25:29), “And when someone sells a dwelling house.” If he repents, then fine; but if not, (in Lev. 25:39), “When your relative becomes poor and he is sold to you.” Why all this? Because they became poor through [their] iniquities. (Lev. 25:25:) “Then his redeemer shall come.” R. Simeon ben Johay said, “Elimelech, Salmon, So-and-So,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Peloni Almoni.</i> According to Ruth 4:1, this was the “name” of Ruth’s most closely related redeemer.</i> and Naomi's father were all descendants of Nahshon ben Amminadab;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>BB</i> 91a.

Cf. the Gk.: <i>pronoos</i> (“prudent”).</i> of the generation.” So for what reason were they punished? Because they went abroad from the Land of Israel. Thus it is stated (in Ruth 1:19), “the whole city was excited over them, [and the women said, ‘Is this Naomi?’]” What is the meaning of, “Is this (<i>Hazot</i>) Naomi?” You saw (<i>hazitem</i>) Naomi when she went abroad from the Land of Israel. What has happened to her? (Lev. 25:25:) “Then his redeemer shall come, the one most closely related (<i>qarov).</i>” This is Boaz. When? When Naomi sold the field, as stated (in Ruth 4:3), “the parcel of land which belonged to our relative, [Elimelech].” (Lev. 25:25:) “Then his redeemer shall come, the one most closely related to him<i>.</i>” This is Boaz, since it is stated (in Ruth 2:20), “The man is our relative (<i>qarov</i>), [he is one of our redeeming kin (<i>go'el</i>)].” At that time Ruth went to Boaz. Her mother-in-law said to her (in Ruth 3:2), “see, he is winnowing barley on the threshing floor tonight.” [If] he was a prince (<i>nasi</i>), would he have been winnowing on a threshing floor? It is simply because his generation was dissolute in matters of theft, and [so] he went out to guard his threshing floor. She said to her (in vs. 3), “You are to wash and anoint yourself.” Then after that (ibid), “and go down to the threshing floor.” \"And I shall go down\" is the actual written text (<i>ketiv</i>)]. What is the meaning of \"and I shall go down?\" She said to her, “My merit will go down with you.” Hence it is written, \"And I shall go down.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ruth R. 5:12.</i> But she did not do as her mother-in-law had told her.

[Only] after she went down to the threshing floor, she did what she was told, as stated (in vs. 6), “She went down to the threshing floor and did just as her mother-in-law had commanded her.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, since she only obeyed Naomi after she had arrived at the threshing floor, she must have neglected to wash and anoint herself before then.</i> Why? It is simply that she said, “The generation was dissolute in sexual matters. What if they see me made up and say, ‘Perhaps she is a harlot?’” Therefore, “She went down to the threshing floor and” afterwards “she did just as her mother-in-law had commanded her.” (Vs. 7:) Then, when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry.” What is the meaning of “and his heart was merry?” That he was occupied with words of the Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ruth R. 5:15.</i> Thus it is stated (Prov. 4:2), “As a good teaching…,” and it is [also] written (about wisdom in Prov. 9:5), “Come and eat of my bread.” (Ruth 3:7, cont.:) “And when he came to lie down beside the grain pile, then she came in secret.” What is the meaning of, “in secret (<i>lt</i>; rt.: <i>lwt</i>)?” [It is] just as you say (in I Sam. 21:10), “here it is wrapped (rt.: <i>lwt</i>) in a mantle.” (Ruth 3:8:) “Now it came to pass in the middle of the night that the man was startled. So he turned aside, [and here was a woman lying at his feet].” What is the meaning of, “turned aside (rt.: <i>lpt</i>)?” [It is] just as you say (in Jud. 16:29), “And Samson embraced (rt.: <i>lpt</i>) the two middle pillars.” That righteous man began to yell. [Fear] embraced him. (Ruth 3:9:) Then he said, “Who are you?” And she said, “I am your handmaid Ruth.” He said to her, “What have you come here to do?” She said to him, “To fulfill the Torah (in Lev. 25:25), ‘When your relative becomes poor [… then his redeemer shall come].’ Arise and fulfill the Torah.” He said to her, “Since you have come to fulfill the Torah, (Ruth 3:13:) ‘Spend the night; then it shall come to pass in the morning that, if he will redeem you, good (<i>tov</i>)’”; for he had a relative older than he, whose name was Tov. R. Hanina said, “She said to him, ‘And are you dismissing me with words?’” He said to her (ibid., cont.), “’As the Lord lives,’ I am not dismissing you with words.” (Ruth 4:1:) “Then Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there, and behold, the redeemer of whom Boaz had spoken was passing by.” He said to him, “Sit down, and we shall look into the Torah; what is written there? Is it not written (in Lev. 25:25), ‘When your relative becomes poor and sells some of his property, [then his redeemer shall come, the one most closely related to him, and redeem…]’” Boaz said to Tov (in Ruth 4:3–4), “’Naomi is selling the parcel of land which belonged to our relative Elimelech […]. And I thought I should disclose it to you, saying, ‘Buy it,’” since you are a senior redeemer than I [and have the right] to redeem it.

[It is so stated] (in Deut. 28:61), “Moreover [the Lord will bring upon you] every disease and every plague which is not written [in this book of the Torah].” Now what were the “things they attributed, which were not right to the Lord?” As Isaiah said (in Is. 1:4), “They have forsaken the Lord […];” do not say, “They have forsaken ('<i>zbw</i>) [Me],” but “They,” as it were, “have made me worth forsaking ('<i>yzbw</i>) (i.e., caused me to be cruel).” Now I was called (in Exod. 34:6), “The Lord, the Lord, a merciful and gracious God.” But through their sins, they have made Me cruel and changed My trait of mercy to cruelty, as stated (in Lam. 2:5), “The Lord has become like an enemy, He swallowed Israel.” It also says (in Is. 63:10), “But they rebelled, and grieved His holy spirit; then He became their enemy, and Himself made war against them.” Therefore, Hosea said, “Who has brought this about for you? [It was] because you did not heed Him, (in Hos. 9:17), ‘My God will reject them because they did not heed Him.’” It is also written (in Deut. 28:65), “And among those nations you shall find no peace.

Samuel bar Nahman questioned R. Johanan ben Eleazar, when he was standing in the market. He said to him, “Recite one chapter (of Mishnah) for me.” He said to him, “Go to the house of study, and I will recite it for you there.” He said to him, “Rabbi, did you not teach me (Prov. 1:20), ‘Wisdom shouts for joy in the street?’” He said to him, “You know how to read (Scripture), but you do know how to recite (Mishnah).

How so? From the beginning (rt.: <i>r'sh</i>) of Torah, how many hosts<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk. <i>ochloi</i> (“crowds”).</i> does she destroy? The generation of the flood, the generation of the dispersion (i.e., of the tower of Babel) and the generation of Sodom. Hence, from the beginning of Torah she calls.

R. Abba said, “She speaks what is good and she speaks what is bad. (In Lev. 26:3-4) ‘If you walk in My statutes […] Then I will give you your rains in their season.’ Here is the good. ‘But if you do not heed, […] I will make your skies like iron’ (according to Lev. 26:14, 19). Here is the bad.” Another interpretation (of Lev. 26:3) “If you walk in My statutes”: What is written there (in vs. 11)? “Then I will set My dwelling place in your midst.” If you fulfill My commandments, I will leave the heavenly beings and come down to dwell among you, as stated (in Exod. 29:45), “And I will dwell in the midst of the Children of Israel.” So they came forth from Egypt on this condition: that they build the dwelling place, so that the Divine Presence might dwell among them, as stated (in vs. 46), “And they shall know that I am the Lord their God who brought them out from the land of Egypt, so that I might dwell in their midst.” Now if they have done My will, My Divine Presence shall not move from their midst. Why? R. Samuel bar Abba said, “The Holy One, blessed be He, desired that, just as He has an abode above, so He would have an abode below, for so He said to the first Adam, ‘If you are worthy, just as I am King over the heavenly beings, so I will make you king over the lower beings.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Tanh</i>., Numb. 2:16; Gen. R. 3:19.</i> It is so stated (in Gen. 2:15), “Then the Lord God took the human.” Now the word, “took” can only be a word of exaltation, just as you say (in Gen. 12:15), “and the woman was taken to Pharaoh's house.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. Gen. R. 16:5.</i> And it also says (in Esth. 2:16), “So Esther was taken unto King Ahasuerus, unto his royal palace.” But He (the Holy One, blessed be He,) did not do so. Rather, when Adam sinned, He removed his Divine Presence from him. Then when Israel arose, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, “You shall only go forth from Egypt on condition that you make a dwelling place for Me, so that My Divine Presence may dwell among you,” as stated (in Exod. 25:8), “Let them make Me a sanctuary [that I may dwell among them].” So also He said to Solomon (in I Kings 6:12–13), “With regard to this house which you are building, if you walk in My statutes […] Then I will dwell in the midst of the Children of Israel [and will never abandon My people Israel].” [However] (in I Kings 9:6-7) “If you and your children turn away from following Me […]. Then I will cut off Israel from upon [the face of] the land.” Why? Because those are [the] terms between Me and them, as stated (in Lev. 26:3. 14), “If you walk in my statutes…. But if you do not heed me;” what is written there (in vs. 31)? “Then I will make your sanctuaries desolate.” What did Solomon do? He had a lot of wives and horses; and it is written (in I Kings 11:4), “Now it came to pass in Solomon's old age that his wives led his heart astray.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “I have given you the Torah [for you] to carry out its commandments, and you have seen the terms which I prescribed to you in it”; and it is written (in Ps. 72:1), “To Solomon, O God, give Your statutes to the king.” And [so] it is written (in I Kings 11:11), “Because this has been with you, and you did not keep My covenant and My statutes.” So what do I do? (According to Is. 55:11) “So shall My word be which goes forth from My mouth: it shall not return unto Me empty.” Manasseh arose to make the image and bring it into the holy of holies, as stated (in II Chron. 33:7; cf. II Kings 21:7), “And he set up a sculptured image, which he had made, in the house [of God].” Then the Holy One, blessed be He, called unto Jeremiah and said to him (in Lam. 4:3), “Even snakes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash follows the ketiv (<i>tannin</i>). The qere reads <i>tannim</i> (“jackals”).</i> extend a breast to nurse their young; [the daughter of My people has become cruel].” When the snake (<i>tannin</i>) comes to nurse from its mother, she sees it from afar and extends her breasts for it to nurse; for it would not see her breasts [if] covered, and would not nurse. Now My children do not act like this. Instead, when they saw Me entering the house, Manasseh came and brought in the image in order to force Me out of it. At first they made a single face,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>prosopon.</i></i> and set it up to the west. The Divine Presence went, as it were, to another corner, a place where the image would not be seen. When Manasseh saw that, he made four faces so that the Divine Presence would see them and depart. Thus it is stated (in Is. 28:20), “For the couch is too short for stretching out, and the molten image<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Massekhah.</i> Most biblical translations render the word as denoting a kind of covering here and in Is. 25:7, but <i>massekhah</i> generally refers to an image. In any case, the image concept must have suggested the use of the verse in this context.</i> too narrow (<i>tsar</i>) for curling up.” Ergo I would say, “Unlike the snakes (in Lam. 4:3), they did not extend a breast to nurse their young.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “What am I doing here? (Hos. 5:15) ‘I am going. I will return to my place.’” \"I will go and return\" is not written here, but “I am going. I will return.” Now if had been written, \"I will go and return (to the heavenly abode),\" there would have been no hope for Israel; however, the Holy One, blessed be He, said, “Although I am going, let them repent, and I will return.” It is therefore written, “I am going. I will return to my place, until they acknowledge their guilt and seek My face. In their distress (<i>tsar</i>) they will search diligently for Me.” Out of the midst of distress, when it comes upon them, they shall repent, and I will return and they shall seek My face. R. Yehuda says, “If Israel does not repent, they will not be redeemed, since it is stated (in Is. 30:15), ‘In stillness (<i>shuva</i>, which can be read as return or repentance) and calm you shall be saved; [… but you were unwilling ].’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>yTa‘an.</i> 1:1 (63d-64a); <i>Sanh</i>. 97b.</i> R.

Elazar said, “If they do not repent on their own, the Holy One, blessed be He, will raise over them an evil king, whose decrees are as harsh as [those of] Haman. Then he shall enslave them, and for that reason they shall repent, since it is stated (in Is. 59:19), ‘for distress shall come like a stream, with the wind of the Lord driving it onward.’ At that time (according to vs. 20), ‘Then a redeemer shall come to Zion.’”"

Another interpretation (of Ps. 89:7), “For who in the skies is comparable to the Lord”: When the Holy One, blessed be He, created the world and wanted to create Adam, the ministering angels said to Him, (in Ps. 8:5), “’What is a human that You are mindful of him, and a person that You should think of him?’ What do You want from this human?” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, “Who is to fulfill my Torah and My commandments?” They said to Him, “We will fulfill Your Torah.” He said to them, “It is written in [the Torah] (in Numb. 19:14), ‘This is the Torah: When a person dies in a tent,’ but there are none among you who die. It is written in [the Torah] (in Lev. 12:2), ‘When a woman emits her seed and bears a male,’ but there are none among you who bear [children].

And is it not written (in Lev. 1:2), ‘When one of you presents an offering to the Lord from the beasts.’ ‘From the beasts’ and not from people?” He said to her, “My daughter, I made a vow (in Jud. 11:31), ‘Then it shall be that whatever comes forth […].’ Is it possible that anyone who makes a vow does not have to fulfill his vow?” She said to him, “Behold, when our father Jacob made a vow (in Gen. 28:22), ‘and of all that You give me, I will surely set aside a tithe for You’; when the Holy One, blessed be He, gave him twelve sons, did he ever offer up one of them as a sacrifice? Moreover, does not Hannah [do likewise], when she makes a vow and says (as reported in I Sam. 1:11), ‘And she made a vow and said, “Lord of hosts, if You will surely see… [then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life].”’ Did she ever offer up her son as a sacrifice to the Holy One, blessed be He?” All these things she said to him, but he did not heed her. When she saw that he did not heed her, she said to him, “Let me go to a court of law. Perhaps one of them will find a loophole for your words.” Thus it is stated (in Jud. 11:37), “leave me alone for two months, so that I may go and come down to the mountains.” R. Zechariah said, “Is there anyone who comes down to the mountains? Does not one go up to the mountains? So what is the meaning of ‘and come down to the mountains?’ These represent the Sanhedrin,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>synedrion.</i></i> as in the usage (of Micah 6:2), ‘Hear, O mountains, the lawsuit of the Lord.’” She went to them, but they did not find a loophole for undoing his vow, because of the sin of those that he slaughtered from the tribe of Ephraim. So it is with reference to him that Scripture has said (in Prov. 28:3), “A poor man who exploits the indigent is a torrential rain which leaves no bread.” “A poor man who exploits the indigent.” This is referring to Jephthah; since he was poor in Torah like a [mere] sycamore shoot.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The metaphor designates one who is poor.</i> (Prov. 28:3, cont.:) “Who exploits the indigent,” since he exploited the indigent, when he said [to the men of Ephraim] (in Jud. 12:6), “Say, ‘S<i>hibboleth</i>’; and he said, ‘<i>Sibboleth,</i>’ not being able to pronounce it correctly.” Then he slaughtered him. Therefore, he is (according to Prov. 28:3, cont.) “a torrential rain, and there is no bread,” in that he had someone who would undo his vow; however (ibid., cont.), “there is no bread,” in that the Holy One, blessed be He, had taken away the halakhah from them, so that they would not find [a loophole] for undoing his vow. When they did not find [a loophole] for undoing his vow, he went up and slaughtered her before the Holy One, blessed be He. Then the holy spirit proclaimed, “Did I desire you to sacrifice lives (<i>npshwt</i>) to Me, [lives] (according to Jer. 19:5), ‘which I never commanded, never spoke for, and which never entered My mind.’” “Which I never commanded” Abraham, that he slaughter his son. Instead I said to him (in Gen. 22:12), “Do not raise your hand against the lad.” [This was] in order to make known Abraham’s love [of God] to the nations of the world, that he did not spare his only one from Me and carried out the will of his Maker. (Jer 19:5 cont.:) “Never spoke” to Jephthah to offer up his daughter as a sacrifice to Me. Rabbi Johanan and R. Simeon ben Laqish [differed on the matter]. Rabbi Johanan says, “He was liable for money [in order to fulfill his vow], like the matter is written in <i>Arakhin</i>.” And R. Simoen ben Laquish said, “[He was liable for] nothing, as he made a stipulation about something that is impossible to sacrifice, and [so] there was no [liability] upon him.” “And which never entered my mind,” this is referring to Misha the king of Moab, about whom it is written that when he fell into the hand of the king of Israel (in II Kings 3:27), “And he took his firstborn son, who would become king in his stead, and offered him up as a burnt offering upon the wall.” What caused Misha to sacrifice his son?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the parallel text in Buber Tanchuma 10:7, which has the final question being about Jephthah, which fits much better with the continuation of the section.</i> Because he was not a Torah scholar; for if he had read the Torah, he would not have lost his son, since it is written (in Lev 27:2-4) “When anyone explicitly vows [to the Lord the value of human beings (<i>npshwt</i>)] And the value of a male shall be […]. And if it is a female….” Ergo (in Prov. 11:30), “but a wise person acquires lives (<i>npshwt</i>).”"

Neither your children nor your sacrifices do I want. For my children I have given a <i>Parashah</i> on value equivalents (in Lev. 27:1-8) and a <i>Parashah</i> on sacrifices, as it is their sacrifices that are beloved in front of Me.” And so it says (in Ps. 37:16), “Better is the little of the righteous.” You yourself know what is at the beginning of the book (in Lev. 1:2), “Speak unto the Children of Israel, and say unto them, ‘When one of you presents an offering to the Lord,’” [i.e.] “of you,” and not \"of the nations.\" Then at the end of the book [one finds (in Lev. 27:2),] “Speak unto the Children of Israel and say unto them, ‘When anyone explicitly [vows].’” It also says (in Ps. 147:19), “He declares His words to Jacob….” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel. “If you bring before me your value equivalents, I will ascribe it to you as if you had offered up your lives before Me.” It is therefore stated (in Lev. 27:2), “When anyone explicitly vows [to the Lord the value of human beings].” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “By virtue of the value equivalents (rt.: '<i>rk</i>) I am saving you from the [fiery] preparation (rt.: '<i>rk</i>) of <i>Geihinnom</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf.

However, when you were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt and when I brought you out from there, I had you lie down on couches, as it states (Exod 13:18), ‘And the Lord made the people circumvent (<i>Vayasev</i>) through the desert.’” What is [the meaning of] ”circumvent?” It teaches that He made them recline in the way that kings dine (<i>mesavin</i>), reclining upon their beds. “And I did not even bring three fleas to trouble you. And I even raised up three redeemers for you to serve you, as stated (in Micah 6:4), ‘and I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam before you.’” Through their merit, Israel was able to travel.

The midrash is seeking the connection between BANQUET HOUSE and HIS STANDARD.</i> When the Holy One, blessed be He, was revealed upon mount Sinai, there descended with Him twenty-two thousand chariots of angels, as stated (in Ps. 68:18), “The chariots of God are two myriads, thousands for a doubling.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash interprets these words to mean: TWO MYRIADS (of 10,000 each) PLUS A THOUSAND DOUBLED for a total of 22,000.</i> Now they all were arranged by standards (rt.: <i>dgl</i>). It is therefore stated (in Cant. 5:10), “the most prominent (rt.: <i>dgl</i>) of ten thousand.” When Israel saw them, as they were arrayed by standards (rt.: <i>dgl</i>), they yearned for standards. They said, “O that we might be arrayed with standards like them!” It is therefore stated (in Cant. 2:4), “He brought me unto the banquet house, [and His standard (<i>dgl</i>) over me is love].” The banquet house (literally: house of wine) is Mount Sinai, on which Torah was given, since [Torah] is compared to wine, as stated (in Prov. 9:5, where wisdom is saying), “and drink of the wine I have mixed.” Ergo (in Cant. 2:4), “He brought me unto the house of wine,” namely to Sinai. (Ibid., cont.,) “And His standard over me is love.” They said, “O that He may raise the standard of love over me!” And so it says (in Ps. 20:6), “Let us shout for joy in Your salvation, and in the name of our God let us set up our standards.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, “Do you yearn for standards? By your life, I will fulfill your petition.” It is so stated (ibid., cont.), “may the Lord fulfill all your petitions.” Immediately the Holy One, blessed be He, made known His love to Israel and said to Moses, “Go and make those standards like the ones for which they have yearned.

Where is it shown for traveling? Where it is stated (in Numb. 10:14), “And [in first place traveled] the camp standard of [the Children of] Judah.” Where is it shown for sacrifices? Where it is stated (in Numb. 7:12), “And the one who offered […] on the first day was Nahshon ben Amminadab of the tribe of Judah.” Where is it shown for warfare? Where it is written (in Jud. 1:1-2), “Who shall be the first to go up for us against the Canaanites to fight against them? Then the Lord said, ‘Let Judah go up.’” And also, when the herald [of messianic age] comes, Judah shall receive the good news first, as stated (in Nahum 2:1), “Behold over the mountains the feet of the herald announcing peace; celebrate your festivals, O Judah, fulfill your vows.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, “In this world you yearned for standards and I fulfilled your petition; but in the future to come, by virtue of the banners, I shall redeem you; and in the merit of the forefathers, that are called mountains, I shall leap over (rt.: <i>dlg</i>) the end, as stated (in Cant. 2:8), ‘The voice of my beloved!

Now (according to Deut. 7:6), “the Lord your God has chosen you….” Why did He choose you?

So he says to Moses each time (as in Numb. 3:15), “Enroll the Children of Levi [….]” “Every male.” Why did he say, “every male,” and not mention the noun, female? Because the glory of God arises from the males. [Ergo,] “every male.” David has stated (in Ps. 127:3), “Behold, sons are the heritage of the Lord”; i.e., the males. “The fruit of the womb, a reward,” for if females come, says the Holy One, blessed be He, “they also are a reward.” And why does he enroll them [each and every time]? Because they are His troops,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">89</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>taxeis.</i></i> and the King has much joy in His troops. Moreover, you find that the whole tribe of Levi was diminished (in number). And why were they diminished? Because they see the Divine Presence much. So also when Israel came up from the captivity, they did not find any of them, because they had been diminished, as stated (in Ezra 8:15), “so I viewed the people and the priests, but I found there none of the Children of Levi.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “In this world they were destroyed, because they had seen the Divine Presence, since it is stated (in Exod. 33:20), “For no human shall see Me and live.” But in the future to come, when I restore my Divine Presence to Zion, I will be revealed in My glory over all Israel. Then they shall see Me and live forever. Thus it is stated (in Is. 52:8), “for eye to eye they shall see the return of the Lord to Zion.” And not only that, but they shall point out My glory to each other with the finger, while saying (in the words of Ps. 48:15), “For this God, our God...” It also says (in Is. 25:9), “And in that day they shall say, ‘See, this is our God; we waited for Him and He delivered us]; this is the Lord; we waited for Him.

And so you find in the case of the first Adam. When he was commanded and told (in Gen. 2:17), “But from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat …,” he incurred the sentence of death; and the world was scourged with forty punishments: ten for Adam, ten for Eve, ten for the serpent, ten for the land. Therefore, when a person commits one of the transgressions [punishable by death], he is scourged with forty lashes. And so you find with each and every thing that the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded Moses, [there were] warnings and punishments. It is written concerning the Sabbath (Exod. 20:8), “Remember the Sabbath day,” as a warning; and as a punishment (there is Exod. 31:14), “whoever profanes it shall surely be put to death.” They came to the desert and (according to Numb. 15:32) found one gathering [wood on the Sabbath], but Moses did not know by what death he should be killed. However, (according to Lev. 24:12) “They left him in custody [because it was not clear what should be done to him.]” The Holy One, blessed be He, said (in vs. 35), “The person shall surely be put to death; [all the congregation] shall stone him with stones.” Immediately Moses rose in prayer and said, “Sovereign of the world, if a man should so sin, should he [really] be stoned? Behold, they would be destroyed. Make an [other] arrangement for them.” He said to him, “Let them be scourged with forty lashes, and they will be exempt from excision.” Similarly when the children of Aaron died, the tribe of Kohath saw them. They began yelling to Moses, saying, “Are we to die like that?” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “Just as I have made an [alternate] arrangement for Aaron, as stated (in 16:3), ‘In this way shall Aaron come [into the sanctuary]…’; so also for the Kohathite families I am making a similar arrangement, lest they die, as stated (Numb. 4:19), ‘Do this for them (i.e., for the Kohathites) that they may live and not die….’” Where is it shown?

He destroyed them but rescued Enoch, as stated (in Gen. 5:24), “And Enoch walked with God.” Why? (Nahum 1:7:) “[The Lord is good, a shelter] in the day of trouble; He knows those who trust in Him.” The generation of the flood provoked Him. So He destroyed them, as stated (in Gen. 7:23), “And He blotted out all existence”; but He rescued Noah, as stated (in Gen. 6:8), “And Noah found favor [in the eyes of the Lord].” And similarly with the Sodomites, He destroyed them, as stated (in Gen. 19:24), “Then the Lord rained down upon Sodom”; but He rescued Lot, as stated (in vs. 29), “and sent Lot away.” He brought darkness upon the Egyptians, but (according to Exod. 10:23) “all the Children of Israel had light in their dwellings.” Why? (Nahum 1:7:) “[The Lord is good, a shelter] in the day of trouble; He knows those who trust in Him.” They went forth from Egypt and came to the desert. [There] they committed that deed (i.e., the incident of the golden calf), [all] except for the tribe of Levi. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 32:26), “[So Moses stood up in the gate of the camp and said,] ‘Whoever is for the Lord, to me!’ And all of the sons of Levi gathered to him.” [What is the meaning of “Whoever is for the Lord?”] Whoever (in Exod. 32:3) has not given a ring for the calf, let him come unto me. [To him] the Holy One, blessed be He, said (in Nahum 1:7), “[The Lord is good, a shelter] in the day of trouble; He knows those who trust in Him.” Moshe immediately arose and killed the sinners, as stated (Exodus 32:28), “And the Children of Levi did like the word of Moses.” With reference to the tribe of Levi, however, which gave their lives for the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, He thus said to Moses and Aaron (in Numb. 4:18), “Do not cut off….” And so He says in another place (i.e., in Numb. 3:15), “Enroll the Children of Levi.” But He has also said (in Numb. 1:49), “However, you shall not enroll the tribe of Levi.” Why? In order to exclude them from the decree. As the Holy One, blessed be He, foresaw that Israel was going to provoke Him and said to them (in Numb. 14:29), “In this desert shall your carcasses drop.” Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, said, “The Children of Levi shall not be [part of] this decree, as stated (in Numb. 1:49, cont.), ‘nor shall you take a census of them as part of the Children of Israel.’ Why? Because they are Mine, as stated (Numb. 3:12), ‘and the Levites shall be mine.’” Thus when anyone offers (rt.: <i>qrb</i>) a little of himself, they advance (rt.: <i>qrb</i>) him a lot.

He appointed (<i>mnh</i>) Ephraim alone to destroy the seed of Amalek. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him (ibid., cont.), “’After you, Benjamin with your peoples,’ [i.e.,] leave him for Saul ben Kish, the Benjamite; he will uproot him.” Another interpretation (of Jud. 5:14), “Out of Ephraim.” Saul was tested and found untrustworthy in his commission.

It is simply that I am allotting them great honor.

He would raise it, take dust from underneath, and put it upon the water, as stated (in Numb. 5:17), “and some of the dust which is in the floor of the Tabernacle, [the priest shall put it into the water].” Then he would write the scroll (in the wording of Numb. 5:19), “If no one has slept with you […].” From here our masters have taught, “When one opens capital cases, one begins with [the case for] acquittal.” Then he writes further (in vs. 20), “And if you have gone astray […].” What is written after it (in vs. 21)? “May the Lord make you a curse […].” And so Solomon has said (in I Kings 8:31–32 // II Chron. 6:22–23), “Whenever one sins against his neighbor, and he gives him an oath for him to swear, then when he comes for the oath before Your altar in this house; You will hearken in heaven, take action, and judge Your servant, in order to condemn the wicked so as to set his conduct upon his own head and justify the righteous so as to render to him according to his righteousness.” (Numb. 5:28:) “But if the woman has not defiled herself [and is pure, she shall be guiltless and shall conceive seed].” If she was defiled, (according to <i>Sot.</i> 3:4; 5:1) she would not have finished drinking before her face turns green, her eyes protrude, and she is full of [swollen] veins. Then the priest says, “Take her out, take her out,” so that she does not defile the Temple court. Just as the water tests the woman, so does the water test the man, since it is stated [twice] (in Numb. 5:22 &amp; 24), “And it (i.e., the water that causes the curse] shall go.” Just as she is forbidden to her husband, so is she forbidden to the lover, since it is stated [twice] (in Numb. 5:13 &amp; 14), “she has defiled herself.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Sot.</i> 28a) explains these double usages more fully.

Moreover, this adulterer cannot look at [the husband]. Ergo, ‘and one that instigates a quarrel among brothers.’” Ergo, [there are] seven injurious things which the adulteress does."

(Exod. 20:7 = Deut. 5:11:) “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God [in vain].” [One breaks this commandment] because he commits adultery and swears in vain that he has not done so. (Exod. 20:12 = Deut. 5:16:) “Honor your father.” When one commits adultery with the adulteress, she becomes pregnant from him. Then she says to her husband, “I am pregnant from you.” When the fetus is grown, it honors her husband, [since it] thinks that he is its father. Moreover, [the grown child] passes through the market and hits the adulterer, since he thinks that he is not his father.

Deut. 5:18:) “You shall not covet your neighbor's house, and you shall not covet your neighbor's wife […].” [The commandment is broken] because whoever covets his friend's wife and commits adultery with her, covets everything that belongs to his friend.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf.

Then when the baby goes on to minister in the Temple, arrange wood, and sacrifice on the Sabbath, he is found to be profaning the Sabbath. Hence the Ten Commandments are violated by the adulteress with the adulterer.

[(Numb. 5:12), “If anyone has his wife go astray.”] This text is related (to Job 24:15), “The eye of an adulterer watches for twilight, saying, ‘No eye shall see me.’” And so the adulterer says, “No human being knows about me”; but the Holy One, blessed be He, has His eyes ranging over all the earth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numb.

They wait for a time of darkness, so that no one will see them. It is therefore stated (in Job 24:15), “The eye of the adulterer watches for twilight.” So also thieves watch for an hour of darkness, as stated (in vs. 16), “He breaks into houses in the dark.” And so it says (in Is. 29:15), “Woe to those who delve deeply to hide a plan from the Lord, for their works are in darkness; [so they say, ‘Who sees us and who knows about us?’]” The thief and the adulterer are obdurate, because they remove the Divine Presence. The Holy One, blessed be He, as it were, fills the realms above and the realms below, as stated (in Jer. 23:24), “’do I not fill heaven and earth,’ says the Lord.” Also in regard to the place where the adulterer comes to commit adultery, the Holy One, blessed be He, is there in His glory. It is so stated (in Is. 6:3), “the whole earth is full of His glory.” Now the adulterer says to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Remove Yourself, and give way to me for a while.” The matter is exceedingly difficult, as it were. Since He is slow to anger, He gives way to him; for (according to Job 11:11) “He knows those who are worthless; so when He sees iniquity, [does He not discern it?]” It also says (in Job 24:15, cont.), “He (i.e., the Holy One, blessed be He) turns a secret into a face.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This rendering fits the context of what follows in the midrash.

When the fetus is conceived from the husband, the Holy One, blessed be He, forms its image in forty days. For thus have our masters taught, ‘In forty days the image of the fetus is recognizable.’ After forty days, when the adulterer comes into her, the Holy One, blessed be He, stands wondering and says, ‘After whom shall I form [the fetus]? The image (rt.: <i>tswr</i>) of the husband or the image of the adulterer?’ (According to Deut. 32:18,) As it were, ‘You were unmindful of (<i>tshy</i>) the Rock (<i>tswr</i>) that bore you.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the adulterer forgot that the Holy One would expose him.</i> The <i>yod</i> (= <i>y</i>) is [here written] small.

Numb. 5:19.</i> It is simply that this is [the kind of woman] who encounters a certain man and sets her eyes on him. Then she has sexual intercourse with her husband while her heart is on him. [There is] a story about the king of the Arabs, who asked R. Aqiva, “I am black and my wife is black, but she has borne me a white son. Shall I kill her because she has played the harlot while under me?” He said to him, “Are the images within your house white or black?” He said to him, “White.” He said to him, “When you were busy with her, she set her eyes on the images and bore [a child] like them. Now if you are surprised over this matter, learn from the Jacob's flock. They were conceived from the sticks, as stated (in Gen. 30:39), ‘Since the flock conceived by the sticks, [the flock bore streaked, speckled, and spotted young].’” Then the king of the Arabs thanked R. Aqiva. Thus, when any woman is alone with her husband in holiness, in the end he produces righteous children from her. Thus we find it so in the case of Hannah, who was alone with her husband in holiness, and [so] the Holy One, blessed be He, did not deprive her of her reward. Rather he gave her a righteous son like Moses, as stated (in Jer. 15:1), “Even if Moses and Samuel stood before Me.” It also says (in Ps. 99:6), “Moses and Aaron were among His priests, and Samuel was among those who call upon His name.” So also did Hannah say (in I Sam. 1:27), “For this child did I pray, [and the Lord has granted me my petition].” Why? Because he was sown in holiness. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “In this world I abhor all those peoples, because they are from unclean seed; but I have chosen you, because you are from true seed, as stated (in Jer. 2:21), ‘And I planted you as a choice vine, all of it from true seed.’ It is also written (in Deut. 7:6), ‘and the Lord your God has chosen you […].’ And also in the future to come I am choosing only you, because you are a holy seed, as stated (in Is. 65:23), ‘They shall not labor in vain, nor bear children in terror, because they are a seed blessed of the Lord, [and their offspring along with them].’”"

Ergo Solomon said it well (in Prov. 27:18), “The one who tends a fig tree shall eat its fruit […].” So also you find in the case of the Tabernacle, when everyone devoted their lives [to it] and made the Tabernacle. All Israel volunteered. The women spun the goat's hair; and similarly (in Exod. 36:8), “Then all the wise-hearted ones among the workers [made the Tabernacle]. And likewise (according to Exod. 36:1), “Then let Bezalel and Oholiab [and all the wise-hearted ones …] do [all that the Lord has commanded].” But because Moses devoted his life to [the Tabernacle], it was called by his name, as stated (in Exod. 25:40), “Observe and make them [by means of] their pattern.” And Moshe went and devoted his life to each and every thing, so that they should make it just as the Holy One, blessed be He, had shown him on the mountain, so that they would not err with it. It is therefore written about each and every thing (in Exod. 39:1, 5, 7, 21, 26, 29, 31, cf. 42), “as the Lord commanded Moses.” And so it says (in vs. 43), “When Moses saw all the work, and behold, they had done it […; then Moses blessed them].” And with what blessing did he bless them? He said to them, “May the Divine Presence dwell in the work of your hands.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “Because Moses has devoted his life to the Tabernacle, I will only write about it in his name.” Thus it is stated (in Numb. 7:1), “So it came to pass on the day that Moses had finished.”"

So He abandoned the Tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent where He dwelt among mortals (which can be read as, surety for mortals).” This is the Tabernacle, which was only made so that if they sinned, it might be seized [instead] of them. (Numb. 7:1:) “So it came to pass on the day that Moses had finished setting up the Tabernacle, and he anointed it.” When he had anointed it, he returned and anointed each and every one of [its] vessels.

You yourself know that it is so written (in vs. 19) where presented (<i>hqrb</i>) lacks [a <i>y</i> (i.e., a <i>yod</i>) and as such is really an imperative, meaning \"come near.\"] When [that tribe] was far away, it was brought near, to come (i.e., to offer sacrifice).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verb, <i>NTHQRB</i> (rt.: <i>QRB</i>), used here means “brought near,” but the root also denotes the offering of a sacrifice.

Because they were knowledgeable in the Torah, as stated (in I Chron. 12:33), “And from the Children of Issachar, those who had an understanding of the times, [to know what Israel should do]; their heads were two hundred.” These were heads of courts (<i>sanhedraot</i>).

So you find this [to have happened] when Solomon built the Temple and wanted to offer sacrifice for the Temple dedication; look at what is written there (in I Kings 8:63 // II Chron. 7:5)! “Solomon sacrificed twenty-two thousand oxen and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep as peace offerings, which he sacrificed to the Lord.” And likewise in the days of Ezra, what is written there (in Ezra 6:17)? “They offered at the dedication of this house of God one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs […].” Ergo (in Ps. 51:20 [18]), “Make Zion prosper in your good pleasure….”"

                "(Numb. 8:1–2:) “Then the Lord spoke unto Moses saying, ‘Speak unto Aaron and say unto him, “When you set up the lamps.”’” Let our master instruct us: Is it permissible to light the Sabbath [lamp] with oil for burning<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e. defiled oil from the <i>terumah</i> (the priestly tithe on produce). So <i>Shab.</i> 23b.</i> on a festival? Thus have our masters taught (in <i>Shab.</i> 2:2): One may not light with oil for burning on a festival. R. Ishmael says, “One may not light [it] with tar out of respect for the Sabbath.” But the sages permit all kinds of oil: Sesame oil, nut oil, radish oil, fish oil, colocynth oil, tar, or mineral oil. R. Tarfon says, “One may only make a light with olive oil alone.” R. Johanan ben Nuri rose to his feet and said, “What will the people of Babylon do, who have nothing but sesame oil? What will the people of Media do, who have nothing but nut oil? What will the people of Alexandria do, who have nothing but radish oil? And what will the people of Cappadocia do, who have neither the one nor the other but only mineral oil?” R. Tarfon said to them, “See we have found that the Holy One, blessed be He, loves olive oil in a lamp and in lighting more than all the other oils, as He repeated it and trebled it in several places. And from His great love [for it], He chose ‘clear oil of beaten olives for lighting’ (Exod. 27:20). ‘For lighting,’ but not for the offerings. And the rest of the olive was for the offerings that were sacrificed.” You know that [it is so]. See, with reference to all the [other] gifts it is only said of them (as in Lev. 2:15), “And you shall put oil upon it”;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. Lev. 2:1, 6 where the same command is expressed with a different verb i.e. POUR.</i> but with reference to the lighting of the lamp, it is written “oil of olives,” and not other oils, (in Exod. 27:20), “clear of beaten [olives] for lighting.” We find that in several places the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded about lighting the lamps with clear oil of beaten olives, and so it says (in Exod. 27:20) “And you shall command the Children of Israel to bring unto you clear oil of beaten olives.” So also it says (in Lev. 24:2, 4), “Command the Children of Israel to bring unto you clear oil of beaten olives for lighting.... Upon the unalloyed lampstand.” And here also it is written (in Numb. 8:2), “When you set up (literally, raise up) the lamps.”"

You yourself know [this truth]. When a person builds a house and makes windows within [his house], he makes windows narrow on the outside and broad on the inside, so that the light will enter from the outside and shine on the inside. But when Solomon built the Temple, he did not make the windows like that.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above Exod. 8:5; <i>PRK</i> 21:5; Lev.

While the Hebrew is obscure the translation here follows the Targum in order to fit the midrashic context.</i> [This text] is to inform you that He is all light and that He has no need for its light.

R. 15:3.</i> You find that, when twelve tribes presented offerings at the dedication of the altar, the tribe of Levi did not offer anything. They were depressed and said, “Why were we removed from making an offering at the dedication of the altar?” A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who made a banquet and each day invited various artisans. Now he had a certain friend who he loved exceedingly, but he did not invite him along with them. So he was depressed saying, “Perhaps the king harbors [some grievance] against me in his heart. [Perhaps] it is for this reason that the king has not invited me to any of the feasts.” When the days of the feast had passed [the king] called the friend [and] said to him, “For all the people of the province I made [that] feast, but for you only I am making one single feast for yourself. Why? Because you are my friend.” So this king is the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He. You find that the twelve tribes brought offerings for the dedication of the altar and the Holy One, blessed be He, accepted them, as stated (in Numb. 7:5), “Take it from them.” But the tribe of Levi did not bring an offering. When the dedication of the altar had passed, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Aaron and his sons, “All the tribes have made a dedication. Now you make a dedication by yourselves.” It is therefore stated (in Numb. 8:2), “Speak unto Aaron [and say unto him], ‘When you set up the lamps,’” and afterwards [it is written] (in vs. 6), “Take the Levites.” Another interpretation (of Numb. 8:2), “Speak unto Aaron [and say unto him], ‘When you set up the lamps.’” You find that Moses experienced more difficulty in making the menorah then for all the [other] vessels of the tabernacle; until the Holy One, blessed be He, showed him with [His] finger.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above Lev. 3:11 and the parallels listed there; Numb.

For Moses spent a lot of effort before the menorah was made; as it says so (in Exod. 25:31), “with difficulty (<i>mqshh</i>, revoweled as <i>miqqashah</i>)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A typical translation of the Masoretic pointing would be: OF HAMMERED WORK.</i> shall the menorah be made.” When it became difficult for him, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “Moses, take a talent of gold and cast it into the fire. Then take it out, and it will have been made automatically.” (Ibid. cont.:) “Its base, its shaft, its cups, its knobs, and its flowers from it,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">English translations usually render the end of this verse: …SHALL BE OF ONE PIECE or something similar; however, the midrash follows the interpretation given here.</i> [is to mean] “Make a blow with a hammer, and it will be made automatically.” It was therefore stated (in Exod. 25:31), “of hammered work (i.e. with difficulty) shall [the menorah] be made (<i>ty'sh</i>).” [The verb is spelled] fully with a <i>y</i> (<i>yod</i> in Hebrew) and not written [with the normal spelling] as <i>t'sh</i> (which could be translated, \"you shall make\"). [It is written with the extra letter] so as to say [that] it shall be made automatically. What did Moses do? He took a talent of gold and threw it into the fire. Then Moses said, “Master of the world, here is the talent; it is cast into the midst of the fire. Let it be made (<i>ty'sh</i>) in front of You just as You wish.” Immediately the menorah came forth made as it should be. It is therefore written (in Numb. 8:4 end), “according to the pattern which the Lord had shown Moses, [so did he make the menorah].” \"Moses made\" is not written here, but merely “he made.” [So] who did make it? The Holy One, blessed be He. Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, told Moses to warn Aaron to light [the lamps] as stated (in Numb. 8:2), “When you set up the lamps.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “If you light [the lamps] before Me, I will preserve your souls from everything evil.” Thus their souls are likened to a lamp, as stated (in Prov. 20:27), “A person's soul is the lamp of the Lord.”"

Rather it is so that you may give light to Me just as I have given light to you in order to exalt you in the presence of all the nations; so that they will say, ‘See how Israel is giving light to the One who gives light to everyone!’” To what is the matter comparable? To a sighted person and a blind person who were walking on a road (... as in Tanchuma, Tetzaveh 4). The Holy One, blessed be He, was leading them and giving them light, as stated (in Exod. 13:21), “And the Lord went before them by day [in a pillar of cloud to guide them on the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light].” When the tabernacle was set up, the Holy One, blessed be He, called to Moses and said to him, “Tell them to give Me light.” It is so stated (in Numb. 8:2), “Speak unto Aaron […], ‘When you set up [the lamps].’” Israel said to the Holy One, blessed be He, (in Ps. 18:29), “’For You light up my lamp.’ And [now] You say that we are to give You light?” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, “It was in order to exalt (<i>lehaalot</i>) you that I told you to give light to Me, just as I had given light to you on the way.” It is therefore stated (in Numb. 8:2), “When you set up (<i>beha'alotekha</i>) [the lamps].”"

So while the tribe of Ephraim made offerings and all of the princes made offerings, the prince of Levi [did not]. Now who was the prince of Levi? This was Aaron, as stated (in Numb. 17:18), “And you shall write the name of Aaron upon the rod of Levi.” So Aaron did not make an offering with the princes, for he said, “Woe to me! Perhaps it is because of me that the Holy One, blessed be He, is not accepting the tribe of Levi.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moshe, “Go, say unto Aaron, ‘Do not be afraid. You are destined for something greater than this.’” It is therefore written (in Numb. 8:2), “Speak unto Aaron [...], ‘When you are raised.’” The offerings remain in force as long as the Temple exists, but the lamps are forever (according to Numb. 8:2 cont.) “in front of the menorah.” Moreover, all the blessings which I have given you to bless My children shall never pass away. Another interpretation (of Numb. 8:2 cont.), “in front of the menorah.” So that you will not despise this menorah. It is so stated (in Zech. 4:10), “For whoever has despised the day of small things shall rejoice to see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel, [even] these seven [...].” This is the menorah. And what are “[these] seven?” These are the seven lamps corresponding to the seven planets that (ibid. cont.) “roam around all the earth.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numb.

[Now if in the case of your eyes, which have within them both black and white, but with you seeing only out of the black], would the Holy One, blessed be He, who is all light need your light?” Another interpretation (of Numb. 8:2 cont.), “in front of the menorah.” Flesh and blood lights a lamp from a burning lamp. Could one [ever] light a lamp from the darkness? The Holy One, blessed be He, however, did make a lamp give light from the darkness, as stated (in Gen. 1:2), “with darkness upon the face of the deep.” What is written after that (in vs. 3)? “Then God said, ‘Let there be light.’” [Since] I have brought light out of the darkness, do I have need for your light?

Then after that He blessed him, as stated (in Gen. 26:12), “So Isaac sowed on that land […] for the Lord had blessed him.” So also in the case of Jacob, when He tested him by means of all those tribulations with Esau, with Rachel, with Dinah, with Joseph, with Simeon, with Benjamin and [with the tribulation of] how he departed from the house of his father and his mother (in Gen. 32:11), “for with [only] my staff did I cross [this Jordan].” Then after that He blessed him.

However all those in the tribe of Levi were righteous and carried out the Torah. It is so stated (in Deut. 33:9), “For they observed Your word,” i.e., the Torah; (ibid. cont.) “and kept Your covenant,” i.e., circumcision. And not only that, but when Israel made the calf, the tribe of Levi did not participate there, as stated (in Exod. 32:26), “So Moses stood up on the gate of the camp and said, ‘Whoever is for the Lord come to me,’ and all the Children of Levi gathered unto him.” When Moses said (in vs. 27), “Each [of you] put his sword on his thigh…,” they immediately did so. Moreover they did not show partiality. And so Moses blesses them, [namely (according Deut. 33:9)], “The one who says of his father and mother, ‘I do not consider them’ and his brother….” When the Holy One, blessed be He, saw that they all were righteous, that He had tested them and they had withstood their trial – as stated (of Levi in Deut. 33:8), “[Your faithful one,] whom You tested at Massah” – the Holy One, blessed be He, immediately said (in Numb. 8:14), “And the Levites shall belong to Me,” to fulfill what is stated (in Ps. 11:5), “The Lord tests the righteous.” In the case of the wicked, however, it is written of them (ibid. cont.), “but His soul (i.e. The soul of the Holy One, blessed be He,) hates the wicked and the lover of injustice.” David said (in Ps. 128:1), “Fortunate is everyone who fears the Lord and walks in His ways.”"

Thus he (i.e., Elijah) caused the dead to live, as stated (in I Kings 17:23), “and Elijah said, ‘See your son is alive.’” Because the Holy One, blessed be He, imparts some of his glory to those who fear Him, He put His own clothing on the messianic king, as stated (in Ps. 21:6), “honor and majesty You shall lay upon him.” What is written about the Holy One, blessed be He, (in Ps. 47:6)? “God has ascended amid acclamation; the Lord with the sound of a horn (<i>shofar</i>).” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “I have made you a king. It is so stated (in Deut. 33:5), ‘Then he became king in Jeshurun.’ Just as when the king goes forth, they sound trumpets before him, so also for you, (in Numb. 10:2:), ‘Make for yourself two silver trumpets.’ [This is] so that will they sound the trumpets before you when you take out and bring in Israel, as stated (Numb.10:3), ‘And they shall blow them and the whole community shall assemble before you.’” Hence (Numb. 10:2:), “Make for yourself two silver trumpets.” This text is related (to Prov. 24:21), “Fear the Lord, my child, and the king, and do not associate with those who would differ.” But what is the meaning of “and the king?” Simply [this, to] make Him (i.e., the Holy One, blessed be He,) king over you.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numb.

Instead they said to him (in Dan. 3:18), “We will not serve your gods, nor will we pay homage to the image of gold which you have set up.” Nebuchadnezzar said to them (in Dan. 3:14), “’Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego?’ Did not the Holy One, blessed be He, say this to you that you should obey royalty in whatever it tells you, where it is stated (in Eccl. 8:2), ‘I [say], “Keep the king's command?”’” They said to him, “You are king over us for taxes and crop levies;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lat.: <i>annona.</i></i> but in regard to the service of idols, Nebuchadnezzar and a dog [have] equal [authority].” (Dan. 3:16-17:) “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, ‘O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to answer you in this [matter]. If our God [whom we serve is able to save us, He shall save us from the burning fiery furnace and from your hand O king].’” They said to him, “Whether He delivers us or whether He does not deliver us (in vs. 18), ‘be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods nor pay homage to the image of gold which you have set up.’” Ergo (in Prov. 24:21), “Fear the Lord, my child, and the king; and do not associate with those who would differ”; [i.e.,] in that Israel is called a third to all those that fear Him, but do not associate with those who say that there are two gods in the world, for the end of [such people] is to perish from the world. It is so stated (in Zech. 13:8), “And it shall come to pass throughout all the land, says the Lord, that two-thirds [in it] shall be cut off [and die], but one-third shall remain in it.” And who is the one-third? This is Israel as stated (in Is. 19:24), “And on that day Israel shall be a third [partner with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth].” Ergo (in Prov. 24:21), “Fear the Lord, my child, and the king.” Whoever is in fear of the Holy One, blessed be He, becomes a king. From whom did you learn [that]? From Abraham because he was in fear of the Holy One, blessed be He, and became a king. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 22:12), “for now I know that you fear God.” But where is it shown that he became a king? It is written (in Gen. 14:17), “[And the king of Sodom came out to meet him …] at the Valley of Shaveh, i.e., the valley of the king.” What is the meaning of the Valley of Shaveh (rt.: <i>shwh</i>?] That they all became equal (rt.: <i>shwh</i>).

R. 15:16.</i> (Ibid.:) “Make for yourself.” For yourself you shall make [them] and not for others. You are to use them, and no one else is to use them. You yourself know that in the case of his disciple Joshua, he did not use those [trumpets] but horns (shofars). When they came to fight against Jericho, there gathered in Jericho seven peoples. It is so stated (in Josh. 14:11), “When you crossed the Jordan and came unto Jericho, the citizens of Jericho, the Amorites, the Perizzites, [the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites,] the Hivites, and the Jebusites fought against you.\" Did seven peoples make up the citizens of Jericho, in that it says [here], “the citizens of Jericho: the Amorites….” R. Samuel bar Nahmani said, “Jericho was the door bolt [for unlocking] the land of Israel. They said, ‘If Jericho is conquered, the whole land will be conquered immediately.’ For that reason seven peoples gathered within it.” What is written (in Josh. 6:20)? “So the people shouted when [the priests] blew on the horns.” [This] teaches that even though Joshua was [Moses'] disciple, he did not use them (i.e. the silver trumpets). Moreover you should not say [this only] about Joshua but even [about] our master Moses, [in that the trumpets] were hidden while he was [still] alive. R. Isaac said, “Note that when Moses was going to depart this world, he said (in Deut. 31:28), ‘Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes [and your officials].’ But where were the trumpets? After all, he did not say, ‘Blow on them for [those people] to gather.’ It is simply that [it was already] while he was [still] alive that they were hidden.” R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi, “It was to fulfill what was said (in Eccl. 8:8), ‘nor is there control on the day of death….’” Ergo (in Numb. 10:2), “Make for yourself....” Make it for yourself, but you shall not use them all the days of your life. Another interpretation (of Numb. 10:2), “Make for yourself.” You are to use them because you are a king, but another is not to use them except King David, as stated (in II Chron. 29:26, 28), “And the Levites stood… the song was sung and the trumpets were blown.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numb. R. 15:16.</i> Our masters have said, “The trumpets that were in the sanctuary were also hidden, but King David used the harp, as stated (in Ps. 57:9), ‘Awake, my glory; awake, O lyre and harp.’” R. Shimon Hassida said, “A harp was hanging above David's bed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>yBer.</i> 1:1 (2d); <i>Ber.</i> 3:b; <i>PRK</i> 7:4; <i>PR</i> 17:3; M.

Immediately David and the students would arise to occupy themselves with the Torah; and driving sleep from their eyes, they would meditate on the Torah until the dawn arose. Therefore, David said (ibid.), ‘Awake, my glory.’ It is customary for the dawn to awaken the people, but (ibid. cont.) ‘I will awaken the dawn.’” Another interpretation (of Ps. 57:9), “Awake my, glory.” What is the meaning of “my glory?” [My glory is] due to the glory of my Creator. For the [evil] drive would say to him, “David, are you not a king? It is customary for kings to arise at three hours into the day; so why are you arising at midnight?” Then [David] said to it, “Empty is my glory. My glory is nothing before the glory of my Creator.” It is therefore stated, “Awake my glory (words which can also be rendered: empty is ['<i>urah</i>] my glory.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The form ‘<i>urah</i> can be either a simple imperative (AWAKE) from the root ‘<i>WR</i> or a past intensive passive (WAS EMPTY) from the root ‘<i>RH</i>.</i> (Ps. 119:62:) “At midnight I will arise to praise You.” David said, “It is my duty to arise at midnight and to praise You for the wonders that You have done with my ancestor (Ruth) at midnight.” It is so stated (in Ruth 3:8–9), “Now it came to pass at midnight that the man was startled, [so he turned aside, and here was a woman lying at his feet]. Then he said, ‘Who are you?’ And she said, ‘I am your handmaid Ruth.’” R. Judah bar Shallum the Levite said, “She said to him, ‘Are you sending me away with [mere] words?’ He said to her (Ruth 3:13) ‘”As the Lord lives,” I am not sending you away with [mere] words.’” (Ruth 3:13:) “As the Lord lives.” [This oath] teaches that he had imposed an oath on his [evil] drive, which was inciting him by saying to him, “You are an unmarried man and she is an unmarried woman. Now is the time to seduce her.” Immediately this righteous man swore, “As the Lord lives, I am not touching her tonight.” And not only Boaz, but all the righteous impose an oath on their [evil] drive. Thus you find it so with David, for when Saul fell into his hands, what did David say (in I Sam. 26:10)? “And David said, ‘As the Lord lives, the Lord shall smite him; either he will die when his day comes or he will go down and perish in battle; [the Lord forbid that I lay my hand on the Lord's anointed].’” Why did he swear two times? R. Samuel bar Nahman said, “His [evil] drive came and said to him, ‘If you had fallen into his hand, he would have shown you no mercy and killed you. [Moreover] according to the Torah it is permissible to kill him, since here he is pursuing [you].’ He therefore hastened to swear two times, ‘As the Lord lives, I will not kill him.’” Israel said to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the universe, You know the power of the evil drive, how strong it is.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, “Remove it little by little in this world, and I will take it away from you in the future.” Thus it is stated (in Is. 62:10), “build up, complete the highway<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The biblical text renders, BUILD UP, BUILD UP THE HIGHWAY.</i> [take away some stone] (i.e. the evil drive)!” It also says (in Is. 57:14), “Build up, build up; clear out a way; remove an obstacle (i.e. the evil drive) from the way of my people!” Then in the world to come I will root it out of you, as stated (in Ezek. 36:26), “I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh.” Thus has R. Tanhuma bar Abba interpreted."

                "(Numb. 11:16:) “Then the Lord said unto Moses, ‘Gather Me seventy men from the elders of Israel….” Let our master instruct us: Within how many cubits is one obligated to stand up in the presence of an elder when he sees him?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numb.

And about which honor did the Torah say (ibid. cont.), “you shall honor the presence of an elder?” That one should not stand in his place or contradict his words. Also when one asks [about] a law (<i>halakhah</i>), one should ask with reverence and not rush to respond or interrupt his words. Whoever does not behave toward his teacher (<i>rav</i>) according to all these rules is labeled a wicked person before the Omnipresent, his learning is forgotten, his years are shortened, and in the end he comes to poverty, as stated (in Eccl. 8:13), “It shall not go well with the wicked one, nor shall he prolong his days; [they are] like a shadow, because he is not in fear before God.” In regard to this fear I do not know [exactly] what it is; [but] when it says (in Lev. 19:32), “You shall rise in the presence of a gray head, [you shall honor the presence of an elder,] and you shall fear your God,” note that it is [really] saying, this is the fear of [students toward] sages.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since GRAY HEAD and ELDER are understood to refer to the sages.</i> [But I might say that this is a fear of] usury and of [false] weights, as fear is stated about them [also].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Lev. 25:36; 19:36. So why say that it refers to a sage?</i> It is simply that R. Eleazar has said, “It is stated here, ‘[you shall honor] the presence (<i>pny</i>) of the elder, and you shall fear your God’; while it is stated in the other passage (in Eccl. 8:13), ‘he is not in fear before (<i>pny</i>) God.’” Hence, one is obligated to greet him before everyone when entering and leaving and to treat him with fear and honor. It is so stated (in Deut. 6:13), “You shall fear (<i>et</i>)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This word generally denotes that what follows is a direct object but at times the word means “along with.” In this latter sense the <i>et</i> implies that one should honor someone along with the Lord your God. For an example of <i>et</i> indicating further inclusions, see <i>Tanh</i>. (Buber) Gen. 1:8.</i> the Lord your God.” And we have learned, “[The <i>et</i> must refer] to [fear of] the master scholars of Torah since you have no other trait like it.” And so it says (in Deut. 1:15), “[So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and well-known people,] and appointed them heads over [you].” From here you learn that you should treat him in a princely manner, [i.e.,] stand in his presence, and give him precedence in every matter of dignity. R. Abba bar Pappa the Priest said, “When I would see a certain group of people, I would walk by another route so as not to be a bother for them, lest they see me and stand for me. [However] when I told of the matter to R. Jose bar Zevida, he said to me, ‘You must pass before them, so that they will see you and stand in your presence. Then you will bring them to the point of fearing Heaven, as stated (in Lev. 19:32), “You shall rise in the presence of a gray head, [you shall honor the presence of an elder,] and you shall fear your God.”’” Why? Because the rise of the righteous is a rise in which there is no decline. But the rise of Esau<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Esau stands for any Roman.</i> the wicked is a rise which is wholly decline. Today he is a governor;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>eparchos.</i></i> tomorrow an assistant [governor]; the next day a captain.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>stratiotes</i> (“citizen soldier”).</i> And thus it is with all their great ones. So also the prophet says (in Obad. 1:4), “Though you make your abode as high as the eagle, and though [your nest is set] among the stars, I will bring you down from there.” The rise of Jacob, however, is a rise which has no decline, and their holiness is never desecrated. And so you find that the elders are one of thirteen things which are written down [as belonging] to the name of the Holy One, blessed be He.

And if we get six each from every tribe, they will add up to the number seventy-two. But if we get five from one tribe and six from another, I shall be imposing jealousy among the tribes.” What did Moses do? R. Judah says, “He took seventy pieces of paper<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Petaqim</i>; cf. Gk.: <i>pittikia</i> (“notes”).</i> and wrote ‘elder’ on them. Then he took another (seventy) [two] blank pieces of paper, mixed them up, put them in an urn,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>kalpis.</i></i> and said to them, ‘Come and take your pieces of paper.’ Whoever took a paper with ‘elder’ written on it knew that he had been appointed an elder. Whoever came up with a blank paper in his hand knew that he had not been appointed an elder.” R. Nehemiah said to him, “There would still have been a controversy, since [a loser] could have said to him, ‘Where is a paper with \"elder\" written on it? If it had been there, it would have come up in my hand.’” Therefore, how did he manage for them? R. Nehemiah said, “He took seventy-two pieces of paper and wrote ‘elder’ on them plus [seventy-]two other blank pieces of paper. Then he mixed them up and put them in the urn. He said to them, ‘Come and take your papers.’ If a paper with ‘elder’ written on it came up in [a person's] hand he knew that he had been appointed an elder, but if a blank one came up in his hand he knew that he had not been appointed. Then the officer-in-charge would say to him, ‘Look there is another paper there with “elder\" written upon it. If you had been worthy of being appointed, [a paper with \"elder\"] would have come up in your hand.’” When [Moses had followed this procedure] the elders were appointed. Eldad and Medad were there, but they excluded themselves. They said, “We are not worthy to be in the number of the elders.” Now because they excluded themselves, they were found [to have become] superior to the elders in five respects. The elders only prophesied for the morrow as stated (in Numb. 11:18), “And you shall say to the people, ‘Purify yourselves for the morrow,’” but these men prophesied what was going to happen at the end of forty years as stated (in Numb. 11:26), “But two men had remained in the camp; [the name of the one was Eldad and the name of the other was Medad…; and they were…] prophesying in the camp.” But what were they prophesying? Some say [they were prophesying] about the downfall of Gog and Magog, while others say they were prophesying that Moses would die and Joshua would bring Israel into the Land. You yourself know that they so prophesied, since it is what Joshua told Moshe (in vs. 28), “Then Joshua ben Nun, Moses' attendant from his youth, answered.” And it is written (in vs. 27), “But a lad ran and told Moses.” And who was it? It was Moses' son, Gershom. The elders did not enter the land, but these did enter the land. Eldad is [so listed] (in Numb. 34:21) [as] Elidad ben Chislon. Medad is [so listed] (in Numb. 34:24) [as] Kemuel ben Shiphtan. The elders were not designated by their names, but these were designated by their names. The elders had their prophecy cease, but these did not have their prophecy cease. It is so stated (of the seventy in Numb. 11:25), “they prophesied but did not continue.” In the case of the elders, their prophecy was from what belonged to Moses, even as the Scripture has said (in Numb. 11:17), “and I will set aside some of the spirit which is upon you and put it on them”; but these [two] had their prophecy from that which belonged to the Holy One, blessed be He, as stated (in Numb. 11:26), “and the spirit rested upon them.”<br>Now if you say, “Since the elders had their prophecy from what belonged to Moses, might it not have lessened his prophecy somewhat?” [The answer is] no. To what may Moses be compared? To a lamp which was lit and<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sifre</i> to Numb. 11:17 (93).</i> everyone lights up from it; yet its light is in no way diminished. So also in the case of Moses. Although the prophets took of his prophecy, the prophecy of Moses was in no way diminished.

So <i>Sot</i>. 11ab; Exod. R. 1:11.</i> Pharaoh took a basket and trowel; who [could] see Pharaoh taking basket and trowel, and working with bricks and not [also] work? Israel immediately went quickly, and applied all their strength along with him all the day, because they were strong and mighty. When it grew dark, he posted taskmasters over them. He said to them, “Reckon the [number of] bricks.” They immediately arose and counted them. He said to them, “This many you shall produce for me each and every day.” He assigned Egyptian taskmasters over the officers of Israel, and the officers were assigned over the rest of the people. Moreover when he said to them (in Exod. 5:7), “You shall no longer give the people straw,” the taskmasters came and counted the bricks. [If] they [the bricks] were found deficient, the taskmasters beat the officers, as stated (in Exod. 5:14), “And the officers of the Children of Israel, whom [the taskmasters of Pharaoh] had set over them, were beaten….” When the officers were beaten for the rest of the people, they did not hand them over into the hands of the taskmasters, for they said, “It is better for us to be beaten than that the rest of the people falter.” Therefore when the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses (in Numb. 11:16), “Gather Me seventy men,” Moses said, “My Master, I do not know who is worthy and who is not worthy.” He said to him (in Numb. 11:16 cont.), “Whom you know to be elders and officers of the people.” These are the officers who had handed themselves over to be beaten on their behalf in Egypt because of the required amount of bricks. Let them come and receive this dignity. It therefore says (ibid.), “whom you know to be elders and officers of the people.” Because they handed themselves over to be beaten for the community, therefore (in Numb. 11:16 cont.), “they shall lead with you in leading the people.” [From here] you learn that whoever hands himself over for the sake of Israel merits dignity and the holy spirit. It is therefore written (ibid.) “whom you know [to be elders and officers of the people.” From the ones of whom it is written (in Exod. 5:14), “And the officers of the Children of Israel [whom the taskmasters of Pharaoh had set over them] were beaten.”"

Then because Hur had stood ('<i>md</i>) up to them with harsh words, they (rt.: '<i>md</i>) rose up against him and killed him [as well]. Then all of Israel gathered around Aaron with great pomp, as stated (ibid.), “and the people gathered unto Aaron...,” [saying,] “Why are you sitting?” R.

In the same way that we rose up against Hur and killed him, so will we do to you, if you prevent us [from our demand].” Once Aaron saw what they did to the elders and to Hur, he was very afraid, as stated (Exodus 32:5), “And Aaron saw and he built an altar <i>(vayiven mizbeach)</i> in front of it,” [meaning that] he built from the killing <i>(vayiven mizvoach)</i>.

When their masters are gathered (dead) from them. The whole time that his master is alive, [the student] asks him. [When] his teacher dies, he toils day and night to fulfill his teaching, as there is no one for him to ask. Hence it is written, “those that are gathered in collections.” (Eccl. 12:11:) “And like implanted nails (<i>msmrwt</i>).” R.

Another interpretation (of Eccl. 12:11 cont.), “and like implanted nails.” From here the sages have said, “It is forbidden to read in the profane (<i>chitzoniot</i>) books.” It is therefore stated (ibid.), “and like implanted nails (<i>msmrwt</i>).” (Ibid. cont.:) [“(The masters of) collections.”] These [masters] are the Sanhedrin.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>synedrion.</i></i> And if you say, “This person permits what another forbids, this one declares unfit what another declares fit, this one declares unclean what another declares clean, R.

So where were the[se earlier] elders? It is simply that, when Israel did those things which are stated (in Numb. 11:1), “Now the people were as murmurers […] then the fire of the Lord burned against them,” they were all destroyed by fire at that time. It is simply that their burning was like the burning of Nadab and Abihu, for they also had acted with disrespect on ascending Sinai, when they saw the Divine Presence. It is so stated (in Exod. 24:11), “they beheld God, and they ate and drank.” Was there eating and drinking there? To what is the matter comparable? To a servant who attended his master while [holding] a slice of bread in his hand and taking bites from it. Similarly had they acted with disrespect as though eating and drinking. So the elders along with Nadab and Abihu deserved to be destroyed by fire on that day; but because the giving of Torah was dear to the Holy One, blessed be He, He therefore did not want to harm them and bring calamity to them on that day. This is what is written (ibid.), “But He (the Holy One, blessed be He,) did not raise His hand against the nobles of the Children of Israel.” From this you may infer that they deserved to have a hand raised [against them]. After a time, however, they were destroyed by fire. Nadab and Abihu were destroyed by fire as they entered the tent of meeting, while the elders were destroyed by fire when they were filled with lusting, as stated (in Numb. 11:4), “Then the rabble (<i>ha'safsuf</i>) which was in their midst became filled with lust.” Who were the rabble (<i>ha'safsuf</i>)? R. Simeon ben Menasya and R. Simeon bar Abba [differed on the matter]. One said, “These were the proselytes who came up with them from Egypt and who were gathered (<i>ne'esafim</i>) together with them as stated (in Exod. 12:38), ‘And a mixed multitude went up with them.’” But the other said, “Rabble can only be a Sanhedrin, since it is stated (in Numb. 11:16), ‘Gather (<i>esfah</i>) Me seventy men.’” What [else] is written there (in Numb. 11:1)? “Then the fire of the Lord burned against them and consumed them in the outskirts (<i>qetseh</i>) of the camp,” [i.e.,] among the selected (<i>muqetsim</i>) in the camp. And where is it shown that those elders who went up onto the mountain were destroyed by fire? Where it is stated (in Ps. 106:18), “And fire broke out in their company ('<i>edah</i>),” since company ('<i>edah</i>) can only be a Sanhedrin as stated (in Numb. 15:24), “And it shall come to pass that if it was done [by mistake] away from the eyes of the congregation ('<i>edah</i>).”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e. the leaders of the congregation.

Now you might say, “What they wanted was flesh? Did it not come about that the manna became whatever they wanted inside of their mouths, as stated (in Ps. 106:15), ‘So He gave them what they asked for...’?” And in case you should say that they did not have oxen and cattle in the desert, has it not already stated (in Exod. 12:38), “And a mixed multitude went up with them and flocks and herds.” And in case you should say they ate them in the desert, is it not written (in Numb. 32:1), “Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had much livestock?” From here R. Simeon said, “It was not meat for which they lusted, since it says so (in Ps. 78:27), ‘And He rained down flesh (<i>she'er</i>) upon them like dust.’ Now <i>she'er</i> must denote illicit intercourse since it is stated (in Lev. 18:6), ‘None of you shall approach any close (<i>she'er</i>) relation to him.’ Ergo, it [really] says that they desired to permit illicit intercourse for themselves; and so it says (in Numb. 11:10), ‘Now Moses heard the people weeping for their families.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Yoma</i> 75a according to which they were weeping here because of the family relations with whom they were forbidden to have intercourse.</i> Thus when they desired such [relations] (ibid. cont.), “the Lord was very angry and it was bad in the eyes of Moses.” At that time Moses said to the Holy One, blessed be He, (in vs. 11), “’Why have you mistreated Your servant […]?’ In the past there was one with me who would bear the burden of Israel, but now I am alone.” Thus it is written (in vs. 14-15), “I am not able to bear [all] this people alone…. So if You are dealing like this with me, please truly kill me.” At that time the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “Appoint other elders instead of those elders.” It is so stated] (in vs. 16), “Gather Me seventy men.” (Numb. 11:17:) “Then I will come down and speak with you there.” [This verse is] to inform you that the day for appointing elders was as dear to the Holy One, blessed be He, as the day for the giving of Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numb. R. 15:25.</i> Thus it is stated (in Exod. 19:11), “for on the third day the Lord will come down”; and also (in Numb. 11:17) with reference to appointing the elders, “I will come down,” is written. To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had an orchard and hired a guard for it. Then he gave him the payment of a guard for him to guard the orchard. After a time the guard said to him, “I cannot guard all of it myself. Rather give me others to guard it with me.” The king said to him, “I have given the entire orchard into your keeping, and I have given you all the payment for guarding it; but now you would say to me, ‘Go and bring others to guard it with me.’ See I am bringing others to guard with you, but observe that I am not giving them their payment from what belongs to me. Rather it is from your payment which I have given you that they are receiving their payment.” Similarly did the Holy One, blessed be He, speak to Moses. When [Moses] said to Him, “I cannot [do everything] alone,” the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “I have given you understanding and knowledge to sustain<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>PRNS</i>. Cf. Gk.: <i>pronoos</i> (“prudent”).</i> My children. Moreover, I did not want others, simply so that you would have strength and knowledge and so that you would stand alone in that greatness. But now you are the one who wants others. Be aware that they will receive [payment], not from what is Mine, but from what is yours.” It is so stated (in Numb. 11:17.), “and I will set aside some of the spirit which is upon you and put it on them [...].” Nevertheless Moses did not lack anything. You should know that after forty years He said to Moses (in Numb. 27:18, 20), “Take Joshua ben Nun …. And put some of your glory upon him.” Then what is written about Joshua (in Deut. 34:9)? “Now Joshua ben Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom.” Why? (Ibid. cont.:) “Because Moses had laid his hands upon him.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “In this world [only] individuals have prophesied, but in the world to come all Israel shall become prophets.” It is so stated (in Joel 3:1), “And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out My spirit upon all flesh so that your sons and your daughters shall prophesy.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See also above Gen. 10:4; cf.

If, however, one desires to set sail from Tyre to Sidon, for example, it is permitted for one to set sail even on the Sabbath eve, because it is a known fact that one can go [there] while it is still daylight. Now these words concern agents with freedom of action; but in the case of agents for [carrying out] a commandment, it is permitted for [such a] one to set sail on whatever day he wants. Why? Because he is an agent for [carrying out] a commandment, and an agent for [carrying out] a commandment overrides the Sabbath.

Thus it is stated (in Josh. 2:1), “Then Joshua ben Nun sent two spies [from Shittim secretly, saying]….” Who were they? Our masters have taught, “These were Phinehas and Caleb.” They had gone and risked their lives in order to be successful in their mission. What is the implication of secretly (<i>heresh</i>), saying? That they made themselves out to be potters and cried, “Here are pots. Whoever wants [some], let him come and buy.” [Their ruse was] so that no one would notice them. Hence secretly (<i>heresh</i>) is written [in this verse, but] read it [as] clay (<i>heres</i>), (from which pots are made). [They had made themselves out to be potters] lest people say that they were spies. (Ibid., cont.:) “So they went and came to the house of a woman who was a harlot whose name was Rahab […].” She arose and received them. The king of Jericho became aware of them and heard that they had come to investigate the whole land, as stated (in vs. 2), “But it was told the king of Jericho [….].” When they came to look for them, what did Rahab do? She took them away to hide them. Phinehas said to her, “I am a priest, and the priests are comparable to the angels (<i>mal'akhim</i>), as stated (in Mal. 2:7), “For the lips of a priest preserve knowledge, and they seek Torah from his mouth, because he is a messenger (<i>mal'akh</i>) of the Lord of hosts.” Now an angel desiring [to be visible] is visible; and one desiring [to be invisible] is not visible. And the prophets are also comparable to angels. As so is it stated about Moshe (in Numb. 20:16), “and he sent a messenger (<i>mal'akh</i>) who brought us out of Egypt.” And was it an angel? And was he not Moses? Hence the prophets are likened to angels (<i>mal'akhim</i>). And so too is it stated (in Jud. 2:1), “An angel (<i>mal'akh</i>) of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim and said, ‘I brought you up from Egypt…” And was he not Phinehas? It is simply that from here [it is shown] that the prophets are called angels. And so do you find with the wife of Manoah, as she said (in Jud. 13:6), “A man of God came to me; he looked like an angel (<i>mal'akh</i>) of God, very frightening.” And it likewise states (in Hag. 1:13), “And Hagai, the messenger (<i>mal'akh</i>) of God, spoke in the mission of the Lord to the people, saying.” Hence you have learned that the prophets were called angels. And it likewise states (in II Chron. 36:16), “And they mocked the messengers of God and disdained His words.” Hence Phinehas said to her, “I am a priest, when I desire [to be visible] I am visible; and when I desire [to be invisible], I am not visible.

[This was] so that everyone would know the punishment for evil speech. [It was a warning] so that if they came to speak slander, they would consider what happened to Miriam; but even so, they did not desire to learn. It is therefore stated (in Is. 44:18), “They neither know nor understand.” Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, wrote [about] the sending out of the spies after the episode of Miriam. Ergo (in Is. 44:18), “They neither know nor understand; for their eyes are stuck shut so that they cannot see….” Another interpretation (of Numb. 13:2), “Send men for yourself”: Even though the Holy One, blessed be He, had said to Moses, “Send men for yourself,” it was not [the wish] of the Holy One, blessed be He, for them to go.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Numb. R. 16:7.</i> Why? Because the Holy One, blessed be He, had already told them [about] the superiority of the Land of Israel. It is so stated (in Deut. 8:7), “For the Lord your God is bringing you unto a good land.” Moreover, while they had been in Egypt, he had said to them (in Exod. 3:8), “I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians [and to bring them up out of that land unto a good and spacious land].” And Scripture states (in Exod. 13:21), “And the Lord went in front of them by day.” So what is the point of [saying] (in Numb. 13:2), “Send men?” It is simply that they wanted these words. When they reached [Israel's] borders, Moses had said to them (in Deut. 1:21), “See, the Lord your God has set the land before you, go and possess….” At that time Israel approached Moses, as stated (in vs. 22), “Then you all drew near unto me [and said, ‘Let us send men ahead of us to explore the land for us’].” This is what Ezra<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Sanh.</i> 93b, which also alludes to the book of Nehemiah under the name of Ezra.</i> said (in Neh. 9:17), “So they refused to listen and were unmindful of Your] wonders.” Now it says (in Numb. 10:33), “and the ark of the covenant of the Lord traveled ahead of them […].” And [yet] they said (in Deut. 1:22), “Let us send men ahead of us to explore the land for us.” [It is simply] that they did not believe. And similarly David said (in Ps. 78:10), “and they refused to follow His Torah.” R. Joshua says, “To what were they comparable? To a king who secured for his son a beautiful wife, the daughter of good and wealthy parents. The king said to him, ‘I have secured you a beautiful wife, the daughter of good and wealthy parents. There is no one like her in the whole world.’ The son said to him, ‘Let me go to see her,’ for he did not trust his father. Immediately the situation became ever more difficult for his father and it was bad for him. His father said, ‘What shall I do? If I say to him, “I am not showing her to you,” then he will say, “She is ugly.”’ For that reason he did not want to show her. Finally he said to him, ‘Look at her, so that you may know that I have not deceived you. But because you did not trust me, I swear that you shall not see her in your house. Instead I am giving her to your son.’ Now similarly did the Holy One, blessed be He, say to Israel, ‘The land is good,’ but they did not believe [Him]. They said (in Deut. 1:22), ‘Let us send men ahead of us.’ The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘If I prevent them, they will say, “The land is no good. For that reason He has not shown it to us.” Rather, they will only see it, for I swear that not one of them shall enter within it, but rather [only] their children.’ Thus it is stated (in Numb. 14:23, 31), ‘Surely they shall not see the land […]. But it is your children, who you said would be carried off, who will go….’’’ When they said to Moses (in Deut. 1:22), “Let us send men ahead of us,” Moses began to wonder. He said, “It is impossible for me to do something before I consult with the Holy One, blessed be He.” He went and consulted. He said to him, “Your children want thus and so.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “This is not the first time for them. While they were in Egypt, they jeered at Me, as stated (in Hos. 7:16), ‘this was their derision in the land of Egypt.’ They are accustomed to such [behavior]. I do not need this; as see, it is written (in Dan. 2:22), ‘He knows what is in the darkness, [and the light dwells with Him]’; I know what they are saying. But if you want, you yourself, ‘Send men for yourself.’” Where is it shown? Where it is written (in Numb. 13:16), “These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land.”"

At first (in Exod. 3:8), “I have come down to rescue them from the Egyptians”: I came down with thousands of thousands and multitudes of multitudes of angels for your sake, and I gave over to each one [of you] two angels. R. Johanan said, “One to strap on his armor and the other to place a crown upon his head.” Rav Huna said, “He clothed them with a regal tunic and the explicit name [of God] was engraved upon them.” All the days that it was in their hand, no bad thing could touch them, not an angel and not anything else. But when they sinned, Moses said to them (in Exod. 33:5), “Remove your adornment.” At that time (in Exod. 33:4), “The people heard this bad thing.” And it is written (in Exod. 33:6), “And the Children of Israel were stripped of their adornment from Mount Horev.” What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He brought the angel of death and said to him, “The whole world is in your power except for this nation that I have chosen.” The angel of death said to the Holy One, blessed be He, “I was created for nought in this world.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “I have created you so that you shall discern in every nation except for this nation, over which you do not have power.” He saw the advice that the Holy One, blessed be He, advised about them, that they should be alive and flourish, as stated (Deut. 4:4), “But you who cling to the Lord your God are all alive today.” And so too does it say (in Exod. 32:16), “The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God that was inscribed (<i>harut</i>) upon the tablets.” What is the meaning of <i>harut</i>?

R. Simeon ben Johay said, “As so is it written (in Gen. 22:16), ‘and you have not withheld your son, your only one.’ See, [‘your son’] has already specified Isaac. [So] what is the meaning of ‘your only one?’ It is to imply Abraham's life. Thus the soul is called only one, where it is stated (in Ps. 22:21) ‘Deliver my life from the sword, [my only one from the power of the dog].’” Abraham said to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Is it possible for me to go from here with no sacrifice?” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Abraham, “Here is your sacrifice. [It has been] prepared for you from the six days of creation.” (According to Gen. 22:13), “Then Abraham lifted his eyes to look, and there was a ram […].” As so did our masters teach, “The ram of Abraham was created from the six days of creation on the Sabbath eve at twilight.” So at that time, Abraham took it and (according to Gen 22:13, cont.) “he offered it up as a burnt offering in place of his son.” Once it said, “he offered it up as a burnt offering,” was the verse missing anything? [So] what is the meaning of “in place of his son?” At that time Abraham said to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the world, see that I am slaughtering the ram; You should so see it as if my son is slaughtered in front of You.” When he took its blood, he said, “You should so see it as if the blood of Isaac is sprinkled before You.” When he took the ram and flayed it, he said to Him, “You should so see it as if Isaac is flayed in front of You on the altar.” When he burnt it, he said to Him, “You should so see it as if his ashes were gathered in front of You on the altar.” [Once it said,] “he offered it up as a burnt offering,” was the verse missing anything? [So] what is the meaning of “in place of his son?” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “By your life, it is your son that is sacrificed first, but it is simply that this ram is after him.” At that time Abraham said to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the world, I am not moving from here until You swear to me that You will never test me again; for if, heaven forbid, I had not obeyed you, I should have destroyed everything I had accomplished during my lifetime.” R.

Thus it is stated (in Gen. 22:16), “And he said, ‘I by Myself have sworn,’ says the Lord.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “By your life, severe afflictions and other trials had been designated to come upon you, but now they shall not come.” These were the same afflictions which came upon Job.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>ySot.</i> 5:8 (or 5) (20c); Gen.

Because blue resembles the sea; the sea resembles the firmament; and the firmament resembles the throne of glory. And from seeing it, he will remember his Creator” Thus it is stated (in Exod. 24:10), “And they saw the God of Israel, and under His feet there was something like brickwork of sapphire, like the heavens themselves for brightness.” (Numb. 15:39:) “So it shall be a tassel for you.” Thus it should be visible.

So that you may remember.” The seeing leads to remembering [the commandments], and remembering leads to performing [them]. Thus it is stated (in vs. 40), “So that you may remember and perform all My commandments.” Why? (Deut. 32:47), “Because it is not a trifling thing for you.” To what is this comparable? To a homeowner who was evaluating his taxes, and writing settlements. His father said to him, “My son, be careful with the settlements, as your life is dependent upon them.” So did the Holy One, blessed be He, say to Israel (in Deuteronomy 32:47), “Because it is not a trifling thing for you.” (Numb. 15:39:) \"So that you do not follow your heart.” The heart and the eyes are procurers for the body, in that they prostitute the body.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numb.

[But if] you withdraw from the commandments and do sins, you immediately become profaned. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “In this world because of the evil drive, you withdraw from the commandments; [but] in the future to come I am rooting it out of you.” Thus it is stated (in Ezek. 36:26–27), “then I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.

In the case of a house which is full of [scriptural] books, what is the rule about it being exempt it from [having] the mezuzah (which contains only two passages of scripture)?” [Moses] said to him, “[Such a house] is required to have the mezuzah.” [Korah] said to him, “Since the whole Torah has two hundred and seventy-five <i>parashiot</i> in it<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>yShab.</i> 16:1 (15c); <i>Soferim</i> 16:10; M.

Rather you are inventing them [by taking them] out of your own heart.” Here is what is written (in Numb. 16:1), “Now Korah […] took.” (Numb. 16:1:) “Now Korah […] took.” Now “took (rt.: lqh)” can only be a word of discord, in that his heart carried him away (rt.: <i>lqh</i>). Thus is [the word] used (in Job 15:12), “How your heart has carried you away (rt.: <i>lqh</i>) […].” This explains what Moses said to them (in Numb. 16:9), “Is it too small a thing for you that the God of Israel has separated you [from the congregation to draw you near unto Himself, to perform the service of the Lord's tabernacle …?” Plus] that whole passage up to (vs. 29), “If these people die the common death of every person.” The sages have said, “Korah was a great sage and was one of the bearers of the ark, as stated (in Numb. 7:9), ‘But to the children of Kohath He gave no [wagons], because they had the service of the holy objects, which they carried on their shoulders.’” Now Korah was the son of Izhar, [who was] the son of Kohath. When Moses said (in Numb. 15:38), “And put on the tassel of each corner a thread of blue,” what did Korah do? He immediately ordered them to make two hundred and fifty blue shawls for those two hundred and fifty heads of <i>sanhedraot</i> who rose up against Moses to wrap themselves in, just as it is stated (in Numb. 16:2), “And they rose up against Moses, together with two hundred and fifty men from the children of Israel.” And who are they?

R. Nathan said, “The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘If all the magicians of Egypt gathered together and tried to turn the morning into the evening and the evening into morning, they would be unable [to do so]; but just as I [formerly] separated the light and the darkness (in Gen. 1:4), so have I separated out Aaron to sanctify him in the holy of holies.’” Immediately (in Numb. 16:12), “Then Moses sent to summon [Dathan and Abiram…, but they said, ‘We will not come up.’” \"We will not go\" or \"We will not come\" is not written here, but “We will not come up.” (Prov. 18:17:) “A fool's mouth is his ruin!” They opened their mouth for a calamity, by saying that they would die by going down and not going up. Just as they spoke, so did they die (according to Numb. 16:33), “So they and all that belonged to them went down alive to Sheol.” Moses said, “In as much as they did not want to come [to me], I shall go to them. Perhaps they will be ashamed and repent.” It is so stated (in Numb. 16:25), “Then Moses arose and went unto Dathan and Abiram.” When they saw him they began to curse and blaspheme, as stated (in vs. 27), “and Dathan and Abiram came out standing (rt.: <i>ntsb</i>).” Does one go out sitting, kneeling, or lying prostrate?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The point here is that to mention that Dathan and Abiram were standing seems unnecessary and therefore implies some deeper meaning.</i> It is simply that it is to teach that they went out cursing and blaspheming.

As anyone who [even] aids dissension, the Holy One, blessed be He, eradicates his memory.

Even though there is no eating and no drinking, it is simply because of us [that we are forbidden to enter] as we have taken food and drink.” Another interpretation (of Numb. 16:5), “In the morning.” Moses said, “The Holy One, blessed be He, has distinguished boundaries for those in His world. Can you confuse morning with evening? And that is what is written in the beginning (in Gen. 1:5), ‘There was evening and there was morning.’ And (in vs. 4) ‘God separated the light and the darkness,’ for its use in the world. And just as he made a separation between the light and the darkness, so did he separate Israel from the nations, [as stated] (in Lev. 20:26), ‘I have separated you from the [other] peoples to be Mine.’ So also did he separate Aaron, as stated (in I Chron. 23:13), ‘Aaron was separated to consecrate the most holy things.’ If you can confuse those distinctions in which he made a separation between the day and the night, you may be able to nullify this.” For this reason he said to them (in Numb. 16:5), “In the morning the Lord will make known [those who belong to Him].” Such a one is already designated; (according to ibid., end) “the one whom He will choose He will have draw near unto Him.” (Numb. 16:6:) “Do this; take censers, [Korah and all his company].” What was his reason for saying this to them?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numb.

But a deadly poison had been put within it, through which Nadab and Abihu were burned. He therefore warned them (in vs. 7, cont.), “then it shall come to pass that the man whom the Lord chooses is the holy one,” And do we not know that the one that the Lord chooses is the holy one? It is simply that Moses said to them, “See, I am telling you that you are not to incur guilt on your two hundred and fifty souls, because when you sacrifice, [only] the one to be chosen from among you shall come out alive, and all [the rest] of you shall perish.” (Numb. 16:7:) “You Levites have gone too far!” See, I have told you a great thing! Were they not fools, in that when he gave them this warning, they took it upon themselves to offer sacrifice? They had sinned against their own lives, as stated (in Numb. 17:3), “The censers of these who have sinned at the cost of their lives.” Now since Korah was a clever man, how did he see fit to commit this folly? It is simply that his eyes misled him. He foresaw a great lineage stemming from himself, [e.g.,] Samuel, who was the equivalent of Moses and Aaron, as stated (in Ps. 99:6), “Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among those who call His name.” Moreover, the twenty-four [Levitical] shifts would stem from his descendants, all of whom would prophesy by the holy spirit, as stated (in I Chron. 25:5), “All these were sons of Heman,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A descendant of Korah.</i> the king's seer in matters pertaining to God for his greater glory.” He said, “Is it possible that, when this greatness is going to stem from me, I should perish?” But he did not foresee correctly, since his children would repent, and those [great ones] would stem from them. But Moses did foresee well. He therefore participated on this assumption, when he heard from the mouth of Moses that they all would perish, but one would escape, as stated (Numb. 16:7) “then it shall come to pass that the man whom the Lord chooses is the holy one.”"

When he saw that he did not listen to him, he said (to himself), “Before others join with him, they should reconsider.” He began to urge them (in Numb. 16:8), “’Please listen, you Children of Levi,’ is the honor that you have too little.” It is so stated (in vs. 9) “Is it too small a thing for you […]?” He turned again to Korah (in vs. 10), “That he has had you approach Him and all your brother Levites along with you?” [It was] because he was the head person in the tribe, that his brothers had become an extension of himself. (Numb. 16:11:) “Therefore you and all your company have come together against the Lord.” Is this dissension which you are creating against us? Is it not rather against the Holy One, blessed be He?

If he had made himself a freedman and taken this dignity for himself, it would have been well for them to rise up against him. Now that his master has acted for him, when anyone rises against him, is not such a one rising up against his master? So also did Moses say to them, “If my brother Aaron had taken the priesthood for himself, it would have been well for you to murmur against him. [But since] the one who gave it to him was the Holy One, blessed be He, to whom belong royalty, high office and power, whenever someone rises against my brother Aaron, is he not taking sides against the Holy One, blessed be He?” It is therefore written (in Numb. 16:11), “and as for Aaron, what is he that you murmur against him?” Come and see the piety of Aaron the righteous! When Moses stood Aaron up and poured the anointing oil upon his head, Aaron trembled with fear. He said to him, “Moses my brother, perhaps I was not worthy to be anointed with the anointing oil; for I may have acted fraudulently and become liable to excision, since it is stated (in Exod. 30:32), ‘Upon human flesh it shall not be poured.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lev.

It is like the precious oil upon the head running down onto the beard, the beard of Aaron […]; Like the dew of Hermon….” [Scripture] has compared the anointing oil with the dew of Hermon. As the dew of Hermon has no [rules concerning] fraudulent use, neither does the anointing oil that was on the head of Aaron have [rules concerning] fraudulent use. It is therefore written (in Numb. 16:1), “[Therefore you and all your company] have come together against the Lord.” With all these words Moses [tried to] appease Korah, but you do not find that he gave him any answer. Because he was clever in his wickedness, he said [to himself], “If I answer him, I know that, since he has great wisdom, he will now overwhelm me with his words and seduce me into being reconciled with him against my will. It is [hence] better that I not respond to him.” When Moses saw that there was nothing to be gained with him, he withdrew from him.

So they went down to Sheol, as stated (in Numb. 16:33), “So they and all that belonged to them went down alive to Sheol.” After they had gone down alive to Sheol, they died. (Numb. 16:13:) “Is it so small a matter that you have brought us up from a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the desert, [that you must also lord it over us]?” They said to him, “On what basis do you assume superiority over us? What good have you done with us? You brought us out of the land of Egypt, which was (according to Gen. 13:10) “like the garden of the Lord”; but you have not brought us into the land of Canaan. Rather here we are dying in the desert, where the plague is sent among us every day; (according to Numb. 16:14) ‘would you put out the eyes of these people….’” (Numb. 16:15:) “Now Moses was very angry.” He was very anguished.

[But] in as much as these have withdrawn from Your children, do not pay attention to their portion. Let the fire leave it alone and not consume it.” (Numb. 16:15, cont.:) “I have not taken one donkey from them.” That which I had [a right] to take I did not take. By universal custom, one who works in the sanctuary receives wages from the sanctuary. [In my case, however,] when I went down from Midian to Egypt I had a right to take a donkey from them, since it was on behalf of their needs that I was going down [there]; but I did not take [one]. Similarly also did Samuel the righteous say (in I Sam. 12:3), “Here am I, testify against me before the Lord and before His anointed; whose ox have I taken, or whose donkey have I taken?” When I sacrificed an ox for their offerings to seek mercy for them and likewise for anointing a king over them, it belonged to me, as stated (in I Sam. 16:2), “Take a heifer with you […].” And similarly it says (in I Sam. 9:12), “because the people have a sacrifice today at the high place (<i>bamah</i>).” But I took nothing from what belonged to them. Also when I sought to handle their lawsuits and their [other] needs, and when I made the circuit of the cities, as stated (in I Sam. 7:16), “And he went on a circuit year by year to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and he judged Israel in all those places;” [although] by universal custom litigants go to the judge, I went around from city to city and from place to place.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash is also making a point that he traveled on his own donkey.</i> Now even Moses said to Israel (in Exod. 18:16), “When they have a matter, it comes unto me.” But I (Samuel) did not act in this way. Instead I took the trouble to go to them. (Numb. 16:15, cont.:) “’And I have not harmed a single one of them,’ in that I neither convicted the innocent nor acquitted the guilty.” When Moses saw that they continued in their pride and in their rebellious acts, then (according to Numb. 16:16-18) “Moses said unto Korah, ‘[Tomorrow] you and all your company [are to be present before the Lord: [you, they, and Aaron]; And let each one take his censer […].’ So each one took his censer.” Then Korah went about all that night and led Israel astray. Now he would say to them, “What do you suppose? That I am busy obtaining greatness for myself? I wish for greatness to go the rounds to all of us, while Moses has taken kingship for himself and has given the high priesthood to his brother Aaron as an eternal statute.” So did he go about seducing each and every tribe as it suited them, until they joined him. How is it shown that when they entered and approached, they were all speaking? It is so stated (Numb. 16:19), “And Korah gathered all the congregation against them.” When they entered and came with him, immediately (we read in Numb. 16:20–21), “Then the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, ‘Separate yourselves from the midst of this evil congregation, [so that I may consume them in a moment].’” (Numb. 16:22:) “But they fell on their faces and said, ‘O God, the God of all human spirits, [shall one person sin and You become angry with the whole congregation]?’” They said to him,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numb.

[The significance of the letters in the name,] Yitschak [is as follows]: <i>Yod</i> [with a numerical count of ten] corresponds to the ten trials [of Avraham]. [The letter] <i>tsadi</i> [with a numerical count of ninety, as] Sarah was ninety when he was born. [The letter] <i>chet</i> [with a numerical count of eight, as] he was circumcised on the eighth day. And the letter <i>kof</i> [with a numerical count of one hundred, as] Avraham was a hundred years old when he was born. Yaakov was called according to [the significance of the letters of] his [own] name: <i>Yod</i> [corresponds to] the tenth of his offspring going backwards, Levi. Count from (the last son), Binaymin to Levi - there are ten sons, and Levi was the tenth. And he gave him as a tithe to the Omnipresent to fulfill [what he said] (Genesis 28:22), \"all that You give to me, I will surely tithe it to You.\" [The letter] <i>ayin</i> [with a numerical count of seventy corresponds to the number of offspring he took to Egypt], \"with seventy souls\" (Deuteronomy 10:22). <i>Kof</i> corresponds to the [number of the] letters of the blessing [that he received], \"And may He give you [etc.]\" (Genesis 27:28). Take away the name [of God] from there, and one hundred [letters] remain. [The letter] <i>bet</i> [with a numerical count of two] corresponds to two angels [that he saw on the ladder in his dream] rising. Yehudah was called according to [the significance of the numerical count of the letters of] his [own] name: Thirty, corresponding to the thirty virtues of the monarchy. There were six hundred and thirteen letters on the tablets - from \"I am\" (Exodus 20:2) to \"to your neighbor\" (Exodus 20:14) - corresponding to the six hundred and thirteen commandments. And they were all given to Moshe at [Mount] Sinai; and in them are statutes and judgments, Torah and Mishnah, Talmud and aggadah. \"The fear of the Lord is his treasure\" (Isaiah 33:6). There is no greater characteristic than fear and humility, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 10:12), \"And now Israel, what does the Lord, your God, ask of you [besides to fear Him].\" \"The fear of\" (<i>Yirat</i>) has a numerical value of six hundred and eleven; along with Torah and circumcision, behold that is six hundred and thirteen. [The numerical value of] fringes (<i>tsitsit</i>) is six hundred. [Add] eight strings and five knots, behold that is six hundred and thirteen. \"[The man (David)] raised on high\" (II Samuel 23:1) - [high (al)] has a numerical value of one hundred, corresponding to one hundred blessings. As on every day, one hundred men of Israel were dying. [So] David and ordained [the daily saying of] one hundred blessings. \"And now Israel, what (<i>mah</i>) does the Lord, your God, ask of you\" - read it as one hundred (<i>meah</i>), these are the hundred blessings. Once he ordained it, the pestilence ceased. \"This is the law of the burnt-offering (<i>olah</i>), it is the burnt-offering\" (Leviticus 6:2), [meaning] the yoke (<i>ulah</i>) of Torah and the yoke of repentance. \"Two anointed ones\" (Zechariah 4:14). These are David and Aharon who were anointed with the anointing oil, such that their anointing was for [all] the generations. With Aharon, it is written (Numbers 25:13), \"It shall be for him and his descendants after him, a pact of priesthood for all time.\" With David it is written (Ezekiel 37:25), \"and My servant David as their prince for all time.\" \"Forgive all guilt and take the good (<i>tov</i>)\" (Hosea 14:3). Israel said, \"Master of the world, at the time that the Temple existed, we would offer a sacrifice and be cleansed. But now all we have in our hand is prayer.\" The numerical value of <i>tov</i> is seventeen. Prayer [consists of] nineteen [blessings]. Take away from them the blessing for the malfeasers that was composed at Yavneh, and \"Let the sprout of David blossom,\" which they ordained for the sake of \"Probe me, Lord, and try me\" (Psalms 26:2). Rabbi Simon says, \"'Forgive all guilt and take the good (<i>tov</i>).' The numerical value of <i>tov</i> in <i>at-bash</i> (matching letters based on how close they are to the center of the alphabet) is [the same as] soul (<i>nefesh</i>). Israel said, 'Behold the fat from us, from our souls. May it be Your will that it be atonement for us and \"that we pay with the words of our lips\" (Hosea 14:3).'\" \"And the Lord gave her conception (<i>herayon</i>)\" (Ruth 4:13). [<i>Herayon</i>] has a numerical value of the [number of the] days of the nine months of birthing (two hundred and seventy one). The name of the angel that is appointed for conception is night, as stated (Job 3:3), \"and the night [that it was] said, 'A man was conceived.\" The measure of the water of a mikveh (ritual bath) is forty <i>seah</i> corresponding to the [forty mentions] of well, written in the Torah. And [the volume of] how many eggs is the measure of the mikveh? Five thousand seven hundred and sixty. And a <i>seah</i> is a hundred and forty-four eggs. Forty-three and a fifth eggs is the measure of [what is required for] <i>hallah</i> [tithe]. And from where [do we know] that a mikveh requires forty <i>seah</i>? As it is written (Isaiah 8:6), \"Since this nation has rejected the waters of Shiloach that flow gently (<i>le'at</i>).\" The numerical value of <i>le'at</i> is forty. Behold the measure of a <i>seah</i> is a <i>tefach</i> by  a <i>tefach</i> with the height of [sixteen] <i>tefach</i> [and a fifth]. And one who separates the  measure of the <i>hallah</i> [tithe] must separate [one part in forty three] and a fifth [from Torah writ like the numerical value of <i>hallah</i>]. Forty lashes (which are actually thirty-nine) is from Torah writ, as it is written (Exodus 35:1), \"These (<i>eleh</i>) are the things which the Lord commanded.\" [The numerical count of] \"<i>eleh</i>\" is thirty-six; \"things\" (being plural) is two; \"the things\" [indicates an additional] one - behold, forty minus one (thirty-nine). \"He shall strike him forty, he shall not add\" (Deuteronomy 25:3), corresponds to the forty curses received by the snake, Chava, Adam and the ground, and the sages lessened one, because of \"he shall not add.\" A Sanhedrin is twenty-three, so [that it is possible for] those advocating innocence to have one more (than twenty), and those advocating guilt to have two more. It is best for the two to come and push off one. The numerical value of anathmea (<i>cherem</i>) is two hundred and forty-eight. And Shmuel said, when it takes force it takes force on [all] two hundred and forty-eight organs, and when it leaves, it leaves from two hundred and forty-eight limbs, as it is written (Habakuk 3:2), \"in anger, remember to have mercy (<i>rachem</i>, which is made up of the same letters as <i>cherem</i>).\" It is written,\"<i>tirash</i>,\" but we read it [as] <i>tirosh</i>. [If] he merits, he becomes a <i>rosh</i> (leader); [if] he does not merit, he becomes a <i>rash</i> (poor person). Our rabbis, may their memory be blessed said, \"A man is recognized by three things: by his purse, by his glass and by his anger. Tavel is Ramaliah. Seshach is Bavel (Babylon) [according to] its numerical value of  in <i>at-bash</i>. The numerical value of Gog and Magog is seventy, as they are the seventy nations [of the world]."

For various definitions, see Jastrow, p. 977, s.v. <i>SYT</i>.</i> it has so many springs (from '<i>yn</i>); yet they do not mingle with one another. The waters of the eyes ('<i>yn</i>) are salty; the waters of the ears are oily; the waters of the nose are putrid; the waters of the mouth are sweet. For what reason are the waters of the eyes salty? Because when someone weeps for the dead, [doing so] all the time, he would immediately become blind; however, because [tears] are salty, he stops and does not weep. For what reason are the waters of the ears oily? Because when a person hears bad news, if he held it in his ears, it would collect in his heart, and he would die. Because they are oily, [the news] goes in one ear and out the other.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, “[A person] admits [bad news] through one [ear], and discharges it through the other.”</i> For what reason are the waters of the nose putrid? Because when a person smells a bad odor, if the waters of the nose were not putrid [enough] to stop it, he would soon die. And for what reason are the waters of the mouth sweet? It sometimes happens that someone eats food that does not agree with him, and he vomits. Now if the waters of the mouth were not sweet, he would not recover. Moreover, since he reads the Torah, of which it is written (in Ps. 19:11), “sweeter also than honey and the drippings of the comb,” the waters of the mouth are therefore sweet. Now here are the grounds for arguing a fortiori (<i>qal wehomer</i>), that if [something the size of] a full <i>sit</i> has so many springs [without them mingling with one another], how much the more so in the case of the Great Sea, of which it is stated (in Ps. 104:25), “There the sea is great and wide […].” [This is] to teach that in everything, the Holy One, blessed be He, accomplishes His mission and that He has not created one thing in vain. Sometimes the Holy One, blessed be He, has accomplished His mission by means of a frog, by means of a gnat,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Lev. R. 22:2-3; Eccl.

Then that scorpion went and stung [the] person so that he died. [There is] also a story about a certain reaper who stood and reaped in the valley of Beth-Kuzevah. When burning heat came, he took grass and tied it on his head. [When] a certain mighty serpent came at him, he killed it. A certain [snake] charmer passed by him. He saw the slain serpent. He said to him, ‘Who killed that serpent?’ [So the reaper] said to him ‘I [did].’ He looked at the grass on his head. He [then] said to him, ‘Remove the grass from your head and [then you can brag (if you still have that power)].’ When he did so, [the charmer] drew near. He had not succeeded in touching him, before [the reaper’s] body parts [all] shed.” R. Jannay was sitting as a judge at the gate of his city, [when] he saw a serpent hissing and coming toward the city. When they would secure against it in one place, it would go to another. He said, “It seems to me that this [serpent] is on its way to carry out its mission.” When it entered the city, a rumor spread in the city, “So-and-so ben so-and-so was bitten by a serpent and he is dead.” R. Elazar was strolling by the seashore of Caesarea. He found a femur bone strewn on the path. [So] he removed it from there, but he found it there again; he removed it from there [a second time] and found it there again. He said, “It seems to me that this [bone] is arranged to carry out its mission.” After [some] days, a minister came and fell over it and died. They looked into him and found evil documents against the Jews in his hand. There is a story about two people who were walking on the way. One who could see, and one was blind. They sat down to eat. They reached out their hands for the herbs of the field and ate. The one who could see became blind, and the one who had been blind became sighted. They did not move from there until the former was being supported by the latter whom he had been supporting. There is a story about a certain person who was going from the land of Israel to Babylon.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lev. R. 22:4.</i> While he was eating, he saw two birds fighting with each other. One of them killed its companion. Then going to get an herb, [it placed it on its mouth,] and made it live again. That person (the one who saw what had happened) went and took the very herb that had fallen from the bird. Then he went to make the dead live with it. When he arrived at the Ladder of Tyre,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A well-known landing dock four hours north of Tyre.

Then let us see who overcomes.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “O you wicked one, son of a wicked one, I am sending against you a tiny creature, the least of My creatures, to eradicate you from the world.” A gnat entered his nostril, and stayed in his nostril for three years. When he passed by a place where blacksmiths were working [and the gnat] heard the sound of iron, it was still. Whenever a gentile [blacksmith] would pass him, [Titus] would hire him for four dinars and say to him, “Bang your hammer in front of me the whole day.” And when he would do this the whole day, [Titus] would give him his four dinars. But when a Jewish [blacksmith] passed him, he would say to him, “Take [your hammer] and bang it [here] and I will give you your wage.” And he would bang the whole day. [But] when he was about to leave him and the Jew would say to [Titus], “Give me my wage,” he would answer and say to him, “It is enough for you that you see your enemy like this.” So would he do every day for three years. When he died they split open his head and found that [the gnat had grown] to be like a partridge and a sparrow and its claws were as hard as copper. And he died an unnatural death. Why is it named a base creature? Because it takes in but does not excrete. Moreover, sometimes it is by means of a hornet [that God's will is carried out]. Thus it is written (in Exod. 23:28), “I will send the hornet before you [to drive out the Hivites, the Canaanites, and the Hittites from before you].” Our masters have said, “When the Holy One, blessed be He, sent the hornet before Israel to kill the Amorites, see what was written about them (in Amos 2:9), “Yet I destroyed the Amorites [before them, whose stature was like the cedars in height and who were as strong as the oaks].” It entered one's right eye and poured out its poison in it. Then [that person] burst open and dropped dead. This indeed is the way of the Holy One, blessed be He, to carry out His missions by means of small things against all who vaunt themselves against Him. He sends them a small creature to exact punishment from them, in order to inform them that there is no substance to their might. Also in the world to come the Holy One, blessed be He, is going to exact punishment from the [idol-worshiping] peoples of the world by means of small things. It is so stated (in Is. 7:18–19), “And it shall come to pass on that day that the Lord shall whistle for the fly. They all shall come […].”"

As it is forbidden for Israel to cook with them, until each and every piece has been purged, as stated (in Numb. 31:23), “Each thing that will withstand the fire [you shall pass through the fire, and it shall be clean].” The spits and the grills<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>escharai.</i></i> which gentiles have used are not permitted until they have come into the fire, as we are taught (in '<i>AZ</i> 5:12), “In the case of a skewer and a grill, one makes them white hot in the fire.” For how long does one make them white hot?

In the case of a pot into which the head of a free-flying sparrow cannot enter, one need not purge it, as stated (in '<i>AZ</i> 38b), “When [concerning] the date solids of gentiles, if they are heated in a large pot, they are forbidden.

Also in the case of a spoon, it is necessary to place it inside of a caldron, and it is purged. In the case of plates, one uses them as a second utensil (a utensil in which food is served, and not one in which it is cooked). If one has taken water from a caldron and poured it over them, it is considered sufficient; but although one has purged them, it is necessary to [also] immerse them in water.

New ones need no immersion. Old ones are not purgeable, as we find in the case of the sin offering (according to Lev. 6:21), ‘But an earthen vessel in which it (the sin offering) was boiled shall be broken.’” However, it is necessary to [ask about] these plates with a glaze,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Qonya</i>; cf. the Gk.: <i>konia</i> (“dust”).</i> which are used with boiling leavened foods. Is there a purging for them or not? For while they were earthen vessels originally, one coated them with glaze. [Is it that] that glaze seal is a shield, so that the clay does not absorb, because glaze is [like] metal, and purging is sufficient for it.

                "R. Isaac began [his discourse] (with Eccl. 7:23), “All this I tested with wisdom; I thought I could fathom it, but it eludes me.” It is written (in I Kings 5:9), “So God gave Solomon wisdom and discernment in great measure, with understanding....” R. Johanan said a parable in the name of R. Simeon ben Yehozedek, “This is comparable to a king who had a friend, and the king loved him exceedingly. The king said to him, ‘Ask me anything you want and I will give it to you.’ And that friend was very wise. He said [to himself], ‘If I ask him to make me a duke, it [alone] will come to me. If I ask him to make me a duke, it [alone] will come to me.” Rather I will ask him for something that is attached to all the advantages.’ Immediately he answered and said to the king, ‘Since you asked that I should ask for something in front of you, I am asking from you that you marry off your daughter to me.’ The king said, ‘By your life, I want this. Behold my daughter is [given] into your house.’ So [too] at the time that the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Solomon (in I Kings 3:5), ‘Ask what I should give to you,’ Solomon said [to himself], ‘What shall I ask; If I ask for silver and gold, it [alone] will come to me. If I ask for the monarchy, it [alone] will come to me. Rather I will ask for something that is attached to all the things.’ Immediately he said in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, ‘Master of the World, I only request from you wisdom.’ [Then] the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, ‘You have asked well in asking for wisdom, as all the things are attached to it. Silver and gold are attached to it, as stated (in Prov. 8:19), “My fruit is better than gold, fine gold, and my produce than choice silver.” Monarchy is attached to it, as stated (in Prov. 8:15), “Through me kings reign.” Behold everything is given to you.’” Hence it is written (in I Kings 5:9), “So God gave Solomon wisdom,” as He gave him wisdom as a gift. (I Kings 5:9, cont.:) “As vast as the sand of the sea.” The rabbis say, “[This] teaches that He gave him as much wisdom as all Israel, who are compared to the sand, as stated (in Hos. 2:1), ‘The number of the Children of Israel shall be like that of the sands of the sea.’ How is this? The sages have knowledge, the elders of knowledge and the children have knowledge, but they are different, one from the other. And [so] if all of Israel would be on one side and Solomon on the other side, his wisdom would be greater than theirs.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numb. R. 19:3; Eccl. R. 7:23:1; <i>PRK</i> 4:3; <i>PR</i> 14:8.</i> R. Levi said, “Just as sand is a wall and a fence for [the sea], that it not go out and flood the world; so that his wisdom stand in front of his [evil] impulse, that he not sin.” The proverb says, “If you lack knowledge, what have you gained? If you have gained knowledge, what do you lack?” Like (in Prov. 25:28) “A city broken into with no walls,” so “is a person who does not restrain his spirit.” (I Kings 5:10:) “Now Solomon's wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the East.” And what was the wisdom of the peoples of the East?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Gen. 7:24; <i>PR</i> 14:9.</i> [In that] they knew about astrology and were astute at divination (from birds). Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel said, “I like three things about the people of the East: They do not kiss on the mouth, but only on the hand; When they cut meat, they cut only with a knife and not on the back of the hand; And when they take counsel, they take it only in the field.<br>It is therefore stated (in Gen. 31:4), ‘So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field where his flock was.’” (I Kings 5:10, cont.:) “From all the wisdom of Egypt.” What was the wisdom of Egypt? You find that when Solomon wanted to build the Temple, he sent to Pharaoh Necho and said to him, “Send me craftsmen [to work] for a wage, for I want to build the Temple.” What did Pharaoh do? He gathered all his astrologers<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>astrologoi.</i></i> and said to them, “Foresee which people are going to die this year and send them to him. So that I can come to him with a grievance and say to him, ‘Give me the value of the craftsmen that you killed.’” When they came to Solomon, he foresaw through the holy spirit that they would die during that year. He [therefore] gave them shrouds and sent them [back] to [Pharaoh]. He sent to him, saying, “Do you not have shrouds to bury your dead? Here they are for you with their shrouds. Go and bury your dead.” Hence it is stated, (I Kings 5:10, cont.) “from all the wisdom of Egypt.” (I Kings 5:11:) “And he was wiser than any man, than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, Chalkol, and Darda the sons of Mahol.” “Wiser than any man (literally, than all of Adam),” than the first Adam. And what was his wisdom? You find that, when the Holy One, blessed be He, wanted to create the first Adam, he consulted with the ministering angels. He said to them (in Gen. 1:26), “Let us make humankind (<i>Adam</i>) in Our image.” They said to him (in Ps. 8:5), “What is a human that You are mindful of him?” He said to them, “This Adam that I want to create Adam shall have wisdom greater than yours.” What did He do? He gathered all cattle, wild beasts, and fowl pass before them. He said to them, “What are the names of these [beings]?” They, however, did not know. When He had created Adam, He made them pass before him. He said to him, “What are the names of these [beings]?” He said, “It is fitting to call this one an ox, this one a lion, this one a horse, [...]” and so on for all of them. It is so stated (in Gen. 2:20), “So Adam recited names for all the cattle.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The understanding of the midrash is that the creatures implicitly already possessed names.</i> He said to him, “And you, what is your name?” Adam said to him, “Adam, because I was created out of the ground (<i>adamah</i>).” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “I, what is My name?” He said to him, “The Lord, because you are Lord over all creatures,” namely as written (in Is. 42:8), “I am the Lord, that is My name,” which the first Adam gave me.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Lev. 3:11.</i> “That is my name,” the one which I have agreed to [for use] between Me and My creatures.

I hear a language I had not known.” (I Kings 5:11, cont.:) “Darda (<i>drd</i>')].” This is the generation (<i>dor</i>) of the desert, which had knowledge (<i>de'ah</i>).

Solomon merely said, “For what reason is a leper cleansed through the tallest among the trees (the cedar) and through the lowest of the low (the hyssop); through (according to Lev. 14:4) cedar wood, [crimson stuff,] and hyssop?’ It is simply because he had exalted himself like the cedar, that he was stricken with leprosy. As soon as he humbled himself like the hyssop, he was therefore cured through hyssop”. (I Kings 5:13, cont.:) “He also spoke with/concerning ('<i>al</i>) the cattle and the fowl.” Is it possible that [a person] would speak with cattle and with fowl? Rather [the passage is concerned with] why the cattle are permitted [as food] with [the cutting of] two organs<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>semeia</i> (“signs,” “omens”).</i> (the gullet and the windpipe); but the fowl, with [the cutting of] one organ (i.e., the gullet or the windpipe).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">75</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hul</i>. 2:1; <i>Hul.</i> 27b.</i> Because cattle were created from the dry land, as stated (in Gen. 1:14), “Let the earth bring forth the living creatures after its kind, cattle, creeping things,” they are permitted with two organs.

Solomon merely said, “For what reason do cattle, beasts, and birds require ritual slaughtering, while fish do not require ritual slaughtering?” Jacob the man of Kefar Gibburayya taught in Tyre with respect to fish, that they do require ritual slaughtering. When R. Haggai heard, he sent for him to come. He said to him, “On what basis did you decide this?” He said to him, “From here (in Gen. 1:20), ‘Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let the fowl fly.’ Just as fowl require ritual slaughtering, so do the fish require ritual slaughtering.” He said to them (i.e., those standing by), “Lay him down to receive lashes.” He said to him, “Shall a person who speaks words of Torah be lashed?” He said to him, “You did not decide [the law] well.” He said to him, “On what basis?” He said to him, “From here (in Numb. 11:22), ‘Are there enough flocks and herds to slaughter for them; are there enough fish in the sea to gather for them?’ The former require ritual slaughtering, while the latter [is taken] through gathering.” He said to him, “Give [me] your beating, as it is good for retention.” And again did Jacob the man of Kefar Gibburayya teach in Tyre, [this time] with respect to an Israelite man, who came upon a foreign woman and had her bear him a son, that he should be circumcised on the Sabbath. When R. Haggai heard, he sent for him to come. He said to him, “On what basis do you hold this?” He said to him, “[From this which is written] (in Numb. 1:18) ‘then they registered their lineages according to their families according to the house of their fathers.’” He said to them (i.e., those standing by), “Lay him down to receive lashes.” He said to him, “Shall a person who speaks words of Torah be lashed?” He said to him, “You did not decide [the law] well.” He said to him, “Where is it shown?” He said to him, “Lie down and listen.” He said to him, “If one of the gentiles came to you in order to become a proselyte on condition that you circumcise him on the Sabbath day or on the Day of Atonement, would you profane the Sabbath on account of him or not?” He said to him, “One does not profane the Sabbath or the Day of Atonement for him but only for the son of an Israelite woman.” He said to him, “On what basis do you hold this?” He said to him (in Ezra 10:3), “So now let us make a covenant with our God to put away all (foreign) wives and (anyone] born of them […].” He said to him, “Would you lash me on the basis of [a non-Mosaic text]?” He said to him, “It is written (ibid.), ‘let it be done [according to] the Torah.’” He said to him, “From which [piece of] Torah?” He said to him, “From that of R. Johanan, when he said in the name of R. Simeon ben Johay, ‘It is written (in Deut. 7:3), “You shall not intermarry with them; do not give your daughters to their sons.” Why?

They began to say, “Moses knows the natural properties of rock. If he wants, he will bring forth water out of this [other] one.” Moses found himself confronted with a dilemma: If he would listen to them, he would disregard the words of the Omnipresent; and the Holy One, blessed be He, (according to Job 5:13) “Catches the wise in their own cunning.” As for the whole of these forty years Moses had been keeping himself from becoming angry with them, because he was afraid of the oath that the Holy One, blessed be He, had sworn (in Deut. 1:35), “Not one of these people from this evil generation shall see [the good land].” They said to him, “Here is a rock. Just as you wish to bring [water] from another rock, you should bring it from this one.” He gave a command to them (in Numb. 20:10), “Please listen, you rebels, shall we bring forth [water for you] from this rock.” What is the meaning of “<i>hamorim</i> (rebels)?” There are many understandings of it. <i>Hamorim</i> is rebels; <i>hamorim </i>is fools, as in the islands of the sea they call fools, <i>morim</i>.

They said to him, “Son of Amram, is this water for nursing children or for babes weaned from milk?” Immediately, he became angry with them, struck it (according to Numb. 20:11) “twice [with his rod], and a lot of water came forth.” Yet for all that, Moses only made [water] from the rock that the Holy One, blessed be He, had told him. And how do we see that they also brought out water from the rock that Israel had said to him and every rock and stone that was in that place?

This [was Amalek, since it is stated (in Numb. 13:29), “Amalek dwells in the land of the Negeb.” Now he dwelt in the gap (in the border), and when he heard that Aaron was dead and that the clouds of glory had departed, he immediately engaged them in battle. (Numb. 21:1, cont.:) “By way of Atharim (a place name interpreted as coming from <i>twr</i>),”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The actual root is ’<i>TR</i>.</i> [meaning] the great scout (rt.: <i>twr</i>) that had scouted (rt.: <i>twr</i>) the way for them.

[So] why did [Scripture] call him a Canaanite? Because Israel was forbidden to fight with the children of Esau, of whom it is stated (in Deut. 2:5), “Do not engage them in battle [...].” When Amalek came and engaged in battle with them a second time, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, “This [nation] is not forbidden like the children of Esau. Just look. They are like Canaanites, of whom it is stated (in Deut. 20:17), ‘Rather you shall utterly destroy them, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, […].’” For that reason he was called a Canaanite; and from time immemorial Amalek has been a strap for the punishment of Israel. You find that when they said (in Exod. 17:7), “Is the Lord amongst us or not,” immediately (in Exod. 17:8), “And Amalek came.” And here (in Numb. 20:29:) “Then all the congregation saw that Aaron had died,” [is followed by (Numb 21:1),] “When the Canaanite, king of Arad, who dwelt in the Negeb, learned that Israel was coming by the way of Atharim, he engaged Israel in battle and took some of them captive.” [And also (in Numb. 14:4),] “And they said – one man to his brother – let us appoint a head and return to Egypt,” [is followed by (Numb. 14:45),] “And the Amalekites and the Canaanites... came down and dealt them a shattering blow at Hormah.” You find that, when Aaron died, Amalek went out against them; and Israel retreated back seven stages [of their journey]. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 10:6), “Then from the wells of Bene-Jaakan the Children of Israel journeyed to Moserah; there Aaron died.” Did Aaron die there?

That is why the people grew restive on the journey. These are the ones that grumbled (in Numb. 21:5), “Our soul loathes.” (Numb. 21:6:) “Then the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people.” Why did the Holy One, blessed be He, see fit to exact retribution from them through serpents?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numb.

Thus it is stated (in Is. 65:25), “but the serpent's food shall be dust.” Now these people ate the manna, as stated (in Ps. 106:15), “So He gave them what they asked for,” and (in Ps. 78:29), “He gave them their desire.” It also says (in Deut. 2:7), “these forty years the Lord your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">125</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., no luxury foods.</i> Let a serpent that eats many species and has [but] one taste in his mouth come and exact the retribution from those who eat one species and taste many species.

And [it is also] to make the power of repentance known to you. As soon as they said, “We have sinned,” he was immediately reconciled to them. [The passage serves] to teach you that the one who forgives should not be cruel. And so too does it say (in Gen. 20:17), “Abraham then prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife.” And so does it say (in Job 42:10), “The Lord restored Job’s fortunes when he prayed on behalf of his friends.” And where is it shown that if one has sinned against his companion and says to him, “I have sinned,” without [the companion] forgiving him, that [the unforgiving one] is called a sinner?

When they came and said to him, “We have sinned,” [as stated] (in I Sam. 12:10), “and [they] said, ‘We have sinned […].’” And he answered, “Far be it from me to sin.” (Numb. 21:8), “And the Lord said unto Moses, ‘Make a fiery serpent, [and put it on a pole]; then it shall come to pass that, when anyone bitten [looks at it, he shall live],” not only one bitten by a serpent, but anyone bitten, even one bitten by an adder, by a scorpion, a wild beast, or a dog.

Furthermore, that wadi separates the borders between the Land of Israel and the Land of Moab, as stated (in Numb. 21:13 = Jud. 11:18), “For the Arnon is the border of Moab […].” The mountain in the Land of Moab, the one with the caves, was [not] shaken; but the mountain in the Land of Israel, the one with the crags in the form of breasts, was shaken and joined to the mountain opposite.

Another interpretation: Why was [the well] given in the desert? Because if it had been given to them in the land, the tribe in whose border it was given would have argued and said, “I have a prior claim to it.” For that reason it was given in the desert where all would have an equal claim to it.

This interpretation of Numb. 22:5 is also given by Rashi, ad loc.</i> (Numb. 22:6:) “So come now please, curse (<i>arah</i>) [this people] for me.” What is the meaning of “curse ('<i>rh</i>) […] for me?” Perhaps I shall be able to control them little by little, like someone who picks (rt.: '<i>rh</i>) figs. (Numb. 22:6, cont.:) “For they are mightier than I.” [It is] not that they are more valiant than I, nor [is it] that their forces are more numerous than mine. It is simply that they conquer through their mouth, [and this is] something that I cannot do. (Numb. 22:6, cont.:) “Perhaps I shall be able to smite them.” What reason was there for this one to engage them (i.e., Israel) in war? Did not the Holy One, blessed be He, tell them this, that [Israel] was not to take any of their land? [It was] simply that [Balak] was more of a master of sorceries and divinations than Balaam, for it is so written of him (in Numb. 22:2), “Now Balak [ben Zippor] saw (in a vision),” except that he did not really comprehend the things [he saw]. And so it says (in Is. 47:13-14), “You are wearied with your many deliberations; let those who study the heavens please stand up and save you; let those who gaze at the stars make known month by month whatever will come upon you. See they have become like straw; fire consumes them […].” When he saw that Israel would fall into his hand, he therefore gave his daughter over (to prostitution to lure Israel to sin);<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Numb. 25:1-15. Numb. 25:15 specifically identifies the sacred prostitute Cozbi as the daughter of Zur, whom the midrash (above, section 7:4) has already identified with Balak.</i> and through her twenty-four thousand fell. To this end he would have engaged them in war, but he did not know how.

Buber also notes a variant reading which substitutes <i>menabber</i> (denoting one who removes the hallah) for <i>menakkah</i> (translated here as “discount”). So the Holy One cleansed Israel by removing 1/24 of the people. However, since there were 600,000 Israelites, 25,000 (=1/24 of 600,000), not 24,000, should have been removed. The thousand extra can be explained on analogy with the law of mixtures allowing 1/24 for impurities. The first part of the interpretation in the text comes from dividing 25,000 into two parts of 20,000 + 5,000 and then multiplying each separately and adding the results, instead of simply multiplying 25,000 by 24,000. Regarding the number of Israelites in the desert, Scripture gives the 600,000 figure only in Exod. 12:37. Cf. Exod. 38:26; Numb. 1:46; 2:32, which fix the figure at 603,550 adult males excluding Levites; also Numb. 26:57, which reports a census figure of 601,730 after the removal of the 24,000 in Numb. 25:9.</i> (Numb. 22:6, cont.:) “And drive them away from the land,” for he only desired to drive them away, so that they would not enter the land. (Numb. 22:6, cont.:) “For I know that whomever you bless is blessed and that whomever you curse is cursed.” From where did he know? When Sihon desired to fight with Moab [and] was afraid because they were warriors, he hired Balaam and his father to curse Moab, for it says (in Numb. 21:27–29), “Therefore those who speak in parables say, ‘Come to Heshbon, let it be built; let the city of Sihon be established. For a fire has come forth from Heshbon, [a flame from the city of Sihon. It has devoured Ar of Moab…]. Woe be to you, O Moab!’” Ergo it says (in Numb. 22:6), “for I know [that whomever you bless is blessed and that whomever you curse is cursed].”"

(Numb. 22:11:) “Behold the people has come out of Egypt […], come now, curse (<i>qavah</i>) them for me.” [This is] to make known that he (Balaam) hated Israel more than Balak, because (in Numb. 22:6) Balak did not say <i>qavah</i> (as Balaam claimed he had said in Numb. 22:11) but <i>arah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Both words mean “curse,” but the former is worse than the latter, because <i>qavah</i> involves the use of the Divine Name.</i> This one (Balaam), however, said (in vs. 11), “curse explicitly (<i>qavah</i>),” [meaning] to take [God’s] name explicitly.

Immediately he got up early in the morning, as stated (in vs. 21), “So Balaam arose early in the morning, saddled his she-ass, [and went with the princes of Moab].” Did he not have a male or female slave [to saddle his donkey]? It was simply that his hatred for Israel was so great that he beat [his servant] to it and arose quickly all by himself. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “You wicked man! Their ancestor Abraham has already anticipated you at the binding of his son Isaac,” as stated (in Gen. 22:3), “So Abraham arose early in the morning, saddled his he-ass.” (Numb. 22:21, cont.:) “And went with the princes of Moab.” [These words are] to teach you that he was as glad at the tribulation of Israel as they were.

It is necessary for two to attend him. Then in turn they attend each other. (Numb. 22:23:) “Now the she-ass saw the angel of the Lord and a sword was drawn in his hand.” Was not the angel able to breathe on him and take away his spirit unless he drew his sword? And look at what is written about Sennacherib (in II Kings 19:35 = Is. 37:36 // II Chron. 32:21.), “the angel of the Lord went out and smote [one hundred and eighty-five thousand] in the camp of Assyria.” [It is also written (in Is. 40:24),] “he blows on them and they wither.” However, he said to him, “[Skill with] the mouth was given to Jacob, as stated (in Gen. 27:22), ‘The voice is the voice of Jacob.’ And [skill with] the hands to Esau, as stated (in Gen. 27:40), ‘Upon your sword shall you live.’ All the nations all live by the sword.

Then the angel of the Lord moved forward again [and stood in a place so narrow that there was no room to turn aside to the right or to the left].” What reason did he have to go ahead of him three times? He showed him here symbols of the [three] patriarchs. When he stood before him the first time, there was space on one side and on the other, [as stated] (in Numb. 22:23), “so the she-ass turned aside from the road.” On the second occasion she could only move to one side. On the third occasion (according to Numb. 22:26) “there was no room to turn aside to the right or to the left.” So what do the symbols mean? If he ever sought to curse the Children of Abraham, he would find the Children of Ishmael and the Children of Keturah on one side and on the other. [If] he sought to curse the Children of Isaac, he would find the Children of Esau on one side, and (according to Numb. 22:25) “she was pressed against the (one) wall.” In the case of the Children of Jacob, however, he found among them no residue through which to touch them.

Another interpretation (of Numb. 22:30): The Holy One, blessed be He, was concerned for the honor of that wicked man, lest they would say, “This is the very one through which Balaam was struck.” And if the Holy One, blessed be He, has concern for the honor of the wicked, it is not necessary to say [the same] about the honor of the righteous. And so is it stated (in Lev. 20:16), “If a woman approaches any beast to mate with it, [you shall kill the woman and the beast].” If the woman sinned, [how] did the animal sin? It is simply since the calamity came to the woman though it. Hence the verse says, “Kill it.” Another interpretation is that [it is so] that the animal should not pass through the marketplace and [people] say, “This is the animal for which x was killed.” [This is] to show how the Holy One, blessed be He is concerned about the honor of the creatures and knows their needs. And [so] He closed the mouth of the animals. As if it could speak, [people] would not be able to subdue it and master it. As this was the silliest of animals and this was the greatest of the sages.

And he said, “Do not raise your hand [against the lad].”’ He is used to saying something, then to have an angel come and reverse it.” [So (in vs. 34),] “if it is evil in your eyes, I will return.” (Numb. 22:35:) “The angel of the Lord said unto Balaam, ‘Go with the men’”; for your lot is [to be] with them, and your end is to be obliterated with them from the world. (Ibid., cont.:) “So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.” [These words] teach that just as they were happy to curse [Israel], so was he happy.

He said to him, “These are borders which have been fixed from the days of Noah, so that a nation would not enter the territory of its neighbor. These [people] are coming to uproot them.” He said to him, “Come to curse them.” Then he showed him how they had broken through and crossed the border of Sihon and Og, as though lodging a complaint against them. (Numb. 22:37:) “Then Balak said unto Balaam, ‘Did I not truly send unto you [to summon you; why did you not come unto me; am I really unable to honor you]?’” He prophesied that his end would be to go in disgrace. Then did Balaam also answer him like the [truth of the] matter (in Numb. 22:38), “So Balaam said unto Balak, ‘See, I have come unto you now, [but am I really able to say anything at all…?]’” For I do not have authority to say what I want."

Balak said (in Numb. 22:17), “For I will surely honor you greatly….” When [Balaam] came, he only sent him an ox and a sheep. Balaam began gnashing his teeth at him, for he was greedy. He said [to himself], “Is this what he sent me? Tomorrow I will deliver a curse through his [own] property,” as stated (in Numb. 23:1), “Then Balaam said [unto Balak], ‘Build [seven altars] for me here, [and make ready for me here seven bulls and seven rams]….’” (Numb. 22:41:) “So it came to pass in the morning that Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the high places of Baal, [and from there he saw the edge of the people].” Balak was a more of a master of divinations and auguries than Balaam, for Balaam was being dragged along after him like a blind man.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numb.

(Numb. 23:1:) “Then Balaam said unto Balak, ‘Build seven altars for me here.’” Why seven altars? [They] corresponded to seven righteous ones from Adam to Moses, who built seven altars and had been accepted: Adam, Abel, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses. Then [Balaam] said, “Why did you accept these? Was it not because of the service (the sacrifices) which they performed before you that you accepted them? Is it not [more] suitable for you to be served by seventy nations and not by [merely] one nation?” As it were, the holy spirit [answered him] (in Prov. 17:1), “Better a dry morsel with tranquility than a house full of quarrelsome feasting.” Better (in the words of Lev. 7:10) “a grain offering mixed with oil or dry” than (in Prov. 17:1) “a house full of quarrelsome feasting”;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The words HOUSE and FEASTING can also mean “temple” and “sacrifice” respectively.</i> for you want to introduce strife between Me and Israel.

What are you doing?” (Ibid., cont.:) “And [Balaam] said unto him, ‘I have prepared the seven altars [and offered a ram and a bull on each altar].’” [The matter] is comparable to a money-changer who lies about the weights. When the head of the marketplace came, he noticed him. He said to him, “What are you doing inflating and lying about the weights?” [The money changer then] said to him, “I have already sent a gift<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>doron.</i></i> to your house.” So also it was in the case of Balaam. The holy spirit cried out to him. It said to him, “You evil man! What are you doing.” He said to it (in Numb. 23:4), “I have prepared the seven altars [and offered a ram and a bull on each altar].” It said to him (in Prov. 15:17), “’Better a meal of vegetable greens [where there is love than a fattened ox with hatred in it].’ Better the dinner of unleavened bread and bitter herbs which Israel ate in Egypt, than bulls which you offer with hands of [hatred].” (Numb. 23:5:) “So the Lord put a word (<i>davar</i>) in Balaam's mouth,” which twisted his mouth and pierced it,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Both “twisted” and “pierced” connote the use of a bit on a horse.</i> as one would drive a nail into a board. R. Eliezer (understanding <i>davar</i> as word) says, “An angel was speaking.” But R. Joshua says, “[It was] the Holy One, blessed be He, as stated, (in Numb. 23:5), “Return unto Balak and speak thus.” (Numb. 23:6:) “So he returned unto him, and there he was standing beside his burnt offerings with all the ministers of Moab,” who stood anxiously awaiting [the time] when he would come and speak.

The unusual Biblical translation is necessary to fit the sense of the midrash.</i> Another interpretation (of Numb. 23:7), “From Aram.” I was with the highest (<i>ram</i>) of the high, and Balak has brought me down from my glory. [The matter] is comparable to one who was walking with the king. When he saw [some] robbers,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>lestai.</i></i> he left the king and toured along with the robbers. When he returned to be with the king, the king said to him, “Go with whomever you have toured with, because it not possible for you to walk with me again.” Similarly Balaam had been bound to the holy spirit. When he paired himself with Balak, the holy spirit departed from him. So he returned to being a diviner as in the beginning. Thus it is stated (at his execution in Josh. 13:22), “Balaam ben Beor the diviner….” Therefore did he say, “I was high up (<i>ram</i>), and Balak brought me down.” Another interpretation (of Numb. 23:7), “From Aram, Balak the king of Moab has brought me, from the hills of the east.” [Balaam] said to [Balak], “We are alike, even both of us, for being ungrateful, because were it not for our father Abraham, there would have been no Balak. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 19:29), ‘And it came to pass that when God destroyed the cities of the plain, God remembered Abraham and sent Lot away.’ Except for Abraham, he would not have delivered Lot from Sodom; and you are one of the children of the children of Lot.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As a Moabite, Balak was descended from Moab, the son of Lot. See Gen. 19:37.</i> Moreover, if it were not for their father Jacob, I should not have been present in the world, because Laban had sons only through the merit of Jacob, since it is written at the beginning (in Gen. 29:9), ‘Rachel came with the sheep.’ Now if he had sons, how was his daughter a shepherdess? As soon as Jacob came there, sons were given to him, as stated (in Gen. 31:1), ‘Now he heard the things that Laban's sons [were saying].’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jewish tradition gives three views on Balaam’s relation to Laban: That he was Laban himself, that he was Laban’s nephew, and that he was Laban’s grandson. See Ginzberg, vol. III, p. 354; vol.. V, p. 303, n. 229; vol. VI, pp. 123f., nn. 722f.; p. 130, n. 764.</i> And it also says [that Laban said] (in Gen. 30:27), ‘I have learned by divination that the Lord has blessed me for your sake.’ So if it were not for their ancestors, you and I would not have been present in the world”. (Numb. 23:7, cont.:) “Come, curse Jacob for me.” Whoever curses the Children of Jacob is cursing himself, since it is stated (in Gen. 12:3), “and the one who curses you, I will curse.” It also says (in Gen. 27:29), “cursed be those who curse you,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, Gen. 6:16.</i> and blessed be those who bless you.” (Numb. 23:7:) “Come, curse [Jacob] for me.” If you had told me to curse another people, for example, the Children of Abraham from the concubines, I would have been able [to do so]. But Jacob? When a king selects a portion for himself, and someone else gets up and speaks disparagingly about it, will he keep his life? Now these people are the Holy One, blessed be He’s, heritage, His portion, and His treasure. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 32:9), “For the Lord's share is His people; Jacob the portion of His heritage.” And it is written (in Exod. 19:5), “and you shall be My treasure.” (Numb. 23:7, cont.:) “And come, denounce Israel.” When a king takes a crown and puts it on his head, and someone says of it that it is nothing, will he keep his life? Now in regard to these people it is written about them (in Is. 49:3), “Israel, in whom I will be glorified.” (Numb. 23:8:) “How shall I curse whom God has not cursed?” When they deserved to be cursed, they were not cursed, when Jacob went in to receive the blessings. It is written (in Gen. 27:16), “Then [she clothed his arms and the hairless part of his neck] with the skins of goat kids.” His father said to him (in Gen. 27:18), “Who are you?” He said to him (in vs. 19), “I am Esau, your first-born.” Does not the one who puts forth a lie with his mouth deserve to be cursed? Yet not only [was he not cursed], but he was blessed; as stated (in Gen. 27:33), “he shall also be blessed.” So how do I curse them? (In the words of Numb. 23:8) “God has not cursed.” Another interpretation (of Numb. 23:8), “How shall I curse whom God has not cursed?” According to universal custom, when a legion<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lat.: <i>legio.</i></i> rebels against the king, it incurs the penalty of death. Now since these denied and revolted against Him, when they said to the calf (in Exod. 32:4), “This is your God, O Israel,” did they not, therefore, deserve to have Him destroy them at that time? [Still] He did not cease to cherish them. Instead He had clouds of glory accompany them. Nor did He withhold the manna and the well from them. And so it says (in Neh. 9:18-20), “Even though they had made themselves a molten calf […], You in Your great mercies did not abandon them in the desert […]; and You did not withhold Your manna from their mouth […].” How can I curse them? This [question] is related (to Numb. 23:8), “How shall I curse whom God has not cursed?” When He commanded them concerning the blessings and the curses, He mentioned them (as the people) in connection with the blessings where it is stated (in Deut. 27:12), “These shall stand [on Mount Gerizim] for blessing the people;” but He did not mention them in connection with the curses. Thus it is stated (in vs. 13), “And these shall stand on Mount Ebal for the curse.” Moreover, when they sin and He plans to bring a curse upon them, it is not written that He Himself is bringing them (i.e., the curses); but with respect to the blessings, He Himself is blessing them; for so it says (in Deut. 28:1, 8), “And it shall come to pass that, if you diligently obey […], the Lord your God will set you high [over all the nations of the earth]. The Lord will command the blessing to be with you.” But with respect to the curses, it is written (according to Deut. 28:15), “And it shall come to pass that, if you do not obey […], then [all these curses] shall come upon you,” [i.e.,] of their own accord. Ergo (in Numb. 23:8), “How shall I curse whom God has not cursed?” (Numb. 23:9:) “For from the top of the rocks I see him,” in order to make the hatred of that evil man (i.e., Balaam) known to you. As from his blessing you may know his thoughts. To what is he comparable? To someone who came to chop down a tree. One who is not an expert chops off the branches one at a time and becomes tired, but the clever one exposes the roots and [then] chops it down. Similarly that wicked man said, “How shall I curse each and every tribe? Rather I will go to their roots.” When he came to touch them, he found them hard [to cut]. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 23:9), “For from the top of the rocks I see him.” Another interpretation (of Numb. 23:9), “For from the top of the rocks,” these are the patriarchs; (ibid., cont.) “and from the hills I behold him,” these are the matriarchs. (Numb. 23:9, cont.:) “Here is a people dwelling alone.” When He makes them rejoice, no nation rejoices along with them. Rather they are all afflicted, [as stated (in Deut. 32:12),] “The Lord alone did lead him, and there was no foreign god with him.” (Numb. 23:9, cont.:), “And they shall not be reckoned (rt.: <i>hshb</i>) among the nations.” But when the nations are rejoicing in this world, they (i.e., the Children of Israel) eat with each and every kingdom, and no one is charging [such pleasures] against their account (rt: <i>hshb</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words the pleasures that Israel enjoys in this world are not to be deducted from their pleasures in the world to come.</i> It is so stated (in Numb. 23:9, cont.), “and they shall not be reckoned (rt.: <i>hshb</i>) among the nations.” (Numb. 23:10:) “Who has counted the dust of Jacob?” Who is able to count the commandments which they carry out upon the dust: (In Deut. 22:10,) “You shall not plow with an ox and an ass together”; (in Deut. 22:9,) “You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed”; (in Numb. 19:9,) “Then someone clean shall gather the ashes of the heifer”; (in Numb. 5:17,) “[Then the high priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel] and some of the dust which is on the floor of the tabernacle”; (in Lev. 19:23,) “[Moreover, when you come into the land and plant any tree for food, you shall count its fruit as forbidden,] three years it shall be forbidden to you, [it shall not be eaten]”; and so on with all of them. (Numb. 23:10, cont.:) “Or numbered the sand (<i>rb</i>') of Israel,” [i.e.,] their copulations (rt.: <i>rb</i>').<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For this interpretation, cf. <i>Nid.</i> 31a.</i> Who can number the masses<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>ochloi.</i></i> that have emerged from them, from those women who seize on and cherish the commandments (of procreation), as stated (in Gen. 30:15), “But she said to her, ‘Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband?’” [And so too (in Gen. 30:3, 9),] “Here is my maid Bilhah; go into her.” “When Leah saw that she had ceased bearing children, [she took her maidservant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife].” [And so too (in Gen. 16:3),] “So Abraham's wife Sarai took her maidservant Hagar the Egyptian… [and gave her to her husband Abraham as a wife].” (Numb. 23:10, cont.:) “Let me die the death of the upright.” The matter is comparable to a butcher who came to slaughter a cow that belonged to a king. The king began to take notice. When [the butcher] realized [what was happening], he began by discarding the knife, then giving [the cow] a rubdown [and] filling the feeding trough for it. He began to say, “Let my life be forfeit for coming to slaughter it; but observe that I have [now given it sustenance].” Similarly Balaam said, “Let my life be forfeit for coming to curse, but I will bless [them].” Ergo (in Numb. 23:10), “let me die the death of the upright!”"

                "(Numb. 23:11-14:) “And Balak said to Balaam, ‘What have you done to me; to curse….’ And Balaam answered and said, ‘Is it not that that which God places into my mouth….’ And Balak said to Balaam, ‘Please go [and] I will take you….’ So he took him to the Field of Zophim [at the top of Pisgah].” He saw that Israel would be breached there, for it was there that Moses died, as stated (in Deut. 3:27), “Go up to the top of Pisgah …, [for you shall not cross over this Jordan].” Is there a breach greater than this? What he saw was through divinations, and he was of the opinion that because of him they would fall there. (Numb. 23:14-16:) “And he built seven altars [and offered a ram and a bull on each altar]. Then he said unto Balak, ‘Stand here [beside your burnt offerings and let me make myself available to the Lord over there]….’ And God appeared to Balaam and he placed a word (<i>davar</i>) in his mouth.” Like a man who places a bit upon the mouth of his animal and twists him to where he wants [it to go]. So was the Holy One, blessed be He, twisting his mouth. When he said to him, “Return to Balak and bless them,” he said, “Why should I go to him to anguish him?” [So] he sought to go to [his own home] and not to Balak. The Holy One, blessed be He, put a bit into his mouth, [and said] (in Numb. 23:16, cont.) “Return to Balak and speak thus.” (Numb 23:17:) “So he [came] unto him, and there he was standing beside his burnt offerings together with the ministers of Moab.” Concerning the first occasion, it is written (in Numb. 23:6), “with all the ministers of Moab.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numb.

(Numb. 23:17:) “Balak said to him, ‘What did the Lord say?’” When he saw that [Balaam] was not in control of himself to say what he wanted, [Balak] sat himself down and mocked him. As soon as he saw that he was mocking him, Balaam said to him, “Get up from there. It is not fitting to sit while the words of the Omnipresent are being spoken.” (Numb. 23:18:) “Rise up Balak and listen; give ear to me, you son of Zippor!” Both of them were [distinguished] sons of [undistinguished] fathers, for they had made themselves greater than their fathers.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On the importance of having a distinguished lineage, see, e.g., <i>Ta‘an</i> 21b.</i> [Hence (in Numb. 24:3),] “An oracle of Balaam son of Beor (literally, his son is Beor)”; (in Numb 23:18) “give ear to me, you son of Zippor (literally, his son is Zippor)!” <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The unusual wording of Numb. 23:18 and 24:3 suggests that Balak and Balaam both had fathers undistinguished enough to be called their sons.</i> (Numb. 23:19:) “God is not a human, that he should speak falsehood.” He is not like flesh and blood. [When a person of] flesh and blood acquires friends and finds others nicer than they, he forsakes the former ones. But [the Holy One, blessed be He,] is not like that. It is not possible [for Him] to be false to the oath of the early ancestors. (Ibid., cont.:) “Has he promised and not fulfilled?” (This phrase can also be read as, “He has promised and not fulfilled.”) When he promises to bring evils upon them, He will cancel them, if they have repented. You find it written (in Exod. 22:19), “Whoever sacrifices to a god shall be devoted to destruction.” When they made the calf, they merited destruction. So I thought to curse and destroy them. But when they repented a little, He suspended [any punishment] and (according to Exod. 32:14) “The Lord repented of the evil which He had planned to do to His people.” And so too in many places. As he said to Jochaniah (in Jer. 22:30), “as none of his seed shall succeed….” But He said to his son’s son (in Hag. 2:22), “And I will overturn the thrones of kingdoms and destroy the might of the kingdoms of the nations,” since it is stated (Hag. 2:23), “’On that day,’ declares the Lord of Hosts, ‘I will take you, O My servant Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel,’ declares the Lord, ‘and make you as a signet.’” And so He suspended what He said to his [grand]father (in Jer. 22:24), “’As I live,’ declares the Lord, ‘if you, O King Coniah, son of Jehoiakim, of Judah, were a signet on My right hand, I would tear you off even from there.’” And so with the men of Anatoth, it is written (in Jer. 11:23), “No remnant shall be left of them, for I will bring disaster on the men of Anathoth.” [But] once they repented, see what is written (in Neh. 7:27), “The men of Anatoth were one hundred and twenty-eight.”"

Thus it is stated (in Is. 60:8), “Who are these that fly like a cloud?” (Numb. 23:23:) “There is no augury in Jacob and no divination in Israel.” Here you are (Balak) practicing augury and divining in what place you may prevail against them, but they are not like that.

Here they are sleeping away from the Torah and the commandments. [Then] having risen from their sleep, they stand up like lions. Quickly reciting the <i>Shema</i>', they proclaim the sovereignty of the Holy One, blessed be He. Then having become like lions, they embark on worldly business pursuits. If one of them should stumble, or if destroying demons come to touch one of them, he proclaims the sovereignty of the Holy One, blessed be He.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On reciting the <i>Shema</i>‘ to be safe from demons, see <i>yBer.</i> 1:1 (2d); <i>Ber.</i> 5a; M.

Thus it is stated (Ps. 130:6), “My soul [yearns] for the Lord more than the watchmen for the morning, the watchmen for the morning.” For that reason Balaam says, “There is no nation like this one.” (Numb. 23:24, cont.:) “And drunk the blood of the slain.” He prophesied that Moses would not die, until he had taken vengeance upon him and the five kings of Midian, as stated (Numb. 23:24), “it does not sleep until it has eaten its prey,” this [prey] is Balaam; “and drunk the blood of the slain,” these are the five kings of Midian. It is so stated (in Numb. 31:8), “And they slew the five kings of Midian upon their corpses.” (Numb. 31:6:) “With the vessels of the sanctuary.” This is the [high priestly diadem] plate upon which it is written (according to Exod. 28:36), “holy to the Lord.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For a description, see <i>Shab.</i> 63b; <i>Suk.</i> 5a.</i> (Numb. 31:6, cont.:) “And the trumpets for sounding the alarm in his hand.” Moses said to Israel, “Balaam the wicked has practiced magic for you<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. the parallel account in Gen.

Is it not in fact written (in Numb. 24:25), “Then Balaam arose and went back to his own place?” It is simply this: when he heard that twenty-four thousand [Israelites] had fallen (in Numb. 25:9) through his counsel,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">75</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Deut.

Once a certain Jew came in to eat there but did not wash his hands. Thinking that he was a foreigner, he set pork before him. He ate without saying the blessing. When he came to settle the account with him for the bread and for the meat, the pork was expensively priced.

Therefore the sages have said, “Whoever does not wash his hands after the meal is like one who takes a life.” Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, has warned Israel not to transgress even insignificant commandments, as stated (in Deut. 32:47), “For it (the Torah) is no empty thing for you, [in that it is your very life].” Even some commandment that you consider to be empty and insignificant has within it life and length of days, as stated (in Deut. 32:47, cont.), “and through this thing you will lengthen your days upon the land.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “If you keep My commandments, I will cast down your enemies before you,” as stated (in Ps. 81:14-15), “O that my people would listen to Me, that Israel would walk in My ways. Then I would virtually [subdue their enemies…].” When Balaam saw how Israel observed [even] the insignificant commandments, he said, “Who can curse these people, when they observe commandments and when His name is engraved upon them.” (Numb. 23:21:) “The Lord their God is with them.” Whoever curses them curses himself, because His name is joined with them.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the name <i>El</i> (“God”) forms part of the name Isra<i>el</i>.</i> He began turning to oracles, as stated (in Numb. 24:3), “So he took up his theme” This text is related (to Prov. 27:14), “Whoever rises early in the morning to bless his neighbor in a loud voice shall have it reckoned to him as a curse.” When Balaam came to curse Israel, the Holy One, blessed be He, diverted his tongue, so that he began to bless. It is so stated (in Deut. 23:6), “But the Lord your God did not want to heed Balaam; so the Lord your God turned the curse into a blessing for you.” The Holy One, blessed be He, put power in his voice and his voice went from one end of the world to the other, so that the nations would hear that he was blessing [Israel].

There is a parable about a wolf who fell upon a flock of sheep. The owner of the sheep said to the shepherd, “Count how many were lost.” [This] is to inform you how much unchastity distances [from God]; as this was [just one] individual, and [yet] twenty-four thousand fell on his account. This is related to (in Prov. 16:14), “The king’s wrath is a messenger of death, but a wise man can appease it.” There is a parable about a king who was passing by when a group of youths were standing in front of him.

He said to him, “Would you please pay attention to your wife [to be foregoing with her after I die].” The king said to him, “Instead of you charging me concerning my wife, charge my wife concerning me, that she be careful with my honor.” So did the Holy One, blessed be He, as it were, say to Moses, “Instead of you charging Me (in Numb. 27:16), ‘Appoint…,’ charge them concerning Me, that they be diligent with My honor.” What is written below (in Numb. 28:2)? “Command the Children of Israel, and say unto them, ‘My offering, My bread.’” What reason did [Moses] have to request this need after the ordering of inheritance? It is simply that since he saw the daughters of Zelophehad inherit the properties of their father, Moses said, “See it is the time for me to claim my needs. If daughters inherit, it is [also] proper for my sons to inherit my glory.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him (in Prov. 27:18), “’He who tends a fig tree will enjoy its fruit.’ Your sons sat [with] their own [concerns] and were not involved with Torah [study]. It is [more] appropriate that Joshua, who served you, serve Israel and not lose his compensation,” as stated (in Numb. 27:18), “Take Joshua bin Nun.” And why is the Torah compared to a fig tree? Since [the fruit of] most trees – the olive tree, the grapevine, the date palm – is gathered [all] at once, but the fig tree is gathered a little [at a time]. And so too is the Torah. Today he studies a little and tomorrow he studies much; as it is not taught in a year, nor in two. (Numb. 27:18:) “A man with the spirit of God with him.” Since you said (in Numb. 27:16), “’The God of the spirits of all flesh,’ since You know each and every one, one should be appointed who knows how to proceed with each and every one of them according to his temperament”; [so then (in Numb 27:18, cont.),] “lay your hand upon him,” like one who lights a candle from a candle. (Numb 27:20), “Invest him with your majesty,” like one who pours from one vessel to another vessel. Concerning that which I said to you (in Numb. 36:9), “So the inheritance will not move around from one tribe to another,” this glory will not move from the house of your father, as even Joshua who will arise in your place (according to Numb. 27:19), “shall stand in front of Elazar the priest” (nephew of Moses)."

Thus have our masters taught (in <i>Men.</i> 5:1–2):<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, Lev. 1:7.</i> All meal offerings were offered unleavened except the leavened [cakes] in the thank offering and the two loaves (of Pentecost) which were offered leavened. R. Meir says, “The leaven is separated from its own [dough], and [it is from this that] they are leavened.” R. Judah says, “Even that is not the best [method]; one should bring the leaven, put it into the [measure], and fill the measure [with flour].” [The sages] said to him, “Even that [method] resulted in too little or too much.” All meal offerings were kneaded in lukewarm water and one watched them lest they become leavened; and if the remnants of it became leavened, one transgressed a negative commandment, as stated (in Lev. 2:11), “No meal offering which you offer to the Lord shall be made with leaven.” Thus one may become culpable in the kneading of [leaven], in rolling it, and in baking it. There is nothing more pleasing for you than the offerings. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “Say to those Israelites, ‘I did not tell you to offer me sacrifices because I have a need for them, since the whole world is Mine, and I created the animal from which you offer a sacrifice in front of Me.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numb.

Judah bar Simon said, “It is not that I require to eat anything which I commanded you to offer as My offering, My bread; as there is not eating or drinking in front of Me.” R. Simon said, “There are thirteen attributes of mercy that are written about the Holy One, blessed be He, as stated (in Exod. 34:6), ‘And the Lord passed over his face….’ Is there a merciful one that delivers his victuals to a cruel one?” Ergo (in Ps. 50:12), “If I am hungry, I would not tell you.” R. Judah bar Simon said, “The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘I have delivered ten [kinds of] clean animals to you (for food).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See also <i>PR</i> 16:1; Numb.

Rather [your sacrifices come] from those which are in your possession, which grew up at your feeding trough.’” Ergo (in Ps. 50:12), “If I am hungry, I would not tell you.” R. Isaac said, “It is written (in Numb 28:2), ‘My offering, My Bread, for My burnt offering.’ Is there eating and drinking in front of Me? And if you say there is eating and drinking in front of Me, [you should] learn from the ministering angels, as stated (in Ps. 104:4), ‘His servants flaming fire.’” From what are they [then] sustained? R. Judan said in the name of R. Isaac, “They are nourished from the radiance of the Divine Presence, as stated (in Prov. 16:15), ‘The light of the king’s face is light.‘” R. Simeon ben Laqish said, [Regarding (Numb. 28:6),] “The regular burnt offering done at Mount Sinai,” “And did they do it at Mount Sinai? It is simply that if you will say that that there is eating and drinking in front of Him, learn from Moshe, our teacher. Observe what is written about him (in Exod. 34:28), ‘And he was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread nor drank water.’ If there was eating and drinking in front of Me, he would have eaten and drank from what I eat and drink. And if Moses who [only] fulfilled the errand of God, ‘neither ate bread nor drank water,’ all the more so is it true of the Holy One, blessed be He.” Ergo (in Ps. 50:12), “If I am hungry, I would not tell you.” R. Hiyya bar Abba said, “So did the Holy One blessed be He say: ‘My [other] creatures do not need My creatures (people). In your days have you heard one saying, “Let this vine produce wine,” and it produces much wine, [or] “Let this olive tree produce oil,” and it produces much wine. My creatures do not need My creatures and I should need My creatures?’” R. Jannai said, “It is customary that when a man is walking by a river, it is impossible for him not to drink two or three <i>log</i>. Now all the water that is in the world would fill the hollow of My hand, as stated (in Is. 40:12), ‘Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand?’ But [yet] I have written about your <i>log</i> (in Numb. 28:7), ‘to be poured in the sacred precinct as an offering of fermented drink to the Lord,’ which is an expression of drinking, an expression of satiation, an expression of inebriation.” I have created one animal in My world, and you are not able to support its victuals. And which is it? That is (in Psalms 50:10), “the behemoths on a thousand mountains.” R. Johanan, R. Joshua ben Levi and the Sages [disagreed about this]. R. Johanan said, ‘It was one animal crouching on a thousand mountains and it would pasture on a thousand [different] mountains each day, as stated, (in Job 40:20), ‘The mountains yield him produce.’” R. Joshua ben Levi says, “It was one animal crouching on a thousand mountains and a thousand mountains would produce many types of food, for the righteous to eat in the future to come, as stated (in Is. 65:10), ‘Sharon shall become a pasture for flocks, And the Valley of Achor a place for cattle to lie down.’” And the Sages say, “It crouches upon the thousand mountains, and the thousand mountains produce animals every day and it eats [them].” What is the explanation? As it states (in Job 40:20, cont.), “and all the beasts of the field play there.” Is it possible for a grazing animal to eat a grazing animal? R. Tanchuma says, “Great is the work of our God and how great are His acts.” And from where does it drink? R. Joshua ben Levi and the Sages [disagreed about this]. R. Joshua ben Levi says, “It drinks up with one swallow all that the Jordan produces in six months, as stated (in Job 40:23), ‘He can restrain the river from its rushing; [he is confident the Jordan will gush at his command].’ [And the sages say, “Twelve months….”]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Numb.

Chiya taught in the name of R. Meir (from Job 12:7), “’But ask the beasts, and they will teach you; the birds of the sky, they will tell you’: ’But ask the beasts,’ this is the behemoth; ‘the birds of the sky,’ this is the <i>ziz</i> of the Omnipresent (a giant bird). (Job 12:8:) ‘Or speak to the earth, it will teach you; the fish of the sea, they will inform you’: ‘Or speak to the earth,’ this is the Garden of Eden; ‘The fish of the sea,’ that is the leviathan. (Job 12:9:) ‘Who among all these does not know that the hand of the Lord has done this?’” You have one king and his name was Solomon, as stated (about the lavishness of his meals in I Kings 5:2-3), “Solomon’s daily provisions consisted of thirty <i>kor</i> of semolina, and sixty <i>kor</i> of [ordinary] flour, ten fattened oxen….” R. Yehuda bar Zvidah said, “Solomon had a thousand wives and each and every one would make him like this every day, as she thought he would eat with her. [And] Nehemiah the governor did not [even] have the ability to reckon his meal, as stated (in Neh. 5:18), ‘And although what was prepared for each day came to one ox….’ The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘My children, it is not because there is eating and drinking in front of Me. Rather it is because of the smell, that you shall be pleased and give the pleasant smell in front of Me.’”"

However, one may place food into its mouth (<i>malitin</i>).” Another interpretation (of Prov. 13:25), “The righteous man eats to satiate his soul”: This is Ruth about whom it is written (in Ruth 2:14), “and she ate her fill and had some left over.” As blessing dwelt in the mouth of that righteous woman.

How so? [if one makes] a <i>konam</i> not to make a sukkah, not to take up a lulab, not to put on phylacteries, in the case of vows (<i>nedarim</i>) it is forbidden to put them on or to make them, even though they are commandments (of the Torah); but in the case of oaths (<i>shevu'ot</i>) it is permitted, because one does not swear to transgress against the commandments. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “Be circumspect with your vows (<i>nedarim</i>) and do not break them; for all who break vows (<i>nedarim</i>) end up in being faithless in oaths (<i>shevu'ot</i>).” And the one who is faithless in oaths is denying the Holy One, blessed be He through it and will never have forgiveness, as stated (in Exod. 20:7 = Deut. 5:11), “for the Lord will not exonerate [one who takes His name in vain].” [Yet] it is also written (in Jer. 4:2), “And you shall swear, ‘As the Lord lives,’ [in truth, in justice, and in righteousness].” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “Do not think that you have permission to swear in My name even in truth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numb.

It therefore is stated (ibid.), “Him you shall serve (rt.: '<i>bd</i>).” (Deut. 10:20, cont.:) “To Him you shall hold fast.” Can one hold fast to the Divine Presence? Moreover, has it not already been stated (in Deut. 4:24), “For the Lord your God is a consuming fire?” It is simply [being stated with reference to] anyone marrying off his daughter to a scholar who reads [Scripture] and recites [Mishnah], that he engage in commerce<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>pragmateia.</i></i> for him and have him benefit from his assets.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ket.</i> 111b; cf. <i>Sot</i>. 14a.</i> It is with reference to [such a] one that it is stated (in Deut. 10:20), “to him you shall hold fast.”<br>If you have all these [attributes] you may swear; if not, you are not entitled to swear. There is a story about King [Jannai], that he had two thousand towns and they all were destroyed because of a true oath. (Numbers 30:17:) “Between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter.” Just like a man only annuls vows of self-affliction and matters between him and her, so too a father only annuls with regards to self-affliction and what is between him and her."

On the contrary, [they have done so precisely] because of the Torah and commandments which You have given.

Since Scripture had made the death of Moses dependent upon the vengeance against Midian, they said, “Shall we go against Midian and let Moses die?” They refrained from going. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “Cast lots over the tribes, and they will be furnished automatically.” (Numb. 31:6:) “Then Moses sent them, a thousand per tribe [along with Phinehas ben Eleazar].” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses (in vs. 2), “’Take vengeance,’ by yourself,” and he sent others?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numb.

As this one is next to Moab and it is [still] desolate until now. And why did He send Phinehas (instead of someone else)? He said, “Whoever has begun a commandment should finish it. [Phinehas] has (according to Numb. 25:11) ‘turned around My wrath’ (by executing an Israelite man copulating with the Midianite woman). Let him finish the commandment [that he undertook].” (Numb. 31:6, cont.:) “And the vessels of the sanctuary (<i>haqodesh</i>).” This refers to the ark (and its contents), since it is stated (in Numb. 7:9), “because they (i.e., the Children of Kohath) had the service of the holy (<i>haqodesh</i>) objects, which they carried on the shoulder.” R. Johanan said, “These were the priestly garments, in which were the <i>urim</i> and <i>thummim</i>, as stated (in Exod. 29:29), ‘And the sacred (<i>haqodesh</i>) garments of Aaron.’” (Numb. 31:8:) “They also killed Balaam ben Beor with the sword.” Now what was he doing there? He had simply gone to receive a reward for the twenty-four thousand from Israel that had fallen through his counsel. And about him is it stated (in Prov. 26:27), “He who digs a pit will fall in it.” [It is like the] proverb about the camel that goes to put on and claim horns, while the ears that it had are severed from it. (Numb. 31:11-12:) “Then they took all the plunder…. And they brought unto Moses and Elazar the Priest.” [This text serves] to show their excellence, for they did not want to take the spoils without permission. Rather they had brought all of it before them; and [only] after that, they took [them with his permission]. (Numb. 31:13:) “Then Moses, Elazar the Priest, and the princes of the congregation [went out to meet them.” This text serves] to show Moses' humility, for they all were disciples of his disciples."

R. 22:5.</i> [The text] teaches that Moses longed to see vengeance on the Midianites before he died, and [so] he requested from the Holy One, blessed be He, about it, that he should [see it] with his eyes. Thus it is stated concerning him (in Ps. 58:11), “A righteous person will rejoice when he sees vengeance, he will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked person.” (Ibid.:) “A righteous person will rejoice,” this refers to Moses; “when he sees vengeance,” i.e., vengeance on Midian; “he will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked person,” i.e., of Balaam. Moses said to Phinehas and the warring men, “I know that Balaam the Wicked is there, as he went to collect his wage. Before the wolf comes to the flock, spread the trap for him. And if you see that that wicked man is doing magic, show him the diadem, upon which it is written (according to Exod. 28:36), ‘holy to the Lord.’ And [when] he shall [then] fall, kill him.” (Numb. 31:8:) “And upon their [other] corpses they killed the kings of Midian,” as they were doing magic with Balaam and flying in the air; so they showed them the diadem and they fell upon their corpses. The sages said “It is written about Joshua (in Josh 1:5), ‘as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.’ So Joshua should have lived a hundred and twenty years like Moshe our teacher. And why were they shortened by ten years? Because at the time that the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses (in Numb. 31:2), ‘Exact vengeance for the Children of Israel…,’ even though the announcement of [his] death was [also] announced, he did not say, ‘Tomorrow I will die; what benefit is it to me to exact vengeance from Midian?’ Rather, he showed alacrity in the whole matter, as stated (in Numb. 31:6), ‘And Moses sent them.’ But Joshua did not do like this. When he came to war against thirty-one kings, he said, ‘If I kill them, I will die immediately, as happened to Moshe our teacher.’ What did he do? He began with one and stalled in the war [with the rest], as stated (in Josh. 11:18), ‘Joshua waged war with all those kings over a long period.’ [So] the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, ‘See that I will shorten your years by ten years.’ David said (about this in Prov. 19:21), ‘Many thoughts are in the heart of a man, [but it is the counsel of the Lord that will stand].’”"

R. 22:7.</i> Thus have our masters taught: The Holy One, blessed be He, created three gifts in the world: wisdom, strength, and wealth. A person meriting one of them receives what is most desirable in the whole world. A person meriting wisdom has merited everything. A person meriting strength has merited everything. A person meriting wealth has merited everything. When? When they are gifts of the Heavens and come from the power of the strength of the Holy One, blessed be He. But human strength and wealth are nothing; for thus has Solomon stated (in Eccl. 9:11), “Again I saw that under the sun [the race does not belong to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor even wealth to the discerning, nor even favor to the knowledgeable].” Thus also has Jeremiah stated (in Jer. 9:22), “Thus says the Lord, ‘Let not the wise boast in their wisdom, [nor the strong boast in their strength, nor the wealthy boast in their wealth].’” So these gifts, when they do not come from the Holy One, blessed be He, will finally be cut off from them. The sages taught, “Two wise men arose in the world, one from Israel and one from the nations of the world. Ahitophel was from Israel, while Balaam was from the nations of the world; but both of them were lost from this world and from the world to come. Two strong men arose in the world, one was from Israel and one from the nations of the world. Samson was from Israel, while Goliath was from the nations of the world; but both of them were lost from the world. Two wealthy men arose in the world, Korah from Israel and Haman from the nations of the world; but both of them were lost from the world. Why? Because their gift was not from the Holy One, blessed be He. Rather they grabbed it up for themselves. So also do you find with the Children of Gad and the Children of Reuben that they were very wealthy and had a lot of livestock. But they loved their money and resided outside the Land [of Israel as a result]. For that reason they were the first of the tribes to go into exile, as stated (in I Chron. 5:26), ‘and he carried them into exile, i.e., the Reubenites and the Gadites […].’ Who brought [the exile] upon them? [It happened] because they had separated themselves from their siblings for the sake of their livestock. And where is it shown?

Rather even if one sails away in ships to go from east to west and searches in wildernesses and on mountains (<i>harim</i>), he does not become wealthy. What is the meaning of (Ps. 75:7, cont.), “or from the wilderness that there comes an exaltation (<i>harim</i>)?” R. Abba Sanagoria says, “Every use of <i>harim</i> in Scripture denotes mountains except for here, where it denotes exaltation. Thus one is not exalted from these things.” So what does the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He takes possessions (<i>nekhasim</i>) from one and gives them to another, as stated (in Ps. 75:7, cont.), “For God it is who gives judgment; He brings down one man, He lifts up another.” That is why they are called<i> nekhasim</i>, as they are covered (<i>nikhsim</i>) from one and revealed to another. And why is the name of [common coins] called <i>zuzim</i>? Because they move (<i>zazim</i>) from one and are given to another. [It is called] money (<i>mammon</i>), because what you count (<i>mah [she’atah] moneh</i>) is not anything. [It is called] coins (<i>ma’ot</i>), because they are from time (<i>me’et</i>) to time.

What is written above (in Numb. 31:9)? “Then the children of Israel took the women and children of the Midianites captive, and all their cattle, all their livestock, and all their wealth they seized as plunder.” Then after that, it is written (in Numb. 32:1), “Now [the Children of Reuben and the Children of Gad] had much livestock.” See that He brought down the Midianites and raised up the Children of Reuben and the Children of Gad, to fulfill that which is stated, (in Ps. 75:8), “For it is not from the east or from the west…, for it is God who judges; He brings down one man, He lifts up another.”"

Since they received (accommodated) Israel, the Holy One, blessed be He, will give them their reward in the future. It is so stated (in Is. 35:1-2), “The arid desert shall be glad.... It shall blossom abundantly, it shall also exult....” And if the desert [will receive] such for receiving Israel; one who receives a Torah scholar into his home, all the more so [will he be rewarded].

[Then] all of Israel said, “Moses, our teacher, if these spies were two [or] three, it would be correct for us to trust [them], as stated (Deut. 17:6), ‘By the testimony of two witnesses....’ And behold, they are ten, (as in Deut. 1:28), ‘To where shall we go up?’” As it were, [they were complaining that] the Master of the house is not able to remove his vessels (the inhabitants) from there. What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He took the ministering angel of the land and bound him and put him down in front of them, as stated (Deut. 1:21), “See the Lord, your God, has placed in front of you....” And was [the land] in front of them? It is simply that He put down its ministering angel. And He said to them (in Deut. 1:21, cont.), “Go up and possess..., do not fear and do not tremble,” not from the Nephilim and not from the people that [you say] are bigger and more numerous than us. (Ezek. 45:1:) “When you allot the land as an inheritance....” This text is related (to Psalms 16:6), “Portions of land fell to me in pleasantness, even a beautiful inheritance for me.” “Portions of land fell to me.” These are the twelve tribes, since the land was divided to the twelve tribes, as stated (in Ezek. 47:13), “Thus said the Lord God, ‘These shall be the boundaries of the land that you shall allot to the twelve tribes of Israel.’” “In pleasantness,” in the merit of the Torah, about which it is stated (in Prov. 22:18), “As it is pleasant that you should store them in your belly....” “Even a beautiful inheritance for me.” There is a man who is handsome but his clothing is ugly, and one is ugly but his clothing handsome. But Israel is not like this. They are handsome and their clothing is handsome. They adorn the land and the Land of Israel adorns them. Hence it is stated (in Ps. 16:6), “Even a beautiful inheritance for me.” And so too is it stated (in Job 29:14), “I clothed myself in righteousness and it clothed me.”"

                "It is written (in Josh. 7:19), “Then Joshua said unto Achan, ‘My son, please give glory [to the Lord God of Israel and make a confession to Him; please tell me what you have done, do not hide it from me.]’” Achan said to him, “Am I to die because of this thing that you are saying ?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numb. R. 23:6.</i> When Achan saw [the situation], he said in his heart, “Now I shall be entrapped by the lot. Then I shall be found untrue (rt.: '<i>mn</i>) and deemed a liar before Joshua.” At that moment Achan said to Joshua, “Why are you casting lots between me and my house? Let me cast lots between you and Phinehas! If the lot comes up for both of you, I also shall believe (rt.: '<i>mn</i>) [in it].” At that moment (according to Josh. 7:19) Joshua said to Achan, “My son, please give glory to the Lord God of Israel [and make a confession to Him]. Please tell me what you have done.” Achan said to him, “You also tell me what you have done.” Immediately discord broke out in Israel, so that [Achan's] tribe of Judah arose in strife and killed one group in Israel after another. When Achan saw this, he said in his heart, “If anyone saves a single life in Israel, it is as though he had saved the entire world; yet in my case, it has been through me that several people in Israel have been killed. I am a sinner and one who causes [others] to sin. It is better [for me] to confess my transgression before the Holy One, blessed be He, and before Joshua, so that no calamity come about through me.” What did Achan do? He arose and made his voice heard, so that the whole congregation turned to him. He said to Joshua (in vs. 20), “’(Truly) I am the one who sinned before the Lord God of Israel; thus and so (literally, like this and like this) is what I have done.’ So it was not this alone, but I have already misappropriated other [things].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Gen. R. 85:14, according to which Achan had acted dishonestly in the person of his great grandfather, Zerah, the son of Judah by Tamar.</i> Joshua said to him, “Indeed I also knew that you were responsible for the situation; (Josh. 7:19:) ‘please tell me what you have done. Do not hide it from me.’” (Vs. 21:) “I saw among the spoils.” [He said,] “I have seen what is written in the Torah (in Deut. 20:14), ‘you may eat the spoils of your enemies.’” (Josh. 7:21, cont.:) “A fine <i>shinar</i> mantle.” [He continued,] “Now do not say that I am poor and in need, for there is no one in the tribe of Judah wealthier than I. Immediately (there follows vs. 22), “Then Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent.” For what reason did Joshua send them? So that the tribe of Judah would not steal them (i.e., the stolen articles) and continue in the discord. Joshua therefore sent quickly, and (according to vs. 23) “they brought them unto Joshua and unto all the Children of Israel; and they spread them out before the Lord.” What is the significance of “and they spread them out?” Joshua said in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the world, is it because of these that You have been angry with Your children? Here they are set before you.” Immediately [we read] (in vs. 24), “Then Joshua took Achan ben Zerah, the silver, the mantle, and the wedge of gold, together with his sons and his daughters,” [the latter] in order to teach them a lesson; “his ox, his ass, […] and his tent,” for burning. (Vs. 24, cont.:) “All Israel [Joshua took] with him,” to see his punishment so that they would not become accustomed to acting in this way. (Vs. 24, cont.:) “And they brought them up to the Valley of Achor (<i>akhor</i>; rt.: '<i>kr</i>).” (Vs. 25:) “Then Joshua said, ‘Just as you have afflicted (rt.: '<i>kr</i>) us, [may the Lord afflict (rt.: '<i>kr</i>) you] this day.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Without the bracketed words, the verse would read: HOW YOU HAVE AFFLICTED US THIS DAY!</i> This day [only] is he to be afflicted ('<i>akhur</i>; rt.: '<i>kr</i>), but he will have a share in the world to come. (Vs. 25, cont.:) “Then all Israel pelted him with stones,” him alone; “and they burned them with fire.” The text is speaking of his wealth, for so it had been told [Joshua] by the Almighty (in vs. 15), “And it shall come to pass that the one who has been seized with what has been proscribed shall be burned with fire....” If so, what do we learn from the verse (vs. 15, cont.), “him, and all that he has?” [This passage] is only to teach you that Achan had confessed that he had stolen them on the Sabbath, when he took them out of Jericho and buried them in the midst of his tent. Thus he was stoned for profaning the Sabbath and burned because he had transgressed the ban. And where is it shown? You find that the Holy One, blessed be He, said so to Joshua (in Josh. 6:2–4), “See, I have given Jericho into your hands, [along with its king and the mighty warriors. So you shall go around the city with all the men of war to encompass the city one time, thus shall you do for six days. …] but on the seventh day you shall go around the city seven times.” [This passage serves] to teach you that Jericho was conquered on the Sabbath. Now Joshua did this thing on his own, and the Holy One, blessed be He, gave his consent. Joshua said (to himself), “The Sabbath is holy, as stated (in Exod. 31:14), ‘You shall keep the Sabbath, because it is holy for you.’ So whatever we conquer on it shall be holy.” It is so stated (in Josh. 6:19), “But all the silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze and iron, are holy to the Lord.” And where is it shown that he received consent? Where it is stated (in Joshua 6:17), “The city and everything in it are to be proscribed for the Lord.” At that time (according to Josh. 7:26) “the Lord turned from His burning anger.” Concerning [this matter], it is stated (in Prov. 16:14), “The king's anger is like messengers of death, and whoever is wise will appease it.” This refers to Joshua, who caused the burning anger of the Lord to turn away from Israel."

It is the same with one who kills by mistake, when he goes into exile into the cities of refuge.” It is therefore stated (in Ps. 25:6), “Be mindful of Your mercies, O Lord, and of Your steadfast love….” When Moses arose, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to [him] (in Numb. 35:11), “You shall provide yourselves with cities [to be cities of refuge].” Moses said, “Master of the world, when someone takes a life by mistake in the south or in the north, how will he know where the cities of refuge are, that he should flee to it?” He said to him (in Deut. 19:3), “’You yourself shall prepare (rt.: <i>tkn</i>) the road (<i>derekh</i>).’ You yourself shall make the roads [to these cities] straight (rt.: <i>tkn</i>), so that [anyone fleeing to them] will not go astray for the blood avenger to find him and kill him, when (according to Deut 19:6) ‘he did not incur the death penalty.’” He said to him, “How?” He said to him, “Erect road markers<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>stelai</i>; Lat.: <i>stelae.</i></i> directing (rt.: <i>tkn</i>) [such a refugee] to the cities of refuge, so that he will know how to go there; and on every marker inscribe, ‘[Involuntary] killers to the cities of refuge,’ as stated (in Deut. 19:3), ‘You yourself shall prepare (rt.: <i>tkn</i>) the road (<i>derekh</i>).’” Thus David has said (in Ps. 25:8), “The Lord is good and straightforward; therefore He instructs sinners in the way (<i>derekh</i>).” [Now] if for killers He has made a way and a road (<i>derekh</i>; rt.: <i>drk</i>), for them to flee and escape death), how much the more so in the case of the righteous.

If someone goes and kills on purpose, then says, “It was by mistake that I killed,” and flees to [one of the] cities of refuge, the Holy One, blessed be He, says, “Even if he comes in and flees to My altar, kill him, according to what is stated (in Exod. 21:14), ‘[But when someone plots against his companion and kills him treacherously], you shall take him away [even] from My altar [for execution].’” Who was this person who fled to the altar and was killed? This was Joab, of whom it is stated (in I Kings 2:28), “When the news came to Joab,… [Joab fled unto the tent of the Lord and seized the horns of the altar].” You find that Joab was a great sage and the head of the Sanhedrin,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>Synehedrion.</i></i> as stated (in II Sam. 23:8), “one who sits in the seat of wisdom.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These words are commonly understood as the proper name, JOSHEB-BASSHEBETH, A TAHCHEMONITE, but this and other citations of the verse in rabbinic literature tend to understand the verse as translated here.

It is better to die here, so that I may be buried with my ancestors.” (I Kings 2:30–31:) “Then Benaiah brought back word unto the king.... So the king said to him, ‘Do as he has spoken, strike him down and bury him.’” Why was he killed? Because his (Solomon's) father, David, had ordered him [to do] so (in I Kings 2:5), “Moreover, you also know what Joab ben Zeruiah did to me.” What did he do to him? You find that, when David wrote to Joab (in II Sam. 11:15), “Set Uriah in the front line [where the fighting is the fiercest]...,” he did so, and he was killed. All the army leaders assembled against Joab, as [Uriah] was the head of the warriors, as stated of him (in II Sam. 23:39), “Uriah the Hittite, [was one of all] thirty-seven [leaders].” He showed them the document. It is therefore stated (in I Kings 2:5), “What Joab ben Zeruiah] did to me.” (I Kings 2:5, cont.:) “And what he did to the two commanders of Israel's forces, to Abner ben Ner and to Amasa ben Jether, he killed them.” All of Israel had been of the opinion that David had ordered him to kill [Abner] because Abner was Saul's cousin. And for that reason David arose and cursed Joab, when he said (in II Sam. 3:29), “may the house of Joab never lack [one with a discharge, a leper, one who grasps the crutch,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Modern translations commonly understand these words to mean, A MALE WHO HANDLES THE SPINDLE, but the midrash understands them in the sense given here.</i> one who falls by the sword, and one lacking bread].” Then all Israel was appeased,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rt.: <i>PYS.</i> Cf.

Therefore (according to vs. 24), “they inflicted judgments on Joash.” Now for what was Abner punished? It was because he had made light and an amusement (rt.: <i>shq</i>), the blood of the young men, as stated (in II Sam. 2:14), “Then Abner said unto Joab, ‘Please let the young men arise and play (rt.: <i>shq</i>) before us.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The result of their “playing” was that they all killed each other.</i> And there are also those who say it was because he put his name before the name of David, as stated (in II Sam. 3:12), “Then Abner sent messengers unto David where he was, saying, ‘To whom does the land belong?’” But the sages say, “It was because he did not let Saul be reconciled with David.” And our masters say, “He had the power to protest [the massacre] at Nob, the city of priests, and did not protest.”"

All the miracles that he did for Israel in the wilderness, He is likewise going to do in Zion. It is written concerning the wilderness (ibid.), “These are the words;” and it is written concerning Zion (in Is. 42:16), “I will turn darkness before them into light and rough places into level ground. These things (<i>elleh hadevarim</i>) I will do, and I will not forsake them.” It is written concerning the wilderness (in Exod. 20:15), “Now all the people saw the thunderings (<i>qol</i> in the plural)”; and it is written concerning Zion (in Jer. 33:11), “The sound (<i>qol</i>) of joy and the sound (<i>qol</i>) of gladness, [the voice (<i>qol</i>) of the bridegroom and the voice (<i>qol</i>) of the bride].” It is written concerning the wilderness (in Ps. 68:9), “The earth quaked”; and it is written concerning Zion (in Hag. 2:6), “I will cause the heavens and the earth to quake.” It is written concerning the wilderness (in Exod. 13:21), “And the Lord went before them by day”; and it is written concerning Zion (in Is. 52:12), “for the Lord shall go before you.” It is written concerning the wilderness (in Deut. 30:9), “for the Lord shall be glad over you again”; and it is written concerning Zion (in Is. 65:19), “I will also rejoice in Jerusalem and be glad in My people.” [Also (according to Is. 35:1),] “The wilderness and the arid land shall be glad.” What did Isaiah see to say this? It is simply that, when Israel transgressed the Torah, Hosea arose and said (in Hos. 2:5), “I will make her like a wilderness and render her like an arid land.” For that reason Isaiah has said (in Is. 35:1), “The wilderness and the arid land shall be glad.” Now all the consolations of which Isaiah spoke are double, because (according to Is. 40:2) “she (i.e., Jerusalem) has received from the hand of the Lord double for all her sins.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lam.

To teach you that when the Holy One, blessed be He, reveals His Divine Presence over Israel, He does not reveal it all to them on one occasion, because they would not have been able to persevere in this bounty all at once; for if He had revealed His bounty to them at one time, they would all have died. See what is written (in Is. 64:3), “From time immemorial they have not heard, nor has an ear perceived, nor has an eye seen a God besides you, who works for those who wait for him.” Go and learn from Joseph; for when he made himself known to his brothers after so many years, [when] Joseph said to them (in Gen. 45:3), “I am Joseph,” they all died, “and they could not answer him; [for they were dismayed because of him].” How much the more [would Israel be dismayed] at [a sudden revelation of] the Holy One, blessed be He! So what does the Holy One, blessed be He, do for them instead? He reveals himself to them little by little. At the beginning, He makes the mountains glad, as stated (in Is. 35:1), “The wilderness and the arid land shall be glad.” Then after that (ibid.), “the steppes shall rejoice […].” Then after that (in vs. 2), “It shall bloom abundantly.” Then after that (ibid.), “the glory of Lebanon shall be given to it.” Then after that (ibid.), “they shall see the glory of the Lord, the splendor of our God.” For that reason David said (in Ps. 102:17), “For the Lord has built up Zion; He has appeared in His glory.” It also says (in Is. 52:8), “for eye to eye they will see the return of the Lord to Zion.” And it also says (in Is. 25:9), “In that day they shall say, ‘See, this is our God; we waited for Him, and He delivered us; [this is the Lord; we waited for Him, let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation.’”"

He perishes forever, like his dung….” With reference to whom did Job say this verse? It only speaks with reference to the day of death. So even though one ascends to the heavens and makes himself wings like a bird; when his time to die arrives, his wings are broken, and he falls before the angel of death like an animal before the butcher.

First you said, (in Exod. 4:13) ‘Please make someone else your agent’; secondly (in Exod. 5:23), ‘For ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, [he has dealt worse with this people, and You have still not delivered Your people]’; thirdly (in Numb. 11:22) ‘If the sheep and cattle would be slaughtered for them , would it be [enough] for them’; fourthly (in Numb. 16:29), ‘The Lord did not send me’; fifthly (in Numb. 20:10), ‘Listen, you rebels, [shall we bring forth water for you from this rock]’;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, the note at the end of Exod. 1:20.</i> sixth (in Numb. 32:14), ‘And now you brood of sinners have arisen in place of your ancestors.’ But were Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob sinners, for you to say this to their children?” He said to Him, “I have learned so from You, when you said (in Numb. 17:3), ‘The censers of these who have sinned [at the cost of their lives].’ He said to him, “I said (ibid.), ‘At the cost of their lives,’ and not, ‘at the cost of their ancestors.’” He said in front of Him, “I am an individual, while Israel numbers sixty myriads (i.e., 600,000). They have sinned before You a lot of times; and when I sought mercy on their behalf, You forgave them. You took care of sixty myriads [because of me], yet You are not taking care of me.” He said to him, “Moses, a decree over a community is not like a decree over an individual. Furthermore, up to now [the] time was delivered into your hands, but from now [the] time is not delivered into your hands.” He said to Him, “Master of the universe, rise up from the seat of judgment and sit down upon the seat of mercy for me, so that I do not die. Then my sins shall be forgiven through torments which You shall bring on my body. So do not deliver me to the pangs of the angel of death. Moreover, if You do this, I will proclaim Your praise to all who come into the world, just as David has said (in Ps. 118:17), ‘I shall not die, but live [and recount the works of the Lord].’” He said to him (in vs. 20), “This is the gate of the Lord; the righteous shall come through it.” [From this it follows that] death has been ordained from time immemorial for the righteous and for all mortals. When Moses saw that they paid no attention to him, he went to the heaven and earth, where he said to them, “Seek mercy for me.” They said to him, “Before seeking mercy for you, we should seek mercy for ourselves, since it is stated (in Is. 51:6), ‘for the heavens shall vanish like smoke, and the earth shall wear out like a garment.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See ‘<i>AZ</i> 17a, for this verse applied to Eleazar ben Dordia in a similar way.</i> He went to the stars and planets.

He said to them, “Seek mercy for me.” They said to him, “[Before seeking mercy for you,] we should seek mercy for ourselves, since it is stated (in Is. 54:10), ‘For the mountains shall move, and the hills shall be shaken.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The translation of the verb tenses here differs from some biblical translations but fits the sense of the midrash.</i> He went to the Great Sea. He said to it, “Seek mercy for me.” [The sea] said to him, “Son of Amram, how is today different from a couple of [other] days? Are you not the son of Amram, who came upon me with your rod, smote me, and divided me into twelve parts? For I was unable to stand before you because the Divine Presence was walking at your right hand. It is so stated (in Is. 63:12), ‘Who had His glorious arm walk at the right hand of Moses, who divided the waters before them […].’ So what has happened to you today?” When the sea reminded him what he had done in his youth, he cried out and said (in Job 29:2), “’O that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me!’ When I passed through you, I was a world king; but now I am prostrate, and they pay no attention to me.” Immediately he betook himself to the arch[angel] of the [Divine] Presence and said to him, “Seek mercy for me, that I not die.” He said to him, “My master, Moses, why the exertion? This is what I have heard from behind the curtain:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Pargod.</i> Cf. Lat.: <i>paragauda</i> or [paragaudis] (a garment with a lace border); Gk.: <i>Paragaudes</i> (a garment with a purple border).</i> That your prayer is not heard on this matter.” Putting his hands on his head, Moses sobbed and wept, as he said, “With whom shall I seek mercy for myself?” R. Simlay said, “At that time the Holy One, blessed be He, was full of anger over him, as stated (in Deut. 3:26), ‘But the Lord was angry with me […],’ until Moses began by uttering this Scripture (Exod. 34:6): ‘Then the Lord passed before him and proclaimed, “the Lord, the Lord is a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger…].’” Immediately the holy spirit was cooled off.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “Moses, I have sworn two oaths, one that you should die and one to destroy Israel. To repeal both of them is impossible; so if you want to live, Israel will be destroyed.” He said before Him, “You are coming to me with a plot. You are seizing the rope at both ends. Let Moses and a thousand like him be destroyed, but do not let one person in Israel be destroyed.” He said to him, “Master of the Universe, should feet that have climbed up to the firmament, should a face that has greeted the Divine Presence, should hands that have received Torah from Your hands lick the dust? Woe!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Vay.</i></i> All mortals will say, “If Moses, who ascended on high, became like the ministering angels, spoke with Him face to face, and received Torah from His hand, had no reply for responding to the Holy One, blessed be He, how much the worse it will be for [mere] flesh and blood, who comes with no [merit from] Torah and with no [merit from the] commandments?” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “Why all this anguish that you are experiencing?” He said, “Master of the world, I am afraid of the pangs of the angel of death.” He said to him, “I am not delivering you into his hands.” He said in front of Him, “Master of the universe, my mother Jochebed, who was distressed (literally, whose teeth were blunted) during her lifetime by two of her sons, will be distressed by my death.” He said to him, “So has it come up in [My] mind, and so is it the way of the world: every generation with its expositors, every generation with its administrators,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>pronoi</i> (“prudent ones”).</i> every generation with its leaders. Up to now it has been your lot to serve in front of Me, but now your lot is over and the time of your disciple Joshua for him to serve [Me] has arrived.” He said to him, “My Master, if I am dying because of Joshua, let me go and become his disciple!” He said to him, “If you want to do that, go and do it.” Moses arose and went early to Joshua's door.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. the somewhat different account in Deut. R. 9:9.</i> Now Joshua was seated expounding [Torah], so Moses stopped to bend his stature and put his hand on his mouth. But Joshua's eyes were hidden, and he did not see him, so that he (Moses) would be sorrowful and resign himself to death. When Israel came to Moses' door to study Torah, they asked and said, “Where did Moshe our master [go]?” [Others] said to them, “He got up early and went to the door of Joshua.” [So] they went and found him at the door of Joshua, with Joshua sitting and Moses standing. They said to Joshua, “What has come over you that Moses our master stands, while you sit?” When he raised his eyes and saw him, he immediately rent his clothes. Then sobbing and weeping, he said, “O my master, my master! My father, my father and lord!” Israel said to Moses, “Moses our master, teach us Torah.” He said to them, “I am not allowed.” They said to him, “We are not leaving you.” A heavenly voice (<i>bat qol</i>) came forth and said to them, “Learn from Joshua.” [So] they took upon themselves to sit and learn from the mouth of Joshua. Joshua sat at the head with Moses to his right and with [Elazar and Ithamar] to his left. So he sat and expounded in the presence of Moses. R. Samuel bar Nahmani said that R. Johanan said, “When Joshua opened by saying, ‘Blessed be the One who has chosen the righteous,” they took the traditions of wisdom from Moses and gave them to Joshua. Now Moses did not know what Joshua was expounding. After Israel arose [from the session], they said to Moses, “[Explain] the Torah [we have just heard] to us.” He said to them, “I do not know what to answer you.” So Moses our master was stumbling and falling. It was at that time that he said, “Master of the universe, up to now I requested life, but now here is my soul given over to You.” Then when he had resigned himself to death, the Holy One, blessed be He, opened by saying (in Ps. 94:16), “’Who will stand for Me<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In context, the word, me, here is self-referential to the author of Psalms, and not referring to God.</i> against evildoers?’ Who will stand for Israel in the time of My wrath? Who will stand in the battle of My children? And who will stand and seek mercy for them, when they sin before Me?” At that time Metatron<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lat.: <i>metator</i> (“measurer,” “one who marks out boundaries”).</i> came and fell on his face. He said to Him, “Master of the world, [as] in Moses' life he belonged to You, so in his death he belongs to You.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “Let me give you a parable. To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had a son. Now on each and every day, his father was angry with him and sought to kill him because he did not maintain respect for the father; but his mother rescued him from his hand. One day his mother died and the king wept. His servants said to him, ‘Our lord king, why are you weeping?’ He said to them, ‘It is not over my wife alone that I am weeping, but for my son; for many times when I was angry with him and wanted to kill him, did she rescue him from my hand?’” So also did the Holy One, blessed be He, say to Metatron, “It is not over Moses alone that I am weeping, but over him and over Israel, for look at how many times that they angered Me, and I was angry with them; but he stood in the breach before Me to turn back My anger from destroying them.” They came and said to Moses, “The hour has arrived for you to depart from the world.” He said to them, “Wait for me until I bless Israel, for they have not found contentment from me all my days, because of the rebukes and warnings with which I rebuked them.” He began to bless each tribe separately. When he saw that the time was growing short, he included all of them in a single blessing. They came and said, “The hour has arrived for your soul to depart from the world.” He said to Israel, “I have caused you a lot of grief over the Torah and over the commandments, but now forgive me.” They said to him, “Our lord master, you are forgiven.” Israel also arose before him and said to him, “O Moses our master, we have angered you a lot and increased the burden upon you. Forgive us.” He said to them, “You are forgiven.” They came and said to him, “The moment has arrived for you to depart from the world.” He said, “Blessed be the name of the One who lives and abides forever.” He said to Israel, “If you please, when you enter the land, remember me and my bones, and you shall say, ‘Woe (<i>oy</i>) to the son of Amram, who ran before us like a horse but whose bones have fallen in the wilderness.’” They came and said to him, “The half moment has arrived.” He took his two arms and placed them on his heart. Then he said to Israel, “See the final end of flesh and blood.” They answered and said, “The hands which received the Torah from the mouth of the Almighty shall fall to the grave.” At that moment his soul departed with a kiss (from the Holy One, blessed be He),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>MQ</i> 28a.</i> as stated (in Deut. 34:5), “Then Moses [the servant of the Lord] died there [in the Land of Moab at the command of the Lord (literally, by the mouth of the Lord)].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>BB</i> 17a; <i>ARN</i>, A 12:2; Cant.

From Moshe. When Israel left Egypt, what is written? \"And Moses took the bones of Yosef with him\" (Exodus 13:19). All of the people were involved in the plunder and he was taking care of Yosef's bones. He went and stood among the coffins.

Moshe departed in the wilderness and did not enter the Land. [So] Israel brought in Yosef's bones and buried them. And the commandment was draped upon them, as it is stated (Joshua 24:32), \"The bones of Joseph, which the Children of Israel had brought up from Egypt, were buried at Shekhem.\" Therefore He said to them, \"All of the commandment.\" Rabbi Yannai said, \"Anyone who begins a commandment but does not finish it will bury his wife and two of his sons.\" From who do you learn [this]?

He said to them, \"We are going to kill our brother and then recite a blessing [over the bread]?\" As it is stated (Psalms 10:3), \"the one that loots (<i>botsea</i>) and blesses reviles the Lord.\" Hence is it written, \"What gain, etc.\" \"Come, let us sell him to the Yishmaelites\" (Genesis 37:27). And they listened to him, as he was a king. And had he said to them to bring him back to his father, they would have listened to him. But rather he began with the commandment and did not finish it.

Give ear, O my people, to my Torah […].” And it is written (in Deut. 4:9-10), “Only take heed to yourself and watch [yourself closely, lest you forget the things that your eyes have seen and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life; make them known to your children and to your children's children]: The day that you stood [before the Lord your God at Horeb]….” [This is] to tell you that [when] anyone despises the words of Torah, it is as though he were denying the Holy One, blessed be He,, because He only bestowed Torah so that Israel would be occupied with it day and night, as stated (in Josh. 1:8), “and you shall meditate on it (i.e., on the Torah) day and night.” And it is written (in Ps. 1:2), “But their delight is in the law (<i>Torah</i>) of the Lord, [and on his law (<i>Torah</i>) they meditate day and night].” And when anyone occupies himself with the Torah and fulfills it, [it is] as though he had received it from Sinai. It is therefore written (in Deut. 4:9), “make them known to your children […],” and adjacent to it (in Deut. 4:10), “The day that you stood before the Lord your God….” When Asaph came, he began to say (in Ps. 78:1) “Give ear, O my people, to my Torah.” So also did Solomon say (in Prov. 4:2), “For I gave you good instruction; [do not abandon my Torah].” Israel said to Asaph, “Is there another Torah, such that you say (in Ps. 78:1), ‘Give ear, O my people, to my Torah?’ We have already received it from Mount Sinai.” He said to them, “The sinners of Israel say that the Prophets and the Writings are not Torah, and they do not believe in them, as stated (in Dan. 9:10), “And we have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God by walking in His Torah, which He set before us at the hand of His servants the prophets.” Ergo, the Prophets and the Writings are Torah.

[The father] said, 'For the one who praises me.' [The son continued asking,] 'And for whom are the swords?' [The father answered,] 'For the one that rebels against me.' So [too,] the Holy One, blessed be He, shows them blessings and curses, and they see that the blessings are few and the curses are many.\" Another interpretation: The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, \"If you do My will - even though the the blessings are few - I will increase them for you, and I will not bring the curses upon you. There is a [relevant] parable about a king who took on a servant with a contract. And he wrote in the contract, \"If you do my will and serve me as is fit, I will give you food, drink and clothing like the rest of my servants. But if you do not do my will, I will not give you food and I will not give you drink, but I will rather put you in shackles and put you in prison.\" [So] the servant entered [into the contract] and did his will more than he stipulated. What did the servant do [afterwards]? He stopped doing the will of his master. His master said to him, \"I stipulated with you that I would shackle you and kill you. By your life, I will make a compromise with you.\" So is it with Israel. The Holy One, blessed be He, wrote about them (Leviticus 26:3), \"If you walk in my statutes,\" I will bring you these blessings. But if not, I will bring the curses upon you, as it is stated (I Kings 8:56), \"Not one thing of all of His good word shall fail.\" And when Israel sinned in the days of Yirmiyahu, the Holy One, blessed be He, said, \"I stipulated with you that I would bring the curses upon you. [But] I know that you do not have the ability to withstand them. Rather I will make a compromise with you.\" Rabbi Abba said that Rabbi Yirmiyah said, \"'The Lord has done what He purposed, He has carried out His word' (Lamentations 2:17). 'He has carried out,' He has made a compromise with them.\" Hence it is written (Deuteronomy 11:26), \"See I, etc.\" The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, \"In this world I have ordered in front of you blessings and curses, the good and the bad. But in the world to come, I will remove the curses and the bad from you and I will bless you. And all who shall see you shall say that you are a blessed people, as stated (Isaiah 61:9), 'Their offspring shall be known among the nations, their descendants in the midst of the peoples; all who see them shall recognize that they are a stock the Lord has blessed.'\""

When the Holy One, blessed be He, said to them to bring a freewill offering, what is written there? \"These continued to bring freewill offerings to [Moshe] morning after morning\" (Exodus 36:3), two mornings.

If they are victorious, they come and make a crown and crown him.

Og, king of Bashan.\" But He gave the crown to Israel, as it is stated (Joshua 12:5), \"Moshe, the servant of God, and Israel smote them.\" And so [too], with Yehoshua, what is written? \"And the Lord hurled huge stones on them from the sky\" (Joshua 10:11).

But they did not go in immediately. As when they left from Egypt, the seven nations [inhabiting the land] heard that [the Israelites] were coming to inherit [the land]. What did they do? They cut down the trees, stopped up the springs and destroyed the homes, such that if [the Israelites] would enter, they would find nothing [worthwhile there]. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, \"If I bring them in right away, they will find it desolate, and I promised them that they would find it full of all of good things.\" What did He do? He held them up in the wilderness forty years, such that the Canaanites disregarded Israel, saying they are not coming. [Hence] they rose and planted trees, they fixed the wells and the cities, such that Israel would come when it was built, to fulfill that which is stated (Deuteronomy 6:11), \"Houses full of all good things.\" This is [the meaning of] that which is written (Exodus 13:17), \"God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines.\" Once they fixed everything, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moshe, \"Why are you standing? 'Go up from here, you and the people' (Exodus 33:1).

Avraham wanted it, as so does it state (Genesis 15:8), \"And he said, 'O Lord God, how shall I know that I am to possess it?'\" Yitschak wanted it, as it was stated to him (Genesis 26:3), \"Reside in this land, and I will be with you and bless you, for I will assign all these lands to you and to your seed.\" And Yaakov wanted it, as it is stated (Genesis 28:20-21), \"If God will be with me, etc. I will return to my father’s house.\" Rabbi Yehudah said, \"Moshe also wanted it, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 3:23-25), 'I pleaded with the Lord at that time,  \"[...].

Just like a gazelle is light in its running, so does the Land of Israel run its fruits, such that it gives fruit first. Another interpretation: Just like the skin of a gazelle cannot hold its flesh, so [too], when Israel merits, the Land of Israel cannot hold its fruit. \"Of the beauties (<i>tsivaot</i>) of the nations\" (Jeremiah 3:19). That the delights (<i>tsivionot</i>) of the nations are in it.

                "(Deut. 12:29:) When the Lord God has cut off the nations.” A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who planted a vineyard within his field, but within [that field] were great cedars and thorns. The king went and cut down the cedars and left the thorns. His servants said to him, “Our lord king, the thorns which catch our clothes you have left [standing]; but you have cut down the cedars?” He said to them, “If I had left the cedars and cut down the thornbushes, how should I have fenced in my vineyard. So also Israel is the vineyard of the Holy One, blessed be He, as stated (in Is. 5:7), “For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the House of Israel.” He brought Israel into the land and cut down the cedars that were in it, as stated (in Amos 2:9), “Yet I destroyed the Amorites before you, whose stature was like the cedars in height.” But he left their children and their children's children so that Israel would observe the Torah, as stated (in Jud. 3:1), “Now these are the nations which the Lord left to test Israel,” “whether they are keeping the commandments of the Lord” (Jud. 2:22). So when the vineyard stands in its place in the service of the Torah, then (according to Is. 33:12) “The peoples shall become burnings of lime, thorns cut down that are burned in the fire].” It is also written (in Is. 40:17), “All the nations are as nothing before Him….” And so do you find when Israel left Egypt.

See how many multitudes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: ochloi.</i> went out with Pharaoh! When Israel saw them, they were terrified before them.

Isaac interpreted the verse (Prov. 28:22) with reference to the one who lends to an Israelite at interest and is too miserly to lend it without interest, and (Prov. 8:22) “he does not know that loss will come to him”; that it is written (in Prov. 28:8), “The one who augments his wealth by interest and usury amasses it for one who is generous to the poor.” Who is the one that is generous to the poor? This is Esau the wicked. Is Esau the wicked generous to the poor? Rather does he not oppress the poor? He is like those procurators who go out to the villages and plunder tenants. Then they go back to the capital and say, “Gather the poor, because we want to perform a good act for them.” The [Aramaic] adage says, “[She commits adultery] for apples, and distributes [them] to the sick.” R. Levi interpreted the verse (i.e., Prov. 28:22) with reference to the person who does not take out his tithes properly. To this end R. Levi told a story about someone who did take out his tithes properly: Now he had a certain field that produced a thousand measures every year. So he took a hundred measures from it for his tithes; and from the remainder he and the children of his household sustained themselves all of his days. At the time of his death, he summoned his son. He said to him, “My son, give your attention to this field. It yields such and such [a number of] measures, and I take out such and such a tithe. From it I have sustained myself and my household all my days.” When that son planted it the first year, it produced a thousand measures, and he took out a hundred measures from it for the tithe. For the second year, an evil eye (i.e., of greed) entered within him. So he subtracted ten [measures from the tithe], but [the field] subtracted one hundred [measures from its yield]. Similarly also [on the third, fourth, and fifth [years], until it was reduced to its tithes. When kinfolk and friends saw [what was happening], they put on white (i.e., festive) [tunics] and wrapped themselves in white [mantles]. [When] they came to him, he said to them, “Why have you come? To rejoice over the very one who has been excommunicated [by the Heavens]?” They said to him, “God forbid! We have only come to rejoice with you. In the past you were the owner of the house, and the Holy One, blessed be He, was the priest; but now the Holy One, blessed be He, has become the owner of the house, and you are the priest.” For that reason Moses warned Israel (in Deut. 14:22), “You shall surely tithe.”"

                "Another explanation (of Deut. 14:22), “You shall tithe, tithe.” This is related to the verse (in Is. 24:5), “And the earth was distorted under its inhabitants, because they transgressed Torahs;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Torot.</i> Such a literal translation is required by the midrash. In the biblical context the word denotes something more general, such as teachings.</i> they violated a statute; [they broke an eternal covenant].” R. Isaac said, “You have already been false to it, and [so] it is distorted for you. It [may] show you standing grain, but it does not show you a shock of sheaves. It [may] show you [a shock of sheaves, but it does not show you a threshing floor]. It [may] show you a threshing floor, but it does not show you a winnowed heap. Why [not]? (Ibid.:) ‘Because they transgressed Torahs; they violated statutes,’ in that they did transgress two Torahs, the written Torah and the oral Torah; (ibid.) ‘they violated a statute,’ the statute of tithes; (ibid.) ‘they broke an eternal covenant,’ an ancestral covenant.” For that reason Moses warned Israel (in Deut. 14:22), “You shall surely tithe.” (Prov. 6:20:) “My child, keep your father's commandments, [and do not forsake the Torah of your mother].” R. Huna said, “Our earliest ancestors separated out <i>terumot</i> and tithes.” Abraham separated out the great <i>terumah,</i> as stated (in Gen. 14:22), “[Then Abram said unto the king of Sodom,] ‘I have lifted up my hand unto the Lord, God most high.’” A lifting up is nothing but a <i>terumah</i> (rt.: <i>rwm</i>), as you say (in Numb. 18:26), “[Now you shall speak unto the Levites and say unto them, ‘When you receive tithes from the Children of Israel, the tithe that I have given you as your portion,] you shall lift (rt.: <i>rwm</i>) out of it a <i>terumah</i> of the Lord, [a tithe from the tithe].’” Isaac separated out the second tithe, as stated (in Gen. 26:12), “So Isaac sowed on that land and reaped in that year a hundredfold, [for the Lord had blessed him]”; R. Eiba bar Kahana said, “Is it not true that a blessing does not rest on what is measured, on what is weighed, or on what is counted? So why did he measure them? In order to tithe them. This is what is written (ibid.), ‘for the Lord had blessed him.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Deut. 14:24, which mentions a blessing in the context of the second tithe; therefore, perhaps the blessing of Gen. 26:12 would have been the result of Isaac’s second tithe.</i> Jacob separated out the first tithe, as stated (in Gen. 28:22), “and of all that You give me, I will surely set aside a tithe for You.” A certain Cuthean (i.e., a Samaritan) came and questioned R. Meir. He said to him, “Do you not say that indeed your ancestor Jacob is truthful?” He said [back] to him, “Yes, as it is written (in Micah 7:20), ‘You give truthfulness to Jacob.’” [The Cuthean] said to him, “He separated out the tribe of Levi [as a tithe] for the tribes, [i.e.,] one out of ten. Should he not have separated out [a tithe] from two more [tribes]?” R. Meir said to him, “You have said that there were twelve, but I say that there were fourteen, as stated (in Gen. 48:5), ‘Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine like Reuben and Simeon.’” He said to him, “So here you are supporting me. You have added flour. Have you added water?” He said to him, “Do you not admit that there are four matriarchs that had four first-borns? Take away from [the fourteen] the four firstborn (of Jacob's four wives), since the firstborn is not tithed. Why? Because he is holy, and something holy does not redeem for use something [else that is] holy.” He said to him, ‘It is good for your people that you are among them.” Hence it is written (Prov. 6:20), “and do not forsake the Torah of your mother (<i>immekha</i>),” [i.e.,] your people (<i>ummatekha</i>). That is what David said (in Ps. 40:9), “To carry out Your will, my God, is my desire, [for Your Torah is within my belly].” R. Aha bar Ulla said, “Is there Torah within the belly? And is it not so written (in Jer. 31:33), ‘and upon their heart (not their belly) I will write it?’ It is simply that David said, ‘May [a curse] come upon me, if something goes down into my belly, except when it is tithed.’ This is what is written (in I Chron. 27:25), ‘And over the treasuries of the king was Azmaveth ben Adiel; and over the treasuries in the country in the cities, in the villages, and in the towers was Jonathan ben Uzziah.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, David was concerned enough about tithes to appoint overseers.</i> For that reason Moses warned Israel (in Deut. 14:22), “You shall surely tithe.”"

Simeon ben Halafta said, “It is comparable to one who had a bondmaid for sale in the bazaar. When someone passed by and saw her, he said, ‘She is mine.’ He said to him, ‘Rebuke her. If she heeds you, she is yours; but if not she is not yours.’ Similarly the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Job, ‘It is written of Me (in Ps. 104:32), “Who (i.e., the Lord) looks on the earth and it trembles.” Yet you say (in Job 31:38), “If my land cries out against me.” Is it your handiwork?’” At that time Job said, “Master of the universe, I did not say that. Rather [what I meant by the words, ‘If <i>my</i> land cries out against me,’ was] if I did not take out its tithes properly; (ibid., cont.:) ‘and [if] its furrows weep together’ [means] if I planted it [unlawfully] with mixed seeds. (Job 31:39:) ‘If I have eaten its produce without payment (literally, without money),’ this refers to the second tithe, as stated (in Deut. 14:25), ‘Then you shall convert it into money […]’; (Job 31:39, cont.) ‘and disappointed its owners,’ this refers to the tithe for the poor.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash identifies the OWNERS of Job 31:39 with the poor who actually work the land.</i> If I have not done [all] this, (then in vs. 40), ‘May thorns come up instead of wheat […].’” R.

[What is the reason (evidence)?] That which is written (in Job 31:40), ‘May thorns come up instead of wheat, and stinkweed instead of barley.’” (Ibid., cont.:) “The words of Job are ended.” Up to here, Job foresees and prophesies any number of prophecies, and [here] you say, “The words of Job are ended?” It is simply that Job was saying, “If I have not fulfilled these [conditions] (of vss. 38-39), may my words be ended, and let me not have a pretext for saying to you (in Deut. 26:13 regarding the second tithe), ‘I have removed the consecrated portion from the house.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>MSh</i> 5:10.</i> For that reason Moses warned Israel (in Deut. 14:22), “You shall surely tithe.”"

It is also written (in Is. 1:21), “she (i.e., Jerusalem) was full of justice, there righteousness dwelt; but now murderers.” Because “she was full of justice, there righteousness dwelt.” For this reason, Jeremiah said to them (in Lam. 4:12-13), “The kings of the earth did not believe, [… that foe or enemy would come through the gates of Jerusalem]. It was for the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests [who shed the blood of the righteous in her midst].” At that time the Holy One, blessed be He, swore that He Himself would exact retribution from the judges, as stated (in Is. 1:24), “Therefore thus says the Lord, the Lord of hosts, the Most Mighty of Israel, [‘Ah, I will exact vengeance from my foes]….’” Now “therefore” can only be a term [related to] an oath, since it is stated (in I Sam. 3:14), “And I therefore swear to the house of Eli.” Moreover, mighty can only be a term for the <i>av bet din</i> (head of the court)<i>,</i> since it is stated (in I Sam. 21:8), “the most mighty of the shepherds [that belong to Saul].” [This is] to teach you that the Holy One, blessed be He, became an <i>av bet din</i> in order to exact vengeance from them. And where is it shown that the text is speaking about judges? See what is written after it (in Is. 1:26), “And I will restore your judges as in the beginning.” Therefore David has said (in Ps. 147:19), “He declares His words to Jacob, [His statutes and His ordinances to Israel].”"

He saddled his donkey and went to a province and he did not ask of the idolatry. He entered the province and its priest was standing at the entrance of the province. When he entered, he saw them and was immediately afraid. He descended from the donkey and the donkey fled. The [people] that were standing there came down and he became frightened of them. [But] they stood him upright, supported him and said, \"This old man fell.\" They [then] immediately brought him to his donkey, and [so] he entered in peace and left in peace. What caused him this? Because he held on to the Torah. Hence, \"As those nations that you are about to dispossess listen to soothsayers and augurs, but the Lord your God did not give like this to you.\" There is a story about Rabbi Yannai and Rabbi Yochanan who were sitting at the entrance of Teveriya.

Now they are coming and doing to us like what we did to them, as we have killed their first-born and taken their money.

He said to them, 'You do not need [to do anything], but you should stand and be silent and the Holy One, blessed be He will [fight] your wars,' as it is stated (Exodus 14:14), 'The Lord will fight for you and you shall be quiet.' That is [the meaning of] 'and the Children of Israel yelled out' (Exodus 14.10).\" Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said, \"To what is this matter comparable? To the daughter of a king that was passing on a road, and brigands took her as a [captive]. She began to yell out to the king. The king said, 'This is what I desired.' So [too] with Israel. They were subjugated in Egypt [and] placed their eyes towards the Heavens, as it is stated (Exodus 2:23), 'and the Children of Israel groaned from the work and screamed.' [So] the Holy One, blessed be He, took them out and desired to hear their prayer [again]. But they did not pray. What did He do?  He agitated Pharaoh and his army against them and they pursued them. As it is stated (Exodus 14:10), 'As Pharaoh drew close (<i>hikriv</i>).' As he drew the Children of Israel close to prayer. Immediately, 'and the Children of Israel cried out to the Lord.'\" Hence it is written, \"O my dove, in the cranny of the rocks, hidden by the cliff, let me see your appearance, let me hear your voice,\" that same voice that I heard in Egypt. Immediately the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moshe (Exodus 14:16), \"And you lift up your rod and hold out your arm over the sea and split it, so that the Children of Israel may come into the sea on dry ground.\" And the Holy One, blessed be He, made war with Pharaoh, destroyed [his army], trounced them in the sea and saved Israel. That is [the meaning of] that which is written (Psalms 140:8), \"God, my Lord, the strength of my deliverance, You protected my head on the day of weapons (<i>nashek</i>),\" [meaning] the day of the war at the sea.

Pharaoh came out like a warrior; and the Holy One, blessed be He, is like a warrior, as it is stated (Isaiah 42:13), \"The Lord goes forth like a warrior, like a man of war He whips up His rage,\" as only upon Pharaoh did He first make known His strength. At the time of war, He is called a man, as it is stated (Exodus 26:3), \"The Lord is a man of war, the Lord is His name.\" Pharaoh went forth dressed in tin-plated armor; and the Holy One, blessed be He, likewise, as it is stated (Habakuk 3:11), \"as Your arrows fly in brightness, Your flashing spear in brilliance.\" Pharaoh went forth with catapult stones; and the Holy One, blessed be He, went forth with stones of <i>elgavish</i> and hail stones.

Upon a female mare, as it is stated (Song of Songs 1:9), \"To a mare in Pharaoh’s chariots have I likened you, my darling.\" Another interpretation [of] \"To a mare in Pharaoh's chariots\": What is [the meaning of] \"to a mare?\" Rather the Holy One, blessed be He, saw that Pharaoh did not want to enter the sea. [So] what did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He rode upon a light cloud and transformed it into a mare. And He stood [it] in front of the horses of the troops. And the horses ran after the mare, and the Holy One, blessed be He, descended into the sea with the horses [coming] after Him [to pursue the mare]. Hence, \"to a mare,\" [meaning a] female. Another interpretation [of] \"To a mare in Pharaoh's chariots\": Pharaoh said to his troops, \"What is the lightest (fastest) animal upon which to ride, so that I can go forth and chase the Children of Israel?\" They said to him, \"A mare, as there is nothing like it in the world.\" Therefore (due to her speed) the males were following her. And Pharaoh rode [speedily] like the gazelles. And the Holy One, blessed be He, also did this. The Holy One, blessed be He, said in front of the ministering angels, \"Which among all of the creatures that serve in front of Me is light?\" They said to Him, \"Is it not revealed in front of You, that there is none among all of the creatures that serve in front of You that is as light as the cherub that comes out from under the wings of the cherubs.\" [So] the Holy One, blessed be He, rode upon the cherub and beat the horse of Pharaoh and all of his troops, as it is stated (Exodus 15:19), \"For the horse of Pharaoh, with his chariots and horsemen, went into the sea.\" And it is [also] stated (Psalms 136:15), \"And He shook Pharaoh and his army in the Reed Sea.\" Moshe said to them, \"Is this not what I told you (Exodus 14:14), 'and you shall be quiet.' There is nothing for you to do except to stand silently, and the Holy One blessed be He, will [fight] your wars.\" Therefore he said to them, \"When you enter the land and see many multitudes and horses and chariots, do not be afraid of them,\" as it is stated (Deuteronomy 20:1), \"When you go out to war and you see horse and chariot, a people more numerous than you, do not be afraid of them, as the Lord, your God is with you.\" Hence (Proverbs 21:31), \"The horse is readied for the day of battle, but the salvation comes from the Lord.\" "

And he killed Mephibosheth,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There may be some confusion between Mephibosheth who was a son of Saul that David had killed (in II Sam. 21:8) and the Mephibosheth who was Saul’s grandson and who was falsely accused of betraying David for Absalom (II Sam. 16:3; but cf. 19:24–30).</i> and had Ziba rule over the whole house of Saul (II Sam. 16:4; cf. II Sam. 9:9). It is taught: R.

Deut. 21:18-21)? It is simply that Torah has foreseen the end of the thinking of a defiant and rebellious son. As in the end he will squander his father's assets with wastrels with whom he eats and drinks, until he seeks what he has been accustomed to and does not find it. Then he goes out to the crossroads, where he kills people and robs<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Melastem,</i> from the Gk.: <i>lestes</i> (“robber”).</i> them. So the Torah is saying, ‘Let him die innocent and not die guilty,’ for the death of the wicked benefits them and benefits the world.” And what is written after that (in vs. 22)? “And when someone is guilty of a crime punishable by death and is put to death.” If he is delivered from the one,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the preventive punishment as A DEFIANT AND REBELLIOUS SON.</i> he is not delivered from the other.

What is written after that (in vs. 9)? “You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed.” You will merit to [possess] a vineyard and to sow a field.

                "(Deut. 22:6-7), “You come across a bird nest, [….] You must surely let the mother go.” This text is related (to Prov. 4:23), “More than any observance preserve your heart, for out of it comes life.” R. Abba said, “There are two hundred and forty-eight positive commandments in the Torah corresponding to the organs that are in a human being; for each and every day they cry out at the person, ‘Perform a commandment with me so that we may live through its merit and you may lengthen your life.’ There are also three hundred and sixty-five negative commandments like the number of the solar days. So on each and every day while the sun rises until it sets, it speaks and cries out at a person, ‘Decree me upon yourself by the One who has brought your days up to this day. Do not commit this transgression against me, and do not tilt yourself and the whole world toward the scale of guilt.’” Here are six hundred and thirteen commandments. Moreover, for each and every commandment there is a recorded reward. For example honoring father and mother (in Exod. 20:12 // Deut. 5:16) and leaving a nest alone (in Deut. 22:7) about which it is written, a lengthening of life. There are also commandments with children as the reward; as, for example, Sarah, who hosted guests (in Gen. 18:6-14), and the Shunammite woman, who received Elisha (II Kings. 4:8-17). There is [also] a transgression, [which may] require stoning, burning, slaying (with the sword),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Hereg.</i> See <i>Sanh.</i> 7:3, for the interpretation of <i>hereg</i> as beheading with a sword.</i> or strangulation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For details on all four types of execution, see ibid., 6:4; 7:1–3.</i> Of all the commandments, none is as easy as leaving a nest alone. And what it its remuneration (according to Deut. 22:7)? “In order that it may be well with you and you may lengthen your life.” A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who brought laborers into his field to plant it but did not reveal to them the remuneration for their planting. At evening he gave one gold coin to whoever planted a tree. They all began to be amazed and say, “Now if the one who has only planted a light and small tree [has received] one gold coin, how much the more will there be for us who have planted many [of them].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. Deut. R. 6:2.</i> So if the remuneration for leaving a nest alone has a lengthening of life as its remuneration, how much more will be the remuneration for a commandment in which there is material loss, hardship, and [the need to] preserve one's life? For this reason the Holy One, blessed be He, did not explain the remuneration for the commandments which are in the Torah, so that Israel of its own accord would fulfill them and thereby increase the remuneration. Thus we have learned (in <i>Avot</i> 1:3), “Do not be like servants who serve the master for the sake of receiving a reward […].” It is therefore written (in Prov. 4:23), “More than any observance preserve your heart, [for out of it comes life].” There is a story about someone who went up to the top of a tree to fulfill the commandment of leaving a nest alone, and he fell and died. [This is] because it is stated (Deut. 22:7), “When you come across a bird nest on the way,” and not that you see it at the top of the trees and go up after it. The verse (Ps. 94:12) states, “Happy is the man whom You discipline, O Lord, the man You instruct in Your Torah.” Rabbi Elazar ben Yaakov said, “A man must remember gratitude to the Holy One, blessed be He, at a time when afflictions come upon him. Why? Because afflictions draw a man to the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is stated (Prov. 3:12), ‘For whom the Lord loves, He rebukes, as a father the son whom he favors.’” R. Shimon bar Yochai said, “If a man’s son dies, he should not voice a complaint, as the son causes him to be acceptable to the Holy One, blessed be He.” There is a parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who became angry with the son of his daughter, and someone else came and made this son of his acceptable in front of the king. That son of the daughter says, “Do [I] not need to remember gratitude to the one that made [me] acceptable?” So [too] if a man’s son dies, he should remember gratitude to the Holy One, blessed be He, as the son made the father acceptable to his Creator. Why? (As in Prov. 3:12), “For whom the Lord loves, He rebukes, [as a father the son whom he favors].” Therefore David said in (Ps. 94:12), “Happy is the man whom You discipline, O Lord.” If afflictions come to a person, he should stand firm and accept them. Why? As there is no end to its remuneration. And from where (in Scripture) do you learn [this]? From the tooth and the eye [that is injured], through which a gentile slave goes out to freedom. Is it not [then] fitting that afflictions that scour the entire body of man atone? R. Chiya bar Abba said, “Since it is stated about the one that fulfills the commandment of leaving the nest alone, ‘in order that it may be well with you,’ all the more so will the death of a man’s child atone for him.” (Deut. 22:7:) “And the young (literally, children) take for yourself.” If you do not have children, I will give you children as the reward for this commandment. Another interpretation of (Deut. 22:7), “You must surely let [the mother] go.” If you let them go, (as in Is. 59:18) “According to their deeds, so shall He repay.” [See] what is written (in Jer. 50:33-34), “The children of Israel are oppressed […] they refuse to let them go. Their redeemer is mighty, [His name is] the Lord of hosts; He shall surely fight their fight.” [It also says (in Is. 16:2),] “For it shall be that the daughters of Moab at the fords of the Arnon shall be like a migrating bird, an abandoned nest.” This text is related (to Jer. 17:11), “As a partridge hatches without laying, so is one who makes money apart from justice….” What is written after that (in vs. 12)? “A glorious throne exalted from the beginning, our sacred shrine.” What is the connection between the two [verses]? Whoever says a partridge hatches is [really] saying a glorious throne. [This is] to teach you that a partridge brings eggs from other birds and sits on them until [the young] emerge from their shells and become fledglings. Then they rise up over it and pluck its wings. When it goes out to fly, it is unable [to do so] because its wings are plucked. So a wild beast or reptile finds it and eats it. And what caused its [destruction]? [It happened] because it had raised eggs that were not its own. So it shall be with the peoples of the world and the Moabites and the Ammonites that stretched their hands against (according to Jer. 17:12) His glorious throne, destroyed His sacred shrine, burned His Temple, and carried Israel into exile. The Holy One, blessed be He, shall destroy their memory, as the matter is stated (in Zeph. 2:9), “Therefore, as I live, says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, surely Moab shall become like Sodom, [and the children of Ammon like Gomorrah].”"

His grandfather was Abraham. His father was Isaac. Yet are you saying (in Ps. 109:14), “May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered?” [The verse is] simply [referring to] a sin that he sinned against his fathers.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew of Ps. 109:14 can also be understood in this sense.</i> And how?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, <i>Tanh.</i> (Buber), Gen. 6:3; Gen. R. 63:12.</i> You find that Isaac got his vitality from Abraham; yet he lived a hundred and eighty years, while Abraham only lived a hundred and seventy-five years. Why so? So he would not see Esau’s shame. Abraham had [Isaac] when he was a hundred years [old]. (Gen. 25:26-27:) “And Isaac was sixty years old when they were born. And the lads grew.” Both of them went to the elementary school, and both of them were equal until the age of fifteen. R. Levi said, “To what were they comparable? To a myrtle and a thorny plant. As long as they are small, no one [can] distinguish one from the other. After they have grown up, the one gives off its pleasant smell, but the other brings forth its thorns. Thus, so long as Esau and Jacob were small, no one distinguished between them. After they were grown up (in Gen. 25:26, cont.), ’Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the outdoors; but Jacob was a mild man who stayed in camp.’” And Esau would go out and rob and extort, and people would maledict him. And during the five years [that were withheld from Abraham's life], Esau committed two serious transgressions: He violated a betrothed maiden, and he took a life. The one is what is written about (in Gen. 25:29), “then Esau came from the field, and he was exhausted.” Now field can only be a reference to a betrothed maiden [of whom it is stated (in Deut. 22:25), “If in the field the man finds [a maiden who is betrothed, and the man seizes her and lies with her…].” Moreover, exhausted can only be a reference to a murderer, of whom it is stated (in Jer. 4:31), “woe to me, now; for my life is exhausted before those who kill.” Rabbi Zakkay said, “He also stole, as stated (in Obad. 1:5), ‘If thieves have come to you.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Midrash, of course, is identifying the Edom of Obadiah with Esau.</i> The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “I had already promised my beloved Abraham (in Gen. 15:15), ‘And you shall go unto your ancestors in peace; [you shall be buried at a good old age].’ But now he would see his grandson go to bad culture and hear what people say about his grandson; [that he was] transgressing sexual prohibitions and shedding blood. He would [then] wonder and say, ‘Are these the stipulations that the Holy One, blessed be He, being fulfilled with me?’ And he would voice a complaint, ‘And this is not “a good old age.”’ What should I do for him?” [So] He gathered him from the world. It is better for the righteous man to be gathered (to his ancestors) in peace, as stated in Ps. 63:4), “For Your steadfast love is better than life.” Behold, he [thus] sinned against his grandfather. He sinned against his father, as he caused his eyes to become dim during his lifetime. Hence they have said, “Whoever produces a wicked son or a wicked disciple causes his [own] eyes to grow dim during his lifetime.” From where [in Scripture] do you learn [this]? A wicked son, from Isaac, as stated (in (Gen. 27:1), “And it came to pass that when Isaac was old [and his eyes were too dim to see].” [In regard to] a wicked disciple, [we learn] from Ahijah, as it is written (in I Kings 14:4), “now Ahijah could not see, because his eyes were dim from old age.” Why? Because he produced a wicked disciple in Jeroboam. [(Ps. 109:14:) “And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.”] But how had he sinned against his mother? R. Judah, R. Nehemiah, and [our] masters [differ]. R. Judah says, “When he left his mother's belly, he severed her uterus,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Metrin</i>: Gk.: <i>metra</i>; cf. Lat.: <i>matrix.</i></i> with the result that she would not bear [any more children].

Berekhyah says, “You should not say [this] in reference to when he had left [his mother's uterus].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen.

(Ps. 58:4:) “The wicked go astray (<i>zoru</i>) from the womb.” R. Nehemiah says, “He was the cause of her not producing twelve tribes.” As Rav Huna has said, “Rebekah was worthy of producing twelve tribes, as stated (in Gen. 25:23), ‘And the Lord said to her, “Two nations are [in your womb].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, <i>Tanh.</i> (Buber), Gen. 12:16.</i> Here are two.

Hanina said, “Because they brought out her bier at night, the text only explained about her obliquely. Thus it is written (in Gen. 35:8), ‘Then Rebekah's nurse, Deborah, died [and she was buried under the oak below Bethel] and its name was called Weeping Oak (<i>Allon-Bacuth</i>)],’ as they wept two weepings (<i>bekhiot</i>).”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bacuth,</i> of course, means “weeping,” and <i>allon</i> can be understood as a Greek adjective in the neuter that means “other” or “another.” Thus the name can be read as “another weeping” and imply a second weeping. So <i>PRK</i> 3:1; Gen. R. 81:5; cf. Eccl. R. 7:2:3.</i> While Jacob was seated in observance [of mourning] for her nurse, the news about his mother came to him, as stated (to Gen. 35:9), “Now God appeared unto Jacob again […,] and blessed him.” With what blessing did He bless him?

I shall pay him back with evil, as his children destroyed My house. You and I shall rise against him, as stated (Obad. 1:1), “Rise, and we shall rise up against her for war.” Israel said to him, “Master of the world, we cannot [overcome] him.” [So] the Holy One, blessed be He, says to them, “You mention his name below, and I shall blot out his name above, as stated (Ps. 109:15) ‘Let them (the iniquity against his fathers and the sin against his mother) always be before (<i>neged</i>) the Lord.’ Whatever he has done, he has done against (<i>neged</i>) Me.” [Therefore] (ibid., cont.), “and may He have their memory cut off from the earth.” Ergo (in Deut. 25:17), “Remember what Amalek (Esau's grandson) did to you.”"

Joshua [ben Levi] said, “It should be remembered what they did in the Torah, as it is written about it (in Ps. 12:7), ‘refined sevenfold.’” And the masters said, “It should be remembered what they did to the Temple, which was the bosom (<i>heq</i>) [i.e., the center] of the earth, as stated (with reference to the Temple in Ezek. 43:14), ‘And from the lap (<i>heq</i>) of the earth<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A more usual translation would read: AND FROM THE BASE ON THE GROUND.</i> to the lower ledge, two cubits.’” When Samuel came, he repaid them, as stated (in I Sam. 15:33), “then Samuel hewed Agag.” What did he do to him?

Thus it is stated (in Deut. 26:15), ‘Look down from your holy dwelling, [from the heavens and bless your people].’ And not only that, but he would say, “I am not moving from here until You perform my requirements this day,’ as it is written next to it (in vs. 16), ‘This day the Lord your God is commanding you to perform.’” Resh Laqish said, “A heavenly voice (<i>bat qol</i>) comes forth and says, ‘You shall do it again on this day in the coming year.’ [He is] like one who gives fresh fruit to his friend, and [the friend] says to him, ‘Would that you would do this again, and give me some next year.’” R. Hiya bar Abba said, “How spoiled are those who perform the commandments in front of the Holy One, blessed be He. As the Holy One blessed be He, enacts a decree and the righteous ones annul it. As it is stated (Eccl. 8:4), ‘Inasmuch as a king’s command is authoritative, and who can say to him, “What are you doing.”’ Who is it [that can say it]? (Eccl. 8:5:) ‘One who obeys commandments will not know a bad thing,’ he can object to the Holy One, blessed be He.” And so with David, he said (II Sam. 23:3), “The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke about me, ‘He that rules over men must be righteous, ruling in the fear of God.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Moed Katan 16b, where this verse is explained as saying that the righteous one rules over God.</i> [(Deut. 26:16:) “This day the Lord your God is commanding you to perform…].” What is the meaning of this day? Had the Holy One, blessed be He, not given a command to Israel until now? And was not this the fortieth year (since they left Egypt), as stated (in Deut. 1:3), “And it came to pass in the fortieth year….” Then what is the meaning of the words, “this day?” Simply that Moses spoke to Israel as follows, “On each and every day, let the Torah be dear to you, as if you had received it this day from Mount Sinai.” Moreover, it is written in another place (i.e., in Deut. 4:9), “make them known to your children….” Then it is written (in vs. 10), “The day that you stood before the Lord [your God at Horeb].” (Deut. 26:16, cont.:) “These statutes,” these are the midrashic commentaries; “and these ordinances,” these are the court decisions. Another interpretation (of Deut. 26:16), “these statutes and these ordinances: [They are meant] to include light and heavy [commandments], inferences from analogy, and fine points of scribal exegesis. (Deut. 26:16, cont.:) “So you are to be diligent in doing them.” R. Johanan said, “When anyone performs a single commandment truthfully, Scripture ascribes it to him as if it had been given [to him] from Mount Sinai, as stated (Deut. 26:16), ‘So you are to be diligent in doing.’” Then what is the meaning of (in Lev. 25:18), “and you shall do (which can also be read as, make) them?” Rather, anyone that observes the Torah and does it truthfully, it as if he arranged it and gave it from Mount Sinai. And R. Johanan also said, “Anyone who does [what is written in] the Torah truthfully, Scripture ascribes it to him as if he had made himself; as stated (in Deut. 4:14), ‘At that time the Lord commanded me to impart [to you laws and rules to make you do].’ It does not say, ‘to do them,’ but “to make you, do them.’ From here [we learn] that Scripture ascribes it to him as if he made and created himself.” (Deut. 26:16, cont.:) “With all your heart.” Behold Scripture warns Israel and says to them, “When you pray to the Holy One, blessed be He, you shall not have two hearts, one in the presence of the Holy One, blessed be He, and one for something else.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ben Sira 1:28 (25).</i>"

Moses said to Israel, “Form [yourselves into] individual classes (<i>kitot</i>), and incline your heart to hear the words of Torah.” Another interpretation: He said to them, “Pound (katetu) your hearts and souls to hear the words of Torah.” [(Deut. 26:16:) “With all your heart.”] R.

Aqiva and his colleagues proceeded to [ignore it and] occupy themselves with the Torah. When Pappus ben Judah found him, he said to him, “See here, rabbi, you are endangering yourself, when you transgress against a decree of the king.” R. Aqiva said to him, “Let me illustrate for you in a parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a fox. As he was walking near a river, he saw [some] fish there.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ber.</i> 61b explains that the fish were fleeing the nets of fishermen.</i> He said to them, ‘Get yourselves to me, and I will hide you in the clefts of the rocks. Then you shall not be afraid.’ They said to him, ‘Are you the one that they say about you that you are the most clever of the animals? You are only a fool. All our lives have been [spent] only in the water. So would you tell us to walk onto the dry land? If we are afraid in the place of our life, all the more so [will we be afraid] in the place of our death!’ Similarly all the life of Israel exists only in the Torah, of which it is written (in Deut. 30:20), ‘for that is your life and your length of days’; yet you are saying, ‘You are endangering yourself?’” In a few days they arrested the both of them. Pappus said to him, “Fortunate are you, since you were arrested for the words of Torah. Woe to that Pappus, who was arrested for idle things.” [Subsequently] when they brought out R. Aqiva for execution, it was time to recite the <i>Shema</i>'. While they combed his flesh with combs of iron, he was calling out the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>'.

It is so stated (ibid. cont.), “may You fill their belly with what You have kept in store for them.” And not only that, but they attain merit for their children after them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As indicated by the rest of the verse.</i> And because [the Children of] Israel lay down their lives for the Torah and for the sanctification of the name of the Holy One, blessed be He; for that reason the Holy One, blessed be He, made them into an entity and a blessing in the world, as stated (in Deut. 26:17), “Today you have had the Lord promise….” And just as Israel makes an entity in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, so does the Holy One, blessed be He, make them an entity, as stated (in vs. 18), “The Lord has proclaimed you today [to be for Him a treasured people…].” R. Joshua ben Levi said, “Just as the pestle (<i>'eli</i>) crushes, so is Israel going to crush four empires under its feet.

But] when we stood in front of Mount Sinai, you gave us commandments like a man pouring from the mouth of a barrel.\" \"Your name is like finest (<i>turak</i>) oil.\" What is [the meaning of] \"<i>turak</i>?\" Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Shila, \"That bring alacrity to the one that does His will. And the expression <i>turak</i> can only be a weapon, as it is stated (Genesis 14:14), 'and he armed (<i>vayarek</i>) his retainers.'\" Another interpretation [of] \"Your name is like finest (<i>turak</i>) oil.\" The Torah is compared to oil and it is compared to water. To water, as it is written (Isaiah 55:1), \"Ho, all who are thirsty, come for water.\" Just like the world cannot stand without them and a man purifies himself in them, so too can the world not stand without Torah, and the Torah teaches man how to purify himself. And just like water, a man does not plant a tree and does not build a house if he has no water, so too can the world not stand without Torah. And just like water is life to the world, so too is Torah life to the world. Just like [with] water, anyone who does not know how to swim in it will cause himself to be lost from the world, so too anyone who is not able to find words of Torah is lost from the world. Just like water can be drawn to any place one wants, so too is the Torah drawn in all of the world. Just like water is not preserved in silver containers nor in gold containers but rather in ones of clay, so too is Torah not preserved in the haughty, but in one with a humble spirit. And Rabbi Acha says, \"'But from where (which can also be read as, from nothing) can wisdom be found.' What is [the meaning of] 'from nothing?' From those who make themselves like nothing.\" And just like this water no one supervises [to demand a price], so is the Torah. You find that it is [also] compared to honey, as it is written (Psalms 19:11), \"sweeter than honey, than drippings of the comb.\" Just like honey is not polluted, so is the Torah not polluted, as stated (Proverbs 8:8), \"All my words are just, none of them perverse or crooked.\" And the Torah is compared to oil. Just like oil brings light to the whole world, so too is the Torah light to the world. And just like this oil is crushed and the more it is crushed, the better it is; so too [with] the Torah, [the more] one [exerts] himself upon it, the better it is to its Owner. You find that with all liquids, you can counterfeit them and put other liquids in them; but [with] this oil, he [can] put it in any liquid that he wants, and it rises to the top. So too is Israel; even if they are placed at the bottom, behold they are like this oil that [rises] to the top, as stated (Deuteronomy 28:1), \"the Lord your God will set you high above all the nations of the earth.\""

Rabbi Yehudah says, \"At the time that he comes to part from the world, as it is stated (Ecclesiastes 12:13), 'The end of the matter, everything is heard.'\" And Rabbi Meir says, \"until he completes his soul, as stated (Job 10:22), 'gloom and not arranged,' as he arranges his study.\" Another interpretation: \"If you surely listen,\" your prayer will be heard, like Choni the Circle-maker. At the time that Israel required rain, they went into him and said to him, \"Pray for us, as we need rain.\" Immediately, he drew a circle and stood inside it, to fulfill that which is stated (Habakuk 2:1), \"I will stand on my watch.\" The rain began to drizzle. He said, \"This is not what I requested, but rains of desire, blessing and freewill.\" The rain [then] began to fall in its accustomed way. What caused him to be one who prays, such that the Holy One, blessed be He listens to his prayers? [It was] because he listened to the words of the Torah. Another interpretation: If you listen in this world, you will listen [to it] in the world to come from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He. Rabbi Yonah the father of Rabbi Manna said in the name of Rabbi Levi who said in the name of Rabbi Abba, \"The Torah was not supposed to have been given to Israel in this world. Why?

It should have said, \"You shall be blessed in the field and you shall blessed in the city,\" as it is from what he brings in from the field that he is blessed in the city.

Another interpretation: A man should not say, \"If the Holy One, blessed be He, had given me a field, I would have extracted tithes from it.

He turned over the works of the generation of the flood, and there was no recovery for them, as stated (in Gen. 7:23), “And he wiped out all living things.” He turned over the works of the Sodomites, and there was no recovery for them, as stated (in Gen. 19:25), “And he overturned those cities.” He turned over the works of the Egyptians, and there was no recovery for them, as stated (in Exod. 14:28), “and not so much as one of them remained.” He turned over the works of Babylon, and there was no recovery for them, as stated (in Is. 14:22), “and from Babylon i will cut off name, remnant, offspring, and posterity.” Moreover, David has said about all of them (in Ps. 36:13), “There the evildoers have fallen; they are thrust down and cannot rise.” When Israel falls, however, it stands up [again], as stated (in Micah 7:8), “Rejoice not over me, O my enemy; when I fall, I shall arise….” It also says (in Mal. 3:6), “For I the Lord do not change; [and you, O Children of Jacob, are not destroyed (rt.: <i>klh</i>).” R. Hanina bar Pappa said, “The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘I have never smitten a people and [restored] them, but (according to Mal. 3:6), “you Children of Jacob are not destroyed,”’ This is as stated (in Deut. 32:23), ‘I will use up (rt.: <i>klh</i>) My arrows on them,’ [meaning that] My arrows are used up (rt.: <i>klh</i>) but they are not destroyed (rt.: <i>klh</i>).” And so has the assembly of Israel said (in Lam. 3:12), “He has bent his bow; he has set me as a target for the arrow.” To what is the matter comparable? To a warrior who raises up the [target] post and shoots the arrows at them. The arrows are used up (rt.: <i>klh</i>), but the post stands. So it is also with Israel. Every time that afflictions came upon them, the afflictions ended, and they were standing in their place. Ergo it is stated (in Prov. 12:7), “The wicked are overturned and are no more.” Hezekiah the son of R. Hiyya said, “Why is this <i>parashah</i> next to the <i>parashah</i> about curses (i.e., Deut. 27:11-28:69)?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi on Deut. 29:12.</i> Because Israel heard a hundred curses less two in this <i>parashah</i>, apart from the forty-nine which are uttered in the priestly Torah (i.e., in Leviticus). They immediately turned green in the face and said, ‘Who can withstand these [curses]?’ Moses called them immediately (in Deut. 29:1) and pacified them with [the words from Deut. 29:9].” What is written above the matter (in Deut. 29:1-2, 6)? “Then Moses summoned all of Israel [and said unto them, ‘You have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt,] …. The great trials [which your eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders]. When you came unto this place, [Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out to engage us in battle; but we defeated them].” And you did not heed My voice, and you uttered words before Me for which you deserved destruction. Still I did not wreak destruction upon you, when it is stated (in Ps. 106:7), “When our ancestors were in Egypt, they did not consider Your wondrous works….” And not only that, but they said of the calf (in Exod. 32:4), “This is your god, O Israel.” Now if you should say, “For what reason did the [other] nations deserve destruction, while we are remaining alive?” It is because when afflictions come upon them, they kick against them and do not mention the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, as stated (in Ps. 79:6), “Pour out your wrath upon the nations that have not known you, [upon the kingdoms that do not invoke Your name].” In the case of Israel, however, when afflictions come upon them, they make submit and pray, as stated (in Ps. 116:3-4), “I found trouble and sorrow, but I shall invoke the name of the Lord.” Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, said, “Even though these maledictions come upon you, they [themselves] stand you up; and so it says (in Deut. 8:16), ‘in order to humble you and in order to test you, [so as to benefit you in the end].’” Thus did Moses say to Israel, “Even though afflictions come upon you, you have a standing.” It is therefore stated (in Deut. 29:9), “You are standing today, all of you.” Another interpretation (of Deut. 29:9), “You are standing (<i>nizavim</i>) today”: Why did Moshe make them into a pillar (<i>mazevah</i>)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A type of altar generally used for idolatry, but always forbidden by the Torah. See Deut. 16:22.</i>? Because they would [change] from one opinion to another opinion: from the opinion of Moshe to the opinion of Joshua; from the opinion of Joshua to the opinion of the elders. And Joshua also made them into a pillar, as stated (in Josh. 24:1), “Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel at Schechem, [and he summoned Israel’s elders and commanders, magistrates and officers; and they presented (<i>yityazvu</i>) themselves].” And Samuel – since they [changed] from his opinion to the opinion of the kings – also made them into a pillar, as stated (in I Sam. 12:7), “And now stand (hityazvu) and I will judge you.” Another interpretation (of Deut. 29:9), “You are standing today”: Just as today (literally: the day) sometimes darkens and sometimes lightens, so it is with you. Although you have darkness, the Holy One, blessed be He, is going to shine on you with light eternal, as stated (in Is. 60:19), “for the Lord shall be your everlasting light.” When? When you all become one group, as stated (in Deut. 4:4), “are all alive today.” According to universal custom, if one takes a group of reeds, will he be able to break them at one stroke! But if he takes them one by one, even an infant can break them. So also you find that Israel was not redeemed until they became one group, as stated (in Jer. 50:4), “’In those days and at that time,’ says the Lord,’ the children of Israel, they and the children of Judah, shall come together.’” When they are united, they shall welcome the face of the Divine Presence."

But perhaps you will say, “Why all this bother?” It is not because I need you? Rather what shall I do to you, when I have already sworn to your ancestors, that I will never replace you and your children? It is therefore stated (in Deut. 29:12), “In order to establish you today as his people […] as he swore to your ancestors.” It [also] says (in Cant. 7:6), “a king is bound by his tresses.” Now bound [indicates] nothing except an oath. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 30:4), “[When a woman vows a vow to the Lord] and binds herself with a bond.” Therefore, He cannot break his oath. And so you find, when they sought to get rid of the yoke of His oath in the days of Ezekiel, it is written (in Ezek: 20:1), “some elders of Israel came to consult the Lord.” They said to him, “When the son of a priest buys a slave, is it legal for him to eat the <i>terumah</i>?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The priestly tithe on produce.</i> He said to them, “He may eat it.” They said to him, “If a priest returned and sold him to an [ordinary] Israelite, has he not left his jurisdiction?” He told them, “Yes.” They said to him, “We too have left the jurisdiction of [the Holy One, blessed be He]; are we not [now] like the all the [rest of the] world?” Ezekiel said to them (in Ezek. 20:32-33), “But that which you have in mind shall never come to pass, that should you say: let us become like the gentiles…. ‘As I live,’ says the Lord God, ‘surely I will [reign] over you with a powerful hand....’” He said to them, “As long as one has not sold [a slave], he is in his jurisdiction; and you have not been sold for a price.” It is so stated (in Is. 52:3), “For thus says the Lord, ‘You were sold for free, [and you shall be redeemed for no money].’” (Deut. 29:12:) “In order to establish you today as his people…,” so that I would not go back on the word that I swore to your ancestors. Deut. 29:13), “And not only with you [have I made this covenant and this oath].” But rather the generations that have yet to come were also there at that time, as stated (in vs. 14), “But with those who are [standing ('<i>md</i>)] here with us [today… and with those who are not here with us today].” R. Abahu said in the name of R. Samuel bar Nahmani, “Why does it say, ‘those who are [standing ('<i>md</i>)] here [...]; and those who are not here’ (without using the word, standing)? Because all the souls were there, [even] when [their] bodies had still not been created. It is for that reason [their] existence (literally, standing, rt.: '<i>md</i>) is not stated here.” R. Eliezer said, “A curse will come upon Laban, because he said to Jacob (in Gen. 31:30), ‘Why did you steal my gods?’ It (i.e., such an idol) could not save itself from theft. [So] how could it save others? But Israel is not like that, as they serve the Holy One, blessed be He, about whom it is stated (in Deut. 10:21), “He is your praise, and He is your God, [who has done these great and awful things for you that your own eyes have seen].” He [also] watches over Israel like a father who watches over his son, as stated (in Ps. 121:4), “Behold the One keeping Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.”"

                "<b>You who are present today, all of you:</b> You are the existence of this world and the world to come. When the Holy One, blessed be He, will come to give a goodly reward to the righteous, He will show them behemoths that crouch on a thousand mountains; and a thousand mountains will bring up grasses and they will eat. And from where [do we know] that they crouch on a thousand mountains? As it is stated (Psalms 50:11), \"The behemoths on a thousand mountains.\" And they drink all [the water] that the Jordan draws, as it is stated (Job 40:23), \"he is certain that he will draw the Jordan to his mouth.\" Rav Yosef said, \"They take one swallow and draw all that the Jordan draws for six months. And it is a full verse (Job  39:24), 'With trembling and anger, he swallows the earth.'\" And the Leviathan also crouches upon the deep. In the world to come, the Holy One, blessed be He, says to the ministering angels, \"Come and fight with him.\" But when they descend to fight against him, he suspends his eyes and stares at them. And [then] they fear and flee, as it is stated (Job 41:17), \"From his rising do the powers fears, the breakers are lacking.\" When he seeks to eat, he makes a wave in the sea. And [so] the fish think that it is [bringing] something edible, and they go to it; and he opens his mouth and swallows them. And not one of them escapes, but rather all of them enter into his mouth. And [then] the Holy One, blessed be He, says to the ministering angels, \"Cast arrows.\" And they fling [them] at him, but he pays no attention, but they are rather considered like straw by him - as it is stated (Job 41:20), \"The son of the bow does not make him flee.\" And [then] the Holy One, blessed be He, says to them, \"Take projectile stones and hurl them at him.\" And they do it, but he thinks it is straw - as it is stated (Job 41:21), \"The catapult is considered like straw.\" And if you say, where is he crouching; the Holy One, blessed be He, said, upon the clay that is better than gold - as it is stated (Job 41:22), \"he reclines on the broken leaves of clay.\" And if you say [that] if he seeks to leave, he [can] leave - [hence] we learn to say, \"he is enclosed with a narrow (<i>tsar</i>) seal\" (Job 41:7) - I have closed in front of him, and sealed across from him and I have even restricted (<i>hetsarti</i>) him. And [so] how do the righteous ones eat [it]? Rather the Holy One, blessed be He, puts a spirit into the behemoths and also into the Leviathan, and they come and fight, one with the other - as it is stated (Job 41:8), \"One approaches to the other.\" This one overturns the ground and quiets the behemoths, and these split the Leviathan. [Then] the righteous ones immediately gather around them, and the Holy One, blessed be He, says to each and every one [to eat]. And [each righteous one] eats according to his reward, as it is stated (Job 40:30), \"Will the charmers (<i>chavarim</i>) repast upon him?\" - Chizkiyah said, \"These are [Torah] colleagues (<i>chaverim</i>).\" Another [understanding]: \"Will the charmers repast upon him?\" - anyone who has charmed himself from doing [evil]. \"Will it be divided by the traders?\" (Job 40:30) - there are among men those that engage in trade: This one gives fifty gold pieces and this one gives ten; they purchase a pearl and it produces revenue. According to what each and every one gave do they take from the revenue. So did the Holy One, blessed be He, say - \"Let anyone that was involved with Torah [study] and with [practice of] the commandments, come and take his reward\"; as it is stated (Job 42:2), \"There is no one so fierce as to rouse him; [and] who can stand (<i>yityatsev</i>) in front of Me?\" Who are the ones that are eating in front of [God]? \"You who are present.\" Said the Holy One, blessed be He, \"You stood in front of Me in this world to accept the commandments; so too will I stand you in the world to come\"; as it is stated (Isaiah 66:22), \"For as the new heaven and the new earth, which I will make, shall stand in front of Me - speaks the Lord - so shall your seed and your name stand.\" Thus did Rabbi Tanchuma expound."

The numerical equivalent of counsels is six hundred and six. [That,] and the seven commandments that the Sons of Noach were commanded, is six hundred and thirteen. And so [too,] does it state (Isaiah 5:1), \"my beloved had a vineyard in a fertile corner\": \"A vineyard\" - that is Israel, as it is stated (Isaiah 27:2), \"a vineyard of wine, sing to it.\" \"And he separated it\" (Isaiah 5:2) - with Avraham, that he cast away the residue from him, such as Yishmael. \"And he cleared it of stones\" - with Yitschak, that he took Esav away from him. \"And he planted it with choice vines\" - that is Yaakov, as all of the plantings that came out from him were good and desirable, like this choice vine which is completely good. And this is [the meaning of] \"all of it was true seed\" (Jeremiah 2:21). Choice vine (<i>sorek</i>) has a numerical equivalent of six hundred and six, [together with] the seven commandments of the Children of Noach - behold, that is six hundred and thirteen. It is written (Proverbs 3:19), \"The Lord established the earth with wisdom\" - and there is no wisdom besides Torah. And what is its name? Confidant (<i>Amon</i>), as it is written (Proverbs 8:30), \"And I was a confidant with Him.\" And it was not called Torah until it was given at Sinai. The numerical equivalent of Torah comes to six hundred and eleven. And the two that are subtracted from six hundred and thirteen are the two that were given by the mouth of the Almighty. And this is what is stated by the verse, \"God spoke one, I heard two\" (Psalms 62:12). This is [the meaning of] \"Moshe commanded us the Torah\" (Deuteronomy 33:4) - Moshe commanded us [commandments] according to the numerical equivalent of Torah. And the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded us the [remaining] two, as I explained in Parshat Vayishma Yitro. And it is an inheritance for Yaakov, and not for the [other] nations of the world, as it is stated (Psalms 147:19), \"He tells His words to Yaakov, His statutes and His judgments to Israel, He did not do this with any nation.\" And it is written about it, \"each day,\" as it is stated (Proverbs 8:30), \"And I was a confidant with Him and I was His delight each day.\" And a day is not less than a thousand years, as it is stated (Psalms 90:4), \"As  a thousand years in Your eyes is like the day, yesterday.\" Upon what was it written before it was given? If upon silver and gold, gold and silver had not been created. Rather it was written on the forearm of the Holy One, blessed be He. And so every man [should] understand and fathom with his mind and his intelligence to contemplate the Torah day and night - as it is written (Joshua 1:8), \"and you shall contemplate about it day and night\" - and good deeds. And it is as the Sages said: The world is half guilty and half meritorious - if one comes and commit sins such that the sins outweigh the merits, it comes out that the world becomes guilty through him; but if the transgressions are of equal weight to the merits and one comes and performs one commandment, the merits will outweigh the transgressions. Happy is he who brings merit to the world! And if he has not learned as is fitting him, let him do his actions with faithfulness. Elihayu, may his memory be blessed, said, \"I was once walking on the way and I found a man, and he was mocking me and taunting me. I said to him, 'What [can] you answer on the day of judgement, since you have not studied Torah.' He said, 'I have what to answer - it is [because of] the understanding and intelligence and heart that were not given to me from the Heavens.' I said to him, 'What is your craft?' He said to me, 'I am a trapper of birds and fish.' I said to him, 'Who gave you knowledge and heart to take flax and spin it and weave it to make traps, and to catch fish and birds with them and to sell them?' He said to me, 'It is the understanding and the knowledge that were given to me from the Heavens.' I said to him, 'To take flax and to weave and spin and catch fish and birds you were given understanding and intelligence; but to acquire the Torah, they were not given to you? Behold, it is written (Deuteronomy 30:14), \"But the thing is very close to you, in your mouth and in your heart to do it.\"' [So] he immediately thought in his heart and raised his voice in crying. I said to him, 'My son, Let it not be bad to you, as all those that come to the world are rebuked once they come and are pulled away from Torah, as it is stated (Isaiah 19:9), \"And embarrassed will be the workers of flax, the combers and weavers of holes.\"' And it is about him and those similar to him, and those that do like his deeds. And the last word is the fear of the Lord; and those that do it with faithfulness - his craft will be counted and he is fitting for life in the world to come.'\""

But if, God forbid, they negate them, the hand of the witnesses will be the first against them, to kill them.

But if, God forbid, they refuse, the hand of the witnesses will be the first against them, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 31:28), \"and I will bring the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you.\" And this is why he brought them for testimony - as it is [found] in the Pesikta [that] man is compared to the twelve constellations: At the beginning when he is born, he is compared to a lamb, as he is soft, but he grows up to be like an ox.

Isaiah said (in Is. 1:2), “Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth.” What was the reason for Isaiah saying, “Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth?” [It was] simply to teach you that all the words of the prophets are equivalent. Moses said, “Give ear, O heavens,” and Isaiah said, “Hear, O heavens.” R. Aqiva said, “[This] teaches that when Moses uttered the Torah, he was in the heavens, and that he was speaking with the heavens like one who is speaking with his friend, since he said, ‘Give ear, O heavens.’ But when he saw that the earth was far from him, he said, ‘Let the earth hear the words of my mouth.’ In the case of Isaiah, however, because he was on earth, he said, ‘Hear, O heavens,’ [since they were] far from him. After that he said, ‘And give ear, O earth, because it was near to him. (Is. 1:2, cont.:) “For the Lord has spoken.” They said to him, “Isaiah our teacher, if the Holy One, blessed be He, had spoken, would not the earth have quaked?

R. 28:1.</i> He said to them, ‘Is it because of the two things that were granted to me [from the heavens] that you wish to kill me?’ When they heard this, they left him alone. A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a great merchant who was walking in a dangerous place. [When some] brigands<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>lestai.</i></i> seized him [and] wanted to kill him, he said to them, ‘Is it because of the five minas<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are four hundred minas to a shekel.</i> in my hand that you wish to kill me?’ But they did not know that there were in his hand precious stones and pearls<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>margaritai</i> or <i>margeleis.</i></i> which were invaluable. They said to each other, ‘What profit is there in killing him? He has nothing on him.’ So they left him alone. When he entered the city, he began to sell precious stones and pearls. They said to him, ‘When we captured you yesterday, you said, “There is nothing on me but five minas”; but now you are bringing out precious stones and pearls which are invaluable?’ He said to them, ‘When I spoke to you, I was in a dangerous situation.’ So also did Moses our master say to the angels, ‘There are [only] two things with me.’ [In fact] there was a great gift with him, as stated (in Ps. 68:19), ‘You ascended on high; [you captured captives; you received gifts for humans].’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some translations interpret the passage to mean that the gifts are from humans, but the midrash requires the interpretation given here.</i> Therefore David said (in Ps. 119:72), “The Torah of Your mouth is better for me [than thousands of gold and silver pieces].” It also says (in Ps. 19:11), “More delightful are they than gold, than much fine gold”; and it says (in Ps. 12:7), “The sayings of the Lord are [pure] sayings....” Israel said to Moses our master, “Fortunate are you, for your having received gifts.” He said to them, “If I had not said to the ministering angels that there were [only] two things, I should have been burned by their fire, but this Torah saved me from their hand. It was with reference to them that he said (in Deut. 32:2), “Let my instruction drop down like the rain.” “Drop down (rt.: '<i>rp</i>)” must mean killing, since it is stated (in Deut. 21:4), “and they shall break the neck (rt.: '<i>rp</i>) of the heifer there”; and so too with Judah, it states (in Gen. 49:8), “your hand will be on the neck (rt.: '<i>rp</i>) of your enemy.” And my instruction must mean Torah, since it is stated (in Prov. 4:2), “For I gave you good instruction....” And why is Torah compared to rain? To say [that] just as rain erodes, as it states (in Job 14:19), “Water erodes stones”; so does the Torah erode a heart of stone. And this is related to that which our masters say (in <i>Qidd</i>. 30b), “If [the evil impulse] is [like] a stone, it will be dissolved. If it is [like] iron, it will be shattered.” Therefore, there is nothing that is good for a man besides killing himself over the words of the Torah and to constantly occupy himself with it, day and night. And it is so stated (in Josh. 1:8), “and you shall meditate upon them night and day.” And this is related to that which they said (in <i>Meg</i>. 6b), “If a man tells you, “I have toiled but I have not found,’ do not believe [it].” And it is therefore compared to rain. Just like there can be no world without rain, as it is needed to grow all good things; so can the world not survive without Torah, as it is stated (Jer. 33:25), “Were it not that I have established My covenant day and night, I would not have put the laws of heaven and earth.” And just like rain descends little by little, so too with the Torah, one starts at the beginning with the small count of <i>aleph, bet, gimmel</i>, and comes to the large count of <i>kof, reish, shin</i> at the end. So does one start and then one understands the Torah and its details. Another interpretation (of Deut. 32:2), “Let my instruction drop down like the rain.” Israel said to Moses our master, “You have not come to speak with heaven and earth but with the rain and the dew.” He said to them, “[Let me tell you] a parable. It is comparable to a wealthy person who went to honor the king. He took with him great ministers and honored men. [So when] he went into the king along with them, the king received them cordially.” So also did Moses say, “It is better for me to call for heaven and earth, the rain and the dew to be with me, so that when I call upon the Holy One, blessed be He, He will answer me.” For that reason he said to them (in Deut. 32:1-2), “Give ear, O heavens…. Let [my instruction] drop down like the rain…”; and [then] afterwards (in Deut. 31:3), “For I am proclaiming the name of the Lord.”"

Sometimes He is close, as it is stated (Psalms 145:18), \"Close is the Lord to all who call to Him\"; [but] sometimes He is not close, as it is stated (Proverbs 15:29), \"Far from evildoers is the Lord.\" And it is written (Numbers 6:26), \"And the Lord shall lift His face\"; but [another[ verse states (Deuteronomy 10:17), \"Who does not lift the face.\" [Only] if [one] repents, He lifts His face to him. It is possible [that He does this] for all. [Hence] we learn to say \"to you\" (Numbers 6:26) - but not to another nation; as it is stated (Jeremiah 4:14), \"Wash your heart from evil, Jerusalem, in order that you be saved\" - if they repent. But if not, \"Even if you wash with natron [... your iniquity is before Me]\" (Jeremiah 2:22). Hence Yishaiyahu said, \"Pursue the Lord in His being found; call to Him in His being close.\" [There is a relevant] parable: To what is the matter similar? To a king who said to his servants, \"Go out and announce in all of my dominion that I am sitting and judging financial cases. Anyone who has an issue with his fellow - let him come in front of Me, and I will judge him favorably, [now] before I sit to judge capital cases.\" And so [too,] did the Holy One, blessed be He - may His name be blessed - say to Israel, \"My sons, Know that I judge the world at these four periods: At Pesach about the grain; at [Shavouot] about the fruit of the trees; at Rosh HaShanah, all those that come to the world come in front of me like <i>bnei Maron</i>; and at [Sukkot] about the water. On three of these periods, I sit to judge financial cases, to make wealthy or make poor, to increase or to decrease. But on Rosh HaShanah, I judge capital cases, whether for death or life - as you say in the shofar blows of Rav, 'And upon it is said, about the provinces, etc.' But if you repent with a full heart, I will accept you and judge you favorably. As the gates of the Heavens are open and I will hear your prayers, since I 'observe from the windows, peer through the lattice,' [now] before I seal the judgement on Yom Kippur.\" Hence it is stated, \"Pursue the Lord in His being found.\" Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani said, \"[There is a relevant] parable: To what is the matter similar? To a king who resided in a province and the people of the province were angering him. The king got angry and went outside of it [a distance of] ten <i>mil</i> and he stayed there. A man saw him, [and] he said to the people of the province, 'Know that the king is angry with you and he is seeking to send his legions upon the city to destroy it. Go out and appease him and he will return to you, before he distances himself from you.' A clever man was there, [and] he said to them, 'Fools, While the king was with you, you did not seek to appease him. And now before he distances himself, go out to him. Maybe he will accept you.'\" Hence it is stated, \"Pursue the Lord in His being found\" - these are the ten days of repentance, that he is found among you, as so did Yechezkel say, \"a wall between Me and them\" (Ezekiel 43:8). This is \"call to Him in His being close. Let the evildoer leave his path and a man his thoughts of iniquity and return to the Lord and He will have mercy upon him\" (Isaiah 55:6-7)."

And there is a story of a very rich and popular man, and he had a daughter who was of very beautiful appearance and pious. And she married three times to three men, but on the morrow of each first night of her marriage, they would take out her husband dead. She said, \"Men shall no longer die due to me - I will sit as a widow and a chained woman (<i>agunah</i>) until the Omnipresent sees and has mercy.\" She sat [like this] many days. And that wealthy man had a very poor brother in a different province, and he had ten sons. And on each and every day, he and his biggest son would would bring bundles of wood from the forest and sell them. And from that, he, his wife and his children would support themselves. One time, they did not sell it and they did not have money to buy bread; and [so] that day, they did not eat the whole day. They went to the forest and the father fainted. The son's eyes poured tears about their poverty and he hung his eyes to the Above. The son thought in his heart - he took leave from his father and from his mother and he went to the province of his uncle. And when he came to [his uncle's] house, his uncle was very happy about him, as was his wife and his daughter. They asked him about his father and about his mother and about the children. He stayed with [the uncle] for seven days. At the end of seven days, the lad came to his uncle. He said to him, \"I have one request to ask from you; do not turn me away.\" His uncle said to him, \"Say what you want, my son.\" He said to him, \"Swear to me.\" And so he did. He said, \"This is the request that I am asking from you - that you give me your daughter as a wife.\" When the man heard, he cried. He said to him, \"Don't, my son, don't - as such is her trait, due to my iniquities.\" He said to him, \"[Nonetheless].\" He said to him, \"If it is for the [sake] of my money that you are seizing upon her, do not marry her - as I will give you much silver and gold, since you are a fine and wise lad. But upon my advice, do not endanger yourself with her.\" He said, \"You have already sworn about this thing.\" The rich man examined the thing and agreed to him. He came to his daughter and explained the things to her. When she heard this, she cried and yelled out from the bitterness of her soul. And she hung her eyes to the Above, and she said, \"Master of the Universe, May your hand be upon me, and let not all of these die due to me.\" What did [the rich man] do? He betrothed her and made a party and called the elders of the city and made  a canopy and the groom sat within it. And an elder chanced there - and it was Eliyahu the prophet - and he called [the groom] to speak with him [privately]. And he said to him, \"My son, I will counsel you proper advice and do not budge from my advice. When you sit to repast, a poor man will come to you, dressed in torn black clothes, barefoot and tired, his hair like nails - a poor man that has none like him in the whole world. When you see him, rise from your seat and seat him next to you, give him to eat and to drink and serve him with all of your strength and honor him. And do not neglect anything from all that I have told you; and you shall stay in peace and I will go upon my way.\" The elder left and the groom came to his place. They [all] sat at the party. When they began to eat, that poor man came. And when the groom saw him, he rose from his place and did everything for him that the elder told him. After the party, that poor man called the groom, [and] he brought him to the room. He said to him, \"My son, I am the messenger of the Omnipresent, and I have come here to take your soul.\" He said to him, \"My master, give me a year's time or half a year.\" He said to him, \"I will not do [so].\" He said to him, \"If so, give me thirty days or seven days of the party.\" He said to him, \"I will not even give you a day, as your time has already come.\" He said to him, \"I plead of you, Wait for me until I go and take leave of my wife.\" He said to him, \"About this thing I will lift your face (indulge you), but go quickly.\" He went to the room and she was sitting alone and crying and praying to her Maker. The lad called to her, and she came to open [the door] for him, [and] brought him into the room with her. She held him and kissed him, [and] said to him, \"My brother, why have you come?\" He said to her, \"To take leave from you, as my time has come to go in the way of all the world - since the angel came and told me that he came to seek my soul.\" She said to him, \"Do not go but sit here, and I will go to him and I will speak to him.\" She went and found him, [and] said to him, \"Are you the angel that has come to seek the soul of my husband?\" He said, \"Yes.\" She said to him, \"He shall not die now - it is written in the Torah (Deuteronomy 24:5), 'When a man takes a woman for a wife, he shall not go out with the army nor be assigned to it for any purpose; he shall be exempt one year for his household, to rejoice his wife that he has married.' And the Holy One, blessed be He, is true and His Torah is true, but if you take his soul, you will make the Torah, a fraud.

And when midnight arrived, the man and his wife got up to prepare a grave for their son-in-law before the rising of the dawn. When they got up, they heard the groom and bride laughing and joyful together. They went into the room to see the thing. They saw and they rejoiced and they announced the thing to the community and gave thanks to the Lord. And this is that which the Holy One, blessed be He, guards those that have faith in Him. "

Noah blessed his children, but it contained a divergence, as he blessed one and cursed another, as stated (Gen. 9:27,) “May God enlarge (<i>ypt</i>) Japheth (<i>ypt</i>) [...]; and let Canaan be a slave to them.” Isaac blessed Jacob, but there was strife in it. It is so stated (in Gen. 28:4), “May He give you the blessing of Abraham, but he said to Esau (in Gen. 27:35), “Your brother came with deceit”; and it is stated (in vs. 41), “Then Esau hated Jacob […, and Esau said in his heart, ‘Let the days of mourning for my father come, and I will kill my brother Jacob’].” Jacob blessed the tribes, but there was strife among them, in that he rebuked Reuben, as stated (in Gen. 49:4), “Unstable as water”; and similarly (in vs. 5), “Simeon and Levi [are brothers; weapons of violence are their swords].” And from where did each and every one of the patriarchs learn to bless his generation? [They learned it] from the Holy One, blessed be He. When he created Adam, He blessed him, as stated (in Gen. 1:27-28), “male and female. Then [God] blessed them.” And the world was maintained by that blessing, until the generation of the flood came, and they cancelled it out, as stated (in Gen. 6:7), “And the Lord said, “I will blot out the humanity which I created.” When Noah left the ark, the Holy One, blessed be He, saw that this blessing had passed from them. He blessed Noah and his children anew, as stated (in Gen. 9:1), “Then God blessed Noah and his children.” The world was maintained by this blessing, until Abraham came into the world, and He added blessing, as stated (in Gen. 12:2), “For I will make you into a great nation.” Once Abraham came, the Holy One, blessed be He, said, “It is not honorable for Me, that I should be obliged to bless My creatures. Rather take note! I am handing over the blessings to Abraham and to his seed, so that for all who they issue a blessing, I am placing my seal upon [those blessings], as stated (in vs. 2, cont.), ‘[I will bless you and magnify your name] and so become a blessing.’” (Vs. 3:) “I will bless those who bless you….” What is the meaning of “I will bless?” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “Take note. I am handing over the blessings to all whom you bless, and I am sealing [them] through you.” But if from then on the blessings were [handed over] to Abraham, why did he not bless Isaac? It was because Abraham saw that Esau would issue from him. He said, “If I bless Isaac, then Esau will be blessed, and Isaac will be found lacking.” A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To the head of a household that had a vineyard,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Gen. R. 61:6; Numb. R. 11:2; M. Pss. 1:5.</i> [and] gave it to a tenant. And in that vineyard was a tree of life, but it had overgrown a tree having a deadly poison. Now he did not know what to do. He said, “If I cultivate that vineyard, then the tree having a deadly poison will flourish; but if I do not cultivate that vineyard, then the tree of life will die. So what shall I do? I will bear with that vineyard until the owner of the vineyard comes. Then he may do what he wants with his vineyard.” And so also did Abraham say, “If I bless Isaac, Esau will end up being blessed and Jacob will lose out. Rather look here. I will leave him alone until the Holy One, blessed be He, comes, when He will deal with what belongs to Him.” Jacob came and received five blessings: two from his father, one from Abraham, one from the angel, and one from the Holy One, blessed be He.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. Gen. R. 94:5.</i> From his father, as stated (in Gen. 27:33), “Then Isaac trembled (when he realized he had blessed Jacob instead of Esau). Why “trembled?” R. Eliezer ben Pedat said, “[He did so] because he saw <i>Gehinnom</i> open in front of him. He wanted to say, ‘Cursed will be [Jacob.’ Instead,] he went back [on it], and added blessing [to it], when he said (ibid., end), ‘he also shall be blessed.’” Here is one [blessing]. A second (is in Gen. 28:1), “So Isaac called Jacob and blessed him.” The blessing of the Holy One, blessed be He, (is in Gen. 35:9), “Now God appeared unto Jacob [… and blessed him].” The blessing of Abraham (is in Gen. 28:4), “And may He grant you the blessing of Abraham.” And the blessing of an angel is (in Gen. 32:30), “and he (the angel) blessed him there.” When Jacob came to bless the tribes, he blessed them with the five blessings that he had in hand and added one blessing to them, as stated (in Gen. 49:28), “All these are the tribes of Israel, [twelve in number, and this is what their father spoke to them when he blessed them, each one with his own blessing is how he blessed them].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash notes that the words, HE BLESSED THEM, occur twice and interprets the verse to mean that one blessing, the fivefold blessing he had received, was for the tribes as a group while the other blessing was a specific blessing for each tribe.</i> When Moses came to bless Israel, he added a seventh blessing to them. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 33:1), “And this is the blessing.” [According to another interpretation, Moses made] an addition to the blessings with which Balaam had blessed Israel,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>PRK</i> 31(suppl. 1):4.</i> since it was fitting for him to bless them with seven blessings corresponding to the seven altars [he had built];<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On these altars, see Numb. 23:1, 14, 29.</i> but [Balaam] only blessed them with three, as stated (in Numb. 24:10), “but here you have even blessed them these three times.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “O wicked one, your eye is too jaundiced for you to bless them. Moreover, I am not putting the power in your hand to finish your blessing over Israel. Moses will come, whose eye is fair; then he will bless Israel.” And it is about him that Solomon has said (in Prov. 22:9), “He that has a benevolent eye shall be blessed (<i>ybrk</i>).” Do not read “<i>ybrk</i> [with vowels meaning] shall be blessed,” but [with vowels meaning] “shall bless.” This refers to Moses our master whose eyes were fair when he blessed Israel, such that he blessed them with [the other] four blessings: The first is (in Exod. 39:43), “When Moses saw all the work […] he blessed them.” The second is (in Lev. 9:23), “Then Moses and Aaron came unto the tent of meeting; and when they came out, they blessed the people….” The third is (in Deut. 1:11), “May the Lord God of your ancestors add [to your numbers a thousand times more than you are and bless you].” The fourth is (here in Deut. 33:1), “And this is the blessing.” It is therefore stated (in Prov. 31:29), “Many daughters have done valiantly, but you surpass them all.”(Deut. 33:1:) And this is the blessing.” It was fitting for Moses to bless Israel because he had constantly risked his life for them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>PRK</i> 31(suppl. 1):12.</i> For this reason, it is stated (in Deut. 33:1), “And this is the blessing [that Moses blessed... the Children of Israel].” (Deut. 33:1:) “The man of God (the Power).” If it says, “man,” why does it say, “God,” and if it says, “God,” why does it say, “man?” It is simply that at the time he fled from in front of Pharaoh, he was a man, but at the time he trounced [the Egyptians], he was a power. Another interpretation: At the time that he went up to the firmament, he was a man; in front of the angels that were all fire, he was a man. But at the time he came down, he was a power. Before he went up to the firmament, he was a man, as he would eat and drink. But all the time that he was there, he was a power, as stated (in Exod. 34:20), “and they were afraid to approach him.”"

Abba said (regarding Deut. 33:1), “’Which Moses blessed,’ that is Moses; ‘the man of God,’ that is the Holy One, blessed be He, as stated (in Exod. 15:3), ‘The Lord is a man of war.’ And why so much?

R. 11:6.</i> Then what is the meaning of before his death? Before the angel of death. When the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him (in Deut. 32:49-50) “Ascend [this mountain of the Abarim]…. And you shall die,” the angel of death thought that the Holy One, blessed be He, had already given him authority over Moses' life. He came and stood directly above him. Moses said to him, “The Holy One, blessed be He, has already promised me that he would not deliver me into your hand.” He [answered], “The Holy One, blessed be He, has sent me to you; that you are to depart on this day.” Moses said to him, “Go away from here, as I want to praise the Holy One, blessed be He, ‘I will not die, but rather live and tell the acts of the Lord (Ps. 118:17).’” The angel said to him, “Why are you bragging, He [already] has someone to praise Him, (in Ps. 19:2), ‘The heavens recount God’s glory.’” Moses said, “I will quiet them and praise,” as stated (in Deut. 32:1), “Listen O heavens....” He came to him a second time. What did Moses do? He mentioned the explicit name [of God], and [so the angel] fled, as stated (Deut. 32:3), “For I proclaim the name of the Lord.” He [then] came to him a third time. [At that point,] Moshe said, “Since he is coming from the Heavens, I must justify the judgement [of death] upon myself.” He immediately began saying (in Deut. 32:4), “The Rock, His actions are just.” R. Isaac said, “Moses’ soul was hesitating to leave him, and he spoke with it. He said to it, ‘Tell me, my soul, what will you say, since the angel of death seeks to subdue you?’ It said to him, ‘He will not do so to me, as the Holy One, blessed be He, promised me that he would not deliver me into his hand.’ He said to it, ‘Tell me [what you will say] when you see them crying and you cry with them.’ It said to him (in Ps. 116:8), ‘You have delivered me from death, my eyes from tears’. He said to it, ‘Tell me [what you will say] when they try to push you to <i>Gehinnom</i>.’ It said to him (in Ps. 116:8, cont.), ‘my feet from stumbling.’ He said to it, ‘And where will you be walking in the future?’ It said to him (in Ps 116:9), ‘I shall walk before the Lord in the lands of the living.’ When Moses heard this from it, he said to it (Ps. 116:7), ‘Return, O my soul.’” R. Abba said, “Once he was departed, the lower creatures (people) said (Deut. 33:4), ‘Moses charged us with Torah.’ The higher creatures (angels) said, ‘He executed the Lord’s judgments and His decisions for Israel.’ And even the Holy One, blessed be He, Himself, in all of His glory praises him and says (in Deut. 34:10-11), ‘Never again did there arise in Israel a prophet like Moses [...].

Thus it is stated (ibid., cont.), “and He shone upon them from Seir.” These are the Children of Esau, in that they were children of Seir. (Ibid., cont.:) “He appeared from Mount Paran.” These are the Children of Ishmael, of whom it is stated (in Gen. 21:21), “He dwelt in the Wilderness of Paran.” It is also written (in Hab. 3:6), “He arose and measured the earth; [He looked and made nations tremble (rt.: <i>ntr</i>, literally, leap)].” When the Holy One, blessed be He, saw that they did not want to accept the Torah, He made them jump into <i>Gehinnom</i>, even as it says (in Lev. 11:21), “to leap (rt.: <i>ntr</i>) with upon the ground.” Yet it says in another place (in Ps. 138:4), “All the kings of the earth shall give thanks to You, O Lord, for they have heard the words of Your mouth.” And [so] we still need to learn that they did not want to heed. Micah the Morashitite came and put an end to the matter, where it is stated (in Micah 5:14), “In anger and wrath will I execute retribution on the nations [because they have not obeyed].” Here you learn that they did not want to receive the Torah. David came and gave thanks to the Holy One, blessed be He, over this, where it is stated (in Ps. 77:15), “You are the God who performs wonders; You have made Your strength known among the peoples.” David said, “Master of the World, O the wonders that You performed when You made Your Torah known to the nations of the world!” [As] “Your strength” can only be Torah, since it is stated (in Ps. 29:11), “The Lord will grant strength to His people.” R. Abbahu said, “It was revealed and made known to the One who spoke and world came into being that the nations of the world would not accept the Torah. Then for what reason did He make them the offer? It is simply that this represents the character of the Holy One, blessed be He. First He made an offer to His creatures, and after that He drove them from the world, because the Holy One, blessed be He, does not deal with His creatures in tyranny.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gk.: <i>tyrannia</i>.</i> A second reason for his making them an offer: [It was] on account of appeasement of [their] ancestors.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>PRK</i> 31 (suppl. 1):15, which reads: “Because of the merit of the ancestors.” Abraham had fathered Ishmael and Isaac had fathered Esau.</i>"

He is valiant, but among his hosts there some more valiant than he. In the case of the Holy One, blessed be He, however, there is no one like Him among all His myriads. It is so stated (in Ps. 86:8), “There is no one like You among the powers, O Lord.” It also says (in Exod. 15:11), “Who is like You among the powers, O Lord ]...].” (Deut. 33:2, cont.:) “At His right hand is a fiery law.” [This] teaches that the Torah was given only by the right hand.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>PRK</i> 31 (suppl. 1):17.</i> R. Johanan said, “Whoever wants to be engaged with the Torah should see himself as if he were standing in the fire.

Another interpretation (of Deut. 33:3), “and they are pounded at Your feet”: Although they are beaten, they do not move from Your dwellings, but (ibid., end) “they take up (from) Your words,” a great reward; as they take up and bring (discuss) in the war (debate) of the Torah. (Deut. 33:4:) “Moses charged us with Torah, as the inheritance for the Congregation of Jacob.” It is an inheritance for the Congregations of Jacob, for whoever engages in it for its own sake is worthy of the inheritance of Jacob, as stated (in Is. 58:14), “Then you shall take delight in the Lord…, and I will feed you the inheritance of your father Jacob.”"

It speaks of none other than Moses the righteous, for there is no one like him, not among the prophets and not among the sages. So here is the Holy One, blessed be He, testifying concerning him after his death (in Deut. 34:10), “Never again did there arise in Israel a prophet like Moses.” Still, he did not have the power to save himself from death, all the more so other people. And David therefore said (in I Chron. 29:15), “For we are sojourners before You and transients like all our ancestors; our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no hope.” But is it not written (in Ps. 37:34), “Hope in the Lord and keep His way, [and He will raise you up to inherit the land?” So why does the text say (in I Chron. 29:15), “and there is no hope?” David said, “Master of the world, in all circumstances a person has hope. If one is poor, he hopes until he becomes rich. If he is feeble, he hopes until be becomes strong. [If] he is sick, he hopes until he is healed. If he is confined in prison, he hopes until they free him. On the day of death, however, he has no hope.” As see here that the Holy One, blessed be He, spoke with Moses face to face, but he was [still] not able to save himself from death. And so Solomon has said (in Eccl. 9:2), “Since everything [happens] to everyone, [the same lot to the righteous and to the wicked].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>PRK</i> 26:1.</i> R. Hanina said, “In the case of an intercessory spirit,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Pisqonit.</i> Cf. <i>Sanh.</i> 44b, where the Tosafot and the notes of Elijah Gaon of Vilna, citing Rashi, identify this spirit with Gabriel, who was surnamed Pisqon, because he argues against the Holy One.</i> it has authority to speak before the Holy One, blessed be He. [Such a one is] like a senator<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lat.: <i>senator.</i></i> before the king. So he says to [the Holy One, blessed be He], ‘Master of the world, all flesh is [destined] for death. Abraham experienced death, Nimrod experienced death; Isaac experienced death, Abimelech experienced death; Moses experienced death, Pharaoh experienced death; for Solomon has stated (in Eccl. 3:20), “Everyone is going to the same place.” So from now on, what gain is there for the righteous to be engaged with the Torah and good works in this world? And what loss is there for the wicked to sin and cause [others] to sin in this world?’ Solomon has the explanation (in vs. 21), ‘Who knows the lifebreath (spirit) of humans (literally, the Children of Adam) that rise upward [and the lifebreath (spirit) of the beast that goes down into the earth]?’ ‘The spirit of humans,’ these are the spirits of the righteous, because they are put in storage and hidden under the throne of glory;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shab.</i> 152b; Deut. R. 11:10.</i> ‘and the spirit of the beast that goes down into the earth,’ these are the spirits of the wicked, which go down to <i>Gehinnom</i>. And so it says (in Is. 14:15), ‘You shall also be brought down unto <i>Sheol</i>, [unto the uttermost parts of the pit].’” But where is it shown that the righteous are called Adam? Where Jonah says so (in Jon. 4:11), “So should I not take pity on Nineveh, [that great city] in which there are over a hundred and twenty thousand persons (literally, Adams), [who do not know their right hand from their left, and many animals].” “Adams,” these are the righteous; “who do not know their right hand from their left, and many animals,” these are the wicked, in that their actions are like the actions of the animals. It is therefore stated (in Prov. 11:31), “Behold, shall a righteous one be recompensed on earth?”"

Samuel bar Nahmani said, “Do days die? These words are simply a reference to the righteous. When they die, their days pass away from the world, but they themselves remain alive, as stated (in Job 12:10), ‘In whose hand is every living soul.’ If the living are delivered into His hand, are the dead not delivered into His hand? It is simply that these are the righteous, who even in their death are called living.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ber.</i> 18ab.</i> Thus it is stated (in II Sam. 23:20), ‘And Benaiah ben Jehoiada, the son of a valiant warrior (literally, of a living person) from Kazbeel, [who had performed great deeds…].’ And is not everyone [eventually] dead? However, the wicked during their lifetime and in their death are called dead, as stated (in Ezek. 21:30), ‘And you, O slain wicked [prince of Israel, whose day has come…].’” And so it says (in Deut. 17:6), “On the evidence of two or three witnesses shall the dead be put to death.” Does someone dead deserve another death? It is simply that the wicked during life are regarded as dead. Because on seeing the rising sun, such a one does not say the blessing, \"blessed be the One who forms light.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The opening blessing before the morning <i>Shema</i>‘.</i> When it sets, he does not say the blessing, \"who brings on evenings.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The opening blessing before the evening <i>Shema</i>‘.</i> Nor does he say a blessing when eating or drinking. However, the righteous do say a blessing for each and every thing that they eat and drink, and see and hear. Moreover, [these blessings] are uttered not only while they are alive, but even when they are dead. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 149:5-6), “Let the saints rejoice in glory; let them sing for joy upon their beds. With paeans to God in their throats and two-edged swords in their hands.”",
