            "... Adam looked to above and below . . . and he saw the creatures/b’riyot that the Holy One had created and he began to glorify the name of his Creator and he said, “How diverse are Your works Hashem” [Ps 104:24]. He stood on his feet and was described/proportioned/m’to’ar in the likeness of Elohim. The creatures saw him and they were afraid of him, as they thought that he created them, and all of them came to bow down to him. He said to them: “You’ve come to bow down to me? Come, I and you, and we will go and clothe in majesty and strength and make rule over us . . . the one who created us . . . Adam went and made Him rule over himself first and all the creatures after him and they said: “Hashem ruled, clothed in majesty” [Ps 93:1]."
