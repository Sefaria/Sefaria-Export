                "In the name of Yud-Hei (יה), I will begin to write from the teachings of Rabbi Eliezer with the help of the One who helped our ancestors at the Red Sea.",
                "Rabbi Eliezer, the son of Rabbi Yosei HaGalili, said in the name of Rabbi Shimon, 'Every place where you find the words of Rabbi Eliezer, his son, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGalili, in the Haggadah, tilt your ear like an antler, as it is written, 'Incline your ear to wisdom, bend your heart to understanding' (Proverbs 2:2). Through this, you will recognize the one who said and it was, the Author of Creation. Learn the Haggadah, for through it, you will recognize the Torah and the ways of your Creator, to walk in all His paths and cleave unto Him.",
                "Thirty-three principles are required in the Haggadah. Of majority, minority, majority after majority, minority after minority, explicit leniency and stringency, implicit leniency and stringency, equal derivation, building on a foundation, a case of short reasoning, a matter subject to change, a structured order, an issue that comes to teach but is found to have been learned, a generalization followed by a specific example, an issue dependent on a small element from which the larger point is deduced in a manner perceivable by the ear as it hears, two scriptures that contradict each other until a third comes and decides between them, a unique matter in its place, a matter that is not interpreted in its place and is interpreted elsewhere, a matter that is stated partially and applied universally, a matter that is stated for one and has relevance for another, a matter that is linked to two principles, and you give it the power of the better of the two, a matter that one's fellow reproves him for, a matter that one reproves his fellow for, a matter that is part of a category but stands out from the category to teach about itself, a matter that is part of a category but stands out from the category to teach about another, a governance, an allusion, an opposition in it, from a gematria, from a letter substitution, from the language of a netrikon, early and late regarding its context, early and late regarding its divisions."
