                "... …and the Holy One said to Israel, ‘my children – now take from me the cup of consolation.’ They replied to Him ‘Master of the World! You were angry with us and brought us out from within Your house and exiled us among the nations of the world [and that is like a vessel cast aside among the nations of the world] and now you’ve come to appease us?! He said to them, ‘I will give you an allegory, to what is this thing to be likened? To a man who married his sister’s daughter. He grew angry with her and sent her out of his house, and after some days came to appease her. She said to him ‘you were angry with me and threw me out of your house and now you’ve come to appease me?!’ He said to her, ‘you are are my sister’s daughter, maybe you will say in your heart that from the day that you went out of my house [another woman entered in, by your life] even I have not entered my house.’ Thus the Holy One said to Israel, ‘my children, from the day I destroyed My house below I have not gone up and sat in My house above. Rather, I sat in the dew and the rain. If you do not believe me place your hands in My head [and see the dew which is on My head, if it were not an explicit verse it would be impossible to say] as it says “…for my head is full of dew, my locks with the drops of the night.” (Shir HaShirim 5:2) And the Holy One clothed Zion with her strength, in reward for “The Eternal's strength and His vengeance were my salvation…” (Shemot 15:2) which they said at the sea, [and from where do we learn that the Holy One clothes her in her strength?] as it says “Awaken, awaken, put on your strength, O Zion…” (Yeshayahu 52:1)"
