            "<b>“It was during the days when the judges judged, there was a famine in the land. A man from Bethlehem of Judah went to reside in the field of Moav, he, his wife, and his two sons” (Ruth 1:1).</b><br>“It was during the days when the judges judged” – Rabbi Yoḥanan began and said: “Hear My people and I will speak; [Israel, and I will forewarn you]” (Psalms 50:7). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One forewarns only one who can hear it. Rabbi Yudan ben Rabbi Simon said: In the past they were called Israel like all other nations: “Savta, Rama, and Savtekha” (Genesis 10:7);<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These are the names of nations listed in Genesis, chap. 10.</i> from here forward, they are called only My people. “Hear My people and I will speak” – from where did you merit to be called My people? From “and I will speak” – from what you spoke before Me at Sinai and said: “Everything that the Lord has spoken we will do and we will heed” (Exodus 24:7). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: “Hear My people” – [what I have said] in the past; “and I will speak” – in the future. “Hear My people” – in this world; “and I will speak” – in the World to Come. So I will have a response to the angels of the nations of the world who are destined to accuse them before Me and say: ‘Master of the universe, these worship idols and those worship idols, these engaged in forbidden sexual relations and those engaged in forbidden sexual relations, these spilled blood and those spilled blood, and these are going down to the Garden of Eden and those are going down to Gehenna?’<br>At that time, the advocate of Israel is silenced. That is what you say: “At that time Mikhael will stand” (Daniel 12:1). Is there sitting on high? Did Rabbi Ḥanina not say: There is no sitting on high, as it is written: “I approached one of those standing [<i>kamaya</i>]” (Daniel 7:16). What is this language <i>kamaya</i>? Standing [<i>kayama</i>], as it is written: “Seraphim stood above Him” (Isaiah 6:2), and it is written: “The entire host of heaven standing in His presence on His right hand and on His left” (see I Kings 22:19). And you say “will stand”?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since angels always stand, what does it mean that the angel Mikhael will stand at that moment?</i> [Rather,] what is “will stand”? It is stand silent, as you say: “Shall I wait, because they do not speak, <because they stand silent [<i>amdu</i>] and do not answer>?” (Job 32:16).<br>The Holy One blessed be He says to him: ‘Do you stand silent and not advocate on behalf of My children? By your life, I will speak in support of their righteousness and rescue My children.’ What righteousness? Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Yoḥanan, one says: Due to the righteousness that you established My world because you accepted My Torah, as had you not accepted My Torah, I would have restored it [the world] to emptiness and disorder, as Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: “Earth and all its inhabitants dissolve, [I set its pillars, selah]” (Psalms 75:4). The world would have already dissolved, had Israel not stood before Mount Sinai…<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Referring to a midrash that appears in <i>Shir HaShirim Rabba</i> 1:9: “If Israel had not stood on Mount Sinai and said: ‘Everything that the Lord has spoken we will do and we will heed’ (Exodus 24:7), the world would have dissolved and returned to emptiness and disorder.” The midrash there then continues as it does here.</i> And who established the world? “I [<i>anokhi</i>] set its pillars” (Psalms 75:4). Due to the merit of <i>anokhi</i>, “I set its pillars, selah.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Anokhi</i> is the first word of the Ten Commandments. In other words, due to the merit of Israel’s future acceptance of the Ten Commandments and the entire Torah, God established the foundations of the world.</i> One said: Due to the righteousness you did for yourselves in accepting My Torah, as had you not done so, I would have eliminated you from among the nations.<br> “God; I am your God” (Psalms 50:7) – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is sufficient for you that I am your patron. Reish Lakish said: Although I am your patron, how does My patronage help at trial?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash is responding to the repetition in the verse: “God; I am your God.” God [<i>Elohim</i>] represents the attribute of justice, and the verse thus presents a tension between God being strictly just and God being particularly Israel’s God, i.e., their patron.</i><br>Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai taught: I am the God for all humankind, but I have designated My name only upon My people Israel. I am not called the God of all the nations, but rather, the God of Israel. “God [<i>Elohim</i>]; I am your God” – Rabbi Yudan interpreted the verse in reference to Moses: The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Even though I called you “god to Pharaoh” (Exodus 7:1), “I am your God” – I am above you.’ Rabbi Abba bar Yudan interpreted the verse in reference to Israel: Although I called you god, as it is stated: “I said you are godlike [<i>elohim</i>]” (Psalms 82:6), “I am your God” – know that I am above you. The Rabbis interpreted the verse in reference to judges: Even though I called you <i>elohim</i>, as it is stated: “Do not curse <i>elohim</i>” (Exodus 22:27), know that I am above you. Then He said to Israel: ‘I accorded honor to the judges and called them <i>elohim</i>, and they demean them. Woe unto a generation that judges their judges.’",
            "“It was during the days when the judges judged.” “Indolence casts into a deep sleep” (Proverbs 19:15) – because Israel were indolent in paying their respects to Joshua; that is what is written: “They buried him on the border of his inheritance…north of Mount Gaash” (Joshua 24:30). Rabbi Berekhya said: We reviewed the entire Bible and did not find a place named Gaash. What is Mount Gaash? It is because Israel was negligent [<i>nitgaashu</i>] in doing kindness for Joshua. At that time, the Land of Israel was being divided [among the tribes], and its division [i.e., the land] was too beloved to them. Israel were engaged in their labor; this one was occupied in his field, this one was occupied in his vineyard, this one was occupied in his olives, and this one was occupied with his planks [for construction]. “A deceitful soul will starve” (Proverbs 19:15)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the conclusion of the verse: “Indolence casts into a deep sleep, and the deceitful soul will starve” (Proverbs 19:5).</i> – Israel was negligent [<i>nitgaashu</i>] in doing kindness for Joshua, and the Holy One blessed be He sought to bring an earthquake upon the world, upon all its inhabitants, as you say: “The earth shook [<i>vatigash</i>] and quaked” (Psalms 18:8). “A deceitful soul will starve” – because they were deceitful to the Holy One blessed be He: Some of them worshipped idols. Therefore, the Holy One blessed be He starved them of the divine spirit, as it is stated: “The word of the Lord was rare in those days” (I Samuel 3:1).<br>Another interpretation: “Indolence casts into a deep sleep” (Proverbs 19:15) – due to the fact that Israel was indolent about repenting during the days of Elijah, “casts into [<i>tapil</i>] a deep sleep” – prophecy proliferated. Proliferated? But you said <i>tapil.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tapil</i> literally means ‘cause to fall’ or ‘cause to decline.’</i> It is as you say: The price of fruit has fallen.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because the supply has increased, the price has declined.</i> Rabbi Simon said: Like a person who says to another: ‘Here is a sack, here is a <i>sela</i> coin, arise and eat.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, prophecy was readily available, like buying produce.</i> As Rabbi Derosa said: Six hundred thousand prophets arose for Israel during the days of Elijah; Rabbi Yaakov said: One million two hundred thousand. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Between Gevat and Antipatris<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gevat was at the southern border of Roman Judea and Antipatris at its northern border. This expression is a way of saying ‘throughout Judea.’</i> there were six hundred thousand towns, and there were no towns more corrupt that Beit El and Jericho; Jericho, because Joshua cursed it (see Joshua 6:26), and Beit El, because Yerovam’s calves were situated there (see I Kings 12:28–29). It is stated: “The disciples of the prophets who were in Beit El went out to Elisha” (II Kings 2:3). “Prophets” – prophets are no fewer than two.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If in this corrupt city there were at least two prophets, presumably there were more elsewhere.</i> Why were their prophecies not publicized? It is because they served no purpose for future generations. On this basis, say: Any prophecy that served no purpose for future generations was not publicized. But in the future, the Holy One blessed be He will come and bring them with Him, and their prophecy will be publicized; that is what is written: “The Lord my God will come, all the holy ones with You” (Zechariah 14:5).<br>“A deceitful soul will starve” (Proverbs 19:15) – because they would deceive the Holy One blessed be He: Some of them worshipped idols and some of them worshipped the Holy One blessed be He. This is what Elijah said to them: “How long will you waver between the two opinions” (I Kings 18:21)? “Will starve” – the Holy One blessed be He starved them during the days of Elijah, as it is stated: “By the life of the Lord [. . .] before whom I have stood [there will not be dew or rain during these years]” (I Kings 17:1). Another interpretation: “Indolence casts into a deep sleep” (Proverbs 19:15) – because Israel were indolent about repenting during the days of the judges, a deep sleep will be cast upon them. “A deceitful soul will starve” – because they deceived the Holy One blessed be He with some of them worshipping idols and some of them worshipping the Holy One blessed be He, the Holy One blessed be He starved them with a famine during the days of their judges.",
            "“It was during the days when the judges judged, there was a famine.” “The path of a man is erratic [<i>hafakhpakh</i>] and strange, [but as for the pure, his conduct is upright]” (Proverbs 21:8) – this is the wicked Esau [Rome] who would erratically [<i>mithapekh</i>] assail Israel with [evil] decrees. ‘Did you steal?’ ‘We did not steal.’ ‘Did you kill?’ ‘We did not kill.’ ‘You did not steal, who stole with you?’ ‘You did not kill, who killed with you?’ They would confiscate from them and impose monetary penalties upon them: Bring your property tax, bring your head tax, bring your state tax. “Man” – this is the wicked Esau, as it is stated: “Esau was a man who knew hunting” (Genesis 25:27). “And strange” – as he made himself estranged from circumcision and estranged from mitzvot. “Pure” – this is the Holy One blessed be He, who treats him in upright ways and gives him his reward in this world, like a laborer who performs labor in good faith with his employer.<br>Another interpretation: “The path of a man [<i>ish</i>] is erratic [<i>hafakhpakh</i>] and strange” (Proverbs 21:8) – these are the nations of the world who constantly [<i>mehapekhin</i>] assail Israel with [evil] decrees. “A man” – they who descend from Noah, who was called “a man” (Genesis 6:9); “and strange” – as they worship idols. “But as for the pure, his conduct is upright [<i>yashar</i>]” – this is the Holy One blessed be He, who treats them in an upright manner. Rabbi Aḥa said: “The path…is erratic” – this is Israel, as it is stated: “As they are an erratic generation” (Deuteronomy 32:20). “A man [<i>ish</i>]” – “The men [<i>ish</i>] of Israel took an oath” (Judges 21:1).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is difficult to ascertain what is meant by this reference. Perhaps the midrash seeks to connect “the path of a man is erratic” to the tragic events surrounding the concubine of Giva recounted in Judges, chaps. 19–21.</i> “And strange [<i>vazar</i>]” – because they estranged themselves from the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “They betrayed the Lord, as they begot foreign [<i>zarim</i>] children” (Hosea 5:7). “But as for the pure” – that is the Holy One blessed be He, who conducts Himself with uprightness in this world and gives them a complete reward in the future, like a craftsman who performs his labor in good faith with his employer. At that time, the Holy One blessed be He said: My children are recalcitrant; to eliminate them is impossible, to return them to Egypt is impossible, to exchange them with another nation, I am unable. What shall I do to them? I will afflict them with suffering and will refine them with famine during the days when the judges judged. That is what is written: “It was during the days when the judges judged, there was a famine in the land.”",
            "Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon began: “He said: I will hide My face from them” (Deuteronomy 32:20). [It is analogous] to a king’s son who went out to the marketplace and struck but was not hit, demeaned but was not demeaned, and he went running up to his father. He [his father] said to him: ‘What do you think, that you are honored because your own honor? You are honored only because of my honor.’ What did his father do? He repudiated him, and no one paid any attention to him [the son]. So, when Israel departed from Egypt, dread of them fell over all the nations, as it is stated: “Peoples heard, they were agitated; terror gripped the dwellers of Philistia. Then the chieftains of Edom were confounded, trembling gripped the powers of Moav, all the dwellers of Canaan dissolved. Dread and fear fall upon them” (Exodus 15:14–16). When they began transgressing and performing evil deeds, the Holy One blessed be He said to them: What do you think, that you are honored due to your own honor? You are honored only due to My honor. What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He repudiated them a bit, and the Amalekites came and confronted Israel, as it is stated: “Amalek came and waged war with Israel in Refidim” (Exodus 17:8). In addition, the Canaanites came and confronted Israel, as it is stated: “The Canaanites heard […and waged war with Israel]” (Numbers 21:1).<br>The Holy One blessed be He said: You have no faithfulness, you are not true to your word, you are erratic, as it is stated; “As they are an erratic generation, children in whom there is no trust [<i>emun</i>]” (Deuteronomy 32:20). It is written <i>amen</i>. When the prophets would bless them, not one of them began to say amen until Jeremiah said it, as it is stated: “I responded, saying: Amen, Lord” (Jeremiah 11:5). At that time, the Holy One blessed be He said: You are erratic, you are bothersome, you are recalcitrant; to eliminate them is impossible, to return them to Egypt is impossible, to exchange them with another nation is impossible…",
            "Rabbi Neḥemya began: “Israel, your prophets have been like foxes in ruins. [You did not go up into the breaches or build a fence for the house of Israel, to stand in battle on the day of the Lord]” (Ezekiel 13:4–5)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The prophets addressed by Ezekiel are false prophets, “foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing” (Ezekiel 13:3).</i> – just as this fox anticipates in the ruins so that when he sees people he will know to which direction to flee, so <your prophets> have been like foxes in the ruins. You did not go up into the breaches like Moses. To whom was Moses our master similar? It is to a faithful shepherd for whom a fence fell just before dark. He arose and fenced on three sides, but a breach remained, and he did not have time to fence it. He stood in the breach; a lion came, and he stood against it. A wolf came, and he stood against it. You [the prophets], however, did not stand in the breach like Moses, for if you had gone up into the breaches like Moses, you would have been able to stand in battle on the day of God’s wrath.",
            "<b>“The name of the man was Elimelekh, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Maḥlon and Khilyon, Efratites of Bethlehem in Judah. They came to the field of Moav, and they were there” (Ruth 1:2).</b><br>“The name of the man was Elimelekh” – once trouble came, you went and abandoned them. “A man from Bethlehem of Judah” (Ruth 1:1) – that is what the verse says: “Our oxen [<i>alufeinu</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>aluf</i> can also mean leader. The midrash is reading the verse to refer to Elimelekh as a leader of the people.</i> are laden [<i>mesubalim</i>]; [there is no breach, none have gone out; there is no outcry in our plazas]” (Psalms 144:14). Rabbi Yoḥanan says: It is not written here: Bearing [<i>sovelim</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As in, the leaders bear the burdens of the people.</i> but rather: “Are laden [<i>mesubalim</i>].” When the lesser bear the burden [<i>sovelim</i>] of the greater, “there is no breach [<i>peretz</i>]” – there is no outbreak [<i>pirtza</i>] of plague, as you say: “A plague broke out among them” (Psalms 106:29). “None have gone out [<i>yotzet</i>]” (Psalms 144:14) – there is no emergence of a plague, as you say: “Fire emerged [<i>vatetzeh</i>] from before the Lord” (Leviticus 9:24). “There is no outcry” (Psalms 144:14) – there is no outcry of plague, as you say: “All Israel that were around them fled at their cry” (Numbers 16:34).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This verse appears in the story of Koraḥ, which concludes with a plague (Numbers 16–17).</i> Reish Lakish reverses the order of the verse: When the greater tolerate<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He reads <i>alufeinu mesubalim</i> to mean, ‘our leaders bear [tolerate].’</i> the lesser there is no breach of exile, as it is written: “Through breaches they will go out” (Amos 4:3). “None have gone out” – to exile, as it is written: “Cast them from before Me and let them go out” (Jeremiah 15:1). “There is no outcry” – of exile, as it is written: “Behold the sound of the outcry of the daughter of my people” (Jeremiah 8:19), and it is written: “And the outcry of Jerusalem has risen up” (Jeremiah 14:2). Rabbi Luliani said: When the lesser heed the greater, but the greater do not bear the burden of the lesser, about them Scripture states: “The Lord will enter into judgment” (Isaiah 3:14). “The name of the man was Elimelekh” – when trouble came, you [Elimelekh] went and abandoned them: “A man from Bethlehem of Judah went” (Ruth 1:1).",
            "Rabbi Tanḥuma in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great, and Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Elazar: This midrash came up with us from the Exile:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From Babylonia. Presumably, this is a way of stating that it is an ancient tradition.</i> Any place that “It was [<i>vayhi</i>]” is stated, [it alludes to] trouble. Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great: Any place that <i>“</i>It was<i></i> [<i>vayhi</i>]”<i></i> is stated, it can serve [to allude to] either trouble or joy. If it is trouble, there is none like it. If it is joy, there is none like it. Rabbi Shmuel said: There are five [instances of] “during the days of [<i>bimei</i>].” “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the days of [<i>bimei</i>] Amrafel” (Genesis 14:1) – what was the trouble there? They waged a war. [It is analogous] to the friend of a king who was located in a certain province. Because of him, the king took care of the province. One time, barbarians came and beset him [the king’s friend]. They say: Woe for us, the king will no longer care for the province as he had done. Likewise, the entire world was created only due to the merit of Abraham our patriarch; that is what is written: “They turned back and came to Ein Mishpat,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ein Mishpat literally means ‘eye of justice’.</i> which is [<i>hi</i>] Kadesh” (Genesis 14:7). Rabbi Aḥa said: They came to beset the eyeball of the world.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Abraham.</i> The eye that overcame the attribute of justice in the world you seek to blind?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash is rhetorically addressing the kings that attacked Abraham.</i> “Which is [<i>hi</i>] Kadesh” – Rabbi Aḥa said: <i>Hu</i> Kadesh.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>hi</i>, meaning ‘which is,’ is spelled with a vav as the middle letter, which could be read as the masculine <i>hu</i>. The midrash is reading <i>hi Kadesh</i> as <i>hu kidesh</i>, he sanctified.</i> He [Abraham] sanctified [<i>kidesh</i>] the name of the Holy One blessed be He in the fiery furnace.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Tanḥuma</i>,<i> Lekh Lekha</i> 6.</i> When everyone saw that all the kings came to beset him, they began screaming: Woe [<i>vai</i>]; that is, “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the reign of Amrafel.”<br>“It was during the days of Aḥaz” (Isaiah 7:1) – what was the trouble there? “Aram from the east and the Philistines from the west” (Isaiah 9:11) – [it is analogous] to the son of a king who had a tutor who sought to kill him. He [the tutor] said: If I kill him, I will be condemned to death by the king; instead, I will withhold his wet nurse from him, and he will die on his own. So did Aḥaz say: If there are no kids, there are no rams, and if there are no rams there is no flock, and if there is no flock there is no shepherd. So Aḥaz thought to say: If there are no children, there are no adults, and if there are no adults there are no students, if there are no students there are no scholars, if there are no scholars, there are no synagogues and study halls, if there are no synagogues and study halls, the Holy One blessed be He, as it were, cannot rest His Divine Presence in the world. Therefore, I will seize all the synagogues and study halls. That is what is written: “Bind the testimony, seal the Torah in my disciples” (Isaiah 8:16).<br>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Why was he named Aḥaz? It is because he seized [<i>aḥaz</i>] the synagogues and study halls. Rabbi Yaakov bar Abba in the name of Rabbi Avin: Isaiah said: “I will wait for the Lord, who conceals His face from the house of Jacob” (Isaiah 8:17). There was no time that was as difficult for Israel as that time, as it is stated: “I will conceal My face” (Deuteronomy 31:18) – in this world. But from that moment, “I hoped for Him” (Isaiah 8:17), as it is written: “As it will not be forgotten from the mouths of their descendants” (Deuteronomy 31:21). Was it [this verse] fulfilled for him [Isaiah]? “Behold, I and the children whom the Lord gave me” (Isaiah 8:18) – were they his [Isaiah’s] children? Were they not his students? It teaches that they were as dear to him as his sons. Once everyone saw that he seized the synagogues and study halls, they began screaming: Woe [<i>vai</i>]: that is, “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the days of Aḥaz.”<br>“It was during the days of Yehoyakim” (Jeremiah 1:3) – what was the trouble there? “I saw the land, and behold, it is emptiness and disorder, and the heavens, and their light is not” (Jeremiah 4:23) – [it is analogous] to a king who sent a proclamation to a province. What did the residents of the province do to it? They took it, ripped it, and burned it in fire. They said: Woe to us when the king becomes aware of these matters. That is what is written: “It was, as Yehudi would read three columns or four” (Jeremiah 36:23) – three or four verses. When he reached the fifth verse: “Its besiegers are ascendant” (Lamentations 1:5),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the fifth verse of the first chapter of Lamentations.</i> immediately: “He would cut it with a scribe’s razor and cast it into the fire that was in the fireplace, until the end of the scroll, upon the fire that was in the fireplace” (Jeremiah 36:23). Once they saw that it was so, they began screaming: Woe [<i>vai</i>]; that is, “it was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the days of Yehoyakim.”<br>“It was during the days of Aḥashverosh” (Esther 1:1) – what was the trouble there? [It was] “to kill, and to eliminate all the Jews” (Esther 3:13). [It is analogous] to a king who entered a vineyard and three enemies beset him: The first began picking unripe grapes, the second began trimming the clusters, and the third sought to uproot all the vines. Likewise, the wicked Pharaoh begin picking the unripe grapes; that is what is written: “[Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying:] Every son who is born you shall cast into the Nile” (Exodus 1:22).<br>The wicked Nebuchadnezzar began trimming the clusters; that is what is written: “[He exiled Yehoyakhin.…] and the artisans and the smiths, one thousand” (II Kings 24:15–16). Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Yehuda said: One thousand artisans and one thousand smiths; Rabbi Yoḥanan said: All of them were one thousand. Rabbi Shmuel bar Rabbi Yitzḥak said: These are the notables. Rabbi Yehuda son of Rabbi Simon said: These are the Torah scholars.<br>Haman the wicked sought to uproot the entire egg;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Egg, in the sense of the very origins of Israel.</i> [as] they say buy [the hen] with the egg<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A aphorism meaning that he sought to complete the task, leaving no future.</i> – “to destroy, to kill, and to eliminate” (Esther 3:13). When they saw that it was so, they began screaming: Woe [<i>vai</i>]; “it was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the days of Aḥashverosh.”<br>“It was during the days when the judges judged” (Ruth 1:1) – what was the trouble there? “There was a famine in the land” (Ruth 1:1) – [it is analogous] to a province that owed a tax to the king. What did the king do? He sent a tax collector to collect it. What did the residents of the province do? They took him, struck him, and extracted it [the money] from him. They said: What he sought to do to us we did to him. Likewise, during the days when the judges judged, an Israelite person would worship idols, and a judge would seek to bring him to trial, and he would come and flog the judge. He would say: What he sought to do to me, I did to him. Woe unto a generation whose judges are judged;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash is reading the verse to mean that it was in the days that the judges were judged, i.e. punished.</i> that is, “It was during the days when the judges judged.”<br>Shimon bar Rabbi Abba said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Everywhere that it [“it was,” <i>vayhi</i>]<i></i> is stated, [it alludes to] trouble or to joy; if trouble, there is no trouble like it, if joy, there is no joy like it in the world. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman came and suggested a [different] distinction: Everywhere that it says, “it was [<i>vayhi</i>],” [it alludes to] trouble, everywhere that it says “it will be [<i>vehaya</i>],” joy.<br>But it is written: “God said: Let there be light, and there was [<i>vayhi</i>] light.” He said to them: Even that is not light of joy, as the world did not merit to use that light. By the light that was created on the first day, a person could look out and see from one end of the world to the other end. When He perceived that the wicked were destined to appear, like the generation of Enosh, the generation of the Flood, and the generation of the Dispersion,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">After the Tower of Babel.</i> and like the people of Sodom, He took it [the light] away.

A man of Bethlehem of Judah went to reside in the fields of Moav; he, his wife, and his two sons” (Ruth 1:1).</b><br>“It was in the days when the judges judged [<i>shefot hashofetim</i>].” Woe to the generation that judged their judges, and woe to the generation whose judges require judgment, as it is stated: “They also did not heed their judges” (Judges 2:17). Who were they [those judges]? Rav said: They were Barak and Deborah. Rabbi Yehosha ben Levi said: They were Shamgar and Ehud. Rav Huna said: They were Deborah, Barak, and Yael. <i>Shefot</i> – one, <i>shofetim</i> – two, <i>hashofetim</i> – three.",
                "Rabbi asked Rabbi Betzalel: What is that which is written: “For their mother has committed harlotry” (Hosea 2:7)? Is it possible that Sarah our matriarch was a harlot? He said to him: ‘Heaven forbid; rather, when are matters of Torah rendered contemptible before the common people? It is when their owners debase them.’ Rabbi Yaakov bar Avdimi came and rendered it a [midrashic] dictum: When do matters of Torah become like harlots before the common people? When their owners debase them. Rabbi Yoḥanan derives it from here: “The poor man’s [<i>misken</i>] wisdom is contemptible” (Ecclesiastes 9:16). Was the wisdom of Rabbi Akiva, who was poor, contemptible? Rather, what is a <i>misken</i>? It is one who is contemptible in his words, like an elder who sits and teaches: “You shall not pervert justice” (Deuteronomy 16:19), and he perverts justice; “you shall not show partiality” (Deuteronomy 16:19), and he shows partiality; “you shall not afflict any widow or orphan” (Exodus 22:21) and he afflicts them. Samson followed his eyes, as it is stated: “Take her for me, as she is fitting in my eyes” (Judges 14:3). Gideon worshipped idols, as it is stated: “Gideon made it into an ephod” (Judges 8:27). Woe to a judge who shows partiality in judgment.<br>Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: “You shall not do injustice in judgment” (Leviticus 19:15) – this teaches that a judge who corrupts judgment is called by five names: unjust, hated, detestable, proscribed, abomination. The Holy One blessed be He calls him five: wicked, blasphemer, violator of the covenant, one who infuriates, and defiant. He causes five results in the world; he defiles the land, desecrates the Name, expels the Divine Presence, causes Israel to fall by the sword, and exiles them from their land. Woe to the generation that is corrupted in this way.<br>Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: “You shall not do injustice in judgment [in measure, in weight, or in volume]” (Leviticus 19:35) – in a judicial ruling. If it is about judicial rulings, it is already stated about judicial rulings!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the verse cited above, Leviticus 19:15: “You shall not do injustice in judgment.”</i> If so, why is it stated, “…in judgment in measure [in weight, or in volume]”? It teaches that one who measures is called a judge, and if he falsifies, he is called five names and he causes five results. Woe is the generation whose measures are false, as Rabbi Benaya said in the name of Rabbi Huna: If you see a generation whose measures are false, a kingdom comes and besets that generation. What is the reason? “Scales of deceit are an abomination to the Lord” (Proverbs 11:1), and it is written: “Pride comes, shame comes” (Proverbs 11:2).<br>Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Abba: It is written: “Will I find merit with scales of wickedness, [or with a pouch of deceitful weights?]” (Micah 6:11). Is it possible that a generation whose measures are false will find merit? Rather, “in a pouch of deceitful weights.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They will be left with a purse filled with counterfeit coins. The midrash is reading the second half of the verse, “or with a pouch of deceitful weights” not as the continuation of the rhetorical question, but as the answer to “Will I find merit with scales of wickedness?”</i> Rabbi Levi said: Moses indeed alluded this to Israel in the Torah: “You shall not have in your purse [alternate weights]” (Deuteronomy 25:13); “you shall not have in your house alternate measures” (Deuteronomy 25:13), and if he did so, ultimately, a kingdom will come and beset them, as it is written: “As it is an abomination to the Lord anyone who does [<i>oseh</i>] so, anyone who does [<i>oseh</i>] injustice” (Deuteronomy 25:16), and it is written: “Remember what Amalek did [<i>asah</i>] to you, on the way, as you were leaving Egypt” (Deuteronomy 25:17).",

Blessings bring blessings upon their purveyors, as it is written: “A whole and just weight shall be [yours]” (Deuteronomy 25:15), and if you do so: “shall be yours” (Deuteronomy 25:15). Curses bring curses upon their purveyors, as it is written: “You shall not have in your purse different weights, large and small” (Deuteronomy 25:13), and if you do so, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘You sought to use large and small? By your life, that wicked one [who uses corrupt weights] will not manage to possess even something small,’ as it is written: “You shall not have in your purse.” Similarly, “you shall not make with Me [gods of silver and gods of gold]” (Exodus 20:20). The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘You sought to make for Me “gods of silver and gods of gold” – by your life, that wicked one will not manage to make even one of wood,’ as it is written: “You shall not make for yourselves” (Exodus 20:20).",

[But] because Saul was an offshoot of a sycamore tree,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The sycamore tree is frail.</i> and would have been unable to withstand it, the Holy One blessed be He transferred it and brought it to David, who is the offshoot of an olive tree<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The olive tree is sturdy.</i> and [he] was able to withstand it. A parable says: Shila sinned and Yoḥana<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Generic names of that period.</i> pays for it? So, all of them did not come upon lowly people, but rather upon mighty people who could withstand them. Rabbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar: [It is analogous] to a glazier who had a basket filled with cups of cut glass. When he sought to hang his basket, he would bring a peg, hammer it [into the wall,] and then hang his basket. So, all of them did not come upon lowly people, but rather to mighty people. Rabbi Berekhya would read in reference to them:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">David’s generation.</i> “He gives strength to the weary” (Isaiah 40:29).<br>Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Ḥelbo: Two [famines]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That of Lemekh occurred while Adam was still alive.</i> came during the days of Adam.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the parallel text of this midrash found in <i>Bereishit Rabba</i> 25:3 it says ‘Abraham’ instead of ‘Adam.’</i> Rav Huna in the name of Rav Aḥa: One was during the days of Abraham, and one was during the days of Lemekh. The famine that was during the days of Elijah was due to a drought. One year it produced [a harvest] and the other year it did not produce. But the famine during the days of Elisha was due to [economic] panic, as it is stated: “Until a donkey’s head was sold for eighty of silver” (II Kings 6:25). [Regarding] the famine that came during the days that the judges judged, Rabbi Huna in the name of Rabbi Dosa: They were forty-two <i>se’a</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A measure of dry volume roughly equivalent to 8 liters.</i> and they became forty-one <i>se’a</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference is to the amount of produce that could be purchased for one <i>sela</i>. Some commentators suggest that the text should be read: they were [sold] at a rate of two <i>se’a</i> [per <i>sela</i>] and became one <i>se’a</i> [per <i>sela</i>]. See Etz Yosef.</i> But is it not taught: A person may not depart to outside the Land of Israel until two <i>se’a</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of wheat.</i> are bought for a shekel?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference is to the biblical shekel, which is the equivalent of the rabbinic <i>sela</i>.</i> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: When is that so? It is when one cannot find anything [else] to buy. But if he can find [other food] to buy, even [at] one <i>se’a</i> for a shekel, a Jew may not leave the Land of Israel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Elimelekh was punished because his decision to leave the Land of Israel was not justified.</i> But is it not taught: During a time of pestilence, a time of war, gather everyone inside, but during a time of famine, scatter? Why was Elimelekh punished? It is because he sank the hearts of Israel.<br>[It is analogous] to a prominent person who lived in a province, and the residents of the province would depend upon him, and would say that if drought years would come, he could provide food for the province for ten years. When a drought year came, his maidservant went out, and went into the market with her basket in her hand. The residents of the province said: This is the one who we relied upon, that if there would be a drought he could support us for ten years? His maidservant is standing in the market with her basket in her hand! So, Elimelekh was one of the prominent residents of the province, and one of the leaders of the generation. When the years of famine arrived, he said: ‘Now, all Israel will come around to my door, this one with his basket and that one with his basket.’ He arose and fled from them; that is what is written: “A man of Bethlehem of Judah went.”",

As opposed to below [the exiled Judeans returning to the land, as described in Ezra], because they were departing from the Land to outside the Land, the verse did not attribute their property to them. “A man…went” – like a stump.<br>“To reside in the fields of Moav” – Rabbi Levi said: Every place<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It does not mean every place literally; depending on the context, there are places where field means city, e.g. when the field is mentioned as a place of residence.</i> you find field, it is a city; [where you find] city, it is a province; province, it is a country.

Thus, Rav Huna is stating that during those six months David did not have the status of a king.</i> “He handed her roasted grain” – the kingship returned to him, as it is stated: “Now I know that the Lord has redeemed His anointed” (Psalms 20:7). “She ate, was sated, and there was some left over” – [David] eats in this world, eats in messianic days, and eats in the future.<br>Alternatively, “come here,” is referring to Solomon. “Come here” – draw near to kingship. “Eat of the bread” – this is the bread of kingship, as it is stated: “Solomon's provision for one day was thirty <i>kor</i> of fine flour, and sixty <i>kor</i> of meal” (I Kings 5:2). “Dip your loaf in the vinegar” – these are his sullied actions. “She sat beside [<i>mitzad</i>] the reapers” – the kingship was temporarily captured [<i>notzeda</i>] from him, as Rabbi Yoḥai bar Ḥanina said: An angel in the image of Solomon descended and sat on his throne, and Solomon would circle among the entrances of Israel<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">188</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Seeking charity</i> and say: “I am Kohelet <son of David>, I was king over Israel in Jerusalem” (Ecclesiastes 1:12). What did one of them do? She gave him a bowl of grits and struck him on his head with a reed, and said to him: ‘Isn’t Solomon sitting on his throne, and [yet] you say: I am Solomon king of Israel?’ “He handed her roasted grain” – the kingship returned to him. “She ate, was sated, and there was some left over” – he eats in this world, eats in messianic days, and eats in the future.<br>Alternatively, “come here,” is referring to Hezekiah. “Come here” – draw near to kingship. “Eat of the bread” – this is the bread of kingship. “Dip your loaf in the vinegar” – these are the afflictions, as it is stated: “Isaiah said: Let them take a cake of figs [and spread it on the rash and he will live]” (Isaiah 38:21).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">189</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse is stated regarding Hezekiah.</i> “She sat beside [<i>mitzad</i>] the reapers” – the kingship was temporarily captured [<i>notzeda</i>] from him, as it says: “So said Hezekiah: A day of distress and chastisement” (Isaiah 37:3). “He handed her roasted grain” – the kingship returned to him, as it is stated: “He was exalted in the eyes of all nations thereafter” (II Chronicles 32:23). “She ate, was sated, and there was some left over” – he eats in this world, eats in messianic days, and eats in the future.<br>Alternatively, “come here,” is referring to Menashe. “Come here” – draw near to kingship. “Eat of the bread” – this is the bread of kingship. “Dip your loaf in the vinegar” – that he sullied his actions like vinegar due to his evil actions. “She sat beside [<i>mitzad</i>] the reapers” – the kingship was temporarily captured [<i>notzeda</i>] from him, as it is written: “The Lord spoke to Menashe and his people, but they would not pay heed. The Lord brought the officers of the army of the king of Assyria against them, and they took Menashe captive in manacles” (II Chronicles 33:10–11). Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: They were manacles of iron and bronze. Rabbi Levi bar Ḥayyata said: They made a bronze cauldron and kindled a fire beneath it. He was crying: ‘Idol so-and-so, idol so-and-so, rescue me!’ When he saw that they were of no avail to him at all, he said: ‘I remember that my father would read to me: “In your distress [all these things] will find you…For the Lord your God is a merciful God [He will not forsake you]” (Deuteronomy 4:30–31). I will cry to Him. If He answers, that is good; if He does not answer, everything is one, all the gods are the same.’ At that moment, the ministering angels arose and sealed all the supernal windows, and they said before Him: ‘Master of the Universe, a person who placed an idol in the Sanctuary, are You accepting him through repentance?’ He said to them: ‘If I do not accept him through repentance, I would thereby be locking the door before all penitents.’ What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He excavated an opening beneath His throne of glory, in a place that no angel has control. That is what is written: “He prayed to Him, He acceded to his entreaty [<i>vaye’ater</i>] and He heard his supplication” (II Chronicles 33:13). Rabbi Levi said: In Arabia, they call excavation <i>atira</i>. “He handed her roasted grain” – the kingship returned to him, as it is stated: “He returned him to Jerusalem, to his kingdom” (II Chronicles 33:13). With what did He return him? Rabbi Shmuel in the name of Rabbi Aḥa said: He returned him with the wind. This is what is said: He causes the wind to blow. “She ate, was sated, and left over” – he eats in this world, eats in messianic days, and eats in the future.<br>Alternatively, it is referring to the messianic king. “Come here” – draw near to kingship. “Eat of the bread” – this is the bread of kingship. “Dip your loaf in the vinegar” – these are the afflictions, as it is stated: “He was pained by our transgressions” (Isaiah 53:5). “She sat beside [<i>mitzad</i>] the reapers” – his kingship is destined to be temporarily captured [<i>litzod</i>] from him, as it says: “I will gather all the nations to Jerusalem for the war and the city will be captured” (Zechariah 14:2). “He handed her roasted grain” – it is destined to return to him, as it is stated: “He will smite the land with the rod of his mouth” (Isaiah 11:4). Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Levi: Like the initial redeemer, so the ultimate redeemer. Just as the initial redeemer was revealed, and then was again concealed from them, and for how long was he concealed from them, for three months, as it is stated: “They encountered Moses and Aaron” (Exodus 5:20);<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">190</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash interprets this as referring to the officers of the Israelites meeting Moses and Aaron after Moses returned from a three-month hiatus in Midyan. See <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 5:19, which similarly states that Moses departed to Midyan, but states that it was for six months.</i> so too, the ultimate redeemer will be revealed to them and concealed from them. How long will he be concealed from them? Rabbi Tanḥuma in the name of the Rabbis: Forty-five days; that is what is written: “From the time the daily offering is abolished…[one thousand two hundred and ninety days]” (Daniel 12:11), and it is written: “Happy is one who waits and it comes [to one thousand three hundred and thirty-five days]”(Daniel 12:12). These extra days, what are they? Rabbi Yitzḥak ben Ketzarta in the name of Rabbi Yona: These are the forty-five days that Israel will gather and eat saltwort; that is what is written: “Who pick saltwort from the bushes.” (Job 30:4).<br>Where will he lead them?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">191</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Where will the messianic king lead the Jewish people?</i> To the Judean Desert, as it is stated: “Behold, I will seduce her and I will lead her to the desert” (Hosea 2:16). [There is] one who says: To the wilderness of Siḥon and Og, as it is stated: “I will yet settle you in tents as in the days of the appointed times” (Hosea 12:10). Anyone who believes in him will live, and one who does not believe in him will go to the nations of the world and they will kill him. Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Maryon said: Ultimately, the Holy One blessed be He will appear to them and rain down manna for them, “and there is nothing new under the sun” (Ecclesiastes 1:9).<br>Alternatively, “come here,” is referring to Boaz, draw near and “eat of the bread,” this is the bread of the reapers. “Dip your loaf in the vinegar,” as it is the way of reapers to dip their loaves in vinegar. Rabbi Yonatan said: From here it is derived that one takes out sour foods to the threshing floors. “She sat beside the reapers,” she certainly sat alongside them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">192</sup><i class=\"footnote\">But not in their midst, for reasons of modesty.</i> “He handed her roasted grain,” a light, small amount, with his two fingers. Rabbi Yitzḥak said: You derive from this one of two matters: Either a blessing rested on the fingers of that righteous man, or that a blessing rested on the innards of that righteous woman. From where? It is from that which is written: “She ate, was sated, and there was some left over.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">193</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If he gave her just a pinch of roasted grain, how could she have been sated, with grain to spare?</i> It stands to reason that the blessing rested on the innards of that righteous woman.<br>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Maryon said: The verse comes to teach you that if a person performs a mitzva he should perform it wholeheartedly, as had Reuben known that the Holy One blessed be He was dictating in his regard: “Reuben heard and he rescued him from their hands” (Genesis 37:21),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">194</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This verse is stated regarding Reuben saving Joseph from his brothers, who wanted to kill him.</i> he would have taken him to his father on his shoulder. Had Aaron known that the Holy One blessed be He was dictating in his regard: “Behold, he is emerging to meet you” (Exodus 4:14), he would have emerged to meet [Moses] with drums and dancing. Had Boaz known that the Holy One blessed be He was dictating in his regard: “He handed her roasted grain, and she ate, was sated, and there was some left over,” he would have fed her fattened calves. Rabbi Kohen and Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin in the name of Rabbi Levi: In the past, a person would perform a mitzva and the prophet would write it. Now, when a person performs a mitzva, who writes it? Elijah writes it, and the messianic king, and the Holy One blessed be He affixes a seal for them. That is what is written: “Then those who feared the Lord spoke one with another, [and the Lord heeded, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before Him]” (Malachi 3:16).",

Alternatively, “the end of a matter is better than its beginning,” there can be a person who performs evil deeds in his youth and in his old age he performs good deeds.

Rabbi Eliezer said to Rabbi Yehoshua: ‘These are engaged in theirs, but we are not engaged in ours.’ They began with Torah, and from Torah to Prophets, and from Prophets to Writings, and the matters were as joyous as when they were given from Sinai. Fire began burning around them. During their actual giving at Sinai, were they not given in fire? As it is stated: “The mountain burned with fire until the heart of the heavens” (Deuteronomy 4:11). [Avuya] said: Since the power of Torah is so great, this son, if he endures, I will devote him to Torah.

She smelled [the offering they had sacrificed in their idolatrous rite] and they gave her from that food and she ate it. It was seething in her stomach like the venom of a serpent.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">215</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because Elisha’s mother had eaten from the idolatrous sacrifice, Elisha had an ingrained desire for sin (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i><br>Years passed and Elisha ben Avuya fell ill.

Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman, Rabbi Elazar said: He took an oath to his evil inclination. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: He took an oath to Avishai ben Tzeruya. He said to him: ‘As the Lord lives, if you touch him, I will mix your blood with his blood.’<br>Boaz, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “As the Lord lives, lie until the morning” (Ruth 3:13). Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Ḥunya, Rabbi Yehuda says: That entire night his evil inclination was agitating him and saying: ‘You are single and seeking a wife and she is single and seeking a husband. Arise and consort with her and she will become your wife.’ He took an oath to his evil inclination and said: ‘As the Lord lives, I will not touch her.’ He said to the woman: “Lie until the morning… if he will redeem you, good, he will redeem.” Rabbi Ḥunya said: “A wise man is strong [<i>baoz</i>]” (Proverbs 24:5), a wise man is Boaz. “And a man of knowledge increases strength” (Proverbs 24:5), but he outdid his evil inclination with an oath."

Rav and Levi, one said: Boaz’s shoe, and the other said: The redeemer’s shoe. The matters appear to be in accordance with the one who said: Boaz’s shoe, as it is the way of the purchaser to give a down payment.<br>Likewise, “Aḥiya grabbed the new garment [that was on him, and rent it into twelve pieces]” (I Kings 11:30). Whose garment? Rav and Levi, one said: Yerovam’s garment, and the other said: Aḥiya’s garment. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: It stands to reason, in accordance with the one who said: Aḥiya’s garment, as it is the way of the righteous to rend his garments when there is a schism in the royal House of David.<br>Likewise, “Samuel turned to go; he seized the edge of his robe, and it ripped” (I Samuel 15:27). Whose robe? Rav and Levi, one said: Saul’s robe, and the other said: Samuel’s robe. It stands to reason, in accordance with the one who said: Samuel’s garment, as it is the way of the righteous to rend their garments when their plantings are not successful.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">245</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Samuel had originally anointed Saul as king, and had informed Saul immediately before the verse cited here that his kingship would be torn from him.</i><br>Likewise, “Yerovam did not again recover strength [in the days of Aviya, and the Lord afflicted him and he died]” (II Chronicles 13:20).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">246</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is not clear whether it was Yerovam or Aviya who was afflicted and died.</i> Rabbi Shmuel said: Do you think that it was Yerovam who was afflicted? It was only Aviya who was afflicted. Why was Aviya afflicted? It is because he disfigured the faces of Israel, as it is stated: “The show of their countenance speaks against them” (Isaiah 3:9). Rabbi Aḥa said: It is because he stationed guards over them for three days so their form would be altered, as it is taught: One may testify that a man died only if he can testify about seeing the countenance of the face with the nose (<i>Yevamot</i> 120a).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">247</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, Aviya’s army saw to it that the soldiers of Yerovam’s army who had been killed would not be able to be positively identified in such a way that their wives could remarry. </i><br>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish, Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is because he publicly humiliated them, as it is stated: “With you are the golden calves [that Yerovam made for you as gods]” (II Chronicles 13:8). Reish Lakish said: It is because he demeaned the honor of Aḥiya the Shilonite, as it is stated: “Vain and wicked men gathered around him” (II Chronicles 13:7) – he called Aḥiya the Shilonite wicked.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">248</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It was Aḥiya the Shilonite, a prophet, who had appointed Yerovam king over the ten tribes and declared that they would break away from the kingdom of Judah. Aviya characterized Yerovam’s rise to power as supported only by vain and wicked men.</i> The Rabbis say: It is because idol worship came under his authority and he did not eliminate it. That is what is written: “Aviya pursued Yerovam [and captured cities from him: Beit El and its environs…]” (II Chronicles 13:19), and it is written: “He positioned one in Beit El” (I Kings 12:29).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">249</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yerovam had positioned a golden calf in Beit El as a place of worship, in place of the Temple in Jerusalem. When Aviya captured Beit El he did not destroy it. Consequently, it is clear that when Aviya derided Yerovam and the kingdom of Israel for its golden calves, he did so only to demean them.</i> These matters can be deduces <i>a fortiori</i>: If, [regarding] a king who demeans a king, the verse states that he was afflicted, a commoner who demeans a commoner all the more so.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">250</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Holy One blessed be He takes pity on the downtrodden.</i>",

Therefore, they mentioned Rachel before Leah so that it would not appear that they were according honor to themselves.</i> Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: Rachel was his primary wife, as it is stated: “Rachel was barren [<i>akara</i>]” (Genesis 29:31), [alluding to the fact that she was] primary [<i>ikar</i>]. Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai taught: Because they said things against Rachel,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">252</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Her enemies would attribute her barrenness to her character flaws.</i> therefore [all the tribes of Israel] are called her children, as it is written: “Rachel is weeping over her children” (Jeremiah 31:15).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">253</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse is referring to the entire nation of Israel, not just the tribes who descended from Rachel. The same is true of the verses in Amos and Jeremiah cited below.</i> They are not only attributed to her; they are even attributed to her son: “Perhaps the Lord, God of hosts, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph” (Amos 5:15).

Son is not written here, but rather, offspring – that offspring that will come from elsewhere, and who is this? It is the messianic king.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">256</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse cited is that which describes Lot’s daughters seeking to become pregnant by Lot. What they wanted was a son, yet the verse states the more general term offspring. This is an allusion to a descendant who would eventually come to be from their actions, namely the messianic king, who descends from Ruth, who herself was from Moav—the son produced by Lot and his younger daughter. The term redeemer mentioned in Ruth 4:14 is an allusion to the messianic king (<i>Midrash Hamevoar</i>).</i>",

                "Rabbi Abba bar Kahana began: “Tremble [<i>rigzu</i>] and do not sin…” (Psalms 4:5). David said before the Holy One, blessed be He: ‘How long will they be provoking [<i>mitragzim</i>] me, and saying: Does he not have flawed lineage? Does he not descend from Ruth the Moavite?’ ‘“…Say in your heart, on your bed…” (Psalms 4:5) – you also, do you not descend from two sisters?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">258</sup><i class=\"footnote\">You also have lineage that could be considered questionable, as Jacob married two sisters, Leah and Rachel. This would later be prohibited by the Torah. This is stated by David as a response to the elders of Judah, who had been taunting him due to his lineage.</i> You, see what are your roots! “…and be silent, Sela” (Psalms 4:5). Tamar, too, whom Judah your grandfather took as a wife, is that not flawed lineage?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">259</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judah married Tamar, who had previously been his daughter-in-law. This relationship too would later be prohibited by the Torah.</i> And she was the daughter of Shem ben Noah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">260</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Sages identify him with Malkitzedek king of Shalem, who was a priest, and the Torah severely punishes the daughter of a priest who engages in licentiousness. Consequently, the lineage of her children Peretz and Zeraḥ were compromised by her act of having relations with Judah.</i> What, do you have pedigree?’<br>Rabbi Yaakov bar Aviya said: Confront [<i>argiz</i>] your evil inclination and you will not sin. The Rabbis said: Anger your evil inclination and you will not sin.<br><b>“These are the generations of Peretz: Peretz begot Ḥetzron” (Ruth 4:18).</b><br>“These [<i>eleh</i>] are the generations of Peretz.” Rabbi Abba said: Anywhere that <i>eleh</i> is stated, it rejects what preceded it; <i>ve’eleh</i>, it adds to what preceded it. <As it appears in <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 12 until “informed him that Ishmael repented,” end of quote>.<br><b>“Ḥetzron begot Ram and Ram begot Aminadav” (Ruth 4:19).</b><br>“Ḥetzron begot Ram.” But wasn’t Yeraḥme’el a previous son, [as it is stated:] “the sons of Ḥetzron who were born to him: Yeraḥme’el, Ram, and Keluvi” (I Chronicles 2:9)? Rather, he married a Canaanite woman in order to exalt himself [<i>lehitater</i>] through her, as it is written: “Yeraḥme’el had another wife, and her name was Atara” (I Chronicles 2:26).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">261</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since Yeraḥme’el married a Canaanite woman, the line of kingship did not come through him. </i><br><b>“Aminadav begot Naḥshon and Naḥshon begot Salma.

It appears in two different forms in these verses to allude to the change in status of the family: To this point, its members were tribal princes; from Boaz, Salmon’s son, the family was moving toward establishing the Israelite monarchy (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>).</i> Rabbi Yitzḥak began: “Then [<i>az</i>] I said, behold, I have entered” (Psalms 40:8).

Not only did I enter, but in a scroll and a book it is written about me. In the scroll: Peretz, Ḥetzron, Ram, Aminadav, Naḥshon, Oved, Yishai, David.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">266</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference is to the verses in Ruth 4:18–22.</i> In a book – “the Lord said: Arise, anoint him; for this is he” (I Samuel 16:12). Rabbi Huna says: It is written: “The Lord has provided me another [<i>aḥer</i>] offspring” (Genesis 4:25), an offspring that comes from another [<i>aḥer</i>] place, and who is this? It is the messianic king.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">267</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The messianic king is a descendant of David, and thus David is alluded to in the Torah itself. </i><br>Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Simon [said]: This is analogous to a king who would pass from place to place and a pearl fell from [the crown] on his head. The king and his entire entourage stopped there, and passersby would say: ‘What is the nature [of the stay] of the king and his entourage here?’ They saw and said: ‘A pearl fell from upon his head.’ What did he do? He piled up the dirt, and brought sifters, and sifted one pile but did not find it; the second, but did not find it; and the third, and he found it. They said: ‘The king found his pearl.’ So too, the Holy One blessed be He said to Abraham: “Go for yourself [<i>lekha</i>]” (Genesis 12:1) – It was you [<i>lekha</i>] that I was anticipating.
