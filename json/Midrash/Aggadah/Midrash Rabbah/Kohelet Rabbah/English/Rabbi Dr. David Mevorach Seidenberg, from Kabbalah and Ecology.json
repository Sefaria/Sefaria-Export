Was earth/arets created for the sake of a (human) generation, or a generation created for the sake of the arets?” ... R’ B’rakhyah said in the name of R’ Shimon ben Lakish: Whatever the Holy One created in the human, He created in the earth as a model for him / l’dugma lo. A person/adam has a head and so does the earth, as it is said, “and the head of the dirt/ `afar of the world/teivel” [Pr 8:26]. A person has eyes and so does the earth, as it is said, “And they will cover the eye of the earth” [Ex 10:5]\n"
