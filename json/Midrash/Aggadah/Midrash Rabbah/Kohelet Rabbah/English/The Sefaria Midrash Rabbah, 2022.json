                "<b>“The words of Kohelet, son of David, king in Jerusalem” (Ecclesiastes 1:1).</b><br>“The words of Kohelet, son of David, king in Jerusalem.” This is what the verse said, inspired by the Divine Spirit, [written] by Solomon, king of Israel: “Have you seen a man diligent in his labor? He will stand before kings” (Proverbs 22:29). There was an incident involving Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa, who saw the residents of his city taking up vow offerings and gift offerings to Jerusalem. He said: Everyone is taking up vow offerings and gift offerings to Jerusalem; will I not take anything up? What did he do? He went out to the wilderness [outside] of his city and noticed a certain stone there. He broke it, he chiseled it, and he polished it. He said: I take it upon myself to bring it up to Jerusalem. He sought to hire laborers, and five people came before him. He said to them: ‘Will you take up this stone to Jerusalem for me?’ They said to him: ‘Give us five <i>sela</i> and we will take it up to Jerusalem.’ He sought to give it to them, but he did not have anything in his possession at that time. They left him and went on their way.<br>The Holy One blessed be He arranged for five angels [to appear] to him in the guise of men. He said to them: ‘Will you take up this stone [to Jerusalem] for me?’ They said to him: ‘Give us five <i>sela</i> and we will take your stone up to Jerusalem for you, provided that you join us [in carrying the stone] with your hand and finger.’ He joined them with his hand and finger, and they found themselves standing in Jerusalem. He sought to give them their payment but he did not find them. He entered the Chamber of the Hewn Stone<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The seat of the Sanhedrin.</i> and asked after them. They said to him: ‘It appears that ministering angels took your stone up to Jerusalem,’ and they read this verse in his regard: “Have you seen a man diligent in his labor? He will stand before kings [<i>melakhim</i>].” Read, in his regard: “He will stand before angels [<i>malakhim</i>].”<br>Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta: This is analogous to an adviser who achieved prominence in the royal palace. The king said to him: ‘Ask for whatever [you want and] I will give it to you.’ That adviser said: If I request silver, gold, or fine gems, he will give it to me; garments, he will give me. But I will request his daughter, and everything will be given to me along with his daughter. So, “In Givon, God appeared to Solomon in a nocturnal dream. God said: Ask, what shall I give you?” (I Kings 3:5). Solomon said: If I request silver, gold, and gems, He will give them to me. But I will request wisdom, and everything will be included. That is what is written: “Grant your servant an understanding heart” (I Kings 3:9). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘You requested wisdom and did not request wealth, glory, or the lives of your enemies; therefore, wisdom and knowledge are given to you, and thereby, I will grant you wealth, property, and glory as well.’ Immediately, “Solomon awoke and behold, a dream” (I Kings 3:15). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: The dream was upheld:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The phrase “and behold, a dream” is interpreted to mean that when Solomon awoke he understood that the dream was real and was being fulfilled.</i> A bird would tweet and he would know what it was tweeting about, a donkey would bray, and he would know what it was braying about. Immediately, “he came to Jerusalem and he stood before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, and he sacrificed burnt offerings and he prepared peace offerings and he made a feast for all his servants” (I Kings 3:15). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: From here [it is derived] that one makes a feast when completing the Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Torah includes all wisdom.</i> Immediately, the Divine Spirit rested upon him and he composed these three books: Proverbs, Song of Songs, and Ecclesiastes; that is what is written: “The words of Kohelet, son of David.”",
                "Another matter, “the words of Kohelet, son of David” – three prophets, because their prophecies were matters of rebuke, their prophecy is attributed to them. These are: “The words of Kohelet”; “the words of Amos” (Amos 1:1); “the words of Jeremiah” (Jeremiah 1:1).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This stands in contrast to, for example, the beginning of the book of Joel, which states: “The word of the Lord that came to Joel son of Petuel.” God does not attach His name to negative matters.</i><br>Why was his name called Jeremiah? It is because in his days, Jerusalem became desolate [<i>irmeia</i>]. Amos, why was his name called Amos? Rabbi Pinḥas said: It is because his tongue was encumbered [<i>amus</i>]. The people of his generation said: The Holy One blessed be He overlooked all His creations and rested His Divine Presence only on this stutterer with a severed tongue? Kohelet, why was his name called Kohelet? It is because his words were stated in an assembly [<i>hak’hel</i>], as it says: “Then Solomon assembled” (I Kings 8:1). Rabbi Aḥa in the name of Rav Huna: One group would enter as another group was exiting, to hear Solomon’s wisdom. That is what the queen of Sheba said to him: “Happy are your people, happy are these servants of yours” (I Kings 10:8), and it is written: “There came from all the peoples to hear Solomon’s wisdom” (I Kings 5:14).<br>He was called by three names: Yedidya, Kohelet, Solomon. Rabbi Yehoshua says seven: Agur, Yakeh, Lemuel, Itiel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In addition to Yedidya, Kohelet, and Solomon.</i> Shmuel said: The most primary and authentic among them are Yedidya, Kohelet, Solomon. Rabbi Shmuel concedes regarding these [other] four, but they were epithets given to Solomon, and they were given to be expounded: Agur, as he was filled [<i>agur</i>] with matters of Torah. Yakeh, as he would expel [<i>heki</i>] his words, like this basin that at times is full and at times is emptied; so, Solomon, at times he studied Torah and at times he would forget it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This was when his heart strayed from following God.</i> Lemuel, as he spoke [<i>nam</i>] to God [<i>El</i>] in his heart and said: I can increase<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Horses, wives, and money, see Deuteronomy 17:16–17.</i> and not sin. Itiel, as he said: God is with me [<i>iti El</i>] and I am able.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To marry numerous women.</i><br>“Son of David” – king, son of a king, wise man, son of a wise man, a righteous man, son of a righteous man, a nobleman, son of a nobleman.<br>Rabbi Yudan in the name of Rabbi Alexandri: This ox, until its tendons are cut, it can be suspended by even one tendon. Once its tendons are cut, numerous ropes and numerous nails are needed to suspend it. So too, until Solomon sinned, he would depend on his own merit, but once he sinned, he was dependent on the merit of his fathers; that is what is written: “[However, I will not tear away the entire kingdom; I will give one tribe to your son] for the sake of David, My servant” (I Kings 11:13). Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: Happy is one who was privileged to reign in a place of royalty. There it is written: “[Og, king of Bashan,] who dwelled in Ashtarot in Edre’i” (Deuteronomy 1:4), but here, “king in Jerusalem,” in a place of royalty."

                "<b>“Vanity of vanities, said Kohelet; vanity of vanities, everything is vanity” (Ecclesiastes 1:2).</b><br>“Vanity of vanities [<i>havel havalim</i>]” – Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: David made a statement and did not explain it, but his son Solomon explained it. Solomon made a statement and did not explain it, but his father David explained it. David said: “Man is like <i>hevel</i>” (Psalms 144:4); to what <i>hevel</i> [is man compared]? If it is to the <i>hevel</i> [heat] of an oven, it has significance. If it is to the <i>hevel</i> of a stove, it has significance. His son Solomon came and explained: “Vanity of vanities [<i>havel havalim</i>], said Kohelet.” Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani taught it in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa: It is comparable to a person who places seven pots on the fire one atop the other, and the heat of the upper one is insignificant.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This comparison is based on the fact that the term vanity [<i>hevel</i>] appears five times in Ecclesiastes 1:2, and twice it appears in the plural, for a total of seven mentions of the term <i>hevel</i>.</i><br>Solomon said: “For who knows what is good for man in his life, [all the days of his vain life,] that he spends like a shadow” (Ecclesiastes 6:12). What shadow? If it is like the shadow of a wall, it has substance. If it is like the shadow of a palm tree, it has substance. David came and explained: “His days are like a passing shadow” (Psalms 144:4). Rabbi Huna [said] in the name of Rav Aḥa: Like that bird that passes and its shadow passes with it. Shmuel said: Like the shadow of bees that have no substance at all.<br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak taught it in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar: The seven vanities [<i>havalim</i>] that Kohelet mentioned correspond to the seven worlds that a person sees. A one-year-old is like a king who is on a canopied litter and everyone is hugging and kissing him. A two- or three-year-old is like a pig that extends its hands into the sewers. A ten-year-old jumps like a goat. A twenty-year-old whinnies like a horse, beautifies himself and seeks a wife. When he marries a wife he is like a donkey. When he begets children, he is as audacious as a dog to bring [home] bread and <to bring them> food. When he grows old, he is like a monkey. That is stated regarding the common people; however, regarding Torah personalities, it is written: “King David was old” – even though he was old, he was a king.<br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: The seven vanities that Kohelet mentioned correspond to the seven days of Creation. On the first, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 1:1), and it is written: “For the heavens will vanish like smoke” (Isaiah 51:6). On the second: “Let there be a firmament” (Genesis 1:6), and it is written: “The heavens will be furled like a scroll” (Isaiah 34:4). On the third: “Let the waters be gathered” (Genesis 1:9), and it is written: “The Lord will destroy the tongue of the sea of Egypt” (Isaiah 11:15). On the fourth: “Let there be lights” (Genesis 1:14), and it is written: “The moon will be disgraced” (Isaiah 24:23). On the fifth: “Let the waters swarm [with swarms of living creatures, and let fowl fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven]” (Genesis 1:20), and it is written: “I will destroy the birds of the heavens” (Zephaniah 1:3). On the sixth: “Let us make man” (Genesis 1:26), and it is written: “I will destroy man and animal” (Zephaniah 1:3). Regarding Shabbat, what do you have to say? “One who profanes it will be put to death” (Exodus 31:14). That is stated regarding one who does so intentionally; but [one who profanes it] unwittingly, he will bring an offering and gain atonement. When Adam saw the praise of Shabbat, that one who brings an offering gains atonement, he began singing in its regard to the Holy One blessed be He, praise and psalm. That is what is written: “A psalm, a song for the day of Shabbat” (Psalms 92:1). Rabbi Levi said: This [psalm] was stated by Adam."

                "<b>“What profit is there for man in all his toil that he toils under the sun?” (Ecclesiastes 1:3).</b><br>“What profit is there for man?” Rabbi Binyamin said: The Sages sought to suppress the book of Kohelet because they found in it matters that tend toward heresy. They said: All of Solomon’s wisdom that he seeks to impart is: “What profit is there for man in all his toil,” but one might [think that he meant] even in the toil of Torah. They then said: He did not say “in all toil,” but rather in his toil; in his toil he does not [profit from his] toil, but he does [profit from his] toil in the toil of Torah.<br>Rabbi Shmuel ben Rabbi Yitzḥak said: The Sages sought to suppress the book of Kohelet because they found in it matters that tend toward heresy. They said: All of Solomon’s wisdom is this statement: “Rejoice, young man, in your youth; and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your heart, and in the sight of your eyes” (Ecclesiastes 11:9). Moses said: “Do not stray after your heart and after your eyes” (Numbers 15:39), and Solomon said: “And walk in the ways of your heart, and in the sight of your eyes.” Restraint has been abolished; there is no [divine] justice and no [Divine] Judge. When he said: “But know that for all these, God will bring you to judgment” (Ecclesiastes 11:9), they said: Solomon spoke well.<br>Rabbi Huna and Rabbi Aḥa [said] in the name of Rabbi Ḥilfai: His toil is under the sun, but there is a treasure for him above the sun. Rabbi Yudan said: Under the sun he does not have [profit], but above the sun he does have [profit].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For physical toil there is no profit, but for spiritual toil there is profit.</i> Rabbi Levi and the Rabbis, Rabbi Levi said: What benefit do people who amass mitzvot and good deeds have? It is sufficient for them that I shine light upon them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the phrase “under [<i>taḥat</i>] the sun,” Rabbi Levi and the Rabbis interpret <i>taḥat</i> in the sense of “in exchange for.”</i> The Rabbis say: What benefit do the righteous who amass mitzvot and good deeds have? It is sufficient for them that I am destined to renew their faces [and cause them to shine] like the sun, as it is written: “But those who love Him are like the sun emerging in its might” (Judges 5:31).<br>Rabbi Yannai said: The way of the world is that when a person takes a <i>litra</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">480 grams.</i> of meat, how much trouble must he undergo and how much effort must he expend until he has cooked it! But I blow the winds for you, elevate the clouds, cause the rains and the dew to fall, grow plants and ripen them, set a table before each and every one, give each and every person all his needs, and each and every body what it lacks, and all you bring Me is the <i>omer</i>. Rabbi Pinḥas said: The way of the world is that when a person launders his garment during the rainy season, how much trouble must he undergo and how much effort must he expend until he dries it! But I blow the winds for you, elevate the clouds, cause the rains and the dew to fall, grow plants, wash them, ripen them and dry them, and set a table before each and every one, give each and every person all his needs and each and every body what it lacks, and all you bring Me is the <i>omer</i>. Rabbi Berekhya said: I am your chef, and you do not allow Me to taste the dish that I cooked to know what it needs. Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: I am your guard and you do not give me from what I guarded.<br>Rabbi Elazar said: It is written: “They do not say in their heart: Let us now fear the Lord [our God, who gives the early rain and the late rain in due season]” (Jeremiah 5:24). Oh, wicked ones, do you no longer need Me?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Once the rain has come.</i> The verse states: “Who preserves for us the appointed weeks of the harvest” (Jeremiah 5:24) – He protects us from heatwaves, He protects us from harmful dews. That is what David says: “A bounteous [<i>nedava</i>] rain You will bring, God” (Psalms 68:10). If it requires rain, it is “a gift [<i>nedava</i>],” if it requires dew, “You will bring, God.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Dew is ubiquitous and is therefore not called a gift.</i><br>Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: It is written: “It shall be seven complete weeks” (Leviticus 23:15) -– when? It is when Yeshua and Shekhanya are not among them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When the first day of Nisan falls on Shabbat, the first day of Passover is on Shabbat and <i>Shavuot</i> is on Sunday. Then, the period of the <i>omer</i> is seven complete weeks, and then, the priestly watches of Yeshua and Shekhanya, the ninth and tenth of the twenty-four watches, would not serve during the <i>omer</i>. If the first of Nisan and the first day of Passover are in the middle of the week, <i>Shavuot</i> is in the middle of the week. In that case, because some of the earlier watches would serve only half a week, as on the festivals all the priests would participate in the Temple service, the watches of Yeshua and Shekhanya would serve during the <i>omer period.</i></i><br>Rabbi Abba said: Come and see how much trouble is experienced and how much effort must be expended until they bring the <i>omer</i>, as we learn: How would they perform it? Emissaries of the court would emerge on the eve of the festival [of Passover] and fashion sheaves while [the grain was still] attached to the ground, so that it would be convenient to harvest. All the adjacent towns would assemble there, so that it would be harvested with great fanfare (<i>Menaḥot</i> 65a). Rabbi Levi said: The Holy One blessed be He said to you: ‘Man, you have plowed, sowed, reaped, gathered, and made several piles; if I do not produce for you a little wind, could you winnow? Yet even the fee for that wind you do not give Me.’ That is, “what is the advantage for He who toils for the wind?” (Ecclesiastes 5:15).<br>Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] made a wedding feast for his son. Rabbi invited all the Rabbis but forgot to invite bar Kappara. [Bar Kappara] went and wrote on the gate of [Rabbi’s] house: After all your rejoicing there is death; and what is the profit in your rejoicing? [Rabbi] said: ‘Who did this to us?’ They said: ‘It was bar Kappara whom, alone, you forgot to invite, and he is disgraced.’ He went and made another feast and he invited all the rabbis and he invited bar Kappara. For each and every dish that [the waiter] would place before them, [bar Kappara] would recite three hundred parables about the fox. [The parables] were very pleasant for them, and the dishes grew cold and they did not taste them. Rabbi would say to his servants: ‘Why are the dishes going in and going out and they are not tasting anything?’ They said to him: ‘Because one of the elders who is sitting there, when the dish is taken in, he says three hundred parables regarding the fox. That is why the dishes are growing cold and they are not eating anything.’ He came to [bar Kappara] and said: ‘Why are you doing this? Let the diners eat.’ [Bar Kappara] said to him: ‘It is so you do not think that I came here because of your feast, but rather, it is because you did not invite me here with my colleagues.’ Is this not what Solomon said: “What profit is there for man [in all his toil that he toils under the sun]” (Ecclesiastes 1:3), since “one generation passes and one generation comes” (Ecclesiastes 1:4).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As bar Kappara wrote on the gate: What is the profit in all your rejoicing?</i> After they placated each other, they were reconciled. Abba bar Kappara said to Rabbi: ‘If, in this world, which is not yours, the Holy One blessed be He granted you serenity, in the World to Come, which is entirely yours, all the more so.’<br>Rabbi Bena’a said, the Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘My children, know what is the difference between Me and you.’ What is written?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With regard to the manna that God provided for the children of Israel.</i> “An <i>omer</i> for a person; according to the number of your people…” (Exodus 16:16). But all of you give one <i>omer</i>, and not an <i>omer</i> of wheat, but rather of barley. Nevertheless, be vigilant to bring it at its appointed time; therefore, Moses cautions the children of Israel and says to them: “You shall bring the <i>omer</i>…” (Leviticus 23:10)."

                "<b>“One generation passes, and one generation comes; and the earth abides forever. The sun rises and the sun sets, and hastens its place where it rises” (Ecclesiastes 1:4–5).</b><br>“One generation passes, and one generation comes” – Rabbi Yudan says in the name of Rabbi Levi: There is no day on which six hundred thousand are not born and on which six hundred thousand do not die. What is the reason? “One generation passes, and one generation comes…the sun rises and the sun sets.” Rabbi Berekhya, Rabbi Yaakov bar Avuna, and Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba [said] in the name of Rabbi Levi bar Sisi: From when the sun rises until the sun sets, one generation passes, and one generation comes. From where is it derived that a generation consists of six hundred thousand? It is as it is stated: “If any man among these people, this wicked generation” (Deuteronomy 1:35), and that generation consisted of six hundred thousand. Rabbi Berekhya said: [When a] potter places [vessels] into the furnace, what he places first [he removes] last. However here, one who passes first comes first, and one who passes last comes last.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference here is to death and the revival of the dead.</i>",
                "Rabbi Levi and Rabbi Yaakov Gevulai [said] in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina: Like the generation that passes, so is the generation that comes. If he goes crippled, he will come [back to life] crippled. If he goes blind, he will come [back to life] blind, so they will not say, he killed others and he revived others,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It will be clear that God has revived the dead and not simply created new people.</i> as it is written: “I will kill and I will give life” (Deuteronomy 32:39). Does one who says [he will do something] difficult then say [he will even do something] easier? “I will kill and I will give life,” that is difficult, and all the more so, “I crushed and I will heal” (Deuteronomy 32:39), which is easier. Rather, ‘I will revive them with their blemishes, so they will not say he killed others and others he revived.’ “I will kill and I will give life,” “I crushed,” and then I will heal them.",
                "Another matter, “I crushed and I will heal” – Rabbi Ḥanina in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan, and Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan [said]: “I smote” is not written here, but rather, “I crushed [<i>maḥatzti</i>]” – the rift [<i>meḥitza</i>] that I established between the heavenly and the earthly, that the heavenly live and the earthly die, [holds true only] in this world. But in the World to Come there is no death at all, as it is stated: “He will eliminate death forever” (Isaiah 25:8). Rabbi Abba said [the verse means]: ‘That rift, too, I will then heal, <i>maḥatzti</i>, <i>meḥitzati</i> [My rift] I will heal.’",
                "Rabbi Abba bar Kahana [said], and some say it in the name of Rabbi Ada bar Ḥunya: The generation that comes should be in your eyes like the generation that has passed, so you should not say: ‘Were Rabbi Akiva alive, I would study Bible before him; were Rabbi Zeira and Rabbi Yoḥanan alive, I would study Mishna before them.’ Rather, the generation that comes during your lifetime and the Sage that is in your lifetime are the equivalent of the generation that passed and the early Sages who preceded you.<br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is written: “The Lord who made Moses and Aaron…” (I Samuel 12:6), and it is written: “The Lord sent Yerubaal, Bedan, Yiftaḥ and Samuel” (I Samuel 12:11). Yerubaal, this is Gideon; Bedan, this is Samson; Yiftaḥ as its plain meaning. And it is written: “Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among those who call His name” (Psalms 99:6) – the verse parallels three of the insignificant people of the world to three of the prominent people of the world,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse in I Samuel (12:11) refers to Gideon, Samson, and Yiftah in the same listing as Samuel, thus equating them, and the verse in Psalms is understood to equate Samuel to Moses and Aaron.</i> to teach you that Yerubaal’s court is as great and significant before the Holy One blessed be He as Moses’s court; Samson’s court is the equivalent of Aaron’s court; and Yiftaḥ’s court is the equivalent of Samuel’s court. This teaches you that anyone who is appointed a leader of the community, even if he is extremely insignificant, he is like the noblest of their noble predecessors, as it is stated: “You shall come to the priests, the Levites, and to the judge who will be in those days…” (Deuteronomy 17:9). I have [the ability to come] only to the judge that is in your generation; where [would you be able to find] the judge that is not in your generation? Why does the verse state: “To the judge who will be in those days”?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Clearly, one can go only to a judge who is in his generation.</i> It teaches that the judge in your generation, in his time, is the equivalent of the judge who was in earlier days, and so, it says: “Do not say: How was it that the former days were better than these?” (Ecclesiastes 7:10).<br>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: You should heed only the judge that is in your generation, as it is written: “The heads of the fathers [<i>ha’avot</i>] of the family of the children of Gilad, son of Makhir, son of Manasseh [came near and spoke before Moses and before the princes; the heads of the fathers’ [<i>avot</i>] houses of the children of Israel]” (Numbers 36:1). Rabbi Yudan said: “The fathers [<i>ha’avot</i>],” “fathers [<i>avot</i>].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Regarding the family of Gilad, the verse uses the definite article <i>ha’avot</i>, while regarding the leaders of entire tribes, the verse writes simply <i>avot</i>, without the definite article.</i> Rather, these entered into leadership and these were removed from leadership, and that is why the verse presented then deficiently.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The heads of the families of Gilad were from the younger generation, and were entering leadership positions, whereas the tribal princes were from the older generation and were concluding their terms of leadership.</i><br>Rabbi Berekhya said: It is written: “Yehoyada was the leader of Aaron” (I Chronicles 12:28). Was Yehoyada the leader of Aaron? Rather, had Aaron been alive in the generation of Yehoyada, Yehoyada would have been greater than he was at the time.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse is interpreted to mean that Yehoyada was greater than Aaron. However, that is impossible, as Aaron was in fact greater than Yehoyada. The midrash therefore explains that had Aaron been alive in the generation when Yehoyada was the leader of the priests, Aaron would have been subordinate to him and accepted his leadership despite Aaron’s personal superiority.</i> Rabbi Simai said: It is written: “Aaron and his sons were offering on the altar of the burnt offerings…” (I Chronicles 6:34). Were Aaron and his sons alive? Was it not Tzadok and his sons who were [offering these offerings]? Rather, had Aaron and his sons been alive, Tzadok would have been greater than he was at the time.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Aaron and his sons would have accepted Tzadok’s leadership because he was the High Priest at the time.</i> Rabbi Hillel derived it from here: “The entire congregation that returned from captivity made booths, and they dwelled in the booths, as since the days of Joshua [<i>Yeshua</i>] bin Nun, to that day, the children of Israel had not done so. There was very great rejoicing” (Nehemiah 8:17).

Let them be bathrooms for the multitudes,’ and it gave me pleasure. For that matter I was apprehended for heresy. Moreover, I violated what is written in the Torah: “Distance your way from her, and do not approach the door of her house” (Proverbs 5:8). “Distance your way from her,” this is heresy. “And do not approach the door of her house,” this is prostitution. Why? It is because: “For she has felled many wounded; abundant are all she has killed” (Proverbs 7:26).’<br>How far [must one distance oneself]? Rabbi Ḥisda said: Four cubits. For this, Rabbi Elazar ben Dama, son of the sister of Rabbi Yishmael, died. He was bitten by a snake, and Yaakov of the village of Sikhnaya came to cure him [through incantation] in the name of so-and-so, but Rabbi Yishmael did not allow him to do so. He said: ‘You are not permitted to do thus, ben Dama.’ [Ben Dama] said to him: ‘Allow me, and I will cite you proof from the Torah that it is permitted,’ but he did not manage to cite him proof before he died. Rabbi Yishmael rejoiced and said: ‘Happy are you, ben Dama, as your soul emerged in purity and you did not breach the boundary of the Sages, as anyone who breaches the boundary of the Sages, ultimately punishment befalls him, as it is stated: “One who breaches a fence, a snake will bite him” (Ecclesiastes 10:8).’ But was he not bitten [by a snake]?

They said: ‘Rabbi Yonatan, go and relate joyfully to your mother that you did not turn around and did not look at us, as had you turned around and looked at us, more than the extent to which we would have flown after you, you would have flown after us.’<br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Nekosa, the heretics were harassing him. They would ask him and he would respond, they would ask him and he would respond. He said to them: ‘You are responding to me for naught. Let us agree between us that any person who prevails over his counterpart will wound the brain of his counterpart with a hammer.’ He prevailed over them and wounded their brains until they were filled with wounds upon wounds. When he came, his students said to him: ‘Rabbi, they aided you from Heaven and you prevailed.’ He said: ‘For naught [do you praise me], go and pray for that man and for that bag, which was filled with gems and pearls, but is now filled with coals.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference is to himself.

He lifted his glance and saw that the courtyard [was going to be] overturned.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Due to their impudence in insisting that Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta dance for them, the courtyard would be destroyed.</i> He said to them: ‘Repeat after me what I say: Go and say to this owner of this courtyard: “If you are sleeping, awaken, as the beginning of sin is sweet but its end is bitter.”’ From the sound of their words the owner of that courtyard awakened, and he emerged, and fell at [Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta’s] feet. He said: ‘Rabbi, I beg of you, do not pay attention to their words, as they are young and foolish.’ [Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta] said to him: ‘What can we do for you, the edict has already been issued.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The courtyard will be destroyed.</i> However, I will delay it for you [so you have enough] time to take out everything that you have in the courtyard.’ When he had taken out everything that he had in the courtyard, that courtyard was lifted up and then crashed down [and was destroyed].<br>They went to fulfill the mitzva of circumcision, and the father of the boy was giving them aged wine to drink, and saying: ‘Drink of this fine wine, as I trust in the Master of Heaven that I will [also] give you to drink of it at his wedding.’ They answered him: ‘Just as you brought him to circumcision, so may you bring him to Torah and to the wedding canopy.’ From the sound of their words, Rabbi Shimon bar Ḥalafta emerged into the darkness,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He set out to return home even though it was night.</i> he was accosted by the emissary of the people.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The angel of death.</i> [The angel of death] said to him: ‘Is it because you rely on your good deeds that you are going out at a time that is not a time?’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For people to be outside.</i> [Rabbi Shimon bar Ḥalafta] said to him: ‘You, who are you?’ He said to him: ‘I am the emissary of the people.’ He said to him: ‘Why do you look forlorn?’ He said: ‘It is from the sound of the harsh words that I hear from people every day.’ He said to him: ‘What are they?’ He said to him: ‘That baby that you circumcised today, I have the document of his [fate, which states] that I am to take him from here in thirty days.

That is why it is written: “He said to Adam [<i>la’adam</i>]” (Job 28:28) – not Adam [<i>lo adam</i>], I will not give them to Adam. To whom will I give them? I will give them to his descendants.<br>Rabbi Yaakov of Kefar Ḥanan said: Adam the first man was worthy of having twelve tribes emerge from him, as it is written: “This [<i>zeh</i>] is the book of the generations of Adam” (Genesis 5:1) – <i>zayin</i> – seven, <i>heh</i> –five, twelve tribes, this is the numerical value of “<i>zeh</i> is the book of the generations of Adam.” The Holy One blessed be He said: Adam is My handiwork, will I not give him twelve tribes? He then said: If I gave him two sons and one rose and killed his brother, had I given him twelve sons, all the more so. That is why it written: “He said to Adam [<i>la’adam</i>]” (Job 28:28), not Adam [<i>lo adam</i>], I will not give them to Adam. To whom will I give them?

To what is this matter comparable? [It is comparable] to a king whose son arose from his illness and they said to him: ‘Let your son go to his academy.’ He said: ‘The radiance of my son has not yet come; rather, let him be indulged for two or three months with food and drink and recover, and then he will go to his academy.’ So too, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘The radiance of my children has not yet come, they have emerged from the enslavement of mortar and bricks, and I will give them the Torah?

Rather, let the Temple be constructed and then, what will ultimately happen, will happen.<br>Rabbi Binyamin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: “The world, too, He has placed in their heart” (Ecclesiastes 3:11) – He placed in their heart love of the world. Rabbi Yonatan said: He has placed in their heart fear of the angel of death. Neḥemya, son of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman, said: “And behold it was very good” (Genesis 1:31). “And behold it was...good,” this is man; “and behold it was…good,” this is the good inclination, “very,” this is the evil inclination. Is the evil inclination “very good”? It is to teach you that were it not for the evil inclination, man would not build a house, would not marry a wife, and would not beget children, as Solomon says: “[I saw all toil and all skilled action;] that it is man’s envy of his neighbor” (Ecclesiastes 4:4).<br>Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Abbahu said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: “The world, too, He has placed in their heart” – He placed in their heart love of the world, He placed in their heart love of young children. To what is this matter analogous? [It is analogous] to a king who had two sons, one big and one small. The big one cleans and the small one sullies; nevertheless, he loves the small one more than the big one.<br>Rabbi Aḥva son of Rabbi Zeira said: “The world [<i>ha’olam</i>],” the ineffable name was concealed [<i>ho’olam</i>] from them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>ha’olam</i> is written in the verse without the <i>vav</i> such that it can be read <i>ho’olam</i>.</i> This is analogous to a king who made a feast [and] invited guests.

Shmuel heard her and said: ‘Go prepare a shroud for him.’<br>Rabbi Ḥanina had knowledge of the ineffable name. When his death approached, he said: ‘Is there a person here to whom I can entrust it?’ They said: ‘Eneini bar Naḥshon is here.’ He sent for him and he came, and his own son entered and hid under the bed.

In addition, one entrusts it only standing, and one entrusts it only in a place of purity, and near water. Initially, they would entrust it to any person. When the sinners became more prevalent, they instituted that it should be entrusted only to the modest among the priests, and the modest among the priests would obscure it in the melody of the priests.<br>Rabbi Tarfon said: One time I ascended to the platform with Samson, my mother’s brother, and I cocked my ear in the direction of the High Priest, but he obscured it in the melody of the priests.

Moses rose and made the earthly not eat and drink; that is what is written: “He was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights, he did not eat bread and he did not drink water” (Exodus 34:28).<br>Likewise, the Holy One blessed be He decreed that sea shall be sea and that dry land shall be dry land. Moses rose and transformed sea into dry land. That is what is written: “The children of Israel came into the midst of the sea on dry land” (Exodus 14:16). Elisha, the disciple of his disciple, transformed dry land into sea. That is what is written: “Make this valley full of trenches…[that valley will be filled with water]” (II Kings 3:16–17).<br>Likewise, the Holy One blessed be He decreed that the heavens shall laud him, as it is stated: “The heavens relate the glory of God” (Psalms 19:2).

Why? It is because in this one there is redemption and they were redeemed, and in this of furnace soot, they were not redeemed.<br>Rabbi Yitzḥak interpreted the verse regarding the tribe of Gad and the tribe of Reuben who came to the Land of Israel and saw the amount of room for sowing that was in it, the amount of room for planting that was in it. They said: “A handful of tranquility is better” in the Land of Israel, “than two handfuls of toil” across the Jordan. They reconsidered and said: Did we not cause this to ourselves, did we not say: “Let this land be given to your servants” (Numbers 32:5)?<br>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: It is written: “The cloud of incense will cover” (Leviticus 16:13). This cover, we do not know what it is, until David came and explained it, as it is stated: “You forgave the iniquity of Your people, [You covered all their sins]” (Psalms 85:3). The Holy One blessed be He, too, said: The poor person’s handful of the gift meal offering is dearer to Me than the High Priest’s two handfuls of the incense of the spices. Why? It is because this one comes for atonement and that one does not come for atonement, as it is written: “When a person [<i>venefesh</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The connotation is that it is as though the person in sacrificing his soul [<i>nefesh</i>] and thereby gaining atonement.</i> sacrifices a meal offering to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:1)."

                "It is taught: When a fetus is formed in its mother’s womb, there are three partners in it, the Holy One blessed be He, its father, and its mother. Its father injects the white substance, from which come the white [substances of the body], and the brain, the nails, the white of the eye, the bones, and the tendons. Its mother injects the red substances, from which come the blood, the skin, the flesh, the hair, and black of the eye. The Holy One blessed be He, may His name be blessed and His memory exalted, places ten matters in it, and these are: Spirit, soul, countenance, eyesight, hearing of the ears, speech of the lips, lifting of the arms and walking of the legs, wisdom and understanding, counsel and knowledge, and strength. When the time of his passing arrives, the Holy One blessed be He takes His portion and leaves the portion of his father and his mother before them, and his father and his mother cry. The Holy One blessed be He says to them: ‘Why are you crying? Did I take anything of yours? I took only what was Mine.’ They say before Him: ‘Master of the universe, as long as Your portion was intermingled with our portions, our portions were protected from maggots and worms. Now that You have taken your portion from the midst of our portions, our portions are cast aside and subject to maggots and worms.’<br>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi would analogize it; to what is the matter analogous? It is to a king who had a vineyard and entrusted it to a sharecropper. The king said to his servants: ‘Go and harvest my vineyard, take my portion, and leave the portion of the sharecropper in its place.’ Immediately, they went and acted in accordance with the king’s command. The sharecropper began screaming and weeping. The king said to him: ‘Did I take anything of yours? Did I not take only what was mine?’ He said to him: ‘My lord, the king, as long as your portion was with my portion, my portion was protected from plunder and theft. Now that you have taken your portion, my portion is cast aside for plunder and theft.’ The king [in the analogy] is the King, king of kings, the Holy One blessed be He. The sharecropper, this is a person’s father and mother. As long as the soul is in the person, he is protected. When he dies he is given to maggots and worms, as it is stated: “How much less so man, a maggot” (Job 25:6) – these are the lice [that afflict him] during his lifetime; “the son of man, a worm” (Job 25:6) – these are the worms that creep under him after his death.<br>Shimon ben Elazar says: Even a living one-day-old does not require protection from a weasel, nor from mice, nor from snakes.

From where do we derive it? It is from David, as it is stated: “The name of David went out to all the lands; and the Lord imposed fear of him upon all the nations” (I Chronicles 14:17). A good name is more beloved than priesthood and kingdom, as priesthood and kingdom lapsed, and a good name does not lapse.<br>The disciples of Rabbi Abba and Abba Tzidoni said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: The tribes are more beloved in their death than in their lifetimes, as during their lives, it was not stated: “Six of their names,” while after their deaths, it is stated: “Six of their names” (Exodus 28:10).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It was only after their deaths that remembrance of their names became a source of merit for their descendants.</i><br>Rabbi Yehuda said: Miriam and Yokheved were the midwives of the Israelites.

Alternatively, Pu’a, as she would cry [<i>po’a</i>] and weep over her brother Moses who was cast into the Nile, as it is stated: “His sister stood at a distance” (Exodus 2:4).

Solomon came and explained: “A good name is better than fine oil, and the day of death than the day of one's birth.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is his name at the end of his life, when he dies, that is most important.</i> When a person is born, one counts to his death. When he dies, one counts his life. When he is born everyone is joyous; when he dies, everyone weeps. But that should not be so; rather, when a person is born no one should be joyous, as they do not know the challenges and actions that will confront him, and whether he will be righteous or wicked, good or bad. When he dies, they should rejoice that he passed away with a good name and departed from the world in peace. This is analogous to two ships at sail in the Mediterranean Sea; one was leaving the port and one was entering the port. Regarding the one leaving the port, everyone rejoiced, and regarding the one leaving the port, they did not rejoice. There was one clever person there. He said to them: ‘I see matters to the contrary. Regarding the one leaving the port, they should not rejoice with it, because they do not know what challenges will confront it, how many days it will be challenged, how many storms it will encounter. When it enters the port, everyone should rejoice that in entered in peace.’ Similarly, when a person dies, everyone should rejoice, and praise him that he passed away in peace from the world with a good name. That is what Solomon said: “And the day of death than the day of one's birth.”<br>You find that when the righteous are born no one is aware of it, and when they die, everyone is aware of it. When Miriam was born, no one was aware of it and when she died, the spring vanished, and everyone was aware. The spring publicized her death.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A spring of water miraculously accompanied Israel through the wilderness, on Miriam’s account. When she died, the spring disappeared and the people thirsted for water (<i>Ta’anit</i> 9a).</i> When Aaron the High Priest was born, no one was aware of it, and when he died, the clouds of glory vanished, and everyone was aware. The cloud publicized his death. When Moses our master was born, no one was aware of it, and when he died, everyone was aware. The manna publicized his death. When Joshua was born, no one was aware of it, and when he died, everyone was aware, as it is stated: “They buried him on the border [of his inheritance]…north of Mount Gaash” (Joshua 24:30). The Rabbis say: We reviewed the entire Bible and we did not find a place named Mount Gaash. Rather, what is Mount Gaash? [It is a reference to the fact that] because they were preoccupied [<i>nitga’ashu</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They were involved in settling the land.</i> and were negligent in performing acts of kindness to Joshua,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They did not express their respects for him when he died.</i> the Holy One blessed be He sought to quake and spew [<i>lehagish</i>] lava upon them in order to destroy them. [They were preoccupied] because the Land of Israel had been distributed and its distribution was too dear to them; this one was involved in his field, that one was involved in his vineyard, this one was involved in his olive grove, that one was involved in his charcoal. They were all involved in their labor, and that is why the Holy One blessed be He sought to quake the world upon them. Therefore, everyone was aware of it, and his death was publicized.<br>When David was born, no one was aware of it, but when he died everyone was aware of it, as it is stated: “When Hadad heard in Egypt that David lay with his fathers, [and that Yoav, commander of the army, had died]” (I Kings 11:21). Rabbi Pinḥas said: Is laying not death?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Why does the verse use two different expressions for death with regard to David and Yoav?</i> Rather, for David, who was king, [the term] lying is written;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a less direct and therefore more respectful term than the term death.</i> for Yoav, who was commander of the army, [the term] death is written.

Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: The parable says: One who is bitten by a snake, a rope frightens him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the people had almost been destroyed due to the insufficient honor they accorded Joshua upon his death, they were very careful to pay the proper respects when Samuel died (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: They gave him his due, as it is stated: “He went each and every year and circulated in Beit El, [Gilgal, and Mitzpa, and he judged Israel in all those places]” (I Samuel 7:16).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since he made himself available to the people in so many different places, they all accorded him respect.</i> One verse says: “Samuel died” (I Samuel 25:1), and one verse says: “Samuel had died” (I Samuel 28:3).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Whey does the book of Samuel report Samuel’s death in two separate locations?</i> Rabbi Asi said: “Samuel had died,” certainly [informs of his] death. “Samuel died,” the matters are stated only with regard to Naval, as it is stated: “Samuel died…there was a man in Maon” (I Samuel 25:1–2).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In chapter 28, the book of Samuel reports the death of Samuel as its own event, and recounts the people’s eulogies for him.

Rabbi Yehuda said: This is to teach you that anyone who repudiates acts of kindness, it is as though he repudiates the fundamental doctrine.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference is to the doctrine of belief in God. Naval refused to bestow kindness on David, and of him it is said: “The scoundrel [<i>naval</i>] says in his heart: There is no God” (Psalms 14:1) (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> But King David, may he rest in peace, what would he do? He would perform acts of kindness for everyone. He would say thus: Even a killer, or one who was killed, even a pursuer, or one who is pursued, I perform acts of kindness for him as I do for the righteous.

As Rabbi’s death neared, he said to his son: ‘Do not do so, but rather, appoint them all at once,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Appoint the two new appointees, as well as the order of who will take over for them upon their passing (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> and appoint Rabbi Ḥanina as leader [of them all].’ Why had [Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi himself] not appointed him? Rabbi Yosei bar Zevid said: It is because the residents of Tzippori denounced him. Did [Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi decide how to] act based on their denunciations? They denounce many in this way; if we heed them in his regard, we must heed them regarding others as well. Rabbi Bon said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some commentaries add detail that appears to be missing from the midrash here, but is mentioned in the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ta’anit</i> 4:2): Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi was delivering a public lecture and cited a verse in Ezekiel (7:15), and Rabbi Ḥanina corrected his pronunciation of the Hebrew word <i>homot</i>, which Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi had pronounced <i>homiyot</i>. This caused public embarrassment to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> [Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi] said to [Rabbi Ḥanina]: ‘Before whom did you learn that reading?’ He said to him: ‘Before Rav Hamnuna, the Bible expert of Babylon.’ He said to him: ‘When you go there, tell him that I appointed you to serve as an elder.’ [Rabbi Ḥanina] knew that he would not be appointed in [Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s] days. When [Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi] died, his son sought to appoint [Rabbi Ḥanina], but he did not accept it upon himself. He said: ‘I do not accept, but rather defer to Rabbi Afes of the south.’ There was one elder there who said: ‘If Rabbi Ḥanina is first, I am second. If Rabbi Afes is first, I am second.’ Rabbi Ḥanina accepted upon himself to be appointed third, and he was privileged to live a very long life. He said: ‘I do not know why I was privileged to live a very long life, whether it was because of this matter,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That I deferred to Rabbi Afes and to the other elder.</i> or whether it was because when I would ascend from Tiberias to Tzippori I would take a detour to visit Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta. I do not know which of these two [is the reason.]’<br>Another matter: “For exploitation disconcerts a wise man” – the exploitation of Datan and Aviram, exploiting Moses their master, caused his wisdom to be lost from him. “And destroys the gift of [<i>matana</i>] understanding” – [the word <i>matana</i>] is written [in such a way that it can also be vocalized] <i>metuna</i>, patience. Had Moses been patient, he would have been spared. However, because they provoked him and caused him to become upset, and they said to him: “May the Lord look upon you [and judge, for you have made us loathsome in the eyes of Pharaoh]” (Exodus 5:21), he could not tolerate it, and, as a result, he became upset in his anger and said [to God]: “Since I came [to Pharaoh to speak in Your name…You have not rescued Your people]” (Exodus 5:23). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘I wrote about you that you are wise, and you become upset and say this to me? By your life, you should know and inform others that the ultimate fate of My children will be better than the beginning that I provided them in Egypt,’ as it is written: “Now you will see [what I will do to Pharaoh, as with a strong hand he will send them out, and with a strong hand he will drive them from his land]” (Exodus 5:24). At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Woe for those who are lost and cannot be found. I lost Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who never doubted Me, and I have not found anyone who is their equal.’ At that moment, the attribute of justice sought to harm [Moses], as it is stated: “God [<i>Elohim</i>] spoke [to Moses]” (Exodus 6:2), and <i>Elohim</i> [indicates] nothing other than the attribute of justice. And it is stated: “And He said to him: I am the Lord” (Exodus 6:2).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This second half of the verse refers to God as the Lord [Y-H-V-H], which indicates the attribute of mercy. This indicates that after considering harming Moses, God acted mercifully toward him.</i> He said to [Moses]: ‘You are flesh and blood and unable to bear them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">You are unable to bear their suffering, and that is why you criticized Me.</i> I am the Lord, merciful, the Master of mercy, with My attributes, I will have mercy,’ as it is stated: “I have made and I will bear” (Isaiah 46:4)."

They said to Rabbi Meir: ‘Your teacher Elisha is coming and passing in the marketplace on Shabbat.’ He emerged to him. [Elisha] said to him: ‘In what were you engaged?’ [Rabbi Meir] said to him: ‘“The Lord blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning”’ (Job 42:12). he [continued and] said to him: ‘“Blessed” [indicates] that He doubled his possessions for him.’ [Elisha] said to him: ‘Akiva, your teacher, did not say so, but rather “the Lord blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning,” thanks to the repentance and good deeds that he had to his credit from his beginning.’<br>[Elisha] said to [Rabbi Meir]: ‘What else did you say?’ [Rabbi Meir answered:] “The end of a matter is better than its beginning.” [Elisha] said to him: ‘What did you say in its regard?’ [Rabbi Meir] said to him: ‘You have a person who purchases merchandise in his youth and he loses [money on it], and [he engages in commerce] in his old age and he makes a profit. Alternatively, “the end of a matter is better than its beginning” – you have a person who begets children in his youth and they die, [and he begets children] in his old age, and they endure. Alternatively, “the end of a matter is better than its beginning” – you have a person who performs wicked deeds in his youth, and in his old age, performs good deeds. Alternatively, “the end of a matter is better than its beginning” – you have a person who studies Torah in his youth and forgets it, and in his old age he returns to it; that is what is written: “the end of a matter is better than its beginning.”’ [Elisha] said to him: ‘Rabbi Akiva, your teacher, did not say so; rather [he explained the verse to mean:] “The end of a matter” is good when it is good “from its beginning.”<br>‘Likewise, there was an incident: Avuya, my father, was one of the prominent leaders of the generation. When he came to circumcise me, he invited all the prominent residents of Jerusalem and all the prominent leaders of the generation, and invited Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua with them. When they had eaten and drunk, some began to sing songs and others recited alphabetical poems. Rabbi Eliezer said to Rabbi Yehoshua: ‘These are engaging in their [areas of interest], but we are not engaging in ours.’ They began with the Torah, from the Torah to the Prophets, and from the Prophets to the Writings, and the matters were as joyous as when they were given at Sinai, and the fire was burning around them. In their original giving at Sinai, were they not given in fire, as it is stated: “The mountain was ablaze with fire to the heart of the heavens” (Deuteronomy 4:11). [Avuya] said: ‘Since the power of the Torah is so great, this son, if he endures, I will dedicate him to the Torah.’ Because his intention was not for the sake of Heaven, my Torah did not endure in me.’<br>[Elisha said to Rabbi Meir:] ‘And what else did you say [in your lecture]?’ [Rabbi Meir answered:] ‘“It cannot be valued like gold and glass”’ (Job 28:17). [Elisha asked:] ‘What did you say in its regard?’ [Rabbi Meir] said to him: ‘These are matters of Torah that are as difficult to acquire as gold and glass.’ [Elisha] said to him: ‘Akiva, your teacher, did not say so; rather, just as vessels of gold and glass, if they break they can be repaired, so too, a Torah scholar, if he lost his learning, he can return to it.<br>[Elisha] said to him: ‘Return and enter [the city].’ [Rabbi Meir] said to him: ‘Why?’ [Elisha said:] ‘The Shabbat boundary ends here.’ [Rabbi Meir] said to him: ‘How do you know?’ [Elisha] said to him: ‘From the [number of] steps my horse [has taken, I can tell] that it has already gone two thousand cubits.’ [Rabbi Meir] said to him: ‘You have all this wisdom and you do not repent?’ [Elisha] said to him: ‘I do not have the strength.’ [Rabbi Meir] said to him: ‘Why?’ [Elisha] said to him: ‘I was riding a horse and was sauntering behind the Temple on Yom Kippur that coincided with Shabbat. I heard a Divine Voice crying out and saying: “Return wayward children” (Jeremiah 3:22), “return to Me and I will return to you” (Malachi 3:7), except for Elisha ben Avuya, who was aware of My might and rebelled against Me.’<br>From where did he have this?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">What caused Elisha to forsake the Torah to begin with?</i> He saw a certain person who climbed to the top of a palm tree on Shabbat. He took the mother bird with the fledglings and climbed down unharmed. After Shabbat, he saw a certain person who climbed to the top of a palm tree, took the fledglings, and sent the mother away. He climbed down and a snake bit him and he died. [Elisha] said: ‘It is written: “Send away the mother bird and take the fledglings for yourself so it will be good for you and you will prolong your days” (Deuteronomy 22:7). Where is the good of this one? Where are the prolonged days of this one?’ But he did not know that Rabbi Akiva had expounded it: “So it will be good for you,” in the world that is entirely good; “and you will prolong your days,” in the world that is eternally long [the World to Come].<br>And some say it was because he saw the tongue of Rabbi Yehuda the baker in the mouth of a dog. He said: ‘If for the tongue that toiled in Torah throughout his life it is so, for the tongue that does not know and does not toil in Torah, all the more so. He said: If so, there is no reward given to the righteous and no revival of the dead.’ And some say it was because when his mother was pregnant with him, she passed by houses of idol worship and smelled,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">She smelled the aroma of the offerings being sacrificed and craved them.</i> and they gave her some of that kind, and she ate it, and it was churning in her stomach like the venom of a snake.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because Elisha’s mother had eaten from the idolatrous sacrifice, Elisha had an ingrained desire for sin (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i><br>Sometime later, Elisha ben Avuya fell ill. They came and said to Rabbi Meir: ‘Elisha is ill.’ [Rabbi Meir] went to him and said: ‘Repent.’ [Elisha] said to him: ‘Is [repentance] accepted even in such [circumstances]?’ [Rabbi Meir] said to him: ‘But is it not written: “You turn man to contrition [<i>daka</i>] [and say: Return, son of man]” (Psalms 90:3) – until his soul is crushed?’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The term <i>daka</i> can mean contrition or crushed. Thus, the verse is interpreted to mean that God wants man to repent even if it is at the very end of his life.</i> At that moment, Elisha ben Avuya wept, and he died. Rabbi Meir was glad and said: ‘It appears that my teacher departed in the midst of repentance.’<br>When they buried him, fire came to burn his grave. They came and said to Rabbi Meir: ‘The grave of your teacher is burning.’ He emerged and spread his garment over it. [Rabbi Meir] said to [Elisha]: ‘“Stay tonight” (Ruth 3:13), in this world that is entirely night. “It will be in the morning, if he will redeem you, good, he will redeem” (Ruth 3:13). What is: “It will be in the morning”?

They will save Elisha due to the merit of his Torah.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Just as the casing is saved from fire on Shabbat due to the scroll, Elisha should be saved due to his Torah.</i><br>Ultimately, his daughters came and demanded charity from Rabbeinu.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.</i> He said: ‘“Let no one extend kindness to him; and let no one be gracious to his orphans”’ (Psalms 109:12). They said: ‘Rabbi, do not look at his actions, look at his Torah.’ At that moment, Rabbi wept and decreed that they should be supported. He said: ‘If one whose Torah was not for the sake of Heaven produced such,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Produced daughters with such wisdom and modest comportment; alternatively, this means if he produced a disciple such as Rabbi Meir (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> one whose Torah is for the sake of Heaven, all the more so.’<br>“One of patient spirit is better than one of proud spirit.” A certain Persian came to Rav [and] said to him: ‘Teach me Torah.’ [Rav] said to him: ‘Say <i>alef</i>.’ He said to [Rav]: ‘Who says that it is <i>alef</i>? Let them say that it is not so.’ ‘Say <i>bet</i>.’ He said to [Rav]: ‘Who says that it is <i>bet</i>? Let them say that it is not so.’ Rav scolded him and had him removed, with reprimand. He went to Shmuel [and] said to him: ‘Teach me Torah.’ [Shmuel] said to him: ‘Say <i>alef</i>.’ He said to [Shmuel]: ‘Who says that it is <i>alef</i>?’ ‘Say <i>bet</i>.’ He said to [Shmuel]: ‘Who says that it is <i>bet</i>?’ [Shmuel] pulled him by his ear. He said: ‘My ear, my ear!’ Shmuel said to him: ‘Who says that it is your ear?’ He said to [Shmuel]: ‘Everyone knows that it is my ear.’ [Shmuel] said to him: ‘Here, too, everyone knows that this is <i>alef</i> and this is <i>bet</i>.’ The Persian was silenced, and he accepted it upon himself. That is, “one of patient spirit is better than one of proud spirit.” The patience that Shmuel extended the Persian is better than the exactitude with which Rav acted in his regard. Had he not done so, the Persian would have returned to his corruption.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Instead, he converted to Judaism and credited Shmuel for his patience.</i> He read in [Shmuel’s] regard: “One of patient spirit is better.”<br>Moreover, Aquila the proselyte<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He had not yet converted.</i> asked Rabbi Eliezer, he said to him: ‘The love with which the Holy One blessed be He loves the proselyte is with only bread and garment, as it is stated: “He loves the proselyte, giving him bread and a garment” (Deuteronomy 10:18). [Yet] I have so many peacocks and so many pheasants that even my servants pay no attention to them.’ He said to him: ‘Is it insignificant in your eyes what our patriarch Jacob requested initially, as it is stated: “And He will give me bread to eat and a garment to wear” (Genesis 28:20)? Is that an insignificant matter?’<br>[Aquila] came before Rabbi Yehoshua and asked him this. [Rabbi Yehoshua] said to him: ‘A proselyte who converts for the sake of Heaven is privileged, and his daughters may marry into the priesthood. “Bread,” this is the showbread; “garment,” these are the priestly vestments.’ He drew him near with his words. His disciples said to him: ‘Is the matter for which the elder entreated insignificant in your eyes, as it is stated: “And He will give me bread”? Why, then, do you dispatch him with a trifling matter?’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Apparently, the disciples did not like Rabbi Yehoshua’s first homiletical interpretation. Alternatively, this critique was stated by Rabbi Eliezer’s disciples and belongs in the text before Aquila came to Rabbi Yehoshua (see <i>Matnot Kehuna</i> and <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 70:5).</i> He began to placate him with his words:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Yehoshua told Aquila the following alternate interpretation of the verse.</i> ‘“Bread,” this is Torah, as it is stated: “Come partake of my bread” (Proverbs 9:5);<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This statement is attributed in Proverbs to wisdom, which is personified and offers a speech.

He said to him: ‘Isaac, my son, do you see what I see?’ [Isaac] said to him: ‘Yes.’ He said to [Isaac]: ‘What do you see?’ [Isaac] said to him: ‘A cloud affixed to the mountain.’ He said to Eliezer and Ishmael, his lads: ‘Do you see anything?’ They said: ‘No.’ He said: ‘Since you do not see anything and the donkey does not see anything, “stay here with the donkey [<i>im haḥamor</i>]” (Genesis 22:5) – a people comparable to a donkey [<i>am domin laḥamor</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The slaves and children of maidservants are lowly, and in that sense comparable to the donkey.</i> Then he took Isaac and took him up mountains, took him down hills, and took him up to the peak of a particularly high and steep mountain.

And if the verse is referring to oils, how many oils are there among the nations of the world? It is referring only to mitzvot, good deeds, and Torah. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi stated a parable; to what is this matter analogous? It is to a king who made a feast and invited guests. He said to them: ‘Go bathe and anoint [yourselves], press and launder your garments, and prepare yourselves for the feast.’ But he did not set a time for them when they should come to the feast. The clever among them strolled at the entrance to the king’s palace. They said: ‘Does the king’s palace lack anything?’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Everything can be prepared immediately.</i> The fools among them paid no heed and were not scrupulous regarding the king’s instructions.

Suddenly, the king said: ‘Everyone to the feast.’ They hurried them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The king’s messengers rushed the guests to the feast (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> These came in their glory, and those came in their repulsiveness. The king was pleased with those who were clever, who fulfilled the king’s instructions, and moreover, they brought honor to the king’s palace, but he was angry at the fools who did not fulfill the king’s instructions, and disrespected the king’s palace. The king said: ‘Let those who prepared themselves for the feast come and partake in the king’s feast, and those who did not prepare themselves for the feast will not partake of the king’s feast.’ One might [think] they would take their leave, [but] the king then said: ‘No, but rather these shall recline, eat, and drink, and those shall stand on their feet, be punished, observe, and suffer.’ So it will be in the future;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Those who prepare themselves during their lifetimes will enjoy the benefits of the World to Come, and those who do not, will suffer and wish they had used their lives well.</i> this is what Isaiah said: “Behold, My servants will eat and you will starve; [behold, My servants will drink and you will thirst; behold, My servants will rejoice and you will be ashamed]” (Isaiah 65:13).<br>Zivetai said in the name of Rabbi Meir: These recline, eat, and drink, and those recline, but do not eat and drink. There is no comparing the suffering of one who stands to the suffering of one who reclines. One who stands and does not eat and does not drink is like a waiter; one who reclines but does not eat, his suffering is exponentially greater and his face turns sallow. This is what the prophet says: “You will return and see the difference between the righteous and the wicked” (Malachi 3:18).<br>Bar Kappara and Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Kappara said: [This is analogous] to the wife of a royal courier who would adorn herself before her neighbors. Her neighbors said to her: ‘Your husband is not here, before whom are you adorning yourself?’ She said to them: ‘My husband is a sailor. If a favorable breeze will happen his way, he will come and will be standing over my head. Is it not preferable that he see me in my glory, and not in my repulsiveness?’ So too, “may your garments be white at all times” from transgressions, “and may the oil on your head not be lacking,” from mitzvot and good deeds. It is taught: Repent one day before your death (<i>Avot</i> 2:10). His students asked Rabbi Eliezer, they said to him: ‘Rabbi, does a person know when he will die in order to repent?’ He said to them: ‘All the more so, let him repent today, as perhaps, he will die tomorrow. The result is that all his days he is engaged in repentance.’ That is why it is stated: “May your garments be white at all times.”"

But today, “pity me, pity me, you are my friends…” (Job 19:21).<br>“And also favor is not to the knowledgeable” – this is Joshua. Rabbi Aḥva son of Rabbi Zeira said: There are two matters that Joshua spoke before Moses, but they did not find favor in his eyes, and these are: One regarding the appointment of the elders, and one in the incident of the [Golden] Calf. In the appointment of the elders, as it is written: “My lord Moses, incarcerate them [<i>kela’em</i>]” (Numbers 11:28); he said to him: Put an end to them [<i>kalem</i>] and remove them from the world. “Moses said to him: Are you zealous on my behalf?” (Numbers 11:29).

Moses said to him: ‘A person who is destined to assert authority over six hundred thousand [men] does not know to distinguish between one sound and another sound? “It is not the sound of a cry of strength [<i>gevura</i>]” (Exodus 32:18),’ as it is stated: “Israel prevailed [<i>vegavar</i>]” (Exodus 17:11); ‘“and it is not the sound of a cry of weakness” (Exodus 32:18),’ as it is stated: “Joshua weakened [Amalek]” (Exodus 17:13); ‘“the sound of a cry, I hear” (Exodus 32:18).’ Rabbi Asi said: It is the sound of praise of idol worship, I hear.

Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: Matters of Torah were likened to a mill; just as a mill is not idle by day or at night, so too, regarding matters of Torah it is stated: “You shall contemplate it day and night” (Joshua 1:8). “And one will arise to the voice of a bird” (Ecclesiastes 12:4) – Rabbi Levi said: For eighteen years, a Divine Voice would proclaim and call out to Nebuchadnezzar and say to him: Wicked slave, ascend and destroy the house of your Master, because His children are rebellious and do not obey Him. “And all the sources of music will be lowered” (Ecclesiastes 12:4) – [Nebuchadnezzar] ascended and abrogated song in the Temple; that is what is stated: “They will not drink wine with song” (Isaiah 24:9).<br>“They will also fear heights” (Ecclesiastes 12:5) – [Nebuchadnezzar] also feared the most elevated, the King of kings. “There will be obstacles on the way” (Ecclesiastes 12:5) – the fear of the way fell over him.

Regarding all of these [it could have been said]: “But it will be for them like a vain divination [in their eyes, who have weeks upon weeks, and it evokes iniquity for them to be captured]” (Ezekiel 21:28). The prophet said to Israel: Had you merited, you would have read the Torah that is expounded in seven times seven ways.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is alluded to in the phrase “weeks upon weeks,” as a week has seven days.</i> Now that you have not merited, Nebuchadnezzar will divine seven times seven divinations upon you.

Rabbi Yosei ben Ḥanina said: A nail shaped like tongs is not included in the tally of the spikes.<br>Rabbi Ze’eira [said] in the name of Rabbi Abba bar Zavda:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Shabbat</i> 6:2) the text reads: Rabbi Ze’eira asked Rabbi Abba bar Zavda.</i> ‘What is [the law] regarding placing them on a shoe for Shabbat?’ He said to him: ‘It is permitted.’ ‘What is [the law] regarding switching them?’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Is it permitted to maintain the total number of spikes in both sandals, but to have more than the permitted number in one sandal and fewer in the other?</i> He said to him: ‘It is permitted.’ ‘What is [the law] regarding placing them one atop the other?’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Is it permitted to place all of the spikes on one sandal and none on the other?</i> He said to him: ‘It is permitted.’ Rabbi Ḥiyya would place eleven on this side and thirteen on that side,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He would place eleven on one side of the sandal and thirteen on the other side.</i> corresponding to the twenty-four books [of the Bible]; just as the books are twenty-four, so too, the priestly watches are twenty-four; and just as the priestly watches are twenty-four, so too, the spikes are twenty-four."

That orchard was the most beloved for him of all the orchards that he had. [After some time,] ninety [vines] remained, and he would produce one hundred barrels. Eighty remained, seventy remained, sixty remained, fifty remained, forty remained, thirty remained, twenty remained, ten remained, and he would produce one hundred barrels of wine. One remained, and he would produce one hundred barrels of wine. The king said: This vine is more beloved to me than all the orchards that I have.

                "<b>“For every action God will bring to judgment, for every unknown, whether good or evil” (Ecclesiastes 12:14).</b><br>“For every action” – Rabbi would interpret these verses, and when he would arrive at one of these six verses, he would weep. These are they: “For behold the Former of mountains, [and Creator of wind, who tells man what is his conversation]” (Amos 4:13). Even matters that do not have substance or sin are written for Him in His ledger. Who writes them? “He who renders dawn, darkness…[the Lord, God of hosts, is His name]” (Amos 4:13).<br>In addition: “Seek the Lord, all you humble of the earth, [who have performed His judgment; seek righteousness, seek humility. Perhaps you shall be hidden in the day of the Lord’s anger]” (Zephaniah 2:3).<br>[In addition:] “Hate evil, and love good, [and display justice at the gate; perhaps the Lord, God of hosts, will grant favor to the remnant of Joseph]” (Amos 5:15).<br>And this verse: “For every action God [will bring to judgment, for every unknown, whether good or evil].” “Without knowledge, even the soul is no good” (Proverbs 19:2) – Rabbi Beivai said: [This is likened] to one who was accustomed to engage in relations [with his wife] at sunrise. He forgot<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He forgot that the expected time had come for his wife to menstruate, and he was therefore obliged to refrain from engaging in marital relations with her (see <i>Nidda</i> 63b).</i> and engaged in relations before sunrise.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">His wife menstruated at that time, and they unwittingly violated the prohibition to engage in relations while she was menstruating.</i> If he did so without knowledge, it is not good,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even if he forgot that he was supposed to separate from her, he bears responsibility. The midrash reads this into the phrase “no good” in the verse in Proverbs.</i> and all the more so if he did so with knowledge. Furthermore, “he who hastens with his feet sins” (Proverbs 19:2).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One who rushes down a path leading to sin is held responsible for his sins, even if he committed them unwittingly (<i>Midrash HaMevo’ar</i>).</i><br>[This is likened] to one who had two stores before him, one selling slaughtered meat and one selling meat from an unslaughtered carcass, and he forgot and purchased the meat of the unslaughtered carcass. “Without knowledge…no good” (Proverbs 19:2), and all the more so if he did so with knowledge. Furthermore, “he who hastens with his feet sins” (Proverbs 19:2).<br>Rabbi Yoḥanan interpreted the verse regarding Shabbat. [This is likened] to one who had two paths before him, one smooth and one filled with thorns and pebbles, and he forgot and went on the one in which there were thorns and pebbles.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even though he forgot that there were thorns there, and walking through them would involve detaching some of them from the ground, which constitutes a violation of Shabbat, he is held accountable for this violation.</i> Had he known and gone, all the more so.<br>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish interpreted this verse.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They interpreted “he who hastens with his feet sins” to mean that one should not come to the Temple frequently to bring sacrificial offerings to atone for any sins he may not realize that he has committed; it would be preferable to just be careful to avoid sin.</i> Rabbi Yoḥanan said: With vow offerings and gift offerings it is prohibited; with sin offerings and guilt offerings it is permitted. Reish Lakish said: With vow offerings and gift offerings it is permitted; with sin offerings and guilt offerings it is prohibited.<br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: If one performs one transgression without knowledge it is not good; if he knew and went and performed [the transgression], all the more so. Therefore, “for every action God will bring to judgment, for every unknown, whether good or evil.” He said: A servant whose master considers his unwitting transgressions like intentional transgressions, does he have recourse?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One should avoid sinning even unwittingly.</i><br>What is “for every unknown”? That is one who kills a louse in the presence of another person and [the other person] is disgusted.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One is punished even for this small offense of causing discomfort to the other person.</i> Shmuel said: This is one who expectorates before another person and [the other person] is disgusted.<br>What is “whether good or evil”? The school of Rabbi Yannai says: This is one who gives a coin to a poor person in public, as when Rabbi Yannai saw a man who gave a coin to a poor person in public, he said: It would have been preferable had you not given to him, than now, when you gave to him and shamed him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, the verse is indicating that one can be punished even for an act that is inherently good, such as giving charity.</i><br>The school of Rabbi Shila says: This is one who gives charity to a woman in private, as he causes her to become suspected.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although his intention in giving her charity in secret is noble, his actions may have a detrimental effect; when people notice a man secretly visiting her, they suspect her of illicit activity.</i><br>Rava said; This is one who sends uncut meat to his wife on Friday.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference is to meat from which the sciatic nerve and forbidden fats have not been removed. Since it is close to Shabbat, she will be in a rush and might not remove all of the prohibited portions.</i> Is this so? But did Rava not send [in this manner]? The daughter of Rav Ḥisda<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rava’s wife</i> was different, as he knew that she [would successfully remove all the prohibited portions]. <“Whether good or evil”.>"
