                "Rabbi Yochanan said: Everyone who exerted oneself in Torah study in this world, in the world-to-come will not be set down to sleep, but rather will be led to the Beit Midrash of Shem and Eveir, and of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and Moses, and Aaron. From where do we know this? From (II Samuel 7: 9) \"...I will make your name great, like the names of the greatest men on earth.\" "
