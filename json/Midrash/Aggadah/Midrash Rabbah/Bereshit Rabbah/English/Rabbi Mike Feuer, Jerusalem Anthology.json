            "R’ Abahu and R’ Chiya Raba. R’ Abahu said - from the beginning of the creation of the world the Holy One saw the actions of the righteous and the actions of the wicked. This is what is written “For the Lord knows the way of the righteous…” (Psalms 1:6) “Now the earth was astonishingly empty…” (Genesis 1:2) these are the actions of the wicked, “And God said, Let there be light…” (Genesis 1:3) these are the actions of the righteous. But I don’t know which one of them He desired, the actions of these or the actions of those. Since it is written “And God saw the light that it was good…” (Genesis 1:4). He desires the actions of the righteous and not the actions of the wicked. R’ Chiya Raba said – from the beginning of the creation of the world the Holy One saw the Holy Temple built, destroyed and built. “In the beginning of God's creation…” (Genesis 1:1) refers to it built, this is what it says “…to plant the heavens and to found the earth…” (Isaiah 51:16) “Now the earth was astonishingly empty…” refers to it destroyed, this is what it says “I saw the earth, and behold, it was void and unformed…” (Jeremiah 4:23) , “And God said, Let there be light…” refers to it built and complete in the future to come, this is what it says “Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has shone upon you. For behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and a gross darkness the kingdoms, and the Lord shall shine upon you, and His glory shall appear over you.” (Isaiah 60:1-2) "

            "The way of the world is that one pours a full vessel into an empty one. Perhaps you can pour a full vessel into a full vessel?! All the world was water in water and you say “…into one place…” (Genesis 1:9) Rather from here we learn that a little can hold a lot. Similarly - “Moses and Aaron assembled the congregation in front of the rock…” (Numbers 20:10) R’ Chanina said: there was a space the size of the mouth of a small sieve there, and all of Israel stood there? Rather from here we learn that a little can hold a lot. Similarly – “The Lord said to Moses and to Aaron, \"Take yourselves handfuls (chofneichem) of furnace soot…” (Exodus 9:8) R’ Huna said: and could Moshe’s handful hold eight handfuls (kamatzim)? That’s strange! Rather from here we learn that a little can hold a lot. There is no comparison between what one takes in a cupped handful (chofan) and what one takes in a closed handful (kamatz). A cupped handful is twice that of a closed and it is written “…and Moses shall cast it heavenward…” (ibid.) therefore Moshe’s cupped hand held eight closed handfuls. Rather from here we learn that a little can hold a lot.  Similarly – R’ Yosi bar Chalifta said: “The length of the courtyard shall be one hundred cubits and the width fifty by fifty cubits,” (Exodus 27:18) and all of Israel stood there? That’s strange! Rather from here we learn that a little can hold a lot. Similarly - “And Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come here…” (Joshua 3:9) R’ Huna said: he stood them all up between the two poles of the ark. R’ Acha bar R’ Chanina said: he placed them between the two poles of the ark. The Rabbis said: he shrank them between the two poles of the ark. Yehoshua said to them: from the fact that the two poles of the ark could hold you, you know that Presence of the Holy One is among you. This is what is written “By this you shall know that the living God is in your midst…” (Joshua 3:10) So too regarding Jerusalem it is taught ‘they stood crowded together, but prostrated themselves with plenty of space between them. R’ Shmuel bar R’ Chana said in the name of R’ Acha: each one had four cubits, and a cubit of space to each side so that no one heard the prayer of his fellow. So too it will be in the time to come, as it says “At that time, they will call Jerusalem the Throne of the Lord…” (Jeremiah 3:17) R’ Yochanan went up to visit R’ Chanina, he found him sitting and interpreting this verse ‘At that time, they will call Jerusalem the Throne of the Lord.’ He said to him: oh my teacher, can Jerusalem really hold the throne of the Lord? He replied: The Holy One said to her ‘spread out your length and breadth and receive your population.’ This is what is written “Widen the place of your tent…” (Isaiah 54:2) Why? “For right and left shall you prevail…” (Isaiah 54:3)"

            "“…from the earth…” (Bereshit 2:7) R’ Berachiya and R’ Chelbo said in the name of R’ Shmuel bar Nachman: he was created from the place of his atonement. This is what it says “An altar of earth you shall make for Me…” (Shemot 20:21) The Holy One said: behold, I am creating him from the place of his atonement, oh that he stands! “He breathed into his nostrils…” (Bereshit 2:7) This comes to teach that He stood him up as a lifeless form that stretched from the land to the heavens and then threw a soul into him. Since in this world it was with the act of blowing, therefore we die, but in the future it will be given as it says “And I will put My spirit into you, and you shall live…” (Ezekiel 37:14)"

            "“And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden from the east…” (Bereshit 2:8) They said in the house of R’ Yannai ‘why does the verse use the full name of Gd in reference to planting the garden? Because from the beginning of its creation it required proper alignment. Before man is given form in the womb of his mother, he must align himself with her directions. This is what is written “The Lord's trees are sated, the cedars of Lebanon, which He planted.”’ (Tehillim 104:16) R’ Chanina said ‘They were like the horns of grasshoppers, and the Holy One uprooted them and transplanted into the garden, ‘The Lord's trees are sated…’ R’ Chanina said – their lives were sated, their waters sated, their grove sated.’ R’ Yochanan said ‘the world was not fit to make use of cedars, because they were created only for the needs of the Holy Temple. This is what is written “The Lord's trees are sated, the cedars of Lebanon…” Lebanon only refers to the Holy Temple, as it says “…this good mountain and the Lebanon.”’ (Devarim 3:25) R’ Shmuel bat Nachman said in the name of R’ Yonatan ‘there are twenty-four types of cedar, and only seven of them are praiseworthy. This is what it says “I will give in the desert cedars…”’ (Yeshayahu 41:19) R’ Acha said ‘three: b’rosh is cypress, tidhar is juniper, ta’ashur is box-wood. And why do they call box-wood ta’ashur? Because it is the happiest (m’ushar) among them.’ They added three more to the count – alonim, armonim, almogim. Alonim are oaks, armonim are plane-trees, almogim are aloe-woods. "

            "“The name of one is Pishon…” (Bereshit 2:11) This is Migdal Pishtan and its waters flow abundantly. “…that is the one that encompasses all the land of Havilah…” (ibid.) There was not yet a place called Havilah, and it says that the river encompasses it? That is strange! Rather, “tell the end from the beginning…” (Yeshayahu 46:10) “…where there is gold,” (Bereshit 2:11) gold there certainly was. “And the gold of that land is good…” (Bereshit 2:12) R’ Yitzchak said ‘happy is he in whose house it is, happy is he in whose company it is.’ R’ Abahu said ‘the Holy One gave a great good to His world – a man breaks a gold piece into smaller pieces, and he can buy many things with it.’ Resh Lakish said ‘the world was not fit to use gold, why was it created? For the Holy Temple, as it says “And the gold of that land is good…” like that which it says “…this good mountain and the Lebanon.” (Devarim 3:25) “…there is the crystal and the onyx stone.” (Bereshit 2:12) R’ Ibo said ‘you think this is referring to the crystal of apothecaries? Let another verse clarify it for you “…and its appearance was like the appearance of crystal.” (Bamidbar 11:7) Just as this refers to a precious stone, so too that refers to a precious stone.’"

They said: come let’s divide up the world, one will take the land and one will take the moveable property. This one said: the ground you are standing on is mine. The other one said: what you are wearing is mine. This one said: take it off! The other one said: fly! Because of this “…Cain rose against his brother Abel and killed him.” (ibid.) R’ Yehoshua of Sakhnin said in the name of R’ Levi: they both took the land and the moveable property. What were they arguing about? One said: the Holy Temple will be built in my boundary. The other said: the Holy Temple will be built in my boundary. As it says “…when they were in the field…” (ibid.) and the field only refers to the Holy Temple. This is what it says “…Zion shall be plowed as a field…” (Micah 3:12) Because of this “…Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him.” Yehudah bar Ami said: they were arguing about the first Eve. R’ Ibo said: the first Eve returned to the dust. Then what were they arguing about? R’ Huna said: an extra twin sister was born with Abel. This one said: I will take her because I am the first born. The other one said: I will take her because she was born with me. Because of this “…Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him.”"

If it is distress there is no distress like it and if it is joy there is no joy like it. R’ Shmuel ben Nachmani came and split the teaching in half. Anywhere that it says ‘and it was’ (vayehi) indicates distress, ‘and it will be’ (v’haya) indicates joy…The brought a challenge from this verse “…and he was [there] (v’haya) when Jerusalem was taken.” (Jeremiah 38:28) He said to them: this is still a cause of joy because on that very day Israel received full payment for their sins. As R’ Shmuel ben Nachmani said: Israel received full payment for their sins on the day the Holy Temple was destroyed, as it says “Your iniquity is finished, O daughter of Zion…” (Lamentations 4:22)"

Because from there they would draw the holy spirit. “…and then they would return the rock onto the mouth of the well, to its place.” (ibid) Left to rest for the next pilgrimage festival. Another explanation. “And he looked, and behold! a well in the field…” This refers to Zion. “…and behold! three flocks of sheep…” This refers to the three courts, as it teaches: there were three courts there – one at the entrance to the Temple Mount, one at the entrance to the Courtyard, and one in the Chamber of Hewn Stones. “…because from that well…” Because from there they would hear the ruling. “…and a huge rock…” This refers to the High Court which sat in the Chamber of Hewn Stones. “And all the flocks would gather there…” This refers to the courts throughout the land of Israel. “…and they would roll the rock off…” Because from there they would hear the ruling. “…and then they would return the rock…” Because they would debate back and forth until the ruling was clear. Another explanation. “And he looked, and behold! a well in the field…” This refers to Zion. “…and behold! three flocks of sheep…” This refers to the first three kingdoms. “…because from that well…” Because they became rich from the devoted property that was hidden away in the Temple courts. “…and a huge rock…” This refers to the merit of the forefathers. “And all the flocks would gather there…” This refers to the wicked kingdom who writes out a conscription from all the nations of the world. “…and they would roll the rock off…” Because they became rich from the devoted property that was hidden away in the Temple courts. “…and then they would return the rock…” The merit of the forefathers stands for us in the future…"

The cave of the Machpela, as it is written “And Abraham listened to Ephron, and Abraham weighed out to Ephron the silver…” (Bereshit 23:16) The Holy Temple, as it is written “And David gave to Ornan for the place shekels of gold weighing six hundred.” (Divre HaYamim I 21:25) The grave of Yosef, as it is written ““And he bought the part of the field where he had pitched his tent…” (Bereshit 33:19)"

            "[“Benjamin is a wolf, he will prey…” (Bereshit 49:27)] “Why do you lurk, you lofty mountains, for the mountain that God desired for His dwelling?” (Tehillim 68:17) R’ Yosi haGalili and R’ Akiva: R’ Yosi haGalili explained the verse as referring to the mountains. At the moment when the Holy One came to give the Torah on Sinai the mountains came running and arguing with each other. This one said ‘the Torah will be given on me!’ and this one said ‘the Torah will be given on me!’ Mount Tabor came from Bet Elim and  Mount Carmel from Espamia, this is what is written “As long as I live, says the King, Whose name is the Lord of Hosts, that as sure as Tabor is among the mountains, and Carmel is by the sea, it shall come about.” (Yimiyahu 46:18) This one said ‘I was called!’ and this one said ‘I was called!’ The Holy One said ‘Why do you lurk, you lofty mountains?’ You are all high mountains, but what does lofty (gavnunim) mean? As it says “…or one with long eyebrows (gibein), or a cataract…” (Vayikra 21:20) Idolatry was done on all of you, but Sinai upon which idolatry was never done “…the mountain that God desired for His dwelling,” (Tehillim 68:17) “The Lord descended upon Mount Sinai…” (Shemot 19:20) Nevertheless, “…Even the Lord will dwell [there] forever,” (Tehillim 68:17) refers to the eternal House. R’ Akiva explained the verse as referring to the tribes. At the moment when Shlomo said to build the Holy Temple, the tribes came running and arguing with each other. This one said ‘in my portion it will be built!’ This one said ‘in my portion it will be built!’ The Holy One said to them ‘tribes, why are you lurking? All of you are tribes, all of you are righteous – but lofty (gavnunim). What is gavnunim? Ganavim (thieves). You were all partners in the sale of Yosef; but Benyamin, who did not participate in the sale of Yosef, “…the mountain that God desired for His dwelling.” (Tehillim 68:17) So we find that four hundred and eighty years beforehand the children of Korach prophesied on this, that in the future it would be in the portion of Benyamin as it says “My soul yearns, yea, it pines for the courts of the Lord…” (Tehillim 84:3) So too it says “Behold we heard it in Ephrath…” (Tehillim 132:6) R’ Yehudah says ‘the Holy Temple was built in the portion of Yehudah, as it is written “…Ephrathite man from Bethlehem of Judah…”’ (Shmuel I 17:12) R’ Shimon says ‘in the portion of the son of she who died in Ephrathah. And who died in Ephrathah? Rachel. Perhaps it was in the portion of Yosef who is also among her sons? The verse says “…we found it in the fields of the forest.” (Tehillim 132:6) In the portion of the one who is compared to a beast of the forest, and who is so compared? Benyamin, as it is written “Benjamin is a wolf, he will prey…” (Bereshit 49:27)"

            "“… and he made for his father a mourning of seven days.” (Bereshit 50:10) Why do we mourn for seven days in parallel to the seven days of feasting? The Holy One said to them: in this world you shared the pain of this righteous one and mourned for him seven days, in the coming world I will transform that mourning to joy, as it says “…and I will turn their mourning into joy and will comfort them and make them rejoice from their sorrow.” (Yirmiyahu 31:12) And just as I console you, so I will console Zion and all her waste places in the manner that it says,” For the Lord shall console Zion, He shall console all its ruins, and He shall make its desert like a paradise and its wasteland like the garden of the Lord; joy and happiness shall be found therein, thanksgiving and a voice of song.” (Yeshayahu 51:3)\n"
