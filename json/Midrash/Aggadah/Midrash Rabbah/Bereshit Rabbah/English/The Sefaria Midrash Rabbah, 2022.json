            "Rabbi Hoshaya the Great began: “I<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The speaker is Wisdom (the Torah) personified.</i> was with Him as an <i>amon</i>, a delight day after day…” (Proverbs 8:30) – <i>amon</i> means a child’s caretaker, <i>amon</i> means covered, <i>amon</i> means hidden, and some say <i>amon </i>means greatness. <i>Amon </i>means a child’s caretaker, as it says: “As a caretaker [<i>omen</i>] carries a nursing child” (Numbers 11:12). <i>Amon </i>means covered, as it says: “Those covered [<i>ha’emunim</i>] in scarlet…” (Lamentations 4:5). <i>Amon </i> means hidden, as it says: “He was <i>omen<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is expounded to mean that Mordekhai hid Esther from the emissaries of Aḥashverosh.</i></i> Hadassa” (Esther 2:7). <i>Amon </i>means great, as it says: “Are you better than No Amon [which sits in the rivers]?” (Nahum 3:8), which we translate in Targum as: Are you better than the great city of Alexandria,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">No (or No Amon) is the name of a city in Egypt. Targum identifies this city as Alexandria, and explains Amon to mean great.</i> which is located among the rivers? <br>Another matter, <i>amon </i>means artisan [<i>uman</i>]. The Torah is saying: ‘I was the tool of craft of the Holy One blessed be He.’ The way of the world is that when a flesh-and-blood king builds a palace he does not build it based on his own knowledge, but rather based on the knowledge of an artisan.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A professional builder.</i> And the artisan does not build it based on his own knowledge, but rather, he has [plans on] sheets and tablets by which to ascertain how he should build its rooms, how he should build its doors. So too, the Holy One blessed be He looked in the Torah and created the world. The Torah says: “<i>Bereshit</i> God created” (Genesis 1:1), and <i>reshit </i>is nothing other than the Torah, as it says: “The Lord made me at the beginning of [<i>reshit</i>] His way” (Proverbs 8:22).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Be-reshit</i> is interpreted as ‘by means of the Torah.’</i>",
            "Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin began in the name of Rabbi Levi: “The power of His deeds<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The account of Creation.</i> He told to His people, to give them the inheritance of nations” (Psalms 111:6). What is the reason that the Holy One blessed be He revealed what was created on the first day and what was created on the second day? It is due to the idolaters, so they could not rebuke Israel and say to them: ‘You are a nation of robbers.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">By your conquest of the land of Israel from its original inhabitants.</i> Israel responds to them and says to them: ‘And you, is it [your own land] not in your hands by robbery? Is it not so that: “Kaftorim, who emerged from Kaftor, destroyed them [the Avites], and settled in their place”? (Deuteronomy 2:23). The world and all its contents belong to the Holy One blessed be He. When He wished He gave it to you, and when He wished He took it from you and gave it to us.’ That is what is written: “[The power of His deeds He told to His people,] to give them the inheritance of nations…” – He told them [the history of] all the generations.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So that they should see clearly that peoples have often conquered other peoples.</i>",
            "<b>“In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 1:1).</b> <br>“In the beginning, God created” – Rabbi Tanḥuma began: “For You are great and perform wonders” (Psalms 86:10). Rabbi Tanḥum said: A wineskin, if it has a hole as small as the point of a needle, all its air will escape from it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When one inflates it to determine whether there are any holes.</i> Yet a human is made with numerous cavities and orifices, but his air does not escape from him. Who can do so? It is “You, alone, are God” (Psalms 86:10). <br>When were the angels created? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The angels [<i>malakhim</i>] were created on the second day. That is what is written: “He covers His upper chambers<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The heavens.</i> with water…”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is what God did on the second day (Genesis 1:6–7).</i> (Psalms 104:3), and it is written: “He makes the winds His messengers [<i>malakhav</i>]” (Psalms 104:4). <br>Rabbi Ḥanina said: The angels were created on the fifth day. That is what is written: “Let birds fly [<i>yeofef</i>] over the earth…” (Genesis 1:20), and it is written [of the angels]: “And with two<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The seraphim had six wings, using two of them for flight (Isaiah 6:2).</i> it would fly [<i>yeofef</i>]” (Isaiah 6:2). Rabbi Lulyana bar Tavrin said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: Both according to the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina and according to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, everyone agrees that none were created on the first day, so people should not say: Mikhael was pulling at the south side of the heavens and Gabriel at its north side, while the Holy One blessed be He straightened it out in the middle. Rather, “I am the Lord, who made everything; who stretched out the heavens alone…by Myself [<i>me’iti</i>]” (Isaiah 44:24) – <i>it</i> [the last word] is written [as two],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although the word is pronounced (<i>keri</i>) <i>me’iti,</i> in the biblical text it is written (<i>ketiv</i>) as two words, <i>mi iti</i>.</i> “who is with Me [<i>mi iti</i>]?” Who was partner with Me in the creation of the world? <br>Another matter, “for You are great and perform wonders” (Psalms 86:10) – the way of the world is that a flesh-and-blood king, when he is receives praise in the province,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For its magnificent buildings or for its proficient administration.</i> the prominent leaders of the province receive praise along with him, as they bear the burden [of governing] with him. But the Holy One blessed be He is not so; rather, He alone created the world, He alone is lauded in the world, He alone is glorified in the world. Rabbi Tanḥuma said: “For You are great and perform wonders” – why? It is because “You, alone, are God” – You alone created the world.",
            "“In the beginning, God created” – six items preceded the creation of the world; some of them were [actually] created, and some of them God contemplated creating, [though He did not actually do so]. The Torah and the Throne of Glory were created. Torah, from where is it derived? As it is stated: “The Lord made me<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The speaker is Wisdom (the Torah) personified.</i> at the beginning of His way” (Proverbs 8:22). The Throne of Glory, from where is it derived? “Your throne stands firm from earliest time, [You are from eternity]” (Psalms 93:2). The patriarchs, Israel, the Temple, and the name of the messianic king – God contemplated creating them [before the world, but did not]. The patriarchs, from where is it derived? “Like grapes in the wilderness [I found Israel, like a first fruit on the fig tree, at its beginning [<i>bereshitah</i>] I saw your fathers]” (Hosea 9:10). Israel, from where is it derived? “Remember Your congregation, that You acquired from old times” (Psalms 74:2). The Temple, from where is it derived? “Throne of glory, exalted from the beginning, [is the place of our Temple]” (Jeremiah 17:12). The name of the messianic king, from where is it derived? “May his name endure forever. His name is praised before the sun”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Midrash expounds “before” to mean prior to.</i> (Psalms 72:17). Rabbi Ahava ben Rabbi Ze’eira said: Repentance as well, as it is stated: “Before the birth of mountains” (Psalms 90:2), and at that same time, “You bring man down until he is crushed, [and then You say: Return, sons of man]” (Psalms 90:3). <br>But I do not know which of them<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The two things that were actually created before the world.</i> was first – did the Torah precede the Throne of Glory, or did the Throne of Glory precede the Torah? Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: The Torah preceded the Throne of Glory, as it is stated: “The Lord made me at the beginning of His way, [before His undertakings of old times]” (Proverbs 8:22) – before that in whose regard it is written: “Your throne stands firm from earliest time” (Psalms 93:2). <br>Rabbi Huna and Rabbi Yirmeya said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Rabbi Yitzḥak: The contemplation about [creating] Israel preceded all other things. This is analogous to a king who married a noblewoman, but did not have a son from her. Once the king was found passing in the marketplace. He said: ‘Take this ink and inkwell for my son.’ Everyone was saying: ‘He has no son and yet he says: Take this ink and inkwell for my son?’ Then they said: ‘The king is a great astrologer, had it not been that he is destined to beget a son from her, he would not have said: Take this ink and inkwell for my son.’ So, too, had it not been that the Holy One blessed be He foresaw that after twenty-six generations Israel was destined to receive the Torah, He would not have written in the Torah: “Command the children of Israel”; “speak to the children of Israel.” <br>Rabbi Banai said: The world and its contents were created only due to the merit of the Torah, as it is stated: “The Lord founded the earth with wisdom [<i>beḥochma</i>]”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Beḥochma</i> could also be translated “for the sake of wisdom” – wisdom, throughout Proverbs, refers to the Torah. Similarly, the Midrash is interpreting <i>Bereshit</i> as “for the sake of <i>Reshit</i>” – God created the heavens and the earth for the sake of that which is called <i>Reshit</i>.</i> (Proverbs 3:19). Rabbi Berekhya said: It was due to the merit of Moses, as it is stated: “He saw the first [<i>reshit</i>] for himself, [as there the portion of the lawgiver is hidden]” (Deuteronomy 33:21).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Moses, the lawgiver, is called <i>Reshit</i>, the first one.</i> <br>Rav Huna said in the name of Rav Matana: The world was created for the sake of three things: For the sake of <i>ḥalla</i>, for the sake of tithes, and for the sake of first fruits. What is the source? “In the beginning, [<i>bereshit</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Or, for the sake of <i>reshit</i>.</i> God created,” and <i>reshit </i>is nothing other than <i>ḥalla</i>, as it is stated: “The first of [<i>reshit</i>] your kneading basket” (Numbers 15:20). <i>Reshit </i>is nothing other than tithes, as it says: “The first [<i>reshit</i>] of your grain” (Deuteronomy 18:4). And <i>reshit </i>is nothing other than first fruits, as it is stated: “The choicest of [<i>reshit</i>] the first fruits of your land…” (Exodus 23:19).",
            "Rav Huna began in the name of bar Kapara: “May they be silenced [<i>te’alamna</i>], those lying lips [that speak harsh words against the righteous one with arrogance and contempt]” (Psalms 31:19) – may they be bound up, may they become mute, may they be silenced.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>te’alamna</i> can have all these three meanings, as the Midrash goes on to show.</i> May they become mute – as it says: “Who gives a mouth to a person, or who renders one mute [<i>ilem</i>] or deaf, or sighted or blind? Is it not I, the Lord?” (Exodus 4:11). And [may they be bound up,] as it says: “Behold, we were binding [<i>me’alemim</i>] sheaves in the field and behold, my sheaf arose” (Genesis 37:7). May they be silenced – that is its plain sense.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is the literal translation of <i>te’alamna</i>.</i> “That speak…against the Righteous One” (Psalms 31:19) – [this refers to] Him of eternal life.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The “righteous one” refers to God.</i> “Harsh words [<i>atak</i>]” (Psalms 31:19) – matters that He concealed [<i>shehe’etik</i>] from His creations.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They speak out loud and expound on the secrets of Creation.</i> “With arrogance” (Psalms 31:19) – this is an expression of bewilderment:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Can it be that someone would do such a thing out of arrogance?</i> [Do they do this] in order to boast arrogantly: I am expounding the act of Creation? “And contempt” (Psalms 31:19) – this [too] is an expression of bewilderment: Is it in order to show contempt for My honor? As Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: Anyone who attains honor through the degradation of another person has no portion in the World to Come; how much more so is this so regarding the honor of the Omnipresent. What is written following this? “How great is the goodness You have in store for those who fear You” (Psalms 31:20) – for those who fear You, but not for those who demean the [awesome] fear of You. They will not be included in: “How great is the goodness.” <br>The way of the world is that when a flesh-and-blood king builds his palace in [a location that had been] a place of sewers, a place of refuse, and a malodorous place, anyone who comes and says: ‘This palace was built in a place of sewers, a place of refuse, and a malodorous place,’ is this not an insult? So, too, anyone who comes and says: ‘This world was created from emptiness and disorder,’ is this not an insult? This is a rhetorical question. Rav Huna said in the name of bar Kapara: Were the matter not written explicitly it would not have been possible to say it: “In the beginning, God created” (Genesis 1:1) – from what? “The earth was emptiness and disorder” (Genesis 1:2).",
            "Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon began: “He reveals the deep and the hidden [<i>umsatrata</i>]” (Daniel 2:22). “He reveals the deep” – this is Gehenna, as it is stated: “He does not know that the ghosts are there; [her guests are in the depths of the netherworld]” (Proverbs 9:18). And it says: “He deepened [<i>he’emik</i>] and widened” (Isaiah 30:33). “And the hidden [<i>umsatrata</i>]” – this is the Garden of Eden, as it is stated: “For protection and refuge [<i>ulmistor</i>]” (Isaiah 4:6). And it says: “Conceal them [<i>tastirem</i>] in the hideaway of Your presence” (Psalms 31:21). <br>Another matter, “He reveals the deep and the hidden [<i>umsatrata</i>]” – these are the actions of the wicked, as it is stated: “Those who go deep from the Lord” (Isaiah 29:15). <i>Umsatrata</i> – these are the actions of the wicked, as it is stated: “To conceal [<i>listor</i>] counsel” (Isaiah 29:15). “He knows what is in the darkness” (Daniel 2:22) – these are the actions of the wicked, as it is stated: “Their actions are in the darkness” (Isaiah 29:15). “And the light rests with Him” (Daniel 2:22) – these are the actions of the righteous, as it is written: “But the path of the righteous is like a dawning light” (Proverbs 4:18), and it says: “Light is sown for the righteous…” (Psalms 97:11). Rabbi Abba Sarongaya said: “And the light rests with Him” – this is the messianic king, as it is stated: “Arise, shine, [for your light has come and the glory of the Lord has shone upon you]” (Isaiah 60:1), etc. in <i>Pesikta</i>. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Midrash refers us to <i>Pesikta Rabati parashat Kumi ori, </i>where the idea of light representing the Messiah is expounded further. (According to some, the word בפסיקתא is a scribal error and should be deleted.)</i> <br>Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: From the beginning of the creation of the world, “He reveals the deep and the hidden” (Daniel 2:22). [The verse states:] “In the beginning God created [the heavens]” (Genesis 1:1) – but it did not elaborate.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As to how they were created.</i> And where did it elaborate? It was elsewhere: “Who spread the heavens like a curtain” (Isaiah 40:22). [It states further:] “And the earth” (Genesis 1:1) – but it did not elaborate. And where did it elaborate? It was elsewhere: “For He says to the snow: Become the earth” (Job 37:6); “when the dust consolidated into a mass…” (Job 38:38). [It states:] “God said: Let there be light” (Genesis 1:3) – but it did not elaborate. Where did it elaborate? “Enveloping with light as if with a cloak” (Psalms 104:2).",
            "Rabbi Yitzḥak began: “The beginning of Your word is truth…” (Psalms 119:160) – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Right from the beginning of the creation of the world [it can be seen that] “the beginning of Your word is truth” – “in the beginning, God created.” “But My Lord God is truth” (Jeremiah 10:10),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This verse shows that God is the epitome of truth, and it is fitting that He should establish this truth right at the beginning of the Torah. This truth is the unity of God, as the Midrash goes on to explain.</i> “All Your righteous laws are eternal” (Psalms 119:160) – as each and every edict that You decree upon Your creations, they accept the judgment upon themselves and receive it faithfully, and no person can come and say that two authorities created the world:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Other versions add: Or that two authorities gave the Torah.</i> “God [<i>Elohim</i>] spoke [<i>vaydaberu</i>]” is not written here [in plural], but rather [in singular], “God spoke [<i>vaydaber</i>];”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although the word <i>Elohim</i> is grammatically a plural form, the Torah constantly uses singular verbs with it, proving that God is indeed one. </i> “God [<i>Elohim</i>] said [<i>vayomeru</i>]” is not written here [in plural], but rather [in singular], “God said [<i>vayomer</i>]”; “In the beginning God created [<i>bare’u</i>]” is not written here [in plural], but rather [in singular], “God created [<i>bara</i>].”",
            "Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said in the name of Rabbi Levi: A builder requires six items: Water, dirt, wood, stones, reeds, and iron. If you say that he is wealthy and does not need reeds [to build with], he still needs to use them as a measuring rod, as it is stated: “A linen thread and a measuring rod” (Ezekiel 40:3). So, too, the Torah employed these six expressions of precedence: “Of old [<i>kedem</i>]…from earliest time [<i>me’az</i>], from ancient times [<i>meolam</i>]…from the beginning [<i>merosh</i>], from before [<i>mikadmei</i>]…” (Proverbs 8:22–23) – which counts as two,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since <i>mikadmei</i> is a plural form.</i> in the section of “the Lord made me” (Proverbs 8:22).",
            "A certain philosopher once asked Rabban Gamliel, saying to him: ‘Your God is a great artist, however he found many excellent raw materials that helped him: Emptiness, disorder, darkness, wind, water, and depths.’ He said to him: ‘May the spirit of that man depart from him; regarding all of them, creation is written.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">God did not “find” these materials; He created them Himself.</i> Emptiness and disorder, as it is stated: “Who makes peace and creates evil” (Isaiah 45:7). Darkness, “who forms light [and creates darkness]” (Isaiah 45:7); water, “Praise Him, heavens on heavens, and the water [above the heavens]” (Psalms 148:4). Why? “For He commanded and they were created” (Psalms 148:5). Wind, “For behold, He forms mountains and creates wind” (Amos 4:13); depths, “when there were no depths, I generated” (Proverbs 8:24).",
            "Rabbi Yona said in the name of Rabbi Levi: Why was the world created with the letter <i>beit</i>?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is the first letter of “<i>bereshit</i> – in the beginning.”</i> It is because just as the <i>beit </i>is closed on all [three of] its sides but open in its front, so, you do not have permission to ask: What is below, what is above, what was before, and what is after,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ḥagiga </i>2:1. One should not ponder what is above the firmament and what is below the earth, what was before Creation, and what will be after the end of the world.</i> but only from the day when the world created and onward. Bar Kapara said: “For ask now of the early days that were before you, from the day [that God created man upon the earth]” (Deuteronomy 4:32) – from the day they were created, you may inquire, but you may not inquire what was before that. “From one end of the heavens to the other end” (Deuteronomy 4:32), you may inquire and investigate, but what is beyond that you may not investigate. Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi expounded regarding the act of Creation together with bar Kapara: Why was the world created with the letter <i>beit</i>? It is to inform you that there are two worlds,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The numerical value of <i>beit</i> is two.</i> this world and the World to Come. <br>Another matter, why with a <i>beit</i>? Because it alludes to an expression of blessing [<i>berakha</i>]. And why not with an <i>alef</i>? Because it alludes to an expression of curse [<i>arira</i>]. Another matter, why not with an <i>alef</i>? It is to avoid giving recourse to the heretics to say: How can the world endure, as it was created with an expression of curse? Rather, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Behold, I will create it with an expression of blessing, and there is hope that perhaps it will endure.’ <br>Another matter, why with a <i>beit</i>? It is because just as the <i>beit </i>has two protrusions, one above it and one below and behind it, if one says to the <i>beit</i>: ‘Who created you?’ It points with its upper protrusion, saying: ‘That One who is above created me.’ ‘And what is His name?’ It points with its rear protrusion and says: ‘The Lord [<i>Adonai</i>] is His name.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It points to the letter that is behind it, the <i>alef</i>, which is the first letter of <i>Adonai</i>, one of God’s names.</i> <br>Rabbi Elazar bar Ḥanina said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: For twenty-six generations<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the number of generations that passed from Creation to the giving of the Torah.</i> the <i>alef </i>complained before the throne of the Holy One blessed be He. It said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, I am the first of the letters, but You did not create Your world with me.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to it: ‘The world and all its contents were created only for the sake of the Torah, as it is stated: “The Lord founded the earth with wisdom…”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See earlier, section 4.</i> (Proverbs 3:19). Tomorrow, I will be coming to give the Torah at Sinai, and I will open it at its beginning only with you, as it is stated: “I [<i>anokhi</i>] am the Lord your God”’ (Exodus 20:2). Rabbi Hoshaya says: Why is it called <i>alef</i>? It is because He consented concerning a thousand, as it is stated: “The word that He commanded for one thousand [<i>elef</i>] generations” (Psalms 105:8).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Torah was originally supposed to be given to the thousandth [<i>elef</i>] generation (<i>Bereishit Rabba</i> 28:4). The first letter of that Torah was therefore given the name <i>alef</i>.</i>",
            "Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: [The alternative forms of the letters] <i>Mem</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>tzadi</i>, <i>peh</i>, <i>kaf</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These letters have different forms depending on whether they appear in the beginning or middle of a word, or at its end.</i> the prophets said them, though it was a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses at Sinai.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The existence of these alternative forms was transmitted to Moses, forgotten, and the prophets restored them.</i> Rabbi Yirmeya said in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: What the prophets instituted.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The letters are not listed in the order they appear in the alphabet, and the list can be read as <i>min tzofakh</i> – from your prophets.</i> It once happened that there was a stormy day and the Sages could not gather at the house of assembly,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>bet midrash</i>, where the Torah was expounded.</i> but there were some children there.

            "Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Akilas: To this One it is fitting to call God.

According to the opinion of Beit Shammai, who say that the heavens were created first and the earth thereafter, it is analogous to a king who had a throne made, and once that was made he had its footstool made. So, the Holy One blessed be He said: “The heavens are My throne and the earth is My footstool…” (Isaiah 66:1). According to the opinion of Beit Hillel, who say that the earth was created first and the heavens thereafter, it is analogous to a king who built a palace; first he built the lower sections and then he built the upper sections, so, “on the day that the Lord God made earth and the heavens” (Genesis 2:4).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The earth first, then the heavens.</i> Rabbi Yehuda bar Ilai said: This verse, too, supports Beit Hillel: “You laid the foundations of earth in times past” (Psalms 102:26), and then, “the heavens are the work of Your hands” (Psalms 102:26). Rabbi Ḥanin said: From the same place where Scripture supports Beit Shammai,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">\"God created the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 1:1).</i> from there, Beit Hillel refute them: “The earth was” (Genesis 1:2) – it already was. <br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of the Sages: In terms of Creation, the heavens were first, but in terms of completion, the earth was first. Rabbi Tanḥuma said: I will say the source; in terms of Creation, the heavens were first, as it is stated: “In the beginning, God created [the heavens].” In terms of completion, the earth was first, as it is stated: “On the day that the Lord God made earth and the heavens.” <br>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: I am surprised how it is that the fathers of the world, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, disagreed regarding the creation of the heavens and the earth. It is, rather, as I say, that both of them were created [at the same time,] like a stewpot and its lid, as it is stated: “[My hand also laid the foundation of the earth and My right hand measured the heavens]; I appointed them; they arise together” (Isaiah 48:13). <br>Rabbi Elazar ben Rabbi Shimon said: If it is in accordance with the opinion of my father, why is it that at times the earth is mentioned before the heavens and at times the heavens are mentioned before the earth? Rather, it teaches that both of them are equal in importance to one another.  <br>In every place Abraham is mentioned before Isaac and Jacob, but in one place it says: “I will remember My covenant with Jacob, [and also My covenant with Isaac, and also My covenant with Abraham]” (Leviticus 26:42). This teaches that the three of them are equal in importance to one another.  <br>In every place Moses is mentioned before Aaron, but in one place it says: “It is Aaron and Moses” (Exodus 6:26). This teaches that both of them are equal in importance to one another.  <br>In every place Joshua is mentioned before Caleb, but in one place it says: “Except for Caleb son of Yefuneh the Kenizite and Joshua son of Nun” (Numbers 14:30, Numbers 32:12).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The citation in the Midrash is actually an amalgam of these two verses.</i> This teaches that both of them are equal in importance to one another.  <br>In every place turtledoves are mentioned before young pigeons, but in one place it says: “And a young pigeon or a turtledove as a sin offering” (Leviticus 12:6). This tells you that both of them are equal in importance to one another.  <br>In every place, honor of the father is mentioned before the mother, but in one place it says: “Each of you shall fear his mother and his father” (Leviticus 19:3). This tells you that both of them are equal in importance to one another. However, the Sages said: The father takes precedence over the mother, because both he [a son] and his mother are obligated to honor his father. <br>In every place the creation of the heavens is mentioned before the earth, but in one place it says: “On the day that the Lord God made earth and the heavens.” This tells you that both of them are equal in importance to one another."

That is what is written: “My hands stretched the heavens and commanded all their host” (Isaiah 45:12) – right from when “My hands stretched the heavens,” “I commanded all their host.” I commanded the sea that it should split before Israel. I commanded the heavens and the earth that they should be silent before Moses, as it is stated: “Listen, the heavens, and I will speak, and the earth will hear the sayings of my mouth” (Deuteronomy 32:1). I commanded the sun and the moon that they should stand still before Joshua, as it is stated: “Sun, stand still at Givon; [and Moon, in the Valley of Ayalon]” (Joshua 10:12). I commanded the ravens that they should sustain Elijah, as it is stated: “The ravens would bring him bread and meat…” (I Kings 17:6). I commanded the fire that it should not harm Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya. I commanded the lions that they should not harm Daniel. I commanded the heavens that they should open before Ezekiel, as it is stated: “The heavens opened…” (Ezekiel 1:1).

The king sent a powerful legion and surrounded it so that the residents of the province would see it and be in fear of him. So, why is it that: “He heaps together the water of the sea”?

There was a certain child sitting in the middle of the tabletop and proclaiming and saying: “The earth and all that it holds are the Lord’s, the world and all its inhabitants” (Psalms 24:1).

There was a certain tailor there and he went [to the market] to purchase a fish. It happened that he and the child [servant] of the governor were vying for it. This one would offer a higher price and the other one would offer a still higher price, until it reached twelve dinars, and the tailor purchased it. At dinnertime, the governor said to the child: ‘Why did you not bring me a fish?’ He said to him: ‘My master, I will not conceal it from you, I went [to the market] and there was only one fish there and it happened that I and a certain Jew were vying for it. He offered a higher price and I offered a higher price until it reached twelve dinars. Would you have wanted me to bring you a fish for twelve dinars?’ he asked rhetorically. He said to him: ‘Who is it [who bought the fish]?’ He said to him: ‘A man named such-and-such.’ He sent for him and he came before him. He said to him: ‘What did you see, Jewish tailor, that led you to eat a fish that cost twelve dinars?’ He said to him: ‘My master, we have one day [each year] that atones for us for all the sins we have performed all the days of the year. When it arrives, should we not accord it honor?’ He said to him: ‘Because you adduced a justification for your position, you are exempt [from punishment].’ How did the Holy One blessed be He reward him?

The Rabbis say: [His glory did spend the night with him; ] only at the conclusion of Shabbat was his radiance taken from him as He expelled him from the Garden of Eden. That is what is written: “He banished the man” (Genesis 3:24), and it is written: “You alter his countenance and send him away” (Job 14:20).  <br>Rabbi Yehuda bar Rabbi Simon said: By the light with which the world was created, Adam the first man could look out and see from one end of the world to the other. When the Holy One blessed be He looked ahead at the actions of the generation of Enosh, the actions of the generation of the Flood, and the actions of the generation of the Dispersion, [and saw] that they were corrupt, He arose and hid it away from them, as it is stated: “Their light will be withheld from the wicked” (Job 38:15). Why did He hide it away? The explanation is that he hid it away for the righteous in the future, as it is stated: “God saw that it [light] was good [<i>tov</i>]” (Genesis 1:4). <i>Tov</i> is nothing other than the righteous, as it is stated: “Say of the righteous one that he is good [<i>tov</i>]” (Isaiah 3:10). From where is it derived that He hid it away for the righteous? It is as it is stated: “But the path of the righteous is like a dawning light” (Proverbs 4:18). When he saw that the light was hidden away for the righteous, He rejoiced, as it is stated: “At the light of the righteous He will rejoice” (Proverbs 13:9). <br>Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Gezeira: That [primordial] light functioned for thirty-six hours – twelve on the day before Shabbat, twelve on the night of Shabbat, and twelve on Shabbat [day]. When Adam the first man sinned, He sought to hide it away [immediately], but He accorded deference to Shabbat, as it is stated: “God blessed the seventh day” (Genesis 2:3). With what did He bless it? It was with light. When the sun set on Shabbat eve the light continued to function. Everyone began praising the Holy One blessed be He. That is what is written: “Under all the heavens they sing His praises” (Job 37:3).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Midrash interprets <i>yishrehu</i> as being related to <i>shira</i>, song.</i> Why? It is because “His light is to the ends of the earth” (Job 37:3). That light illuminated all day and all night.  <br>As the sun set at the conclusion of Shabbat, darkness began approaching, and at that time Adam the first man became afraid. He said: ‘Is it possible that the one [the serpent] in whose regard it is written: “He will strike you [<i>yeshufekha</i>] with his head, and you will strike him [<i>teshufenu</i>] with your heel” (Genesis 3:15), is now coming to confront me,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The serpent represents death, as it was through its evil machinations that Adam sinned and was condemned to death.</i> as it is stated: “And I said that darkness will envelop me [<i>yeshufeni</i>]”?’ (Psalms 139:11).

Light emerged from them and he recited a blessing over it. That is what is written: “Night, for me, is light” (Psalms 139:11). This is in accordance with the opinion of what was taught in the school of Rabbi Yishmael: Why does one recite at the conclusion of Shabbat the blessing over light: ‘[Blessed be God] Who creates the lights of fire?’ It is because that time was the beginning of its creation. Rav Huna in the name of Rabbi Aivu in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One recites a blessing over it [light] at the conclusion of Yom Kippur, as well, because fire rested on that day.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is forbidden to make a fire all day on Yom Kippur.</i> <br>Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel: Although the [six] items were created in their complete form,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is derived from the fact that <i>toledot </i>here (Genesis 2:4) is written complete, with both <i>vavs</i>.</i> when Adam the first man sinned they were ruined, and they will not be restored to their completeness until the descendant of Peretz [the Messiah] comes, as it is stated: “These are the offspring [<i>toledot</i>]<i> </i>of Peretz” (Ruth 4:18) – in its complete form,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With both <i>vavs</i>.</i> for the six things [taken away from Adam] that will be restored: His radiance, his [eternal] life, his stature, the produce of the earth, the fruit of the tree, and the lights.

It is as it is stated: “For like the days of a tree will be the days of My people…” (Isaiah 65:22), and it is taught: Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: “Tree” is nothing other than Torah, as it says: “It is a tree of life for those who grasp it” (Proverbs 3:18).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Like the days of a tree” means like the days of the Torah, meaning forever.</i> His stature, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “I caused you to walk upright [<i>komemiyut</i>]” (Leviticus 26:13).  <br>Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: With upright stature and not in fear of any creature. Rabbi Yudan said: [Their stature will be] one hundred cubits<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Komemiyut</i> is interpreted as <i>koma meyot</i> – stature of hundreds.</i> like Adam the first man. Rabbi Shimon said: Two hundred cubits.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because <i>meyot</i> (hundreds) is in plural.</i> Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Shimon said: Three hundred: <i>Koma </i>refers to one hundred,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As that was the stature (<i>koma</i>) of Adam.</i> and <i>meyot</i> – refers to [another] two hundred. Rabbi Abahu said: Nine hundred cubits. Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Dosa: Rabbi Abahu’s source is from here: “For like the days of a tree will be the days of My people” – like a sycamore that grows in the ground for six hundred years. An offspring emerges from its mother’s womb a bit more than a cubit long.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And by the end of the first year after conception (when the baby is three months old), it reaches a length of one-and-a-half cubits. </i> Go out and calculate one-and-a-half cubits per year,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since man’s growth is compared to the growth of a sycamore, that means he will grow at a constant rate for six hundred years.</i> that is nine hundred cubits.  <br>The produce of the earth, the fruit of the tree, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “For the seed is of peace: The vine will yield its fruit, [and the land will yield its produce]” (Zechariah 8:12). The lights, from where is it derived? It is as it is written: “The light of the moon will be like the light of the sun [and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, like the light of the seven days]” (Isaiah 30:26).",

Rain is called <i>toladot</i>, as it is stated: “Does rain have a father?” (Job 38:28). Dew is called <i>toladot</i>, as it is stated: “And who begot the drops [<i>eglei</i>] of dew?” (Job 38:28). Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: These [<i>eglai</i>] are gem-like drops of dew.  <br>It was taught: Anything that is associated with offspring dies and decomposes, is created but does not create. Anything that is not associated with offspring does not die, does not decompose, and creates but is not created. Rabbi Azarya stated: This [latter category] was stated [only] regarding the One above.",
            "Everything that you see is an outgrowth of either the heavens or the earth, as it is stated: “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 1:1). On the second day, He created things out of the heavenly realm: “God said: Let there be a firmament” (Genesis 1:6). On the third day, He created things out of the earthly realm: “God said: Let the earth sprout grass” (Genesis 1:11). On the fourth day, He created things out of the heavenly realm: “God said: Let there be lights” (Genesis 1:14). On the fifth day, He created things out of the earthly realm: “God said: Let the water swarm” (Genesis 1:20). On the sixth day, He came to create man. He said: ‘If I create him from the heavenly realm, the heavenly will outnumber the earthly by one creation and there will not be peace [equilibrium] in the world. If I create him from the earthly realm, the earthly will outnumber the heavenly by one creation and there will not be peace in the world. Rather, I will create him from both the heavenly and the earthly realms for the sake of peace.’ That is what is written: “And the Lord God created man…” (Genesis 2:7) – “Out of dust from the ground” (Genesis 2:7), from the earthly, “and He blew into his nostrils a living spirit” (Genesis 2:7), from the heavenly. This is as Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: “Dominion and fear are with Him; He makes peace in His heights” (Job 25:2). “Dominion” – this is Gabriel; “and fear” – this is Mikhael.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The angels Mikhael and Gabriel represent opposite spiritual forces, and God creates a balance (“peace”) between them, as he did with all of creation.</i>",

And for what purpose was all this effort undertaken? It is for: “You are the Lord, the God who chose Abram, and took him out of Ur of the Chaldeans, and set his name as Abraham” (Nehemiah 9:7).  <br>Rabbi Yudan said: “The ibex are in the high mountains” is not written here, but rather, “the high mountains are for the ibex” (Psalms 104:18). Why were the high mountains created? For the ibex. The ibex is weak and fears wild beasts, but when it seeks to drink, the Holy One blessed be He introduces a manic spirit into it and it shakes its horns back and forth, producing noise, and it [the wild beast] flees. “The crag is a shelter for the hyrax” (Psalms 104:18) – the hyrax takes shelter under the crag from the bird of prey when it flies over so that it will not prey on it. If the Holy One blessed be He took into account this impure being when creating His world, would he not do all the more so for the merit of Abraham? That is a rhetorical question.",

But from what Rabbi Abahu said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <i>Behibare’am</i> – with a <i>heh</i> [<i>beheh</i>] He created them [<i>bera’am</i>], we see that it is this world that was created with <i>heh</i>. Just as <i>heh </i>is closed on all its sides, but open at the bottom, that is an allusion to the fact that all the dead descend to the netherworld.

            "Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua, Rabbi Eliezer says: Everything that is in the heavens is created out of the heavens; everything that is on earth is created out of the earth.

Rabbi Azarya said regarding this statement of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: “Because on it He rested from all His labor [that God created to make].

[Why is that?] The reason is because it went up and encircled the Land of Israel,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">At creation it was not yet “great.” Its greatness came later, when it became the border of the Land of Israel.</i> in whose regard it is written: “For who is a great nation that has God [close to it]” (Deuteronomy 4:7).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Euphrates is called “the great river” because of its association with the land of the “great nation.”</i> The folk saying says: A king’s slave is [himself] a king; attach yourself to an officer and people will bow to you. <br>Rav said to his son Ḥiyya: ‘Build me a house in the Land of Israel.’ He said to him: ‘Where?’ He said to him: ‘Build it as soon as you cross the River [Euphrates].’ Shmuel said: ‘Up to the place where the River flows, that is the Land of Israel.’ Where is that? It is Tarbakna.  <br>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Huna, Rabbi Yudan said: The Euphrates and the Kevar River (Ezekiel 1:1) are one and the same. “Euphrates [<i>Perat</i>]” – because it broadens [<i>para verava</i>] to the point that it can be crossed [only] by boat. “Euphrates [<i>Perat</i>]” – because its water brings fertility [<i>parin</i>] and abundance [to the surrounding soil]. “Euphrates [<i>Perat</i>]” – because it gradually branches out [<i>mefaresh</i>] [into smaller and smaller streams] until it is possible to stop it with a spade. Kevar – because its produce [its grains] are large and do not fall through a sieve [<i>kevara</i>]. Rabbi Huna said: Kevar is a river unto itself, and <i>Perat </i>is a river unto itself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They are not identical, as Rabbi Yehuda said.</i>  <br>Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: They said to the Euphrates: ‘Why do you not emit a loud sound?’ It responded to them: ‘I do not need [to show off], as my actions make me known: A person plants a sapling near me, and it produces [fruit] in just thirty days; he sows a vegetable near me, and it grows in just three days.’ They said to the Tigris: ‘Why do you emit a loud sound?’ It responded to them: ‘Would that my sound might be heard and I be noticed.’ <br>They said to the fruit trees: ‘Why do you not emit a loud sound?’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Your leaves do not rustle loudly.</i> They responded to them: ‘We do not need [to show off], as our fruits attest to our [importance].’ They said to the non-fruit bearing trees: ‘Why do you emit a loud sound?’ They responded to them: ‘Would that our sound might be heard and we be noticed.’ <br>Rav Huna said: It is not for that reason. Rather, fruit trees, because they are weighed down with their fruit, that is why they do not emit a loud sound. But non-fruit bearing trees, because they are not weighed down with their fruit, do emit a loud sound.

Why, then, was it necessary to state the lesser curse after already having stated the more severe one? Large domesticated animals give birth after nine or twelve months of gestation, whereas wild animals give birth after only six months (see later). This shows that animals are worse off than beasts.</i> It was taught: A large kosher animal gives birth after nine months [of gestation], a large non-kosher animal gives birth after twelve months; a small kosher animal gives birth at five months, and the dog at fifty days, the cat at fifty-two, the pig at sixty days, the mongoose at seventy days, the deer and the fox at six months, and all the other swarming creatures at six months, the lion, the bear, the tiger, the elephant, the monkey, the hedgehog at three years, the serpent at seven years, and the adder at seventy years.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are thus beasts that are in fact worse off (in length of gestation) than animals.</i>  <br>A certain scholar once sought to ascertain after how long the serpent bears an offspring.

When the elders once traveled to Rome, he [the scholar] asked Rabban Gamliel: After how long does the serpent bear an offspring? He was unable to answer him and his face turned pallid. Rabbi Yehoshua encountered him and his face was sickly. He said to him: ‘Why is your face sickly?’ He said to him: ‘I was asked a question and I was unable to answer it.’ He said to him: ‘What was it?’ He said: ‘After how long does the serpent bear an offspring?’ He said to him: ‘After seven years.’ He said to him: ‘From where do you know this?’ He said to him: ‘The dog is a non-kosher beast and bears offspring after fifty days. A non-kosher animal gives birth at twelve months. It says [of the serpent]: “Cursed are you from all the animals and from all the beasts of the field.” Just as the animal is seven times more cursed than the beast [dog], so, the serpent is seven times more cursed than the animal.’ Towards evening, he [Rabban Gamliel] ascended and said it to him [the scholar].

The desire of rain is only for the ground, as it is stated: “You remember the earth and fulfill its desire…[the streams of God are full of water]” (Psalms 65:10).

He said: ‘What is the reason that the Holy One blessed be He set the number of the pure animals more than the impure animals? Is it not because He wants me to sacrifice an offering from them?’ Immediately, “he took from every pure animal…[and offered up offerings]” (Genesis 8:20). <br>“He will be like a tree planted by streams of water” (Psalms 1:3), as the Holy One blessed be He implanted him in the ark; “which gives its fruit in season” (Psalms 1:3), this is Shem; “whose leaf does not wither” (Psalms 1:3), this is Ḥam; “and whatever he does he will prosper” (Psalms 1:3), this is Yefet.",

What does Rabbi Ḥanina do with “from all faces”? It is from the faces of Israel. But is it not written: “As the youth will die when he is one hundred years old”? (Isaiah 65:20). This supports Rabbi Ḥanina. What does Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi do with it? [It means that at that age] he will be fit for punishment.  <br>But is it not written: “Like sheep, they are destined for the grave; death will shepherd them. The upright will rule over them”? (Psalms 49:15). This supports Rabbi Ḥanina. What does Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi do with it? Because in this world, there was Pharaoh at his time, Sisera at his time, Sennacherib at his time,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They were all punished.</i> but in the future, the Holy One blessed be He will appoint the angel of death as the permanent sentry.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To administer eternal punishment.

            "<b>“God remembered Noah, and all the beasts, and all the animals that were with him in the ark; God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the water subsided” (Genesis 8:1).</b> <br>“God remembered Noah, and all the beasts…” – and it is written: “Your righteousness is like mighty mountains [<i>keharerei el</i>]; Your judgments are great depths. Lord, You save man and animal” (Psalms 36:7). Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva: Rabbi Yishmael says: The righteous, who accepted the Torah that was given from the mountains of God [<i>meharerei el</i>], You perform righteousness with them [to the greatest extent,] up to the mighty mountains. But the wicked, who did not accept the Torah that was given from the mountains of God, You are exacting with them [to the greatest extent,] down to great depths. Rabbi Akiva says: With both these and those He is exacting down to great depths. He is exacting with the righteous by collecting His due from them for the few bad deeds that they performed in this world, in order to shower them with tranquility and give them a better reward in the World to Come. And He showers the wicked with tranquility and gives them reward for the few good deeds that they performed in this world in order to exact [a fuller] retribution from them in the World to Come. <br>Rabbi Levi said: The verse metaphorically compares [the reward of] the righteous to their abode and [the reward of] the wicked to their abode. The [reward of the] righteous to their abode, as it is stated: “In a good grazing land I will herd them, and on the mountains of the height of Israel will be their pasture” (Ezekiel 34:14). And the [reward of the] wicked to their abode: “So said the Lord God: On the day that he descended to the netherworld I caused mourning [<i>he’evalti</i>]; I covered him in the depths” (Ezekiel 31:15). Rabbi Yehuda bar Rabbi said: <i>Hovalti </i>is written.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With a <i>vav</i> instead of an <i>alef, </i>meaning “I led him [to the netherworld].” (In our text of the Bible it is in fact written with an <i>alef</i>.)</i> One does not craft a cover for a vat out of silver or gold, but rather out of earthenware, which is of the same material [as the vat itself]. So too, the wicked themselves are darkness, Gehenna is darkness, the depths of the earth are darkness. I led [<i>hovalti</i>] the wicked to Gehenna and covered them over with the depths of the earth, darkness covering darkness. <br>Rabbi Yonatan in the name of Rabbi Yoshiya transposes the [words of the] verse: “Your righteousness is upon Your judgments”; “like mighty mountains are upon the great depths.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Psalms 36:7.</i> Just as the mountains weigh down the water of the deep so it should not rise and inundate the world, so do the righteous suppress [God’s strict judgments and] punishments so they should not emerge and incinerate the world. Just as the mountains are endless, so is the reward of the righteous endless.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is an exposition on the straightforward reading of the verse: “Your righteousness is like mighty mountains.” We have transposed the order of sentences in our translation, in accordance with the commentators.</i> Just as the mountains are sown and produce fruit, so, the actions of the righteous produce fruit. That is what is written: “Say of the righteous man that it shall be well with him, [for they will eat the fruit of their actions]” (Isaiah 3:10). <br>And just as the depths of the earth are unmeasurable, so is the punishment of the wicked unmeasurable. That is what is written: “Woe to the wicked one who does evil” (Isaiah 3:11). Just as the depths of the earth are not sown and do not produce fruit, so, the actions of the wicked do not produce fruit, as, were they to produce fruit, they would destroy the world. <br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi once went up to Rome. There he saw pillars covered over with tapestries, so they would not freeze in the cold or split apart in the heat. But when he would walk in the marketplace, he saw a poor man wrapped in a mat, and some say in half a donkey’s saddlecloth. Regarding those pillars, he recited the verse: “Your righteousness is like mighty mountains” (Psalms 36:7) – to the one to whom You give, You give abundantly. Regarding that poor man, he recited the verse: “Your judgments are great depths” (Psalms 36:7) – to the one whom You hit, You hit powerfully.  <br>Alexander of Macedonia once went to the king of Katzia, beyond the Mountains of Darkness. He [Alexander] sent for him [to come see him]. He came out and he was carrying a golden loaf on a platter of gold. He said to him: Do I need your money? He said to him: Did you not have what to eat in your land that you came here? He said to him: I came only because I wish to know how you people administer justice. He sat with him. One day, someone came to him with a claim against another person. He said: This man sold me a ruin and I found a hidden treasure in it. The buyer said: I bought [only] a ruin; I did not buy a hidden treasure, [so it belongs to the seller]. The seller said: I sold the ruin and whatever was in it, [so it belongs to the buyer]. He said to one of them: Do you have a son? He said to him: Yes. He said to the other: Do you have a daughter? He said to him: Yes. He said to them: Go marry them off to each other, and the money will belong to both of them. He [the king] saw that he [Alexander] was sitting there in astonishment. He said to him: What, did I not judge well? He said to him: Yes, [you judged well]. He said to him: Had this case come before you, how would you have ruled? He said to him: I would have killed them both, and the royal treasury would have taken the money from both of them. He said to him: Do you have rainfall [in your land]? He said to him: Yes. He said to him: Do you have sunshine? He said to him: Yes. He said to him: Do you have flocks of sheep and goats? He said to him: Yes. He said to him; May the spirit of that man [you, Alexander] depart from his body. It is not for your sake that rain falls on you, and it is not for your sake that the sun shines for you. It is, rather, for the sake of the animals, as it is written: “Lord, You save man and animal” (Psalms 36:7) – the Lord saves man for the sake of the animals.  <br>Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon interpreted the verse regarding Noah. The Holy One blessed be He said: The righteousness that I performed with Noah in the ark, I performed specifically through the “mighty mountains” (Psalms 36:7) – “The ark rested during the seventh month…[upon the mountains of Ararat]” (Genesis 8:4). “Your judgments are great depths” (Psalms 36:7) – the suffering that I imposed on his generation, I imposed on them specifically through the great depths, as it is stated: “[All the wellsprings of the great depth] were breached” (Genesis 7:11). [“Lord, You save man and animal”] (Psalms 36:7) – when I remembered him, it was not him alone that I remembered, but rather, him and everything that was in the ark with him. That is what is written: “God remembered Noah and all the beasts…”",
            "Another interpretation: That is what is written: “There was a small city, with few men in it, and a great king came against it [and surrounded it]” (Ecclesiastes 9:14). “A small city” – that is the world. “With few men in it” – that is the generation of the Flood. “And a great king came against it and surrounded it” – that is the Holy One blessed be He. “And built great siege works against it” (Ecclesiastes 9:14) – He surrounded it and set ambushes [all around].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He inundated the entire world.</i> “A poor and wise man was found in it” (Ecclesiastes 9:15) – that is Noah. “And he saved the city in his wisdom” (Ecclesiastes 9:15) – “he offered up burnt offerings on the altar” (Genesis 8:20). “But no person remembered that poor man” (Ecclesiastes 9:15) – the Holy One blessed be He said [to those people]: It is you who do not remember him, but I do remember him: “God remembered Noah.”",

Some say it was about the passage concerning vows, and some say it was about the passage concerning libations. [Afterwards,] they took their leave of him, but they stayed over for another day. They said: ‘We must go take leave of him a second time.’ One of them expounded and said to the others: ‘It was already written: “Joshua blessed them and sent them off, and they went to their tents” (Joshua 22:6). Why, then, does the verse state [further]: “Also when Joshua sent them off to their tents, he blessed them”? (Joshua 22:7). The explanation is that while Israel was conquering and dividing the land, the tribes of Reuben and Gad were together with them, and spent fourteen years in this manner. They took their leave of Joshua to go back to their tents. But they stayed over there a few more days, and went back to take leave of him a second time. That is why it is stated: “Also when [Joshua] sent them off…”’ Rabbi Yudan said: ‘The tribes of Reuben and Gad were members of Joshua’s entourage, so he accompanied them to the Jordan.

That is what is written: “He said to them, saying: Return to your tents with much wealth, with very much livestock, with silver, with gold, with bronze, with iron, and with very many garments. Divide the spoils of your enemies with your brethren”’ (Joshua 22:8). <br>Another one expounded: It was already written [concerning Solomon]: “On the eighth day he sent the people away, and they blessed the king” (I Kings 8:66). Why, then, is it stated [further]: “On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away”? (II Chronicles 7:10). The explanation is that they took their leave of him, but then they stayed there several additional days, so they went back to take their leave of him a second time. That is why it is stated: “On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away.” <br>Rabbi Levi said: It is written: “For they engaged in the dedication of the altar for seven days, and then the festival was seven days” (II Chronicles 7:9) – and you cannot have seven days before the festival [Sukkot] that do not include a Shabbat and Yom Kippur. During those seven days the people of Israel were eating, drinking, rejoicing, and kindling lamps. Afterwards they then regretted the matter. They said: ‘Perhaps we have a sin on our hands for having desecrated Shabbat and for not fasting on Yom Kippur.’ In order to reassure them that the Holy One blessed be He approved of their actions, a Divine Voice emerged and said to them: ‘All of you are among the participants in the World to Come.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And this was the second blessing mentioned in the verse.</i> And the latter blessing was greater than the former, as it is stated: “And they went to their tents joyful and good-hearted” (I Kings 8:66). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: “Joyful” – that they found their wives ritually pure; “and good-hearted” – that they [their wives] became pregnant with males. Rabbi Levi said: [The joy was because] a Divine Voice emerged and said to them: ‘All of you are among the participants in the World to Come.’ <br>Another one of them expounded: It was already written [regarding Elisha]: “She departed from him” (II Kings 4:5). Why, then, does the verse state [afterwards]: “She came and told the man of God”? (II Kings 4:7).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">She had already spoken to Elisha and left him. Why did she return to him, and what did she tell him?</i> The explanation is that: “the oil had stopped<i> </i>[<i>vayaamod</i>]”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Vayaamod</i> literally means “it stood.” It is usually understood here to mean that it stood still, ceasing to flow.</i> (II Kings 4:6) – [what happened was] that the price of oil had [miraculously] risen<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And it was in this sense that the oil had “stood.”</i> and she came to ask whether she should sell it or not sell it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">She wanted to know if the miraculous price rise would continue.</i> The latter blessing was greater than the former. “You and your sons will live on the remainder” (II Kings 4:7) – until the dead will come to life.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When he said “will live” he meant that it would suffice until the time when all men will return to life.</i> <br>When he [Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai] saw that they were men of refinement, he sent a pair of Torah scholars to accompany them, to find out what they would expound on the way. One of them expounded: It was already written: “The angel of God that was going before the camp of Israel traveled and went behind them” (Exodus 14:19). Why, then, does the verse state [further]: “And the pillar of cloud traveled from before them and stood behind them”? (Exodus 14:19). The explanation is that the same attribute of strict justice that had been extended against Israel,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Represented by the pillar of cloud.</i> the Holy One blessed be He redirected it against the Egyptians.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is here that the parable of the father with the hot metal tool applies.</i> <br>Another expounded: It is written: “The rainbow shall be in the cloud, and I will see it, to remember the eternal covenant between God and every living creature…” – “between God” – this is the supernal attribute of strict justice; “and every living creature” – this is the attribute of justice below. The supernal attribute of justice is severe; the attribute of justice below is lenient.  <br>One of them expounded: One verse says: “All objects cannot equal it [Torah wisdom]” (Proverbs 8:11), and one verse says: “All of your objects cannot equal it” (Proverbs 3:15). “[All] objects” – these are mitzvot and good deeds. “Your objects” – these are precious stones and pearls. Rabbi Aḥa in the name of Rabbi Tanḥum bar Rabbi Ḥiyya: [God said:] ‘My objects and your objects cannot equal it; “Rather, let the one who glories, glory in this: perceiving and knowing Me, for I am the Lord who performs kindness, justice…”’ (Jeremiah 9:23). <br>Artevan sent a priceless jewel to our Rabbi.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, the patriarch.</i> He said to him: ‘Send me a valuable object that is as valuable as this.’ He sent him a <i>mezuza</i>.

Rabbi Levi and the Rabbis, Rabbi Levi said: One’s wife would be pregnant for [just] three days [before giving birth], as <i>nakhon </i>is stated here, and elsewhere, it is stated: “Be prepared [<i>nekhonim</i>] [for three days]” (Exodus 19:15) – just as <i>nakhon </i>stated there refers to three days, so, too, <i>nakhon </i>that is stated here refers to three days. The Rabbis say: One’s wife would be pregnant for [just] one day and give birth, as <i>nakhon </i>is stated here, and <i>nakhon </i>is stated elsewhere: “Be prepared [<i>nakhon</i>] for the morrow” (Exodus 34:2) – just as <i>nakhon </i>there refers to one day, so, too, here it refers to one day. “And their descendants are before their eyes” – as they would [live to] see their children and their children’s children.  <br>“They send out their youngsters [<i>avileihem</i>] like a flock” – Rabbi Levi said: In Arabia they call a baby <i>avila</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And this is how we know that <i>avileihem</i> means “youngsters.”</i> “And their children dance” (Job 21:11) – in the manner of demons, as it says: “And demons will dance there” (Isaiah 13:21).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They were able to dance with extraordinary robustness and intensity, as demons dance.</i> <br>When one of them would give birth during the day, she would say to her [newborn] son: ;Go out and get me a flint rock to sever your umbilical cord.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Newborns were able to walk and fully function as soon as they were born, “like flock.”</i> [If she gave birth] at night, she would say to her son: ‘Go out and kindle a lamp for me with which to sever your umbilical cord.’ There was an incident involving a certain woman who gave birth at night.

But these, [the generation of the Dispersion], they loved each other, as it is stated: “The entire earth was of one language,” that is why a remnant of them remained. <br>Rabbi says: Great is peace, as even if Israel engages in idol worship, but there is peace among them, the Omnipresent says: ‘It is, as it were, that I have no power over them, since there is peace among them,’ as it is stated: “Ephraim is attached to idols, leave him” (Hosea 4:17).

And if you object that Abraham did not act immediately, and did not rejoice over the words of the Omnipresent, and [you ask] why did he not depart [at once]? It is because he had not yet been permitted, but once he was permitted: “Abram went as the Lord had spoken to him, and Lot went with him” (Genesis 12:4). <br>Rabbi Levi said: When Abraham was traveling through Aram Naharayim and Aram Naḥor, he saw them eating, drinking, and reveling.

Why did he not reveal it [his destination] to him? It was to make it more endearing to him, and to give him a reward for each and every stride. That is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan [elsewhere], as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: “He said: Take your son, your only one” (Genesis 20:2).

Why did He not reveal it to him [immediately]? It was to make it more endearing to him, and to give him a reward for each and every statement. <br> As Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: The Holy One blessed be He withholds [information at first] and keeps the eyes of the righteous directed toward Him, and only then does he reveal to them the particulars of the matter. So: “to the land that I will show you”; “upon one of the mountains that I will say to you” (Genesis 22:2); “proclaim the proclamation that I speak to you” (Jonah 3:2); “Go out to the valley and I will speak to you there” (Ezekiel 3:22).",

They said: ‘The king found his gem.’ So, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘What purpose was there for Me to trace the lineage of Shem, Arpakhshad, Shelaḥ, Ever, Peleg, Re’u, Serug, Naḥor, Teraḥ?

[It was as Jeremiah prophesied:] “I saw the land, and behold, it is emptiness and disorder” (Jeremiah 4:23). This is analogous to a king who sent a proclamation throughout the province.

[Haman’s decree:] “to destroy, to kill, and to eliminate [all the Jews]” (Esther 3:13). This is analogous to a king who had a certain vineyard, and three enemies rose up against it. The first began picking unripe grapes, the second began cutting off the clusters, and the third began uprooting the vines. So too, Pharaoh [said]: “Every son who is born you shall cast into the Nile…” (Exodus 1:22).

Haman sought to uproot the entire vineyard, as it is stated: “To destroy, to kill, and to eliminate all the Jews…” (Esther 3:13). When everyone saw that it was so, they began crying out: ‘Woe [<i>vay</i>].’ That is what is written: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] in the days of Aḥashverosh.” <br>Rabbi Shimon bar Abba in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Everywhere that <i>vayhi</i> is stated it refers either to trouble or to joy; if the context is one of trouble, it is unparalleled trouble, if it is one of joy, it is unparalleled joy.

He said to them: That was nevertheless not complete joy, as everything that was created on the first day is destined to wear away, as it is stated: “For the heavens will vanish like smoke and the earth will wear away like a garment” (Isaiah 51:6). <br>They raised an objection to him: But is it not written: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] evening and it was morning, a second day” (Genesis 1:8), “…a third day” (Genesis 1:13), “a fourth day” (Genesis 1:19), “a fifth day” (Genesis 1:23), “a sixth day”?

It is by the merit of circumcision, as it is stated: “The secret [<i>sod</i>] of the Lord is [revealed] to those who fear Him.”  <br>The Holy One blessed be He said to Abraham: ‘It is sufficient for the disciple to be similar to his master.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a new interpretation of: “The secret [<i>sod</i>] of the Lord is [revealed] to those who fear Him, and His covenant to inform them,” interpreting <i>sod</i> as inner circle.

What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He extended his hand and held it with him as Abraham was cutting, as it is stated: “You are the Lord the God, who chose Abram […and made the covenant with him]” (Nehemiah 9:7–8). “And He made the covenant to him” is not written here, but rather, “made with him.” This teaches that the Holy One blessed be He was holding on to him. <br>Another matter, “the secret of the Lord is [revealed] to those who fear Him.” At first, “the secret of the Lord” was [revealed] to those who fear Him.

That is what is written: “In thoughts from visions of the night,” (Job 4:13) “a matter stealthily came to me” (Job 4:12). What is the difference between the prophets of Israel and the prophets of the nations of the world? Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa and the Rabbis, Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said: This is analogous to a king who was situated with his friend in a great hall, with a curtain placed between them. Whenever he would seek to speak with his friend, he would draw the curtain back and speak with him. But for the prophets of the nations of the world, He does not draw it back, but, rather, he speaks to them from behind the curtain. The Rabbis say: It is analogous to a king who had a wife and a concubine. When he goes to his wife, he goes publicly, but when he goes to his maidservant [the concubine], he goes clandestinely. So, the Holy One blessed be He appears to those of the nations of the world only at night: “God came to Bilam at night” (Numbers 22:20); “God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream of the night” (Genesis 31:24); “God came to Avimelekh in a dream at night.” <br>What is the difference between the prophets of Israel and the prophets of the nations of the world? Rabbi Ḥama ben Rabbi Ḥanina and Rabbi Yisakhar of Kefar Mandi, Rabbi Ḥama said: The Holy One blessed be He appears to the prophets of the nations of the world only with a truncated form of speech, as it says: “God happened [<i>vayikar</i>] upon Bilam” (Numbers 23:4).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash views the word <i>vayikar</i> as a truncated version of the word <i>vayikra</i> – He called, which is what is typically employed with regard to the prophets of Israel.</i> Rabbi Yisakhar of Kefar Mandi said: This expression <i>vayikar</i> is nothing other than an expression of impurity, just as it says: “If there will be among you a man who will not be pure due to an…incident [<i>mikre</i>]” (Deuteronomy 23:11). But to the prophets of Israel [He appears] with a complete form of speech, with an expression of endearment, with an expression of sanctity, with the expression with which the ministering angels laud Him, as it is stated: “And this one called to that one and said: Holy, …” (Isaiah 6:3). Rabbi Yosei ben Beiva said: “The Lord is far from the wicked” (Proverbs 15:29) – this refers to the prophets of the nations of the world; “and He hears the prayer of the righteous” (Proverbs 15:29) – this refers to the prophets of Israel. <br>“God came to Avimelekh in a dream at night, and He said to him: Behold, you will die because of the woman…” – from here we learn that there is no forewarning [necessary] for Noahides.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Noahides are all people in the world other than Jews.

You have taken him up and fulfilled My words, now take him down.’ <Variant reading: They said a parable; this is analogous to a king who said to his friend: ‘Bring your son up to [eat at] my table.’ He brought him to him, knife in hand. The king said: ‘Did I say to bring him up in order to eat him? I said: Bring him up out of affection for him.’ That is what is written: “[They built altars on which to burn their sons and daughters in fire, something that I never commanded] and which never entered my mind” (Jeremiah 19:5) – this refers to Isaac.>",

Rabbi Yudan said: “After” all of Israel’s actions in which they become caught up in transgressions and encounter problems, ultimately they will be rescued through the ram’s horn, as it is stated: “The Lord God will sound the shofar…[the Lord of Hosts will protect them…]” (Zechariah 9:14–15). Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: “After” many generations, Israel will become caught up in transgressions and become entangled with misfortunes, ultimately they will be rescued through the ram’s horn, as it is stated: “The Lord God will sound the shofar” (Zechariah 9:14). Rabbi Ḥanina bar Rabbi Yitzḥak said: All the days of the year, the people of Israel are caught up in transgressions and become entangled in misfortunes, and on Rosh Hashanah they take a shofar and sound it, and they are remembered before the Holy One blessed be He and He forgives them, as it is stated: “The Lord God will sound the shofar” (Zechariah 9:14). <br>Rabbi Levi said: Because Abraham saw the ram freeing itself from one thicket and going and becoming entangled in another thicket, the Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘So, too, your descendants are destined to become entangled in the [four] kingdoms,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Daniel chapters 2 and 8.</i> [going] from [being subjugated by] Babylon to Medea, from Medea to Greece, and from Greece to Edom.

(Genesis 22:2). But, God forbid, I did not do so. Rather, I suppressed my mercy to fulfill Your will. May it be Your will, Lord our God, when Isaac’s descendants encounter transgressions and wicked deeds, may this binding [of Isaac] be remembered for them, and may You become filled with mercy towards them.’ <br>Abraham called it [Jerusalem] Yireh, as it is stated: “Abraham called the name of that place The Lord will see [<i>yireh</i>].” Shem called it Shalem, as it is stated: “Malki Tzedek<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He is identified with Shem.</i> king of Shalem” (Genesis 14:18). The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘If I call it <i>Yireh</i>, as Abraham called it, Shem, a righteous man, will have a complaint. If I call it Shalem, Abraham, a righteous man, will have a complaint. Instead, I shall call it Yerushalayim, as both of them called it, – <i>Yireh</i>, Shalem – Yerushalayim.’ <br>Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Ḥelbo: While it was still called Shalem, the Holy One blessed be made Himself a provisional booth [<i>sukka</i>] and He would pray in it, as it is stated: “His abode [<i>sukko</i>] was in Shalem, His dwelling place in Zion” (Psalms 76:3). What did He say [in His prayers?] May it be My will that I will see construction of My [permanent] house [here]. <br>Another interpretation, this teaches that the Holy One blessed be He showed him [Abraham] the [future] Temple as built,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew text in most editions has “destroyed, then built, then destroyed, then built,” but this is a textual error and the extra words should be deleted (<i>Yefeh Toar</i>). </i> then destroyed and then built, as it is stated: “The name of that place The Lord will see [<i>yireh</i>]” – that refers to the Temple built, just as it says: “Three times in the year [all your males] shall appear [<i>yeraeh</i>]” (Deuteronomy 16:16). “As it is said to this day: On the mount where the Lord” – that refers to the Temple destroyed, as it is stated: “On Mount Zion that is desolate” (Lamentations 5:18). “The Lord will be seen” – [that refers to the Temple] built and perfected in the future, like the matter that is stated: “For the Lord has rebuilt Zion and is seen in His glory” (Psalms 102:17).",

He [Abraham] said to Him: ‘Take an oath to me that you will not test me again from now on, nor Isaac my son.’ This is analogous to one who jumped from the bank of a stream, over the current, and took his son along with him as he jumped.  <br>Another interpretation, what need was there for this oath? Rabbi Ḥama ben Rabbi Ḥanina: He said to Him: ‘Take an oath to me that You will not test me again from now on.’ This is analogous to a king who was married to a noblewoman. She bore for him a first son, and he divorced her. [He remarried her and she bore him] a second son, and he divorced her, a third son, and he divorced her. When she bore a tenth son for him, all of them gathered together and said to him: ‘Take an oath to us that you will not divorce our mother from now on.’ So, too, when Abraham our patriarch was tested with the tenth ordeal,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The binding of Isaac was the tenth and last of Abraham’s tests (see Mishna <i>Avot</i> 5:3).</i> he said to Him: ‘Take an oath to me that You will not test me again from now on.’ <br>Rabbi Ḥanin said: “That because you have done this matter” – this was the tenth test, and yet you say [when reading the verse]: “That because you have done this matter”? The explanation is that this final ordeal is equal in importance to all the others combined, as had he not accepted it upon himself, he would have lost everything <variant reading: Everything that he had done.> <br><b>“For that I will bless you and multiply your descendants as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand that is upon the seashore, and your descendants will inherit the gate of their enemies” (Genesis 22:17).</b> <br>“For that I will bless you [<i>varekh avarekhekha</i>]…” – [the doubling of the verb indicates] a blessing for the father, a blessing for the son. “And multiply [<i>veharba arbeh</i>]” – multiplication for the father, multiplication for the son. <br>“And your descendants will inherit the gate of their enemies” – this refers to Tarmod.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The people of Tarmod were implacable enemies of the Jews.</i> Fortunate are all those who will witness the downfall of Tarmod, as it was a partner to the two destructions [of the Temples].

That is why I do not want it to depart from my children forever.’ <br>Rabbi Ḥanina said: He sent him at night<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Abraham did not bring Isaac back with him, but told him to travel later on, at night.</i> due to the evil eye.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He did this so that the evil eye would not affect Isaac in the wake of the miracle that was performed on his behalf.</i> [Similarly, we find] that from the moment that Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya emerged from the fiery furnace, their names are not mentioned again.

Rabbi Yehuda said: Anyone in whose regard “expiring” is stated, died of intestinal illness. <br>It is written: “Might and grandeur are her clothing, [and she rejoices at the final day]” (Proverbs 31:25) – the entire reward granted to the righteous is prepared for them in the future, and the Holy One blessed be He shows them the granting of the reward that he is destined to give them in the future while they are still in this world, and their souls are satisfied [with what they have seen], and they go to sleep, [i.e., expire peacefully]. <br>Rabbi Elazar said: This is analogous to a feast that the king prepared. He invited the guests [beforehand] and showed them what they would be eating and drinking. Their souls were satisfied, and they went to sleep [with this feeling of satisfaction].

We learned that prophets are called angels [<i>malakhim</i>], as it is written: “Haggai, the messenger [<i>malakh</i>] of the Lord, on a mission from the Lord, spoke to the people” (Haggai 1:13). “And behold, the angels of God” – this is Moses and Aaron. “Ascending” – “Moses ascended to God” (Exodus 19:3). “And descending” – this is Moses “Moses descended” (Exodus 19:14). “Behold, the Lord was standing over him” (Genesis 28:13) – “the Lord descended upon Mount Sinai to the top of the mountain” (Exodus 19:20). <br>Rabbi Salmoni said in the name of Reish Lakish: He [God] showed him [Jacob] a three-legged Throne of Glory. Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: [God told Jacob] ‘You are the third leg.’ This is his opinion, as Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: “For the portion of the Lord is His people; Jacob, the allotment of His inheritance” (Deuteronomy 32:9) – just as a rope is not woven with fewer than three, so, the patriarchs are no fewer than three. <br>Rabbi Berekhya said: He showed him the world and one-third of the world. “Ascending [<i>olim</i>]” – are no fewer than two; “and descending” – two. From where is it derived that an angel is one-third of the world? It is as it is stated: “His body was like beryl [<i>tarshish</i>], his face like the appearance of lightning, his eyes like torches of fire, his arms and his legs like burnished bronze” (Daniel 10:6).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Sea of Tarshish is two thousand cubits and the area of the world is six thousand cubits, meaning that the body of each angel was one-third of the world.

That is what is written: “I will reckon with Bel in Babylon, and I will remove what it swallowed from its mouth” (Jeremiah 51:44). Nebuchadnezzar had a serpent and it would swallow everything that was cast before it. Nebuchadnezzar said to Daniel: ‘How great is its power, in that it swallows everything that is cast before it.' Daniel said to him: 'Give me permission and I will exhaust it.' He gave permission. What did he do? He took straw, concealed nails in it, cast it before it, and the nails perforated its innards. That is what is written: “I will remove what it swallowed from its mouth.”",
            "Another matter, “behold, a ladder” (Genesis 28:12) – this is Nebuchadnezzar’s dream: “Behold, a giant image was set on the earth…its radiance surpassing, stood before you” (Daniel 2:31). “Its top was reaching the heavens” (Genesis 28:12)  – “the image, which was great” (Daniel 2:31). “Behold, the angels of God” (Genesis 28:12) – two ascending and two descending; these are the angels of the four kingdoms, whose dominion ends with them. “Ascending and descending” (Genesis 28:12) – “descending and ascending” is not written, but rather, “ascending and descending.” They ascend; it will be an ascent for them, but each of them is lower than its predecessor. It is written: “That image, its head was of [fine] gold, [its breast and its arms of silver]…” (Daniel 2:32). Babylon was above them all, as it is written: “You are the head of gold” (Daniel 2:38). And it is written: “After you, will arise another kingdom, inferior to yours” (Daniel 2:39), and it is written: “And afterward a third kingdom, of bronze” (Daniel 2:39). And it is written at the end: “The toes of the feet, some of them iron, and some of them earthenware – part of the kingdom will be strong, and some of it will be brittle” (Daniel 2:42). “Behold, the Lord was standing over him” (Genesis 28:13) – it is written: “In the days of those kings, the God of the heavens will establish a kingdom that will be eternal…” (Daniel 2:44)."

            "Another matter, “Jacob sent messengers” (Genesis 32:4) – this is what was said with divine spirit by Solomon king of Israel: “Blessings upon the head of the righteous, and villainy will cover the mouth of the wicked” (Proverbs 10:6). Corresponding to whom did Solomon state this verse? He said it corresponding only to Jacob and Esau. “Blessings upon the head of the righteous” – this is Jacob. “And villainy will cover the mouth of the wicked” – this is the wicked Esau. Happy are the righteous who are blessed on earth and are blessed in Heaven, and this is appropriate, as it is stated: “So that one who blesses himself in the land will bless himself by the God of faithfulness” (Isaiah 65:16) – to inform you that all the blessings that Isaac blessed Jacob, corresponding to those, the Holy One blessed be He blessed him from on High. Isaac said to him: “God will give you from the dew of the heavens…” (Genesis 27:28), and the Holy One blessed be He blessed him with dew and rain, as it is stated: “The remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples like dew [from the Lord, like raindrops]” (Micah 5:6). Isaac said to him: “and from the fats of the earth” (Genesis 27:28), and the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “He will give rain for your seeds with which you will sow the ground” (Isaiah 30:23). Isaac said: “Peoples will serve you” (Genesis 27:29), and the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Kings will be your caregivers, and their princesses, your wet nurses” (Isaiah 49:23). Isaac said: “You will be a lord to your brethren” (Genesis 27:29), and the Holy One blessed be He said to him through Moses: “To place you uppermost over all the nations” (Deuteronomy 26:19). You learned that all the blessings that Isaac blessed Jacob from below, corresponding to that, the Holy One blessed be He blessed him from on High. <br>His mother Rebecca, too, blessed him corresponding to them, as it is stated: “He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High” (Psalms 91:1). So she said to him: “For He will charge His angels on your behalf [to guard you in all your ways]” (Psalms 91:11). When she said that to him in that language, the Divine Spirit blessed Him: “When he calls upon Me, I will answer him…” (Psalms 91:15). Once the Holy One blessed be He blessed him, why did his father bless him again, as it is stated: “Isaac summoned Jacob, and he blessed him”? (Genesis 28:1). It is, rather, that Isaac saw through the divine spirit that his descendants were destined to be exiled among the nations. He said to him: ‘Come and I will bless you blessings of exile, so that the Holy One blessed be He will return to you and gather you from the midst of the exiles.’ What are the blessings? “In six troubles He will deliver you, and in seven, no harm will touch you. …From the scourge of the tongue you will be hidden, and you will not fear pillage when it comes. At pillage and hunger you will laugh, and from the beasts of the earth, do not fear” (Job 5:19, 21–22). That is why it is stated: “Blessings upon the head of the righteous.”",
            "Another matter, “Jacob sent” (Genesis 32: 4) – “Lord, do not grant the desires of the wicked. Do not bring their scheme to fruition [<i>zemamo al tafek</i>]; may they depart, Selah” (Psalms 140:9). He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, do not realize for wicked Esau the thoughts of his heart.’ What is “<i>zemamo al tafek</i>”? He said before him: ‘Master of the universe: Place a muzzle for wicked Esau so that his satisfaction will not be complete.’ What muzzle did the Holy One blessed be He make for wicked Esau? Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: ‘These are the residents of Barbary and the residents of Germany, whom the Edomites<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to Rome, which was being attacked by Germanic tribes.</i> fear.’ <br>Another matter, “do not grant the desires of the wicked” – he said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, just as it was Laban’s intent to harm me, but you did not allow him to do so, so, too, regarding the thoughts of my brother Esau who is thinking to kill me, thwart his evil.’ He was one of three people who thought [to do] evil, but they were unsuccessful – Esau, Yerovam, and Haman. Esau, as it is stated: “Esau said in his heart” (Genesis 27:41). Regarding Yerovam it is written: “Yerovam said in his heart” (I Kings 12:26). Regarding Haman it is written: “Haman said in his heart” (Esther 6:6). <br>What is “Esau said in his heart”? He said: ‘Cain killed his brother, and the Omnipresent did nothing to him. Ultimately, he [Adam] begot additional sons, and they inherited the world with him. But I, I will kill Isaac my father first, and then I will kill Jacob my brother, and I will inherit the world alone,’ as it is stated: “Let the days of mourning for my father approach” (Genesis 27:41) – he said: ‘First, I will hasten the mourning for Father, and then: “I will kill my brother Jacob”’ (Genesis 27:41). But the Holy One blessed be He did not enable him to do so. That is why it is stated: “Do not grant the desires of the wicked.”",
            "Another matter, “Jacob sent messengers” (Genesis 32:4) – come and see what is written before this matter: “Jacob said, when he saw them: [This is the camp of God]” (Genesis 32:3). How many were in a camp of God? Two thousand myriads of ministering angels, as it is stated: “The chariots of God are myriad, thousands upon thousands of companies. My Lord is among them, at Sinai, in holiness” (Psalms 68:18). “He called the name of that place Maḥanayim” (Genesis 32:3). Why were there two camps? It teaches that they gave Jacob four thousand myriads of ministering angels and they appeared to him like a king’s armies, some of whom were clad in iron, some of whom were on horseback, and some of whom were sitting in chariots. He [Esau] encountered those clad in iron. He said to them: ‘With whom are you affiliated?’ They said to him: ‘With Jacob.’ He encountered those on horseback. He said to them: ‘With whom are you affiliated?’ They said to him: ‘With Jacob.’ He encountered those in chariots. He said to them: ‘With whom are you affiliated?’ They said to him: ‘With Jacob,’ as it is stated: “He said: For whom do you intend this entire camp that I met?” (Genesis 33:8). Jacob, too, would mention to Esau the name of the Holy One blessed be He, to scare him and to frighten him, as it is stated: “As I have seen your face, as the sight of the face of angels [<i>elohim</i>]” (Genesis 33:10). To what is this matter analogous? It is to one who invited another to a meal, and he<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The guest.</i> ascertained that he sought to kill him. He [the guest] said: ‘The taste of this dish is like the taste of a dish that I tasted in the king’s palace.’ He said: ‘He knows the king?’ He was afraid and did not kill him. The same is true of Jacob. When he said to Esau: “As I have seen your face, as the sight of the face of angels [<i>elohim</i>]” wicked Esau said: ‘The Holy One blessed be He brought him to all this glory? I will no longer be able to overcome him.’",
            "Another matter, “Jacob sent messengers” (Genesis 32:4) – why did he send messengers to him? Rather, this is what he said: ‘I will send him messengers; maybe he will repent.’ He said to them: ‘Say to him: Do not say Jacob remains as he was when he departed from his father’s house, as it is stated: “For with my staff I crossed…” (Genesis 32:11), “He commanded him, saying” (Genesis 32:5) – say to him: Do not say that when he departed from you he took anything from the household property. Rather, [tell him that] I acquired all these as my wages, through my effort,’ as it is stated: “And now I have become two camps” (Genesis 32:11). <br>At the moment that Jacob called Esau “my lord,” the Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘You abased yourself and called him “my lord” eight times. As you live, I will establish eight kings from his descendants before your descendants,’ as it is stated: “These are the kings who reigned [in the land of Edom, before the reign of a king for the children of Israel]” (Genesis 36:31).  <br>He [Jacob] said to them [the messengers]: ‘Say to him: If you are prepared for peace, I am with you, and if for war, I am with you. I have warriors, courageous and strong, who say something before the Holy One blessed be He, and He performs their will on their behalf,’ as it is stated: “He performs the will of those who fear him” (Psalms 145:19). That is why David came to give praise and acclaim before the Holy One blessed be He, who helped him when he fled from Saul, as it is stated: “For behold, the wicked bend the bow” (Psalms 11:2). What is written thereafter? “If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous man do?” (Psalms 11:3). He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, if You had distanced and forsook Jacob, who is the pillar and foundation of the world, as it is stated: “The righteous man is the foundation of the world” (Proverbs 10:25), “what can the righteous man do?”’ Regarding that moment, it is stated: “Some on chariots and some on horses, but we invoke the name of the Lord our God” (Psalms 20:8).",
            "Another matter, “I have oxen [<i>shor</i>], and donkeys [<i>vaḥamor</i>]” (Genesis 32:6). <i>Shor</i> – this is Joseph, as it is stated: “A firstborn bull [<i>shoro</i>] is his majesty” (Deuteronomy 33:17). <i>Vaḥamor</i> – this is Issachar, as it is written: “Issachar is a strong-boned donkey [<i>ḥamor</i>] (Genesis 49:14).

Issachar’s descendants know what the Holy One blessed be He does in His world, as it is stated: “From the children of Issachar, possessors of understanding of the times, to know what Israel should do; their leaders were two hundred” (I Chronicles 12:33). “Flocks [<i>tzon</i>]” – this is Israel, as it is stated: “You, My flock [<i>tzoni</i>], flock of My pasture, you are man” (Ezekiel 34:31). “And slaves [<i>ve’eved</i>]” – this is David, as it is stated: “I am your servant [<i>avdekha</i>] son of your maidservant” (Psalms 116:16). “And maidservants [<i>veshifḥa</i>]” – this is Avigayil, as it is stated: “Here is your handmaiden as a maidservant [<i>leshifḥa</i>]” (I Samuel 25:41). <br><b>“Jacob was very frightened and distressed. He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks, and the cattle, and the camels, into two camps” (Genesis 32:8).</b> <br>At that moment, those messengers went to Esau and saw armed warriors with him, and they came and told Jacob, as it is stated: “The messengers returned to Jacob, saying: We came to your brother, to Esau” (Genesis 32:7). What is: “And four hundred men with him”? Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: Four hundred kings wearing crowns. Some say: Four hundred prefects were with him. Rabbi Yanai said: Four hundred generals were with him.

The chosen of the patriarchs – this is Jacob, as it is stated: “For the Lord has chosen Jacob for Himself” (Psalms 135:4). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Behold, I am with you” (Genesis 28:15), but ultimately he was afraid, as it is stated: “Jacob was…frightened.” The chosen of the prophets – this is Moses, as it is stated; “Were it not for Moses, His chosen” (Psalms 106:23).

He said to them: ‘You have forgotten what He said to you: “So said the Lord: If the heavens above can be measured [and the foundations of the earth below probed, I too will spurn all the descendants of Israel because of everything that they did]” (Jeremiah 31:36) – if you see the heavens fall and the earth collapse.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Just as the heavens cannot be measured and the foundations of the earth probed, so I will never spurn you.</i> Should you not have learned from the spread of the heavens and the earth?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">You should have learned from the fact that the heaven and earth did not collapse, but rather, the heavens remained spread over the earth.</i> Instead, “you feared continuously all day”’ (Isaiah 51:13).",

From what is written: “For He will charge His angels on your behalf to guard you” (Psalms 91:11) – that is, the guarded is greater than the guard. Rabbi Yehuda says: Who is greater, the carrier or the carried? From what is written: “They will carry you on their palms” (Psalms 91:12) – that is, the carried is greater than the carrier. Rabbi Shimon said: From what is written: “He said: Release me” – that is, the one releasing is greater than the one released.",

That is what is written: “God said to him: Your name is Jacob; [your name shall no longer be called Jacob]” (Genesis 35:10) – “no [more] shall Jacob be said.” <br>Bar Kappara said: Anyone who calls Abraham Abram violates a positive commandment. Rabbi Levi said: A positive commandment and a prohibition. “[Your name] shall no longer be called [Abram]” (Genesis 17:5) – a prohibition; “but your name shall be Abraham” (Genesis 17:5) – a positive commandment. And yet the members of the Great Assembly called him Abram, as it is written: “You are the Lord God who chose Abram…”?

It is taught: It is not that the name of Jacob will be uprooted. Rather, “but Israel shall be your name” (Genesis 35:10) – Israel will be primary and Jacob secondary. Rabbi Zechariah in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: In any case: Your name is Jacob… “but Israel shall be your name” (Genesis 35:10) – Jacob is primary, and Israel is in addition to it.  <br>“For you have striven with God and with men, and you have prevailed” – you have wrestled with the heavenly and prevailed over them, and with the earthly and prevailed over them. With the heavenly – this is the angel. Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: He was Esau’s ministering angel. This is what he said to him: “For therefore, I have seen your face, as the sight of the face of angels [<i>penei elohim</i>]” (Genesis 33:10).

            "<b>“The sun rose for him as he passed Penuel, and he was limping from his hip” (Genesis 32:32).</b> <br>“The sun rose for him…” – Rabbi Berekhya said: For whom did the sun not rise? Rather, for him it is for his healing, but for others, light. <br>Rav Huna said in the name of Rav Aḥa: So, the sun was healing our patriarch Jacob and beating down on Esau and his chieftains. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘You are a paradigm for your descendants. Just as you, the sun was healing you and beating down on Esau and his chieftains, so, your descendants, the sun will heal them and beat down on the idolaters. Will heal them – “but the sun of righteousness will shine for you who fear My name, with healing in its rays” (Malachi 3:20); and will beat down on the idolaters – “behold, the day is coming, burning like a furnace […and all that do evil will be straw, and the day that is coming will set them ablaze]”’ (Malachi 3:19). <br>“And he was limping from his hip” – Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi was going up to Rome.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rome is identified as Edom (Esau).</i> When he reached Akko, Rabbi Ḥanina came out to greet him.

They said: Who will go and placate it? This fox said to them: ‘Come here, as I know three hundred parables, and I will placate him.’ They said to it: ‘Let us go.’ It walked a bit and stopped. They said: ‘What is this?’ It said to them: ‘I forgot one hundred.’ They said to it: ‘We will suffice even with two hundred.’ It walked a bit and stopped. They said: ‘What is this?’ It said to them: ‘I forgot one hundred more.’ They said to it: ‘We will suffice even with one hundred.’ When they reached there, it said: ‘I forgot them all. Instead, let each and every one placate for itself.’ So, Jacob our patriarch; Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: [Initially Jacob said] I have the ability to pray.

            "<b>“He placed the maidservants and their children first, and Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph last” (Genesis 33:2).</b> <br>“He placed the maidservants and their children first” – this is to say: The farther back one is, the more he is beloved. <br><b>“He passed before them and prostrated himself earthward seven times, until he reached his brother” (Genesis 33:3).</b> <br>“He passed before them” – that is what is written: “As a father has mercy upon his son” (Psalms 103:13). Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: Like the most merciful of the patriarchs. Which is the most merciful of the patriarchs? Rabbi Yehuda said: This is Abraham. Abraham said: “Far be it from You to do a thing like this” (Genesis 18:25).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Abraham prayed to avert the destruction of Sodom.</i> Rabbi Levi said: Jacob – “he passed before them.” He said: It is preferable that he harm me and not them. <br>“And prostrated himself earthward seven times” – why seven?

He [Jacob] said to him [Esau]: ‘May you consider yourself as though you are situated behind seven partitions and sitting and judging, and I am being judged before you, and you are filled with mercy upon me.’ <br>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Yitzḥak said: He did not cease prostrating and progressing, prostrating and progressing, until he introduced the attribute of justice into the attribute of mercy.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So that the attribute of justice would be subjected to the attribute of mercy. <br></i>",

Rather, it teaches that at that moment he was overcome with mercy and he kissed him with all his heart. Rabbi Yannai said to him: If so, why is it dotted over it? Rather, it teaches that he did not come to kiss him, but rather to bite him, and Jacob’s neck was transformed into marble and the teeth of that wicked one were blunted. Why does the verse state: “And they wept”? It is, rather, that this one wept over his neck, and that one wept over his teeth.

Every place where there was a corpse, it would rise, and they would move it and take it out of the city. And every place where there was no impurity, the mandrake would remain, and it would indicate which was a place of purity and which was a place of impurity until the time that they purified it from all the corpses. A certain Samaritan ignoramus saw him and said: ‘Will I not go and mock this Jewish elder?’ Some say it was in the wicker basket market, and some said it was the sack market. He took a corpse and concealed it in one of the streets that had been purified. In the morning, he went and said to them: ‘You said that ben Yoḥai had purified Tiberias.

You breached the fence of the Sages, and in your regard it is written: “One who breaches a fence, a serpent will bite him”’ (Ecclesiastes 10:8). He [Nakai the scribe] immediately became a pile of bones. <br>He [Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai] passed in the Beit Nekofa Valley.

With wanting – “All the nations will praise you, [as you will be a wanted land]” (Malachi 3:12). And we learn it from the portion of this wicked one: With cleaving – “his soul cleaved [to Dina daughter of Jacob]” (Genesis 34:3). With desiring – “The soul of my son Shekhem desires your daughter” (Genesis 34:8). With wanting – “because he wanted Jacob’s daughter” (Genesis 34:19).  <br>Rabbi Abba bar Elisha adds two more: With love and with speech. With love – “I have loved you” (Malachi 1:2).

And we learn it from the portion of this wicked one: With love – “he loved the young woman” (Genesis 34:3), with speech – “he spoke tenderly to [<i>al lev</i>] the young woman” (Genesis 34:3). Do you have a person who speaks to the heart [<i>al lev</i>]? It is, rather, matters that calm the heart.

            "Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon and Rabbi Ḥanin in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Anyone who begins a mitzva and does not complete it, buries his wife and his children. From whom do you derive this? It is from Judah. “Judah said to his brothers: What profit is it [if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?]” (Genesis 37:26). He should have borne him on his shoulder to his father. What did it cause for him? He buried his wife and his children. <br>Rav Huna in the name of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: Anyone who begins a mitzva and does not complete it, but another comes and completes it, it is attributed to the second one. That is what is written: “Joseph’s bones, which the children of Israel took up” (Joshua 24:32). Did Moses not take them up, as it is stated: “Moses took Joseph’s bones with him” (Exodus 13:19)? But since it was decreed upon him that he would not enter the land, and these [the children of Israel] tended to them, it is therefore attributed to them. <br>“Joseph’s bones…” (Joshua 24:32) – they analogize it; to what is the matter comparable? To robbers who entered a certain wine cellar. They took a particular jug and drank. The owner of the cellar peered at them. He said to them: ‘May it be pleasant for you, may it be enjoyable for you, may it be sweet for you. You drank the wine, restore the jug to its place.’ So, the Holy One blessed be He said to the tribes: ‘You sold Joseph. Restore his bones to their place.’ <br>Another matter: Joseph said to them: ‘To the place from which you abducted me, return me’ – “are your brothers not herding in Shekhem?” (Genesis 37:13).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This proves that the sale of Joseph took place in or around Shekhem. </i> That is what the children of Israel did: “Joseph’s bones, which the children of Israel took up from Egypt, they buried in Shekhem” (Joshua 24:32).",

The word mimeni, which can also mean “from me,” is interpreted to mean that Tamar’s full exoneration was achieved with assistance from the Divine Voice, or that God announced that all of these events were “from Me,” meaning guided by Divine providence (see Kohelet Rabba 10:16). </i> In the court of Solomon – “she is his mother” (I Kings 3:27).

Rabbi Berekhya said: A caravan would pass in Beersheba, and they would forsake the needs of the public and engage in their own business.

Why to that extent? “Above their jaws” (Hosea 11:4) – because of the words that they expressed with their jaws, as they said: “This is your god, Israel” (Exodus 32:8).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This was stated by the Israelites as they committed the sin of the Golden Calf. </i> But ultimately, “I leaned to them to provide food” (Hosea 11:4) – I provide them with many foods to eat; “There will be abundance of grain in the land” (Psalms 72:16). <br>Another matter, “with ropes of man I drew them [<i>emshakhem</i>]” (Hosea 11:4) – this is Joseph, [as it is stated]: “They pulled [<i>vayimshekhu</i>] and lifted Joseph from the pit” (Genesis 37:28). “With bonds of love” (Hosea 11:4) – “Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons” (Genesis 37:3). “I was for them like those who lift the yoke” (Hosea11:4) – as I elevated his enemies over him. Who was that? It was Potiphar’s wife. Why to that extent? “Above their jaws” (Hosea 11:4) – because of the words that he expressed with his jaws – “Joseph brought evil report of them to their father” (Genesis 37:2). But ultimately, “I leaned to them to provide food (Hosea 11:4) – an abundance of food.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Eventually, after his actions caused him to be brought down to Egypt, Joseph ended up providing food for his entire family, as well as for the entire population of Egypt and other lands. </i>",
            "Another matter, “Joseph was taken down to Egypt.” “Joseph was the ruler” (Genesis 42:6). “Joseph was taken down [<i>hurad</i>] to Egypt” – he ruled over them, just as it says: “He will rule [<i>veyerd</i>] from sea to sea” (Psalms 72:8). He subdued them, just as it says: “For he had dominion [<i>rodeh</i>] over the entire region across the River” (I Kings 5:4). He imposed relocation upon them,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Genesis 47:21. </i> just as it says: “He scraped it [<i>vayirdehu</i>] into his hands” (Judges 14:9).  <br>He caused Jacob our patriarch to descend [<i>horid</i>] to Egypt. Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon: This is analogous to a cow that they were pulling to the slaughterhouse, but it would not be pulled. What did they do to it? They pulled its offspring before it, and it was walking after it despite itself, and to its [ultimate] detriment. So, Jacob was supposed to descend to Egypt in chains and neck chains.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is because of the decree of enslavement in the Covenant between the Pieces (see Genesis 15:13).</i> The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Shall I take My firstborn son down [to Egypt] in disgrace? And if I introduce it into Pharaoh’s heart, would I not be taking him down [to Egypt] in public?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If I introduce it into Pharaoh’s heart to bring Jacob down to Egypt in an honorable fashion, the public nature of the spectacle of his leaving the Land of Israel would itself cause Jacob great discomfort (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> Instead, I will draw his son before him, and he will descend after him despite himself and to his [ultimate] detriment.’ He took down the Divine Presence with him. Rabbi Pinḥas said in the name of Rabbi Simon: From where do we derive that the Divine Presence descended with him? From what is written: “The Lord was with Joseph” (Genesis 39:2). <br>“To Egypt [<i>Mitzraima</i>]” – it is taught in the name of Rabbi Neḥemya: Any word that requires a <i>lamed </i>at its start, a <i>heh</i> [can be] placed at its end [instead]: <i>Sedoma</i>, <i>Se’ira</i>, <i>Mitzraima</i>, <i>Ḥarana</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>lamed</i> as a prefix or the <i>heh</i> as a suffix both mean “to.” These are examples where the verse uses the <i>heh</i> at the end of the name of the place, indicating “to Sodom” and the like. </i> But is it not written: “The wicked will return to the netherworld [<i>lishola</i>]”? (Psalms 9:18).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Lishola</i> has both a <i>lamed </i>at the start and a <i>heh </i>at the end.</i> Rabbi Abba bar Zavda said: [They will be sent] to the lowest compartment in the netherworld.",
            "“[Potiphar...an Egyptian man,] purchased him [from the Ishmaelites]” – those who were acquired were acquiring.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ishmaelites descend from Hagar, Sarah’s maidservant, and the Egyptians descend from Ḥam, of whom it is stated: “A slave of slaves he shall be to his brothers” (Genesis 9:25), and they were the ones purchasing and selling Joseph.</i> All slaves damage the household of their masters. But this one – “the Lord blessed the house of the Egyptian for Joseph’s sake” (Genesis 39:5). All slaves are suspected of robbery, but this one: “Joseph collected all the silver…[Joseph brought the silver to Pharoah’s house]” (Genesis 47:14). All slaves are suspected of licentiousness, but this one: “But he did not heed her” (Genesis 39:10). Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: All slaves, their master feeds <i>teruma </i>to their slaves, but this one fed his master <i>teruma</i>, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa said: Elazar took a wife from the daughters of Joseph.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joseph was married to Potiphar’s daughter, so Potiphar’s granddaughter married Elazar, the son of Aaron, and ate <i>teruma</i>.</i> <br>Potiphar is “Potifera” (Genesis 41:45). Potiphar – because he would fatten [<i>mefatem</i>] calves for idol worship. Potifera – because he would defecate [<i>pore’a atzmo</i>] for idol worship.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Defacation in front of the idol of Baal Peor was a form of its worship (see <i>Sanhedrin</i> 60b). </i> When the bull [<i>par</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joseph, who was likened to a bull; see Deuteronomy 33:17.</i> descended there, [Potiphar] became wealthy.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Translation follows <i>Matnot Kehuna</i>. Alternatively, he became an officer, or a eunuch. </i>  <br>“The official of [<i>seris</i>] Pharaoh” – he was castrated [<i>nistares</i>]. This teaches that [Potiphar] purchased [Joseph] only for intercourse, but the Holy One blessed be He castrated him. This is analogous to a she-bear that was killing its master’s children. He said: ‘Break its teeth.’ So, it teaches that [Potiphar] purchased him only for intercourse, and the Holy One blessed be He castrated him. That is what is written: “For the Lord loves justice [and does not forsake] His pious ones [<i>ḥasidav</i>]” (Psalms 37:28). <i>Ḥasido </i>is written.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>ḥasidav </i>is written with only one <i>vav</i>, such that it can be read <i>ḥasido</i>, “His pious one,” in singular. It should be noted however that the Masoretic text of Psalms actually has the word <i>ḥasidav</i> with two <i>vavs</i>. The midrash here cites a different tradition. Alternatively, in <i>Midrash Shmuel</i> the version of the text cites I Samuel 2:9 rather than Psalms, and in that verse the word in fact appears as <i>ḥasido</i>, with one <i>vav</i> (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> Who is that? It is Joseph. “They are guarded forever, while the seed of the wicked is cut off” (Psalms 37:28) – this teaches that [Potiphar] purchased him only for intercourse, and the Holy One blessed be He castrated him. <br>“Potiphar…an Egyptian man, purchased him [from [<i>miyad</i>] the Ishmaelites]” – a clever man. What was his cleverness? He said: In every place, a German sells a Cushite,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A white man sells a man of dark complexion (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>). </i> but here, a Cushite is selling a German? This is no slave. He said to them: ‘Bring me a guarantor,’ as the term “from [<i>miyad</i>]” is nothing other than a guarantor, just as it says: “I will guarantee him, [from me [<i>miyadi</i>] you can demand him]” (Genesis 43:9). That is why it says: “From [<i>miyad</i>] the Ishmaelites.”  <br>Rabbi Levi said: A slave purchased, the son of a maidservant sold, and a free man was a slave to both of them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Potiphar, the Egyptian, was a descendant of Canaan, who was cursed by Noah to be a slave (see Genesis 9:25). The Ishmaelites were sons of Hagar, described as a maidservant to Sarah (see Genesis 16:2). Joseph was, by birth, a free man. </i>",
            "<b>“The Lord was with Joseph, and he was a successful man, and he was in the house of his master, the Egyptian” (Genesis 39:2).</b> <br>“The Lord was with Joseph” – but with the rest of the tribes, He was not? Rabbi Yudan said: [This is analogous] to an animal driver, who had twelve animals laden with wine before him. One of them entered the shop of an idolater; he forsook the eleven and followed after it. They said to him: ‘Why do you forsake eleven [animals] and follow the one?’ He said to them: ‘These are in the public domain, and I am not concerned lest [the wine] become libation wine.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I am not concerned that an idolator will take the wine and use it for a libation to an idol, rendering it forbidden. Alternatively, this means – I am not concerned that an idolator will pick up the wine, rendering it forbidden by rabbinic law, as though it was poured as a libation to an idol. </i> So, these [Joseph’s brothers] were adults, and in their father’s domain, but this one was young and on his own. That is why, “the Lord was with Joseph.” <br>“He was a successful [<i>matzliaḥ</i>] man” – Rabbi Berekhya said: A leaping man,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He was able to surmount all obstacles.</i> just as it says: “They crossed [<i>vetzalḥu</i>] the Jordan before the king” (II Samuel 19:18). This is analogous to a she-bear that was standing in the street adorned with gems and precious stones. They said: ‘Anyone who jumps on it can take everything that is on it.’ There was a certain clever man there. He said to them: ‘You are looking at what is on it. I am looking at its teeth.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, while the masses approached the bear, the clever man distanced himself from it. Similarly, Joseph recognized the danger of the wife of Potiphar, and sought to distance himself from her. </i> Rabbi Berekhya said: All the power of that she-bear is in that it is able to jump, and you are greater that it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The wife of Potiphar expended great effort to entice Joseph, yet he withstood her advances (<i>Nezer HaKodesh</i>). </i> Astonishing!",

Rabbi Ḥiyya said: Until he saw the Divine Presence standing over him. That is what is written: “His master saw that the Lord was with him.”",
            "<b>“Joseph found favor in his eyes, and he served him.

However, the teaching cited here by the midrash indicates that if he has two pubic hairs, one is not particular about whether he has reached the age of thirteen, and he may be counted toward the quorum (see <i>Berakhot</i> 47b–48a). This implies that a minor who does not yet have two pubic hairs may not be counted toward the quorum. </i> Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: It is necessary for the case of two minors, one [whose status] is uncertain and one who is [certainly] a minor;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The teaching that one is not particular regarding a minor refers to the case of two minors; one has two pubic hairs but has not yet reached the age of thirteen, and the other does not yet have two pubic hairs (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> one renders the uncertain one as part of the quorum and the minor as a completion.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The minor whose status is certain may count only as the tenth man in the quorum. </i> It is taught: One may count a minor and a Torah scroll as the completion of ten.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the minor is holding a Torah scroll, he may be considered the tenth man in the quorum. </i> Rabbi Yudan said: This is the <i>baraita</i>: One may count a minor as the completion for a Torah scroll.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One may include a minor in the tally of seven people called to the Torah during the Torah reading on Shabbat (Maharzu). </i> From when may one count his as the completion?

Similarly, he may not count toward the three men necessary for <i>zimmun</i>, because without him they do not have the obligation to recite <i>zimmun</i> at all (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>). </i> Rabbi Asi said: Many times I ate with Rabbi Taḥlifa and many times I ate with Rabbi Ḥanina bar Sisi my uncle, and they did not include me in the <i>zimmun </i>until I grew two hairs. From when may he read the Torah? Rabbi Avina said: Rav Huna and Rabbi Yehuda dispute [the answer to] this, both of them in the name of Rabbi Shmuel: One said: From when he knows how to recite a blessing. The other says: From when he knows the nature of the blessing and to Whom he recites a blessing. <br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Shilat raised a question before Rav and some say: A question was raised before Shmuel bar Shilat: [If] nine [ate] bread and one [ate vegetables, what is [the ruling]?

It is taught: Three hundred nazirites ascended and were obligated to sacrifice nine hundred offerings<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Each nazirite is obligated to bring three offerings at the conclusion of his naziriteship: A burnt offering, a sin offering, and a guilt offering.

Rabbi Shimon ben Shataḥ went up to King Yannai. He said to him: ‘Three hundred nazirites ascended and are obligated to sacrifice nine hundred offerings, but they do not have [the means]. You give half from yours and I will give half from mine, and let them go and sacrifice.’ King Yannai gave half from his and they went and sacrificed. Someone came and spoke slander to King Yannai about Shimon ben Shataḥ: ‘Know that everything that they sacrificed, they sacrificed from yours, but Shimon ben Shataḥ did not give anything from his.’ King Yannai became angry at Shimon ben Shataḥ. [Shimon ben Shataḥ ] heard that he was angry at him, and he was distressed <variant reading: he was frightened> and he fled.  <br>Some time later, there were dignitaries from the Persian Empire who were eating at King Yannai’s table.

When he came, he sat between the king and the queen. [King Yannai] said to him: ‘Why did you flee?’ [Shimon ben Shataḥ said:] ‘I heard that my lord the king was angry at me, and I was frightened of you [and wanted to ensure] that you would not kill me, so I fulfilled this verse: “Hide for a brief moment, until fury will pass”’ (Isaiah 26:20). He said to him: ‘Why did you deceive me?’ He said to him: ‘God forbid, I did not deceive you. Rather, you [gave] from your wealth and I [gave] of the Torah,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shimon ben Shataḥ had used his Torah knowledge to annul the vows of half the nazirites, thus exempting them from bringing their sacrifices. </i> as it is written: “For in the shadow of wisdom, in the shadow of silver”’ (Ecclesiastes 7:12). He said to him: ‘Why did you not tell me?’ He said to him: ‘Had I told you, you would not have given.’ He said to him: ‘Why did you sit between the king and the queen?’ He said to him: ‘It is written in the book of ben Sira: “Prize it, and it will elevate you; and it will seat you between rulers.”’ He said: ‘Pour for him and let him recite the blessing.’ He said: ‘Blessed [is He] for [providing] the food that Yannai and his cohorts ate.’ He said: ‘Even now, you remain in your obstinacy? In all my days, I never heard Yannai in the blessing.’ He said: ‘What should I say, let us recite a blessing for what we ate? But I did not eat.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Generally, when three men participate in a meal, Grace after Meals is preceded by <i>zimmun</i>, an introductory section in which one of the lines is: Blessed is He from whose [food] we have eaten. However, in this instance Shimon ben Shataḥ had not actually eaten. </i> He said: ‘Give him and let him eat.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Gemara (<i>Berakhot</i> 48a), Shimon ben Shataḥ merely drank the first cup of wine they had brought, and then they brought him an additional cup for the recitation of Grace after Meals. </i> Once he ate, he said: Blessed [is He from whose food] we have eaten.’  <br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They disagree with him, with the statement of Shimon ben Shataḥ. Rabbi Abba said: Regarding the first.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Sages disagreed with his recitation of the blessing: Blessed [is He] for [providing] the food Yannai and his cohorts ate (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> Rabbi Yirmeya said: Regarding the second.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They disagreed with his reciting Grace after Meals for King Yannai and his guests after having only consumed a cup of wine.

Rabbi Yaakov bar Aḥa said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Actually, one does not include him in the <i>zimmun</i>, until he eats an olive-bulk of grain. But is it not taught: [If] two [ate] bread and one [ate] vegetables, they recite the <i>zimmun</i>? That <i>baraita </i>is in accordance with the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.",
            "<b>“Joseph was the ruler over the land; he was the provider of grain to all the people of the land. Joseph's brothers came, and prostrated themselves to him, faces to the ground” (Genesis 42:6).</b> <br>“Joseph was the ruler…” – he issued three edicts: That no slave shall enter Egypt; that no man shall enter with two donkeys, and that donkey drivers shall not transport grain from place to place; that a person shall not enter until he writes his name, his father’s name, and his grandfather’s name.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">All this was to increase the chances that Joseph’s brothers would come, and to ensure that if they were to come, Joseph would know.</i> Manasseh was standing there collecting the notes [with the names].

            "Another matter: “Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt.” It is written: “The withholder of grain, the nation will curse him, but blessing will be on the head of the provider” (Proverbs 11:26). “The withholder of grain, the nation will curse him” – this is Pharaoh; “but blessing will be on the head of the provider – this is Joseph. “The withholder of grain, the nation will curse him” – this is Pharaoh, who hoarded the grain during the years of famine, and the people were cursing him. But Joseph sustained the world during the years of famine, like a shepherd leading his flock. In his regard, David said: “Shepherd of Israel, listen. Appear to us, You who led Joseph like a flock” (Psalms 80:2). When there was a famine during the days of David, he asked for mercy from before the Holy One blessed be He and said: ‘Master of the universe, lead your flock like Joseph, who sustained the world during the years of famine.’  <br>When the famine intensified, the Egyptians gathered and came to Joseph. They said to him: ‘Give us bread.’ He said to them: ‘My God does not sustain the uncircumcised. Go and circumcise yourselves and I will give to you.’ They went to Pharaoh and were crying out and weeping before him, as it is stated: “The entire land of Egypt was hungry, [and the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread]” (Genesis 41:55). He said: “Go to Joseph; what he says to you, you shall do” (Genesis 41:55). They said to him: ‘We went to him and he said empty matters to us, saying: Circumcise yourselves.’ He said to them: ‘Fools, did I not say to you from the outset: Obey him and acquire grain. Did he not proclaim to you during the years of plenty and command you: Know that there is a famine coming? You yourselves were negligent. Why did you not place in your houses grain to last two, three, or four years?’ They said to him: ‘The grain that was in our houses rotted.’ He said to them: ‘Is there no flour leftover for you from yesterday?’ They said to him: ‘Even the bread that was in the basket rotted.’ He said to them: “Go to Joseph; what he says to you, you shall do.” He said to them: ‘If he issues a decree upon grain and it rots, perhaps he will issue a decree upon us and kill us.’ He said to them: ‘“Go to Joseph,” if he tells you cut your flesh, heed him,’ as it is stated: “What he says to you, you shall do.”  <br>“The famine was on the entire face [of the earth]” (Genesis 41:56). It would have been fitting for the verse to say: “On the earth.” Why does the verse say: “On the face”? Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: It is to teach you that the famine began only with the wealthy, as “the face of the earth” is only the wealthy. That is why it is stated: “The withholder of grain, the nation will curse him” – when a person is wealthy, his face is happy to see another, but when a person is indigent, he does not have a face to see, because he is ashamed in front of others.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is implied in the phrase “the famine was on the entire face.” </i> That is why it was stated: “The withholder of grain, the nation will curse him.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word “nation [<i>le’om</i>]” is interpreted to refer to the wealthy, prominent members of the nation (Rashash). </i>",
            "Another matter, “Jacob saw that there was grain [<i>shever</i>] in Egypt” – was Jacob in Egypt that he saw grain in Egypt, such that the verse states: “Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt”? But did he not say [differently] to his sons, [as it is stated]: “He saidBehold, I have heard [that there is grain in Egypt]”? It is, rather, that from the day that Joseph was abducted, the Divine Spirit left him, and he would see but not see, hear but not hear.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He had from the Divine Spirit a vague idea of things that he would not otherwise know, but he did not have a clear understanding of them. </i> Why does it not say “there was food in Egypt,” but instead it is written: “That there was grain [<i>shever</i>] in Egypt”? Is it not already stated: “The entire land of Egypt was hungry”? Why does the verse state: “There was grain [<i>shever</i>]”? Rather, do not read it as “there was grain [<i>shever</i>],” but rather, “there was hope [<i>sever</i>],” as he foresaw that his hope was in Egypt. What was that? That was Joseph. <br>“Jacob said to his sons: Why do you make yourselves conspicuous?” Jacob said to his sons: ‘You are mighty, you are handsome, do not enter through one gate and do not stand in one place, so that the evil eye will not have dominion over you.’ <br>“Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there.” What is “go down”? He foresaw that they would descend and be enslaved in Egypt. <br>Another matter, “go down there” – as anyone who purchases grain from the marketplace, descent is written in his regard.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is because he is dependent upon market conditions for his basic sustenance (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i>  <br>“Joseph’s brothers descended” (Genesis 42:3). The verse should have said: “The children of Israel.” It is that initially, they did not treat him with brotherhood and sold him, but ultimately they had regrets and were saying: ‘When will we descend to Egypt and return our brother to his father?’ When their father told them to descend to Egypt, they all came to a consensus to return him. <br>Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: Joseph, too, knew that his brothers were descending to Egypt to acquire food. What did he do? He positioned guards at all the entrances and said to them: ‘See each one who enters to acquire food, and write his name and his father’s name.’ In the evening, they would bring the notes to him. This is what they did. When Jacob’s sons came, each and every one entered through his own gate, and they wrote their names. In the evening, they brought [Joseph] the notes. This one read: ‘Reuben son of Jacob,’ another read: ‘Simeon son of Jacob,’ and another ‘Levi,’ and likewise, all the gatekeepers, each one brought his own. Immediately, Joseph said: ‘Seal all the storehouses and keep open one storehouse.’ He gave their names to the proprietor of the storehouse. He said to him: ‘See, when these people come to you, apprehend them, and send them before me.’ Three days passed and they did not come. Immediately, Joseph took seventy mighty men from the king’s palace and dispatched them to the marketplace. They went and found them in the marketplace of harlots. What was the nature of their presence in the marketplace of harlots? It is that they said: ‘Our brother Joseph is fair of form and fair of appearance; perhaps he is in a tent.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Perhaps he was forced to work as a male prostitute (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>). </i> They apprehended them and brought them before Joseph. <br><b>“Joseph saw his brothers, and he recognized them, but he acted as a stranger to them, and spoke harshly to them; he said to them: From where did you come?

He took the goblet and struck it. He said to them: ‘I see in my goblet that “you are spies.”’ They said to him: ‘“We are sincere”; however, this is what our father commanded us: Do not enter through one gate…’ He said to them: ‘What is the nature of your presence in the marketplace of harlots? Were you not afraid of the evil eye? Was that not your father’s command?’ They said to him: ‘We lost something and we were seeking it there.’ He said to them: ‘What was the lost item? I see in my goblet that two of you destroyed the big city of Shekhem, and then you sold your brother to Arabs.’ Immediately, they were shocked and said to him: “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, sons of…our father.” He said to them: ‘And where are the other two?’ They said to him: “One is absent” – dead; and “the youngest is with our father today.” He said to them: “Bring your youngest brother to me…” (Genesis 42:34). He took Simeon and incarcerated him before their eyes, because it was he who had pushed him into the pit. He separated him from Levi, so they would not conspire against him. <br>Simeon said to his brothers: ‘So you did to Joseph, and so you seek to do to me?’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">You also sinned in the sale of Joseph.

When they heard his voice, they fell on their faces and their teeth broke, as it is stated: “The roar of the lion and the voice of the great cat, and the teeth of the lion cubs are broken” (Job 4:10). Manasseh was sitting before his father. His father said: ‘You get up.’ Immediately, Manasseh stood and struck him with one blow, took him into prison, and shackled him. [Joseph] said to [his brothers]: ‘This one will be incarcerated until you bring your brother “and your statements will be verified”’ (Genesis 42:20). <br>Immediately, “Joseph commanded and they filled their vessels” (Genesis 42:25). They went to their father and related to him the entire incident. Their father responded and said to them: ‘Where is Simeon?’ They said: ‘He seized him for our youngest brother.’ He said to them: “You have bereaved me.” “Reuben spoke to his father, saying: Kill my two sons.” [Jacob] said to him: ‘Are your sons not my sons?’ Judah said to them: ‘Leave the elder until the bread is finished.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jacob was refusing to send Benjamin. Judah advised his brothers not to continue pleading but to wait until the bread was finished, when Jacob would have to agree. </i> Judah said to him: ‘Father, if Benjamin goes with us, perhaps he will be apprehended and perhaps he will not be apprehended. But if he does not go with us, we will all die of starvation. It is preferable that you forsake the uncertain and seize the certain.’ He said: ‘Who will guarantee him?’ He said to him: ‘I will,’ as it is stated: “I will guarantee him; from me you can demand him” (Genesis 43:9). That is why it is stated: “Jacob saw that there was grain [<i>shever</i>] in Egypt.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash interprets the word <i>shever</i> to mean disaster, as Jacob was afraid of the possibility that Benjamin would be harmed (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).

Corresponding to whom did Solomon say this verse? He said it only corresponding to Joseph the righteous. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: When Joseph the righteous seized Benjamin and said to his brothers: “The man in whose hand the goblet was found, he shall be my slave [and you, go up in peace to your father]” (Genesis 44:17), Judah said to him: ‘Benjamin, you are seized; can there be peace in Father’s household?’ Immediately, Judah grew angry and roared in a loud voice. His voice traveled four hundred parsangs, until Ḥushim son of Dan heard and leapt from the land of Canaan and came to Judah. Both of them roared and the land of Egypt was on the verge of being upended. In their regard Job said: “The roar of the lion and the voice of the great cat” (Job 4:10). “The roar of the lion” – this is Judah, in whose regard it is written: “Judah is a lion cub” (Genesis 49:9). “And the voice of the great cat” – this is Ḥushim son of Dan, as both of them were likened to a lion, as it is stated: “To Dan he said: Dan is a lion cub” (Deuteronomy 33:22). “The teeth of the young lions are broken” (Job 4:10) – these are Joseph’s warriors. When Judah grew angry, the teeth of all of them fell out. <br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: When [the brothers] saw that Judah grew angry, they too, were filled with anger. They kicked the ground and caused it to be full of furrows, as it is stated: “The lion perishes for lack of prey” (Job 4:11) – this is Judah, who risked his life on Benjamin’s behalf.

Alternatively, it had been Judah who had misled Jacob about Joseph’s disappearance and caused him to think that Joseph was dead (Maharzu). </i> At that moment he became filled with rage at Joseph. When Joseph saw the signs of Judah’s [rage], he was immediately shaken and alarmed. He said: ‘Woe is me, perhaps he will kill me.’  <br>What were the signs [of rage] upon Judah? Those of the house of Shilo said: Blood flowed from his two eyes. Some say: He would wear five garments that were like warriors’ armor. When he would grow angry, there was one hair over his heart that would rip through them all. What did Joseph do at that moment? That stone pillar upon which he was seated, he kicked it and rendered it a heap of pebbles. At this Judah was astonished and said: ‘This one is mightier than I am.’ At that moment, Judah grasped his sword and sought to draw it from its scabbard, but it would not be drawn for him. Judah said: ‘This one must be a God-fearing man; that is why it is stated: “Wisdom will fortify the wise”’ (Ecclesiastes 7:19).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash understands the term wisdom in this verse as a reference to fear of God, as in Job 28:28. </i>",

But if they designated him for them, like Sheva son of Bikhri, they shall give, and all of them shall not be killed. Rabbi Yehuda said: In what case are these matters stated? It is when he is inside and they are outside.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When he is trapped by the besieging army but they are not totally trapped, it is possible they will escape the army even if they do not deliver him to the army. Consequently, they may not turn him over. </i> But if he is inside and they are inside, since he will be killed and they will be killed, they shall deliver him to them and all of them will not be killed. Like it says: “The woman came to all the people” (II Samuel 20:22) – since he will be killed and you will be killed, give him to them and let you all not be killed. Rabbi Shimon says: Anyone who revolts against the kingdom of the house of David is liable to death.  <br>Ulla ben Kishar was sought by the empire. He rose and fled to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi to Lod. They sent a messenger after him. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi approached [Ulla ben Kishar] and appeased him. He said to him: ‘It is preferable that this man [i.e. you] be killed, and let the entire community not be punished on his account.’ He appeased him and he delivered him to [the messenger]. Elijah was accustomed to speak with [Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi]. Once he did this, [Elijah] did not come to him any longer. He fasted over him for thirty days, and he appeared to him. [Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi] said to him: ‘What is the reason that my master absented himself?’ He said to him: ‘Do I associate with informers?’ He said to him: ‘Is it not a <i>baraita</i>: A group of people…’ He said to him: ‘Is that a mishna of the pious? That act should have been performed by others and not by you.’  <br>It is taught: When Nebuchadnezzar ascended to conquer Yehoyakim, he ascended and encamped at Daphne at Antioch. The Great Sanhedrin descended to greet him. They said to him: ‘Has the time arrived for this house to be destroyed?’ He said to them: ‘No, but Yehoyakim king of Judah has revolted against me. Give him to me and I will go.’ They went and said to Yehoyakim: ‘Nebuchadnezzar wants you.’ He said to them: ‘Is this how one acts? Does one disregard one life in favor of another life? Is it not so written: “You shall not hand over a slave to his master”?’ (Deuteronomy 23:16). They said to him: ‘Is this not what your ancestor did to Sheva son of Bikhri? That is what is written: “Behold, his head is cast to you over the wall”’ (II Samuel 20:21). When [Yehoyakim] did not heed them, they rose, took him, and lowered him [to Nebuchadnezzar], who dismembered him."

The blind will be healed, as it is stated: “Then the eyes of the blind will be opened” (Isaiah 35:5).

Just as he goes [to the grave] clothed, so he returns clothed. From whom do you derive it? It is from Samuel, who was seen by Saul.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is not meant literally, as it was the woman conjurer who saw Samuel, while Saul himself did not see him (see I Samuel 28:11–14; <i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 26:7). The meaning is that Saul initiated the incident in which Samuel was seen by the conjurer. </i> What did [Saul] say to the woman? “What is his appearance? She said: An old man…and he is clad in a robe” (I Samuel 28:14), as so he was clad, as it is stated: “His mother made him a small robe” (I Samuel 2:19).  <br>Why is it that just as a person departs, so he returns? It is so [people] do not say: ‘When they were alive He did not heal them; did the Holy One blessed be He heal them when they were dead and then bring them back? It seems that these are not they, but others.’ The Holy One blessed be He says: ‘If so, let these stand as they departed, and then I will heal them.’ Why? “[So that you may know and believe Me and understand that I am He;] before Me no god was formed” (Isaiah 43:10), so I will heal them. The beasts will also be cured, as it is stated: “Wolf and lamb will graze as one” (Isaiah 65:25). All will be healed, but the one who brought harm upon all will not be healed, but rather, “and a serpent, dust will be its food” (Isaiah 65:25). Why? Because he took the creations down to the dust. <br>Another matter, “wolf and lamb.” “Wolf” – this is Benjamin.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Genesis 49:27.</i> “And lamb” – these are the tribes, as it is stated: “Israel are scattered sheep” (Jeremiah 50:17). “Will graze as one” – when? It was when Benjamin descended with them, and Jacob was saying to them: “My son will not descend with you” (Genesis 42:38). When the time arrived and he descended with them, they placed him between them and were guarding him. Likewise, regarding Joseph, it says: “He lifted his eyes, and saw Benjamin” (Genesis 43:29).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He was able to see him only after lifting his eyes because the brothers surrounded him.</i> “A lion” – this is Judah; “Judah is a lion cub” (Genesis 49:9). “Like cattle” – this is Joseph; “A firstborn bull is his majesty” (Deuteronomy 33:17). They were found eating together – “they sat before him…he gave gifts” (Genesis 43:33–34). That is, “and a lion, like cattle, will eat straw” (Isaiah 65:25). That is why “he sent Judah before him.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This was a demonstration that Judah and Joseph were now at peace. </i>",
            "The verse states: “The jealousy of Ephraim will cease” (Isaiah 11:13) – because Jacob our patriarch believed that Judah had killed Joseph when he brought him the tunic, as it is stated: “He recognized it, and said: My son's tunic, an evil beast devoured him” (Genesis 37:33), and an evil beast is none other than a lion.",
            "Another matter, “he sent Judah before him.” Rabbi Ḥanina son of Rabbi Aḥa, and Rabbi Ḥanina, one said: To arrange a residence for him. And one said: To arrange an academy in which he would teach Torah matters and in which the tribes would study. Know that it is so; when Joseph departed from him, he knew at which chapter that he was teaching him he left him. When Joseph’s brothers came to him and said to him: “Joseph is still alive… his heart was faint [because he did not believe them]” (Genesis 45:26). He remembered at which chapter he left him, and said to himself: I know that it was at the chapter of the beheaded calf [<i>egla arufa</i>] that Joseph left me. He said to them: ‘If you know at what chapter Joseph left me, I will believe you.’ Joseph, too, knew at what chapter he left him. What did Joseph do? He gave them wagons [<i>agalot</i>], as it is stated: “Joseph gave them wagons by Pharaoh’s order” (Genesis 45:21). This is to teach you that everywhere Jacob would settle he would study Torah, just as his fathers would. <br>At this point, the Torah had not been given, but it is written of Abraham: “[Because Abraham heeded My voice,] and he kept My charge, [My commands, My decrees, and My Torahs]” (Genesis 26:5) – from where did Abraham learn the Torah? Rabban Shimon says: His two kidneys became like two jugs of water and they would gush Torah. From where is it derived that it is so? As it is stated: “Even on nights [my kidneys] instruct me” (Psalms 16:7). Rabbi Levi said: He studied Torah on his own, as it is stated: “The dissembler in his heart shall have his fill from his own ways, and a good man shall be satisfied from himself” (Proverbs 14:14). Rabbi Yonatan Sar HaBira said: Abraham knew even the joining of cooked foods, as it is stated: “Because Abraham heeded…” (Genesis 26:5).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The end of the verse mentions “My Torahs,” in plural, implying both the written and oral Torahs. The oral Torah includes even rabbinic laws, like the joining of cooked foods [<i>eruv tavshilin</i>]. The rabbis forbade cooking on a festival day for Shabbat unless one prepares two cooked items for Shabbat before the festival day (see <i>Beitza</i> 15b).</i> <br>How old was Abraham when he recognized his Creator? He recognized his Creator at the age of forty-eight years old. Reish Lakish said: At the age of three years old, as “<i>ekev</i>” is written, the numerical value of <i>ekev</i>, and Abraham lived one hundred and seventy-five years.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse states “because [<i>ekev</i>] Abraham heeded My voice…” The numerical value of the word <i>ekev</i> is one hundred and seventy-two, implying that Abraham heeded God’s voice for one hundred and seventy-two years. </i> You learn from this that at age three, he recognized his Creator. He would observe the details of the Torah and would teach his children, as it is stated: “For I have loved him, [so that he will command his children and his household after him and they will observe the way of the Lord]” (Genesis 18:19). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘You taught your children in this world, but in the World to Come, I, in My glory, will teach all of you the Torah,’ as it is stated: “All your children will be students of the Lord” (Isaiah 54:13).",

It is to teach you that they were not mighty.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The term <i>katze </i>indicates those on the periphery; those who are relatively weak.</i> Who were these five men? They were Reuben, Levi, Benjamin, Simeon, and Issachar. Why did Joseph the righteous select these five men from his brothers? It is because he knew each and every mighty one among his brothers, and he acted wisely. He said: ‘If I present the mighty ones before pharaoh, he will see them and make them his warriors.’ Anyone whose name was repeated in Moses’s blessing was mighty, and anyone whose name was not repeated, was not mighty. Judah, who was mighty, his name was repeated, as it is stated: “This is for Judah, and he said: Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah” (Deuteronomy 33:7). Therefore, he did not present him before Pharaoh. Likewise Naphtali, as it is stated: “Of Naphtali he said: Naphtali” (Deuteronomy 33:23). Likewise Asher, as it is stated: “Of Asher he said: Blessed of sons is Asher” (Deuteronomy 33:24). Likewise Dan, as it is stated: “Of Dan he said: Dan” (Deuteronomy 33:22). Likewise Zebulun, as it is stated: “Of Zebulun he said: Rejoice, Zebulun” (Deuteronomy 33:18). And likewise Gad – “Of Gad he said: Blessed is He who expands Gad” (Deuteronomy 33:20). That is why he did not present these before Pharaoh. The rest, whose names were not repeated, were not mighty. Therefore, he presented them before Pharaoh. That is why it is written: “From among his brothers he took.” It does not mention their names here because they were not mighty. <br><b>“Joseph said: Give your livestock, and I will give you for your livestock, if silver has run out” (Genesis 47:16).</b> <br>“Joseph said: Give your livestock…” – your horse is before me.

He did not reach the days of his ancestors. Of Boaz, Oved, and Yishai, the Sages said that they lived more than four hundred years, but David lived only seventy years. He did not reach the days of his ancestors; therefore “approach” is written in his regard. Amram lived one hundred and thirty-seven years, but Moses lived only one hundred and twenty years; therefore, “approach” is written in his regard: “Behold, your days are approaching to die” (Deuteronomy 31:14). And Jacob, approach is written in his regard, as he did not reach the days of his ancestors.

Because the ultimate fate of the land of Egypt is to be stricken with lice, and they will swarm in my body. That is why “please do not bury me in Egypt.” <br>Another matter, for what reason did Jacob request not to be buried in Egypt? It was so they would not make him the subject of idolatrous worship, for just as punishment is exacted from one who worships, so is punishment exacted from the one who is worshipped, as it is written: “Against all the gods of Egypt I will administer punishments: I am the Lord” (Exodus 12:12). Likewise you find regarding Daniel, once he interpreted Nebuchadnezzar’s dream, what is written? “Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, and he prostrated himself to Daniel, and said to pour out to him a meal offering and fragrances” (Daniel 2:46). But Daniel did not accept it. Why?

Nebuchadnezzar sought to sacrifice to him, but he did not want it, and you make yourself a god? What was his ultimate fate? “I cast you upon the ground, I placed you before kings that they may gaze upon you” (Ezekiel 28:17). <br>Another matter, Jacob said: ‘So that the Egyptians will not merit redemption because of me. They prostrate themselves to a lamb, and I was likened to a lamb, as it is stated: “Israel is a scattered lamb” (Jeremiah 50:17), and regarding Egypt it is written: “Whose flesh is the flesh of donkeys” (Ezekiel 23:20), and it is written: “The firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb”’ (Exodus 34:20). That is, “please do not bury me in Egypt.” <br>Why did all the patriarchs demand and have fondness for burial in the Land of Israel? Rabbi Elazar said: These are cryptic matters.

Because the dead of the Land of Israel come to life first in the messianic era, and enjoy the messianic years. <br>Rabbi Ḥanina said: One who dies outside of the Land of Israel and is buried there, has undergone two deaths,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Death and burial.</i> as so it is written: “And you, Pashḥur, and all the dwellers in your house, will go into captivity, and to Babylon you will come, and there you will die, and there you will be buried” (Jeremiah 20:6). That is, he has undergone two deaths. That is why Jacob says to Joseph: “Please do not bury me in Egypt.” <br>Rabbi Simon said: If so, the righteous who are buried outside of the Land of Israel suffer a loss. What, then, does the Holy One blessed be He do? He makes tunnels in the ground for them and makes them like channels, and they roll along until they reach the Land of Israel. The Holy One blessed be He then places in them a spirit of life and they arise. From where is this derived? It is written: “Behold, I am opening your graves, and I will take you up from your graves, My people, and I will bring you to the soil of Israel” (Ezekiel 37:12), and then: “I will place My spirit into you and you will live” (Ezekiel 37:14). Reish Lakish said: It is an explicit verse, that once they reach the Land of Israel, the Holy One blessed be He will place a soul in them, as it is stated: “Who places a soul in the people upon it” (Isaiah 42:5). <br>There was an incident involving Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] and Rabbi Eliezer, who were walking near the gates outside Tiberias. They saw the coffin of a dead person who came from outside of the Land of Israel to be buried in the Land of Israel. Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] said to Rabbi Eliezer: ‘What has this one, whose soul departed outside of the Land of Israel and came to be buried in the Land of Israel, accomplished? I read in his regard: “My inheritance you rendered an abomination” (Jeremiah 2:7) during your lifetime, “and you came, and you defiled My land” (Jeremiah 2:7) after your death.’ [Rabbi Eliezer] said to him: ‘Once he is buried in the Land of Israel, the Holy One blessed be He grants him atonement, as it is written: “His earth will atone for his people”’ (Deuteronomy 32:43). <br>Rabbi Yoḥanan, when he was departing from the world, said to those who needed to tend to him: ‘Bury me in garments dyed green, not white and not black, so if I stand among the righteous we will not be shamed, and if I stand among the wicked we will not be disgraced.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Yoḥanan was not sure if he would be summoned with the righteous, who appear in white, or the wicked, who appear in black. He therefore asked to be buried in a different color so as to avoid a situation in which he was dressed in white but summoned with the wicked, which would be embarrassing, or a situation in which he was dressed in black but summoned with the righteous, which might appear as a distortion of Divine justice.</i> <br>Rabbi Yoshiya, when he was departing from the world, said to those who were standing over him: ‘Summon my disciples.’ He said to them: ‘Bury me in white garments. Why? Because I am not ashamed to greet my Creator because of my actions.’  <br>Rabbenu,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.</i> when he was departing from the world, commanded three matters: ‘Do not move my widow from my house. Do not eulogize me in the towns in the Land of Israel. And do not allow a gentile to touch my bier; rather, let he who tended to me during my lifetime tend to me after my death.’  <br>During his lifetime, he resided in Tzippori seventeen years, and he would read in his regard: “Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years,” and Yehuda lived in Tzippori seventeen years. Rabbenu suffered from pain in his teeth for thirteen years, and all those thirteen years, no woman died in childbirth in the Land of Israel and no woman miscarried in the Land of Israel. After thirteen years, Rabbenu became angry at Rabbi Ḥiyya HaGadol. Elijah, of blessed memory, came to Rabbenu in the guise of Rabbi Ḥiyya, placed his hand on his tooth, and he was immediately healed. On the next day, Rabbi Ḥiyya came to him. He said to him: ‘Rabbi, that tooth of yours, what is its condition?’ He said: ‘From the moment you came to me yesterday, it was healed.’ At that moment, Rabbi Ḥiyya said: ‘Woe unto you, birthing mothers in the Land of Israel. Woe unto you, pregnant women in the Land of Israel.’ Nevertheless, he said to him: ‘It was not I who placed a hand on your tooth.’ Rabbenu knew that it had been Elijah of blessed memory. From that moment, Rabbi began treating Rabbi Ḥiyya with honor."

            "“They lamented…there…” – from where is it derived that mourning is seven days? Rabbi Abba cites it from here: “He…observed mourning for his father for seven days” (Genesis 50:10), and we derive a matter [of <i>halakha</i>] from before the giving of the Torah. Reish Lakish in the name of bar Kappara cites it from here: “From the entrance of the Tent of Meeting you shall not emerge seven days…” (Leviticus 8:33)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some suggest that the correct reading of the text references a different verse: “And from the entrance of the Tent of Meeting you shall not emerge, that you not die, as the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you” (Leviticus 10:7). This verse, stated to Aaron and his remaining sons after the death of Nadav and Avihu, is interpreted to mean that just as they were anointed with the anointing oil for seven days, they were to observe seven days of mourning for Nadav and Avihu (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> – just as you were anointed with the anointing oil for seven days, you, too, observe for your brothers seven days. Rabbi Hoshaya cites it from here: “At the entrance of the Tent of Meeting you shall remain day and night, seven days…” (Leviticus 8:35) – just as the Holy One blessed be He observed seven days [of mourning] for His world, you, too, observe seven days [of mourning] for your brothers, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: The Holy One blessed be He mourned for His world for seven days.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Before God destroyed the world with the flood, He observed seven days of mourning, alluded to in Genesis 7:10. Similarly, He commanded Aaron and his sons Elazar and Itamar to observe seven days of mourning in advance of the deaths of Aaron’s other two sons, Nadav and Avihu (see Jerusalem Talmud <i>Moed Katan</i> 3:5). </i> <br>Rabbi Yoḥanan cites it from here: “Please let her not be like a corpse” (Numbers 12:12); rather, “she shall be quarantined for seven days” (Numbers 12:14). Just as the days of quarantine are seven, so the days of mourning are seven. One of the Sages said this [statement] of Rabbi Yoḥanan before Reish Lakish, but he did not accept it. Why did he not accept it? He said: ‘There he treats it as quarantine and here he treats it as confirmed leprosy, as Rabbi Abahu came in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan and said: “Please let her not be like a corpse” – just as the days of a corpse are seven, so the days of a confirmed leper are seven.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Upon the appearance of certain types of leprous spots, a priest will command that the individual go into quarantine for seven days. If the symptoms worsen, the individual will then be declared to be a confirmed leper (see, e.g., Leviticus 13:1–8). Reish Lakish did not accept the teaching reported in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan that treated Miriam’s leprosy as worthy of quarantine, which the Torah says is seven days, because he heard a different statement in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan that treated her leprosy as a case of confirmed leprosy, about which the Torah does not explicitly say that the term is seven days. It should be noted that <i>halakha</i> does not actually limit the term of a confirmed leper to seven days, and commentaries here interpret the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan, based on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Moed Katan</i> 3:5), to mean that just as the days one is impure from a corpse do not count toward the days of a nazirite vow, the same is true of the days one spends as a confirmed leper (see <i>Yefei To’ar</i>; <i>Etz Yosef</i>; Maharzu). </i> Rabbi Yirmeya and Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba in the name of Reish Lakish: “I will transform your festivals into mourning” (Amos 8:10) – just as the days of the festival are seven, so the days of mourning are seven. Rabbi Ḥiyya said: The eighth<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shemini Atzeret</i>.</i> is a festival in and of itself. If so, just as [Shemini] Atzeret is one day, so, mourning is so.

There are some who teach: Distant tidings are after twelve months, near ones are within thirty. Rabbi Abahu said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: The <i>halakha </i>is in accordance with the one who says: Near tidings are within thirty days and distant ones after thirty days. <br>Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Yona in the name of Reish Lakish in the name of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: It is written: “The days of weeping of the mourning of Moses concluded” – days – two, weeping – seven, mourning – thirty. There are those who transpose – days – seven, weeping – two, mourning – thirty. From this, [the mourning periods of] seven and thirty [days are derived], but what is two? It is that if he [the mourner] is extremely poor, on the first and second [days] he does not perform labor, but on the third, he performs [labor] privately, but they said: May a curse come upon his neighbors, who required him to do so.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">His neighbors should have supported him so that he could observe all seven days of mourning without performing labor. </i> Bar Kappara said: Even on the third [day] he shall not perform [labor] at all, because it is the intense period of mourning. Bar Kappara taught: The most intense time of mourning is only on the third day. For three days, the soul is hovering over its grave, believing that it will return [to the body]. When it sees that the radiance of the face has changed, it goes and leaves it. That is what is written: “But his flesh on him is painful, [and his soul mourns over him]” (Job 14:22). In the future, the mouth and the stomach will contend with one another. The mouth says to the stomach: ‘Everything that I stole and robbed, I placed in you.’ After three days [the stomach] bursts and says to it: ‘Here is everything that you stole and robbed,’ as it is stated: “The pitcher is broken at the spring” (Ecclesiastes 12:6). <br>What about donning <i>tefillin</i>?

Rabbi Ze’eira raised a dilemma: What is the ruling for one to don on the second day in accordance with Rabbi Eliezer and what is the ruling to have Rabbi Eliezer like Rabbi Yehoshua not to remove?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Can one combine the leniencies of the two opinions and don <i>tefillin</i> on the second day and not remove them if a new person arrives? The midrash does not cite a resolution to this dilemma. </i> <br>From where is it derived that there is no mourning on Shabbat? Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin in the name of Rabbi Levi cites it from here: “The blessing of the Lord, it will enrich, without adding sadness with it” (Proverbs 10:22). “The blessing of the Lord, it will enrich” – “God blessed the seventh day” (Genesis 2:3). “Without adding sadness [<i>etzev</i>] with it” – this is mourning, just as it says: “The king is grieving [<i>ne’etzav</i>] over his son” (II Samuel 19:3). <br>Rav said: [On Shabbat,] turning around and righting are compulsory, uncovering and putting on are voluntary. Turning the rip around, and righting the bed are compulsory; uncovering the head and putting on shoes are voluntary.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">During the seven day mourning period, the mourner wears a torn garment and does not wear leather shoes. In Talmudic times, a mourner would also turn over his bed and cover his head as signs of mourning. Rav states that on Shabbat, one must turn the garment around so that the tear is not visible, and one must turn the bed right side up. However, although one <i>may</i> uncover the head and wear leather shoes on Shabbat, it is not obligatory to do so. </i> Shmuel said: Uncovering, turning around, and righting are compulsory; putting on, conjugal relations, and washing are voluntary. Uncovering the head, turning the rip around, and righting the bed are compulsory; putting on shoes, having conjugal relations, and washing are voluntary. One student of Shmuel engaged in conjugal relations and went and washed. [Shmuel] said to him: ‘I said it to you as the <i>halakha</i>, did I, perhaps, say [it should be put] into practice?’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although Shmuel held it was permitted for a mourner to engage in conjugal relations and to wash himself on Shabbat, he felt it was nonetheless inappropriate. </i> He became angry at [the student] and [the student] died. <br>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥalafta would relate the praise of Rabbi Meir before the residents of Tzippori.

This led the brothers to think that he harbored enmity toward them and would want to take revenge against them. </i> Rabbi Tanḥuma said: His intention was only for the sake of Heaven. He said: ‘In the past, father would seat me above Judah, who is king, and above Reuben, who is firstborn. Now, it is improper for me to sit above them.’ But that is not what they said, but rather: “Perhaps Joseph will hate us.” Rabbi Yitzḥak said: He went and peered into that pit.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">While in Canaan to bury Jacob, Joseph peered into the pit that his brothers had thrown him into and from which he was removed and sold into slavery. </i> Rabbi Tanḥuma said: His intention was only for the sake of Heaven.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He went to recite a blessing for having been saved from the snakes and scorpions that inhabited that pit (see <i>Shabbat</i> 22a; <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 84:16). </i> But that is not what they said, but rather: “Perhaps Joseph will hate us.” <br><b>“They instructed to tell Joseph, saying: Your father instructed before his death, saying, so say to Joseph: Please, forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin as they did evil to you. And now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father. Joseph wept as they spoke to him” (Genesis 50:16–17).</b> <br>“They instructed to tell Joseph, saying: Your father instructed…” It is taught: Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says: Great is peace, as even the tribes spoke fabricated matters in order to impose peace between Joseph and the tribes. That is what is written: “They instructed to tell Joseph, saying…” Where did he instruct? We do not find that he instructed. <br>“So say to Joseph…[Joseph wept as they spoke to him]” – he said: ‘This is how my brothers are suspicious of me?’ <br><b>“His brothers too, went and fell before him and they said: Behold, we are your slaves” (Genesis 50:18).</b> <br>“His brothers too, went” – you wanted one of us as a slave, here all of us are your slaves.",
            "<b>“Joseph said to them: Fear not, for am I in place of God? You intended me harm; God intended it for good, in order to engender as it is today, to keep many people alive. And now, fear not; I will sustain you, and your children. He comforted them, and spoke to their heart” (Genesis 50:19–21).</b> <br>“Joseph said to them…You intended me harm…And now, fear not…and spoke to their heart” – is there any person who speaks to the heart? It is, rather, words that comfort the heart. He said to them: ‘You were likened to the dust of the earth. Just like the dust of the earth; can anyone eliminate the dust of the earth? You were likened to the beasts of the field; can anyone eliminate the beasts of the field? You were likened to the stars; can anyone eliminate the stars? Ten stars sought to eliminate one star and were unable to overcome it. Can I change the natural order of the world [and eliminate] twelve tribes? For they correspond to the twelve hours of the day and correspond to the twelve constellations in the firmament.’ <br>Rabbi Simlai said: [Joseph said to them:] ‘You are the body and I am the head – “it will come upon the head of Joseph” (Deuteronomy 33:16). If the body is taken, what good is the head? Moreover, before you descended to here, they would call me a slave. After you descended to here, I informed them of my distinguished lineage. If this is so, would I kill you? Could that be? If I were to kill you, they would say: This one cannot be trusted. He did not keep faith with his brothers; with whom will he keep faith? [Or] they would say: They were not his brothers, but a group of lads whom he saw and called his brothers. Know that this is so, for ultimately he concocted a pretext and killed them.’  <br>[Joseph] said: ‘Shall I become an antagonist to my father; my father begets and I bury? Shall I become an antagonist to the Holy One blessed be He; the Holy One blessed be He blesses and I diminish?’ That is what is written: “He comforted them.”  <br>The matters may be inferred <i>a fortiori</i>: If Joseph, who spoke gentle words to the heart of the tribes, was able to comfort them so, when the Holy One blessed be He will come to comfort Jerusalem, all the more so. That is what is written: “Comfort, comfort My people…” (Isaiah 40:1).",
            "<b>“Joseph resided in Egypt, he, and his father's household; Joseph lived one hundred and ten years” (Genesis 50:22).</b> <br>“Joseph resided in Egypt…” – there are six pairs whose years were equal: Rebecca and Kehat, Levi and Amram, Joseph and Joshua, Samuel and Solomon, Moses and Hillel the elder, Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai and Rabbi Akiva. Moses spent forty years in Pharaoh’s palace, forty years in Midyan, and he served Israel for forty years. Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai engaged in commerce for forty years, studied Torah for forty years, and served Israel for forty years. Rabbi Akiva was an ignoramus for forty years, studied Torah for forty years, and served Israel for forty years.",
            "<b>“Joseph administered an oath to the children of Israel, saying: God will remember you, and you shall carry up my bones from here” (Genesis 50:25).</b> <br>“Joseph administered an oath to the children of Israel…” – I would think [he demanded they bring his bones to Canaan] immediately. The verse states: “[You shall bring my bones up from here] with you” (Exodus 13:19) – when you will ascend. From where is it derived that they took up the bones of all the tribes with them? As it is stated: “With you.” <br><b>“Joseph died at the age of one hundred and ten years. They embalmed him, and he was placed in a coffin in Egypt” (Genesis 50:26).</b> <br>“Joseph died at the age of one hundred and ten years. They embalmed him” – who embalmed him? Rabbi Pinḥas and Rabbi Yehuda in the name of Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda said: The physicians embalmed him. Rabbi Pinḥas said: The tribes embalmed him. That is what is written: “They embalmed him, and he was placed in a coffin in Egypt.” Who are they? “These are the names of the children of Israel who came to Egypt” (Exodus 1:1).",
            "Variant reading: “This is what their father Jacob spoke to them” (Genesis 49:28) is not written here, but rather, “their father.” Another man like me is destined to bless you and from the place that I concluded, he will begin, as it is stated: “This is what [their father] spoke.” When Moses stood, he began with “this,” as it is stated: “This is the blessing [that Moses, the man of God, blessed the children of Israel with before his death]” (Deuteronomy 33:1).  <br>[Jacob] said to them: ‘I will say these blessings to you. When will they take effect? When you receive the Torah,’ as it is stated: “This is the Torah” (Deuteronomy 4:44). That is, “this is what their father spoke to them.” With that which their father Jacob concluded [in blessing] them, Moses began [blessing] them. <br>Moses said: “I gain insight from the elders, [for I uphold Your edicts]” (Psalms 119:100). Isaac, when he blessed Jacob, and said to him: “And God Almighty [will bless you]” (Genesis 28:3), with what did he conclude? “Isaac summoned Jacob” (Genesis 28:1).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is called the conclusion because it was the beginning of Isaac’s concluding blessing to Jacob, after he had already blessed him in Genesis ch. 27. See also a variant reading in <i>Devarim Rabba</i> 11:1. </i> Jacob began from where his father had concluded, as it is stated: “Jacob summoned his sons” (Genesis 49:1), and he concluded when he blessed them with “this” – “this is what [their father] spoke [to them]” (Genesis 49:28). Moses began from where Jacob had concluded: “This is the blessing” (Deuteronomy 33:1). With what did Moses conclude? “Happy are you Israel” (Deuteronomy 33:29). David, too, when he came to recite a psalm, began from where Moses had concluded: “Happy is the man” (Psalms 1:1). That is, “I gain insight from the elders.” <br><b>“They came to the threshing floor of Atad, that is beyond the Jordan, and they lamented a very great and substantial lament there, and he observed mourning for his father seven days” (Genesis 50:10).</b>",
            "“And he observed mourning for his father seven days” – why are seven [days] observed? It is corresponding to the seven days of the wedding feast. The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘In this world, you were sorrowful with this righteous one and observed mourning for him for seven days. In the future world, I will transform that mourning into rejoicing, as it is stated: “I will transform their mourning into gladness, and I will console them and cheer them from their sorrow” (Jeremiah 31:13). Just as I comfort you, so I will comfort Zion and all its ruins, like the matter that is stated: “For the Lord will comfort Zion; He will comfort all her ruins; He will render its wilderness like Eden and its desert like a garden of the Lord. Gladness and joy will be found in it, thanksgiving and the sound of music”’ (Isaiah 51:3). <br> <br>"
