            "Judah haNasi once directed Rabbi Afes to write a letter in Judah’s name to Emperor Antoninus. Rabbi Afes wrote: “From Judah the Prince to our Sovereign the Emperor Antoninus.” Judah read the letter, tore it up, and wrote: “From your servant Judah to our Sovereign the Emperor Antoninus.” Rabbi Afes remonstrated that Judah treated his honor too lightly. Judah replied that he was not better than his ancestor, who in Genesis 32:5 sent a message saying: “Thus says your servant Jacob.”"
