            "<b>“It was during the days of Aḥashverosh; that Aḥashverosh who reigned from India to Kush, over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces” (Esther 1:1).</b><br>Rav began: “Your life will be suspended before you, and you will fear night and day, and you will not be assured of your life” (Deuteronomy 28:66). The Rabbis and Rabbi Berekhya; the Rabbis said: “Your life will be suspended before you,” that is one who purchases wheat for a year. “And you will fear night and day,” that is one who purchases wheat for himself from the retailer. “And you will not be assured of your life,” that is one who purchases for himself from the baker. <br>Rabbi Berekhya said: “Your life will be suspended before you,” that is one who purchases wheat for himself for three years. “And you will fear night and day,” that is one who purchases wheat for himself for one year. “And you will not be assured of your life,” that is one who purchases wheat for himself from the retailer. <br>The Rabbis objected to Rabbi Berekhya: What of the one who purchases from the baker? He said to them: The Torah did not speak of the dead. <br>Alternatively, “your life will be suspended before you,” that is one who is placed in the prisons of Caesarea. “And you will fear night and day,” that is one who is taken to judgment. “And you will not be assured of your life,” that is one who is taken out to be hanged. <br>Rav interpreted the verse as relating to Haman:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Specifically, relating to the effect of Haman’s decree on Israel.</i> “Your life will be suspended before you,”  – on the day following the removal of the ring.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Aḥashverosh removed his ring and gave it to Haman when he authorized him to do as he saw fit to the Jews (Esther 3:10-11).</i> “And you will fear night and day” – when the letters were dispatched.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Haman sent written orders to all the provinces for the people to prepare themselves to kill the Jews (Esther 3:13-15).</i> “And you will not be assured of your life” – “to be ready for that day” (Esther 3:14).",
            "<b>“In the morning you will say: Would that it were evening, and in the evening you will say: Would that it were morning – from your heart’s fear that you experience and your eyes’ sight that you see” (Deuteronomy 28:67).</b><br>“In the morning you will say: Would that it were evening” – in the morning of Babylonia you will say: ‘Would that it were its evening.’ In the morning of Media, you will say: ‘Would that it were its evening.’ In the morning of Greece, you will say: ‘Would that it were its evening.’ In the morning of Edom, you will say: ‘Would that it were its evening.’<br>Alternatively, “in the morning you will say: Would that it were evening,” in the morning of Babylonia you will say: Would that it were the evening of Media. In the morning of Media, you will say: Would that it were the evening of Greece. In the morning of Greece, you will say: Would that it were the evening of Edom. Why? “From your heart’s fear that you experience and your eyes’ sight that you see” (Deuteronomy 28:67).",
            "<b>“The Lord will return you to Egypt in ships [<i>baoniyyot</i>], by the route of which I said to you: You will never see it again; and you will offer yourselves for sale there to your enemies, as slaves and as maidservants, and there will be no buyer” (Deuteronomy 28:68).</b><br>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: “In ships” [<i>baoniyyot</i>] – in poverty [<i>baaniyyut</i>]<i> </i>of good deeds. Why to Egypt? Because a slave experiences humiliation and mistreatment when he returns to his original master. Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: In three places, the Holy One blessed be He cautions Israel not to return to Egypt. The first, as it is stated: “For as you saw Egypt [today, you shall not see them ever again]” (Exodus 14:13). The second, it is written: “The Lord said to you: You shall not return again on that way anymore” (Deuteronomy 17:16). This is the third, as it is written: “The Lord will return you to Egypt in ships” (Deuteronomy 28:68).<br>They [Israel] contravened all three of them and were punished for all three of them. The first, during the reign of Sanḥeriv, as it is stated: “Woe! Those who descend to Egypt for aid” (Isaiah 31:1), and what is written thereafter: “Egypt is man, not god […and all of them will perish together]” (Isaiah 31:3). Second, during the days of Yoḥanan ben Kare’aḥ, as it is stated: “It shall be that the sword which you fear [will overtake you there in the land of Egypt]” (Jeremiah 42:16). The third, during the reign of Trajan, may his bones be crushed: His wife gave birth on the Ninth of Av when all Israel was mourning. The baby died on Hanukkah. Israel said: Shall we light [Hanukkah lamps], or not light? They said: We shall light, and anything that he seeks to inflict upon us, let him inflict. They lit. They went and slandered them to Trajan’s wife: Those Jews,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference is possibly to the Jews of Egypt who participated in the Kitos War (115-117), a rebellion against the Romans during Trajan’s reign.</i> when you gave birth, they were mourning, when the baby died, they lit lamps. She sent a missive to her husband: Before you conquer the barbarians, come and conquer these Jews who have rebelled against you. He boarded the ship and expected to arrive in ten days, and the wind brought him in five days. He arrived and found them engaged in this verse: “The Lord will bring a nation against you from afar, from the end of the earth, as the eagle will swoop” (Deuteronomy 28:49). He said to them: I am the eagle, as I expected to arrive in ten days and the wind brought me in five days. His legions surrounded them and killed them.<br>“And there is no buyer [<i>koneh</i>]” (Deuteronomy 28:68). Why is there no buyer? Rav said: It is because you did not impart the words of the covenant, as there is no one among you who is a buyer [<i>koneh</i>] of [i.e., one who learns] the five books of the Torah, the numerical value of <i>koneh</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>koneh </i>– <i>kof</i>, <i>vav</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>heh</i> – can be read as <i>koneh heh</i>, i.e. ‘buyer of <i>heh</i>.’ The numerical equivalent of <i>heh</i> is five.</i> Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: Because I went around to all the nations of the world and there was no one acquiring [no buyer of] the words of the Torah like you [Israel] did. Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzhak said: You have acquisition of [members of] the nations of the world [i.e. the ability to buy them as slaves], as it is stated: “Also from the children of the resident aliens who reside with you, from them you shall acquire” (Leviticus 25:45); but the nations have no acquisition of you. Why do you have acquisition of the nations of the world? It is because you imparted: “These are the words of the covenant” (Deuteronomy 28:69). Why don’t the nations of the world have acquisition in you? It is because they did not acquire: “These are the words of the covenant.”<br>Rabbi Yonatan said: You have patrons, and what are they? They are the words of the covenant. Rabbi Yuda said: You are property of the crown; Isn’t the life of one who takes a slave from the property of the crown forfeit? And so Aḥashverosh said to his wife: “Behold, I gave the house of Haman to Esther [and they hanged him on the gibbet]” (Esther 8:7), and Rabbi Yuda bar Rabbi Simon said: It is because he extended his hand to harm the property of the crown, so it befell him.<br>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: There was an incident in Protzefya involving a certain woman who would redeem captives. One captive woman came, and she redeemed her. A second, and she redeemed her. When her means failed her and she was unable to redeem any more, soldiers immediately surrounded her and killed her. Why did they go to that extreme? In order to motivate future captors.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The local soldiers killed her in order to motivate future captors to kill their prisoners rather than hold them for ransom.</i> <br>Rabbi Levi and Rabbi Yitzḥak. Rabbi Levi said: Who acquires a friend, and the next day he is executed? Who acquires a wife, and the next day she is executed? Rabbi Yitzḥak said: You will not be acquired as slaves and maidservants, but you will be acquired to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be eliminated, as Esther said to Aḥashverosh: “For we have been sold, my people and I, to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be eliminated; had we been sold as slaves and as maidservants, I would have been silent” (Esther 7:4). And so Moses wrote about us in the Torah: “And you will sell yourselves there to your enemies as slaves and as maidservants, and there will be no buyer” (Deuteronomy 28:68); perhaps to be destroyed, to  be killed, and to be eliminated? When everyone saw, they began screaming: ‘Woe!’ “It was [<i>vayhi</i>],” woe [<i>vai</i>] for what transpired during the reign of Aḥashverosh.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The first verse of Esther begins <i>Va-yhi bi-mei Aḥashverosh</i>, “It was during the days of Aḥashverosh.”</i>",
            "<b>“And despite this, even when they are in the land of their enemies, I have not spurned them and have not rejected them, to destroy them, to violate My covenant with them, as I am the Lord their God” (Leviticus 26:44).</b><br>Shmuel began: “And despite this, even when they are in the land of their enemies, I have not spurned them and have not rejected them, to destroy them, to violate My covenant with them, as I am the Lord their God.” – “I have not spurned them,” in Babylonia; “and have not rejected them,” in Media; “to destroy them,” in Greece; “to violate My covenant with them,” in the evil kingdom;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rome.</i> “as I am the Lord their God,” in the future. Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: “I have not spurned them,” during the reign of Vespasian; “and have not rejected them,” during the reign of Trajan; “to destroy them,” in the days of Haman; “to violate My covenant with them,” in the days of the Romans; “as I am the Lord their God,” in the days of Gog and Magog.",
            "<b>“As when a man fled from the lion and a bear attacked him; he came home and leaned his hand on the wall, and a snake bit him” (Amos 5:19).</b><br>Rabbi Yuda son of Rabbi Simon began: “As when a man fled from the lion and a bear attacked him; he came home and leaned his hand on the wall, and a snake bit him.” Rabbi Huna and Rabbi Aḥa in the name of Rabbi Ḥama bar Rabbi Ḥanina said: “As when a man fled from the lion,” that is Babylonia, according to: “The first was like a lion” (Daniel 7:4); “and a bear attacked him,” that is Media, according to: “And behold, another beast, a second one, resembling a bear” (Daniel 7:5). <br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: <i>le dev</i> is written [“a second one, resembling a bear (<i>dov</i>)].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> The words in the verse in Daniel 7:5 <i>domeh le-dov</i>, “resembling a bear,” could be vocalized <i>domeh le-dev</i>, meaning resembling a wolf, as <i>dev</i> can mean wolf in Aramaic.</i> This is the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: “Therefore, a lion from the forest smote them” (Jeremiah 5:6), that is Babylonia; “a wolf of the deserts will plunder them” (Jeremiah 5:6), that is Media; “a leopard lies in wait near their cities” (Jeremiah 5:6), that is Greece; “everyone who emerges from them will be mauled” (Jeremiah 5:6), that is Edom; “he comes home” (Amos 5:19), that is Greece when the Temple stood; “and a snake bit him” (Amos 5:19), that is Edom, as it is stated: “Its sound will go forth like a snake” (Jeremiah 46:22).<br>Likewise, it says: “Open for me, my sister, my love, my dove, my faultless one,” (Song of Songs 5:2). “Open for me, my sister,” that is Babylonia; “my love,” that is Media; “my faultless one,” in Greece; “my dove,” in Edom, as throughout the days of Greece[’s hegemony] the Temple was standing and Israel was offering doves and pigeons on the altar.<br>Rabbi Pinḥas and Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina offered an interpretation [of “In my distress I called to the Lord and to my God I cried; from His Sanctuary He heard my voice, and my cry before Him came into His ears” (Psalms 18:7)]: It is written: “In my distress I called to the Lord,” in Babylonia; “and to my God I cried,” in Media; from His Sanctuary He heard my voice,” in Greece, as Rabbi Huna himself said: “My dove,” in Greece, as throughout the days of Greece, the Temple was standing and Israel was offering there doves and pigeons on the altar. That is: “from His Sanctuary He heard my voice and my cry before Him came into His ears,” in the kingdom of Edom.<br>Another matter: “ As when a man fled from the lion,” that is Nebuchadnezzar; “and a bear attacked him,” that is Belshatzar; “he came home and leaned his hand on the wall, and a snake bit him,” that is Haman, who would crush the people like a snake. That is as it is written: “Reḥum the commander and Shimshai the scribe” (Ezra 4:8), that is the son of Haman; “wrote a letter…to Artaxerxes the king, as follows” (ibid.). And what was written in it? “Now issue a decree to cease, and that this city not be rebuilt ….” (Ezra 4:21), [“they will no longer pay] <i>minda</i>” (Ezra 4:13), that is land tax; “<i>belo</i>” (ibid.), that is the poll tax; and “<i>halakh</i>” (ibid.), that is the king’s service; “and the revenue of the kings will be harmed” (ibid.). Rav Huna and Rabbi Pinḥas said: Even things with which the kingdom entertains itself, e.g., theaters and circuses, this people harms. When he sent it, it was received by the king, and he canceled work on the Temple. When they saw that, everyone began screaming: 'Woe [<i>vai</i>];' “it was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the days of Aḥashverosh” (Esther 1:1).",
            "Rabbi Yitzḥak began: “With the rise of the righteous the people rejoice, and with the rule of the wicked the people sigh.” (Proverbs 29:2). When the righteous achieve prominence, there is joy and happiness in the world; there is joy [<i>va</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word king [<i>melekh</i>] is preceded with the prefix <i>vav</i> <i>heh</i>. <i>Va </i>is an expression of joy.</i> <i> </i>in the world: “And the King [<i>vehamelekh</i>] David” (II Samuel 3:31), <i>va  </i>that David reigned; “and the King [<i>vehamelekh</i>]  Solomon” (I Kings 2:45)<i> va  </i>that Solomon reigned; “and the King [<i>vehamelekh</i>] Asa” (I Kings 15:22), <i>va  </i>that Asa reigned. This is regarding kings of Israel; from where [do we know] regarding kings of the nations of the world? As it is stated: “And Cyrus the King [<i>vehamelekh</i>]” (Ezra 1:4), <i>va </i>that Cyrus reigned.<br>But when the wicked achieve prominence, woe [<i>vai</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word reign [<i>yimlokh</i>] is preceded with the prefix <i>vav</i> <i>yod</i>. <i>Vai</i> is an expression of woe.</i> sighing, and enflamed wrath are in the world. “Ahab son of Omri reigned [<i>vayimlokh</i>] over Israel” (I Kings 16:29), <i>vai</i> that Ahab son of Omri reigned. “Hoshe’a son of Ela…reigned [<i>vayimlokh</i>]” (II Kings 15:30), <i>vai</i> that Hoshe’a son of Ela reigned. “Zedekiah son of Yoshiyahu reigned [<i>vayimlokh</i>]” (Jeremiah 37:1), <i>vai</i> that Zedekiah son of Josiah reigned. Regarding kings of the nations of the world, it is as it is written: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the days of Aḥashverosh” (Esther 1:1), <i>vai</i> that Aḥashverosh reigned.",
            "Rabbi Levi began: “But if you will not dispossess the inhabitants of the land from before you, those who you leave will be like  thorns in your eyes, and like stones in your sides, and they will trouble you in the land you inhabit” (Numbers 33:55). [This verse] refers to Saul. When Samuel said to him: “Now go and smite Amalek” (I Samuel 15:3), he said to him: You went innocent and you returned guilty and spared him, as it is stated: “Saul and the people spared Agag” (I Samuel 15:9). A scion will remain from him, who will perform harsh actions against you; “will be like thorns in your eyes, and like stones in your sides.” And who is that? It is Haman, who said: “To destroy, to kill, and to eliminate” (Esther 3:13). When everyone saw that it was so, they began screaming: ‘Woe [<i>vai</i>];’ “it was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the days of Aḥashverosh” (Esther 1:1).",
            "Rabbi Ḥanina bar Ada began: [“The words of the mouth of a wise man are grace, and the lips of a fool will swallow him” (Ecclesiastes 10:12).] “The words of the mouth of a wise man are grace” – that is Cyrus, as it is stated: “So said Cyrus king of Persia: The Lord, God of the heavens, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and He has commanded me to build Him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah” (Ezra 1:2). “And the lips of a fool will swallow him” – as he (Cyrus) said: “He is the God who is in Jerusalem”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The implication being that He is only the god of Jerusalem, which demonstrates Cyrus’ foolishness.</i> (Ezra 1:3).<br>“The beginning of the words from his mouth is foolishness and the result from his mouth is evil debauchery” (Ecclesiastes 10:13). What is the foolishness? “Any of you from all His people, may his God be with him…”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“His God,” implying that other nations have their own gods.</i> (Ezra 1:3). “The result from his mouth is evil debauchery,” as he decreed, saying: Whoever crossed the Euphrates, crossed; and whoever has not crossed, shall not cross. <br>Another matter: “The beginning of the words...” that is Aḥashverosh, as it is stated: “In the reign of Aḥashverosh, at the beginning of his reign, they wrote a libel against the residents of Judah and Jerusalem.” (Ezra 4:6). “The result from his mouth is evil debauchery,” as he went up and cancelled the work on the Temple. When everyone saw that it was so, they began screaming: ‘Woe [<i>vai</i>];’ “it was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the days of Aḥashverosh” (Esther 1:1).",
            "Rabbi Yuda son of Rabbi Simon began: “From a hypocritical person’s rule; from snares of the people” (Job 34:30). Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish: Rabbi Yoḥanan said: When the king is a hypocrite and rules the people, “from snares [<i>mimokeshei</i>] of the people,” it is due to the stubbornness [<i>kashyuteihen</i>] and the liabilities of the people who do not perform the will of the Creator of the world. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: It is preferable for people to grow themselves wings and fly in the air rather than for them to be turned over and subjugated to a hypocritical king. <br>Alternatively, “from a hypocritical person’s rule,” that is Aḥashverosh, who was hypocritical, who killed his wife because of his friend, and a different time killed his friend because of his wife. <br>Abba Oriyan of Sidon said five things in the name of Rabban Gamliel: <br>When lying judges increase, lying witnesses increase. <br>When informants increase, the property of the people is plundered. <br>When brazenness increases, glory, majesty, and honor are taken from the people.<br>When the actions of beloved children anger their Father in Heaven, He sets over them a hypocritical king who exacts retribution from them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Abba Oriyan is said to list five things he heard from Rabban Gamliel, and this list contains only four. In <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Esther, 1,044, the following is inserted here: “When the younger says to the elder: I am greater than you, the lives of people are truncated.”</i> <br>And who is this? It is Aḥashverosh. When everyone saw that it was so, they began screaming; ‘Woe [<i>vai</i>];’ “it was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the days of Aḥashverosh” (Esther 1:1).",
            "Rabbi Berekhya began: “Who acted and accomplished it? He who proclaimed the generations from the beginning; I, the Lord was first and with the last, I am He” (Isaiah 41:4). From the beginning of the creation of the world, the Holy One, blessed be He, instituted for each and every person what is appropriate for him: Adam, head of the created; Cain, head of the killers; Abel, head of the killed; Noah, head of the survivors; Abraham, head of the circumcised; Isaac, head of the bound; Jacob, head of the wholehearted; Judah, head of the tribes; Joseph, head of the pious; Aaron, head of the priests; Moses, head of the prophets; Joshua, head of the conquerors; Otniel, head of the allocators;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He completed the allocation of the tribal portions that Joshua did not allocate in his lifetime.</i> Samuel, of the anointers; Saul, of the anointed; David, of the musicians; Solomon, head of the builders; Nebuchadnezzar, head of the destroyers; Aḥashverosh, head of the sellers; Haman, head of the buyers; when everyone saw that it was so, they began screaming: ‘Woe [<i>vai</i>];’  “it was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the days of Aḥashverosh” (Esther 1:1).",
            "Rabbi Tanḥuma, Rabbi Berekhya, and Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great interpreted in the name of Rabbi Elazar: This midrash came up with us from the Exile. Everyplace that <i>vayhi</i> is stated, it means nothing but trouble. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman interpreted in the name of Rabbi Yonatan: This midrash came into our possession. Everyplace that <i>vayhi bimei</i> is stated, it means nothing but trouble. <br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: They are five:<br>“It was during the days of [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] Amrafel king of Shinar, Ariokh, king of Elasar, Kedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal, king of Goyim” (Genesis 14:1). What was the trouble there? “They waged war with Bera, king of Sodom…” (Genesis 14:2). [This is analogous] to the beloved of a king who resided in a province and, for his sake, the king attended to that province. When barbarians came and afflicted him [the beloved of the king], they [the other residents of the province] said: ‘Woe unto us that the king is not attending to the province the way that he once did.’ So too, Abraham our patriarch, the beloved of the Holy One, blessed be He, “all the families of the earth shall be blessed in you” (Genesis 12:4). For his sake, the Holy One blessed be He attended to His entire world. That is what is written: “They returned and came to Ein Mishpat, which is Kadesh” (Genesis 14:7). They sought to afflict only the eye of the world [Abraham]. They sought to blind the eye that acts upon the attribute of justice in the world. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> This probably means that Abraham is responsible for the suppression of the attribute of justice, the result of which is that God rules the world through the attribute of mercy.</i> “Which is [<i>hi</i>] Kadesh” – Rabbi Aḥa said: <i>Hu </i>[i.e. he rather than she] is written. He [Abraham] sanctified [<i>kiddesh</i>] the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, and he went into the fiery furnace. When everyone saw that all the kings came to afflict him, they began screaming: ‘Woe [<i>vai</i>];’ “it was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the reign of Amrafel.”<br>“It was during the days [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] when the judges judged; there was a famine in the land and a man from Bethlehem in Judah went to stay in the field of Moab, he, his wife, and his two sons” (Ruth 1:1). What was the trouble there? “There was a famine in the land.” [This is comparable] to a province that owed a tax to the king, and the king sent a tax collector to collect it. What did the residents of the province do? They suspended him [on a pole] and struck him and extracted it [the money] from him. They said: Woe unto us when the king becomes aware of these matters; we did to the emissary of the king what he sought to do to us. So too, when one of the people of Israel would perform inappropriate actions, they would take him to the judge, and what the judge sought to do to the defendant, the defendant would do to the judge. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them: You humiliate your judges; by your lives, I will bring upon you a matter that you are unable to endure. What is that? It is famine, as it is stated: “It was during the days when the judges judged, there was a famine in the land” (Ruth 1:1).<br>“It was during the days of [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] Aḥaz son of Yotam, son of Uziyahu, king of Judah; Retzin, king of Aram and Pekaḥ, son of Remalyahu, king of Israel, went to war against Jerusalem, but he was unable to make war against it” (Isaiah 7:1). What was the trouble there? It was as it is written: “Aram from the east and the Philistines from the west” (Isaiah 9:11). [This is comparable] to a king who handed his son over to a tutor, and his tutor hated him. He said: If I kill him, I will be condemned to death by the king; instead, I will withhold his nurse from him, and he will die on his own. So too, Aḥaz said: If there are no kids, there are no goats, and if there are no goats there is no flock, and if there is no flock there is no shepherd, and if there is no shepherd, the world cannot exist. So Aḥaz thought and said: If there are no children, there are no adults, and if there are no adults there are no students, if there are no students there are no scholars, if there are no scholars there are no elders, if there are no elders there is no Torah, if there is no Torah there are no synagogues and study halls, if there are no synagogues and study halls, the Holy One, blessed be He, will not rest His Divine Presence in the world. What did he do? He arose and locked all the synagogues and study halls, so that no one would engage in Torah study. That is what is written: “Bind the testimony, seal the Torah in my disciples” (Isaiah 8:16). <br>Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Elazar: Why was he named Aḥaz? It is because he seized [<i>aḥaz</i>] the synagogues and study halls. Rabbi Yaakov bar Abba in the name of Rabbi Aḥa derived it from this verse, as it is written: “I will wait for the Lord, who conceals His face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope for Him” (Isaiah 8:17). There was no time that was as grim for Israel as that time, as it is stated: “I will conceal My face on that day because of all the evil that they did…” (Deuteronomy 31:18). But from that moment I hoped for Him,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A reference to the verse quoted above “I will wait for the Lord, who conceals His face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope for Him” (Isaiah 8:17).</i> as it is written: “As it will not be forgotten from the mouths of their descendants” (Deuteronomy 31:21). What did you [Aḥaz] accomplish? “Behold, I [Isaiah] and the children whom the Lord gave me are to become signs and wonders in Israel” (Isaiah 8:18). Were they his children? Surely, they were nothing but his students! Rather, from here [we learn] that a person’s student is called his son. Once everyone saw that he seized the synagogues and study halls, they began screaming: Woe [<i>vai</i>]: “it was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the days of Aḥaz.”<br>“It was during the days of [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] Yehoyakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the exile of Jerusalem in the fifth month” (Jeremiah 1:3). What was the trouble there? “I saw the land, and behold, it is emptiness and disorder; the heavens, and their light is not” (Jeremiah 4:23). [This is comparable] to a king who sent letters from province to province and in each and every province that his letters reached, they would embrace and kiss them, standing on their feet, baring their heads and reading them with reverence, fear, quaking, and trembling. When they reached the king’s province, they read them, ripped them, and burned them. That is what is written: “It was, as Yehudi would read three columns or four,” (Jeremiah 36:23) – three or four verses. When they reached the fifth verse: “Its besiegers are ascendant” (Lamentations 1:5), immediately: “He would cut it with a scribe’s razor and cast it into the fire that was in the fireplace” (Jeremiah 36:23). Once everyone saw that it was so, they began screaming: ‘Woe [<i>vai</i>];’ “it was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the days of Yehoyakim.”<br>“It was during the days of [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] Aḥashverosh; that Aḥashverosh who reigned from India to Kush, one hundred and twenty-seven provinces” (Esther 1:1). What was the trouble there? It was “to destroy, to kill, and to eliminate” (Esther 3:13). [This is comparable] to a king who entered a vineyard and encountered three enemies: The first began picking unripe grapes, the second began trimming the clusters, and the third began uprooting vines. So too, wicked Pharaoh began picking unripe grapes; that is what is written: “Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying: Every son who is born you shall cast into the Nile…” (Exodus 1:22). <br>Nebuchadnezzar, may his bones be crushed, began trimming the clusters; that is what is written: “He exiled Yehoyakhin…and the artisans and the smiths, one thousand” (II Kings 24:14). Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Yehuda said: One thousand artisans and one thousand smiths; the Rabbis said: One thousand artisans and smiths. Rabbi Yuda son of Rabbi Simon said: These are the Torah scholars. Rabbi Shmuel bar Rabbi Yitzḥak said: These are the notables. <br>Haman the wicked, may he be crushed and wiped out, began uprooting the vines; that is what is written: “To destroy, to kill, and to eliminate” (Esther 3:13). He sought to undermine the foundation of Israel, he wanted to devastate the whole house [of Israel]. Once everyone saw that it was so, they began screaming: ‘Woe [<i>vai</i>];’ “it was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the days of Aḥashverosh.”<br>Shimon bar Abba in the name of Rabbi Yonatan said: Everywhere that <i>vayhi </i>is stated it refers to trouble or to joy; if it is to trouble, it is unparalleled trouble, if it is to joy, it is unparalleled joy. Rabban Shmuel bar Naḥman came and suggested a different distinction: Everywhere that it says <i>vayhi </i>(it was), it refers to trouble, everywhere that it says <i>vehaya </i>(it will be), joy. <br>They objected: Is it not written: “God said: Let there be light, and there was [<i>vayhi</i>] light”? He said to them: Even that is not joy, as the world did not merit to use that light. Rabbi Yuda son of Rabbi Simon said: By the light that was created on the first day, a person could look out and see from one end of the world to the other end. When the Holy One, blessed be He, perceived that the generation of Enosh, the generation of the flood, and the generation of the dispersion (after the Tower of Babel) were destined to sin before Him, He arose and concealed it from them. That is what is written: “From the wicked was withheld their light” (Job 38:15). Where did He conceal it? In the Garden of Eden; that is what is written: “Light is sown for the righteous and joy for the upright” (Psalms 97:11). <br>They objected: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] evening and it was morning, one day” (Genesis 1:5). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as everything that was created on the first day is destined to wither; that is what is written: “As the heavens will be eroded like smoke and the earth will be tattered like a garment” (Isaiah 51:6).<br>They objected: It is written: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] evening and it was morning, a second day,” “…a third day,” through the sixth day. He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as everything that was created during the six days of Creation requires action, as they were not completely made, e.g. wheat requires grinding, and mustard and lupines require sweetening.<br>They objected: “The Lord was [<i>vayhi</i>] with Joseph” (Genesis 39:2). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as that resulted in that bear<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Potifar’s wife.</i> confronting him. <br>They objected: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] on the eighth day, Moses summoned Aaron and his sons” (Leviticus 9:1). He said to them: That, too, is not good, as on that day, Nadav and Avihu died and all of Israel lamented them, as it is stated: “Your brethren, the entire house of Israel, will lament the burning” (Leviticus 10:6).<br>They objected: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] on the day that Moses completed assembling the Tabernacle” (Numbers 7:1). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as it was put away when the eternal Temple was built.<br>They objected: “The Lord was [<i>vayhi</i>] with Joshua” (Joshua 6:27). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as on that day Ya’ir, who was equivalent to the majority of Sanhedrin, was killed; that is what is written: “The men of Ai smote them, about thirty-six men” (Joshua 7:5). Thirty-six men is not written, but rather “like thirty-six;”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> The verse says: “The men of the Ai killed about thirty-six [<i>ki-shloshim ve-shisha</i>] men…” The prepositional ‘<i>ki-</i>’ can designate approximation, “about thirty-six” or comparison, “like thirty-six.”</i> that is Ya’ir, who was equivalent to the majority of Sanhedrin [of 70 or 71 members]. What is written there? “Joshua rent his garments” (Joshua 7:6).<br>They objected: “David was [<i>vayhi</i>] successful in all his ways” (I Samuel 18:14). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as it resulted in what is written: Saul felt enmity to David” (I Samuel 18:9).<br>They objected: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] when David dwelled in his house” (I Chronicles 17:1). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as on that day, Natan the prophet came and said to him: “It will not be you who builds Me the House” (I Chronicles 17:4).<br>They said to him: We said ours, now you say yours. He said to them, it is written: “It will be [<i>vehaya</i>] on that day, the mountains will drip with nectar and the hills will flow with milk” (Joel 4:18). “It will be [<i>vehaya</i>] on that day that spring water will emerge from Jerusalem” (Zechariah 14:8). “It will be [<i>vehaya</i>] on that day, each man shall keep a calf of the herd and two sheep alive, and from the abundance of milk produced, he will eat butter, for everyone who remains in the midst of the land will eat butter and honey” (Isaiah 7:21-22). “The remnant of Jacob will be [<i>vehaya</i>] among the nations, in the midst of many peoples like a lion among the beasts of the forest, like a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he passes, tramples and mauls, and there is no deliverer” (Micah 5:7). “It will be [<i>vehaya</i>] on that day, that a great shofar will be sounded, and the lost in the land of Assyria and the outcasts in the land of Egypt will come and bow down to the Lord on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.” (Isaiah 27:13). “He will be [<i>vehaya</i>] like a tree planted near streams of water which yields fruit in season; its leaves shall not wither, and whatever he does will prosper” (Psalms 1:3). <br>They objected to him: “And it was [<i>vehaya</i>] when Jerusalem was captured” (Jeremiah 38:28). He said to them: Even that is not trouble but joy, as on that day, Menaḥem<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Messiah.</i> was born and Israel made penance for its sins, as Rav and Shmuel say: Israel made great penance at the moment that the Temple was destroyed.

Rabbi Yuda son of Rabbi Simon said: Who sought to undermine the foundation of Israel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, to undermine the egg of Israel. The wordplay with the name Aḥashverosh is obscure in this case. Perhaps it involves the word הוריש, meaning to dispossess or destroy.</i> Rabbi Taḥlifa bar bar Ḥana said: Who was the brother [<i>aḥ</i>] of a leader [<i>rosh</i>], the brother of Nebuchadnezzar. Was he his brother? Was not this one a Chaldean and that one a Median? Rather, this one canceled the construction of the Temple, and that one destroyed it; therefore, Scripture equated them. That is what is written: “Even one who is lax in his work is brother to a master of destruction.” (Proverbs 18:9). “Even one who is lax in his work,” that is Aḥashverosh, who canceled the construction of the Temple. “Is brother to a master of destruction,” that is Nebuchadnezzar, who destroyed the Temple.<br>Alternatively, “Aḥashverosh” – Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya: One said: “Aḥashverosh,” who killed his wife [Vashti] because of his beloved one [Haman]; “that Aḥashverosh,” who killed his beloved one [Haman] because of his wife [Esther]. Rabbi Neḥemya said: “Aḥashverosh,” who canceled the construction of the Temple; “that Aḥashverosh,” who decreed that it should be rebuilt. Was it him who decreed? Was it not Cyrus who decreed? Rather, it is written: “During the first year of King Cyrus” (Ezra 6:3). During that year, all his advisers came to him; they said to him: ‘Your father decreed about it that it shall not be rebuilt, and you decree about it that it shall be rebuilt? Does a king abrogate the decrees of another king?’ He said to them: ‘Bring me the copies of the decrees.’ Immediately, they brought them to him. That is what is written: “A scroll was found in Aḥmeta in the capital” (Ezra 6:2). What was written in it? “Now, issue a decree to cancel” (Ezra 4:21). He said to them: ‘Is ‘forever’ written? It is only written: “Until a decree from me will be issued.” Who can say to me that were my father alive, he would not have built it?’ Therefore, he is included with the prophets; that is what is written: “The elders of the Jews built and prospered [in accordance with the prophecy of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah son of Ido, and built and finished, by the decree of the God of Israel, and by the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaḥshasta<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash identifies Artaḥshasta king of Persia as Aḥashverosh.</i> king of Persia]” (Ezra 6:14).",

                "“It was during the days of Aḥashverosh…” Rabbi Levi and the Rabbis, Rabbi Levi said: Aḥashverosh is Artaḥshasta. The Rabbis say: [He was called] Aḥashverosh, since anyone who remembers him, his head hurts [<i>ḥoshesh et rosho</i>]. Why did Scripture call him Artaḥshasta? It is because he would anger [<i>martiaḥ</i>] and exhaust<i> </i>[<i>vetash</i>] [others]. Aḥashverosh – Rabbi Yitzḥak and the Rabbis, Rabbi Yitzḥak said: “Aḥashverosh” – as all the troubles came during his days, as it is stated: “there was great mourning among the Jews” (Esther 4:3). “That is Aḥashverosh” – as all the good came during his days, as it is stated: “Joy and gladness for the Jews, a banquet and a holiday” (Esther 8:17).

The Babylonian Talmud (<i>Megila</i> 11a) records two opinions: one that they are at opposite ends of the earth (consistent with their identification with India and Ethiopia) and the other that they were adjacent to one another, as is implied here.</i> Rather, just as he reigned from <i>Hodu</i> to <i>Kush</i>, so he reigned over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces. On a similar note: “For he [Solomon] ruled over the entire region beyond the river, from Tifsaḥ to Gaza” (I Kings 5:4), but isn’t it a short distance from Tifsaḥ to Gaza? Rather, just as he reigned from Tifsaḥ to Gaza, so he reigned from one end of the world to the other end. <br>Similarly, “From your palace to Jerusalem, kings bring gifts to You”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The literal reading of the verse is “From Your Temple above Jerusalem, to You will kings bring gifts.” The midrash is reading the verse to mean that the kings will bring gifts from the king’s palace to the Temple in Jerusalem.</i> (Psalms 68:30) –  is it not but a short distance from your palace [i.e. the king’s palace] to [the Temple in] Jerusalem? Rather, just as it is commonplace that the sacrificial offerings [go] from the palace to [the Temple in] Jerusalem, so too, processions with gifts are destined to be commonplace for the messianic king. That is what is written: “All kings will prostrate themselves before him” (Psalms 72:11). Rabbi Kohen, brother of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, said: Just as the Divine Presence is found between the Temple and Jerusalem, so will the Divine Presence fill the world from one end to the other end.

Solomon ruled over them all; that is what is written: “Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms...” (I Kings 5:1). Aḥav ruled over them all; that is what is written: “As the Lord your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom [to where my lord did not send to seek you]” (I Kings 18:10). Does a person take an oath about a place that he does not rule? Additionally, from here: “He counted the young princes of the dominions, and they were two hundred and thirty-two…” (I Kings 20:15). Where were the rest?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Earlier it was said that there were two hundred and fifty-two provinces, and here there are representatives of only two hundred and thirty-two dominions.</i> Rabbi Levi and the Rabbis: Rabbi Levi said: They ceased to exist in the famine during the days of Eliyahu. The Rabbis said that Ben Haddad came and took them. That is what is written: “Ben Haddad king of Aram gathered his entire army, and thirty-two kings were with him, and horses and chariots; he went and besieged Samaria, and waged war against it” (I Kings 20:1). We need twenty, and you say thirty-two? Rather, there were provinces that were intractable, and he would take two [young princes] from them as hostages in his charge.<br>Rabbi Berekhya and the Rabbis [related to the verse: “He pierced my kidneys with the contents of his quiver [<i>benei ashpato</i>]” (Lamentations 3:13)].  Rabbi Berekhya said: These were the captives [<i>benei ukaifi</i>] and the hostages [<i>benei emuryai</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These were the “contents of his quiver,” with which God pierced Israel’s kidneys.</i> The Rabbis said: <i>Benei ukaifi</i> – as they were subjugated with manacles [<i>arkof</i>], and <i>benei emuryai</i> – as they were substitutes [<i>temurot</i>] for their fathers. And so it says: “And the hostages [<i>benei hataaruvot</i>]” (II Kings 14:14), they were guarantees [<i>me’uravot</i>] for their fathers.<br>Nebuchadnezzar ruled over them all; that is what is written: “Everywhere the sons of man, the beasts of the field, and the birds of the heavens dwell, [He has given into your hand and set your rule over them all]” (Daniel 2:38).

Darius ruled over them all; that is what is written: “Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, [the nations, and the [speakers of different] languages that reside in the entire earth]” (Daniel 6:26). Aḥashverosh ruled over half of them. Why over half of them? Rabbi Huna in the name of Rabbi Aḥa and the Rabbis, Rabbi Huna in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: The Holy One blessed be He said to him: You divided my kingdom, as you said: “He is the God, who is in Jerusalem” (Ezra 1:3); by your life, I am going to divide your kingdom.

Rabbi Yudan in the name of Rabbi Ayevu: It is written: “I have trodden a winepress alone and from the peoples there was no man with Me...” (Isaiah 63:3). Does the Holy One blessed be He need the help of the nations, that He said: “And from the peoples there was no man with Me?” Rather, this is what the Holy One blessed be He said: When I examine the ledgers of the nations of the world and no merit will be found for them before Me, at that moment, “I trod on them in My wrath and I trampled them in My fury” (Isaiah 63:3). <br>Rabbi Pinḥas and Rabbi Ḥilkiyya said in the name of Rabbi Simon: It is written: “It shall be on that day that I will seek to destroy all the nations [that come against Jerusalem]” (Zechariah 12:9).

Your hand will be present [<i>metzuya</i>] to repay Your enemies, You will present [<i>tamtze</i>] the attribute of justice to them, You will present [<i>tamtze</i>] them with how few are the good deeds they performed; therefore, it says: “Your hand will find all Your enemies.”",

The Rabbis said: Six, as it is stated: “And many houses will be destroyed – the utterance of the Lord” (ibid.). And here it says: “A great throne of ivory”? (I Kings 10:18; II Chronicles 9:17).<br>Rabbi Hoshaya the Great said: It was made according to the specifications of the chariot of the One who spoke and the world came into existence, the Holy One blessed be He. And so it says: “There were six stairs to the throne” (I Kings 10:19; II Chronicles 9:18) – six stairs corresponding to six heavens. But aren’t there seven? Rabbi Avun said: That where the King resides is separate. <br>Six [stairs] corresponding to six lands [i.e., types of lands]: Land, Ground, Earth, Valley, Desert, Desolation, and World,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">World is the seventh ‘land,’ and is the place from which God judges the others.</i> and it is written: “He will judge the world in righteousness, He will administer fair judgment to the nations” (Psalms 9:9). <br>Six corresponding to the six orders of the Mishna: <i>Zera’im</i> – Seeds; <i>Moed </i>– Appointed times; <i>Nashim </i>– Women; <i>Nezikin </i> – Damages; <i>Kodashim </i> – Consecrations; <i>Teharot</i> – Purities.<br>Six, corresponding to the six days of Creation.<br>Six corresponding to the six matriarchs: Sarah, Rebecca, Leah, Rachel, Bilha, Zilpa.<br>Rav Huna said: Six corresponding to the six mitzvot about which the king is cautioned and commanded, as it is written: “He shall not amass wives for himself” (Deuteronomy 17:17); “he shall not amass horses for himself” (Deuteronomy 17:16); “and silver and gold, he shall not amass greatly” (Deuteronomy 17:17); “You shall not distort judgment, you shall not give preference, and you shall not take a bribe” (Deuteronomy 16:19).<br>When he [Solomon] ascended the first step, the herald would proclaim and say to him: “He shall not amass wives for himself.” On the second, he would proclaim: “He shall not amass horses for himself.” On the third, he would proclaim: “And silver and gold, he shall not amass.” On the fourth, “you shall not distort judgment.” On the fifth, “you shall not give preference.” On the sixth, “you shall not take a bribe.” And so it says [about the throne which was on the sixth step]: “There were arm rests on this side and that side of the place of the seat” (I Kings 10:19). When he came to sit, he [the herald] would say to him: Know before whom you sit, before the He who spoke and the world came into existence.<br>They said: Once Solomon died, Shishak, king of Egypt, came and took it [the throne] from them. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: Shishak is Pharaoh, and why is he called by the name Shishak? Because he came against Israel with enthusiasm [<i>bishkikut</i>] and said: I am taking it in payment for my daughter’s marriage contract. He waged war with Zeraḥ the Kushite and he took it from him. Asa waged war with Zeraḥ the Kushite who fell by his hand and he took it from him. It was taught: Asa and all the kings of Judah sat upon it. When Nebuchadnezzar came up and destroyed Jerusalem, he exiled it to Babylon, and from Babylon to Media, from Media to Greece, and from Greece to Edom [Rome]. Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei said: I saw its fragments in Rome. Nebuchadnezzar sat upon it, Cyrus sat upon it, Aḥashverosh sought to sit upon it but they did not allow him to do so. They said to him: Any king who has not become ruler of the world may not sit on it. He arose and made one of his own like it; that is what is written: “On his royal throne [<i>kisse malkhuto</i>],” <i>malkhuto </i>is written [without the <i>vav</i>].” <br>“And there was a round top to the throne, at its back” (I Kings 10:19) –  Rabbi Aḥa said: Like this round headrest of an armchair. “There were arm rests on this side and that side of the place of the seat” (ibid.). He ascends the first step, and the lion extends its foreleg to him. On the second, the eagle extends its leg to him. “Of the place of the seat,” this is how they greeted him, and at the place of the seat, there was a golden scepter behind it, and a dove was set in its top with a golden crown in its mouth, so that the king would be sitting on the seat with a golden crown [suspended just above him], touching but not touching.",

Rather, it is either for one or for the other. Tomorrow, two people will come before you for judgment, a Jewish man, and an adversary and enemy, can you satisfy both of them?

He gives drink” – that is Nebuchadnezzar; “his neighbor” – that is Zedekiah. The Holy One blessed be He said to him [Nebuchadnezzar]: ‘Wicked one, is he not a king like you? Is he not a shepherd like you?’ “Amplifies your wrath” – ‘why are you leveling accusations against him in your wrath?’ He [Nebuchadnezzar] said to him [Zedekiah]: ‘Had you rebelled against me and not rebelled against your God, your God would have stood beside you. Had you rebelled against your God and not rebelled against me, I would have stood beside you. However, you rebelled against your God and rebelled against me,’– that is what is written: “He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had administered an oath to him by God” (II Chronicles 36:13). Upon what did he administer the oath? Rabbi Yosei son of Rabbi Ḥanina said: He administered the oath on the horns of the inner altar. What would that wicked one [Nebuchadnezzar] do to him [Zedekiah]? He would feed him warm barley bread and give him wine from the winepress to drink. Why did he do so? He did so to empty his bowels; that is what is written: “So that you may look upon their nakedness.”<br>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Yitzḥak said: Your honor and the honor of your ancestors: You became royalty only because your grandfather respected his grandfather; that is what is written: “At that time Merodakh Baladan, son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent scrolls and a gift to Hezekiah; he had heard that he had become ill and recovered” (Isaiah 39:1). They said: Merodakh Baladan was a sun worshipper, and he was accustomed to eat at the sixth hour and sleep until the ninth hour. On that day, when the sphere of the sun reversed its course during the days of Hezekiah, he slept until the ninth hour and awakened at the fourth hour. Once he awoke from his sleep, he sought to kill all his servants. He said to them: ‘You allowed me to sleep the entire day and the entire night.’ They said to him: ‘No, rather, the sphere of the sun reversed its course.’<br>He said to them: ‘Is there a god who is greater than my god, who is capable of reversing it?’ They said to him: ‘Hezekiah’s God is greater than your god.’ Immediately he arose and sent [letters]: Peace to Hezekiah, peace to the God of Hezekiah, and peace to Jerusalem. Once the letters and messengers were on their way, he was calmed and he said: ‘I have honored Hezekiah only because of his God, and I offered salutations to Hezekiah, who is flesh and blood, before [I offered] salutations to his God?’ Immediately, he arose from his throne and took three steps, and sent messengers to recall the letters and wrote other scrolls: Peace to the great God of Hezekiah, peace to Hezekiah, and peace to Jerusalem. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: You arose from your throne and took three steps for the glory of My name; by your life, I will establish from you three kings, who will rule the entire world from one end to the other end, and these are they – Nebuchadnezzar, Evil Merodakh, and Belshatzar. That is why The Holy One blessed be He said [to Zedekiah, the last king of Judah]:  ‘Your honor and your honored grandfather and father became kings only because he [Merodakh Baladan] honored this king’s grandfather [Hizkiyyahu], and you are dishonoring him?’ <br>“You are sated with more shame than glory; you too, drink and be exposed! The cup in the right hand of the Lord shall come around to you, and disgrace upon your glory” (Habakkuk 2:16). “More shame than glory” –  Zedekiah my son is being dishonored in the manner that anyone is dishonored, but you [Nebuchadnezzar], “disgrace [<i>kikalon</i>] upon your glory” – vomiting [<i>ki</i>] above and shame [<i>kalon</i>] below. Rabbi Yirmeya in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav said: When the two commanders of his legions saw that he was vomiting above and being shamed below, they stood him from his throne, removed his crown from upon his head, and removed his royal cloak from upon him; that is what is written: “They removed his honor from him” (Daniel 5:20), and they stood him in his nakedness; the nakedness of shame.<br>Who were the commanders of his legions? Cyrus and Darius. Rabbi Menaḥem, son-in-law of Rabbi Eliezer bar Avina, said in the name of Rabbi Yaakov bar Avina: The entire household of that wicked one are only judged naked. “You too, drink and be exposed naked” (Habakkuk 2:16), this is Nebuchadnezzar; “you too,” this is Belshatzar, “and be exposed naked,” this is Vashti.",

                "<b>“After these matters, King Aḥashverosh promoted Haman son of Hamedata the Agagite, and he raised him up and set his seat above all the princes who were with him” (Esther 3:1).</b><br>“After these matters, King Aḥashverosh promoted Haman son of Hamedata” – that is what is written: “But the wicked will perish, and the enemies of the Lord will be like the fat of rams” (Psalms 37:20). They are not fattened for their own good, but for slaughter; so was Haman only made great for his downfall. This is analogous to a person who had a filly, a donkey [the mother of the filly], and a sow. He would feed the sow without limit, and the filly and the donkey measured amounts. The filly said to the donkey: ‘What is this fool doing? We, who perform the owner’s labor, he feeds us measured amounts, and the sow that is idle, without limit.’ She [the donkey] said to her [the filly]: ‘The time will come and you will witness its downfall, as they are not feeding it more for its benefit, but rather, to its detriment.’ When the calends<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The first day of the Roman month, which was often a feast day.</i> arrived, they immediately took the sow and slaughtered it. They began placing barley before the daughter of the donkey, and she blew on it and wouldn’t eat. Her mother said to her: ‘My daughter, it is not the food that causes it, but rather the idleness causes it,’ as it is written: “He set his seat above all the princes who were with him” – therefore, “they hanged Haman” (Esther 7:10).",
                "Another matter: “After these matters” – Rabbi Levi said: What the verse says: “When the wicked sprout like grass, and evildoers flourish” (Psalms 92:8); what is written at the end of the verse: “For their eternal destruction.” Haman was made great only to his harm. Why was he made great? It is analogous to a common soldier who cursed the king’s son. The king said: If I kill him, everyone will say: He killed a common soldier. He appointed him to be an officer, and afterwards, a commander, and then beheaded him. So the Holy one blessed be He said: Had Haman been killed when he went down and counseled Aḥashverosh to cancel construction of the Temple, no one would have known him. Rather, let him be made great and then be hanged. Therefore, “he set his seat above all the princes who were with him,” and then, “they hanged Haman.” The enemies of the Holy one blessed be He are made great for their downfall, and it is written: “He exalts the nations and eliminates them” (Job 12:23).",
                "Another interpretation: “After these matters” – it  is written: “Though his haughtiness ascends to the heavens” – to the heights; “and his head reaches to the clouds”– the clouds<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash explains that the word <i>av</i> in the verse means clouds.</i> (Job 20:6). “He will perish forever, like his dung” (Job 20:7) – just as dung is repulsive, so too, he is repulsive. “Those who see him will say: Where is he?”   (Ibid.) –  They see him but do not recognize him: Where is Haman and where is his contentment?<br>Rabbi Pinḥas related these events: The lion made a banquet for all the animals and spread over them [for shade, the] hides of lions, wolves, and predators. After they ate and drank, they said: ‘If only someone would recite a poem before us.’ They fixed their eyes on a certain fox. He said to them: ‘You repeat to me what I say to you.’ They said: ‘Yes.’ He said to them: ‘He who showed us with those above, let him show us with those on the ground.’ So: He who showed us the downfall of Bigtan and Teresh and their hanging will show us the downfall of Haman. And He who punished the first ones, let him punish the latter ones. What is written above on the topic? “The two of them were hanged on a gibbet” (Esther 2:23); so, too, this person will ultimately be hanged.",
                "Another matter: “After these matters, King Aḥashverosh promoted Haman” – there were calculations there. Who calculated? Rabbi Yehuda said: Haman calculated. He said: If Esther is a Jewess, she is my relative via my ancestor Esau; that is what is written: “Isn’t Esau a brother to Jacob” (Malachi 1:2); and if she is a gentile, all gentiles are affiliated with each other.",
                "Rabbi Pinḥas said: Two wealthy men arose in the [history of the] world, one from Israel and one from the idolaters, and their property was only to their harm. Koraḥ in Israel, who found the treasures of gold and silver that Joseph had concealed, and Haman among the idolaters, as he took the treasures of the kings of Judah. When the king saw his wealth, and his ten sons [living] as princes, he arose and promoted and raised him up; that is what is written: “After these matters, King Aḥashverosh promoted Haman son of Hamedata…and he raised him up.”  The king commanded that they should bow and prostrate themselves to him. What did Haman do? He crafted for himself an embroidered image on his garment and on his heart, and anyone who would prostrate himself to Haman would prostrate himself to the image.",
                "<b> “All the king's servants who were at the king's gate bowed and prostrated themselves to Haman, for so had the king commanded concerning him; and Mordekhai would not bow and would not prostrate himself” (Esther 3:2).</b><br> “All the king's servants who were at the king's gate.” Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina began: “The arrogant laid a trap for me” (Psalms 140:6) – the congregation of Israel said before the Holy one blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, the idolaters have spread a trap before me to bring me down. They say to me: Engage in idol worship. If I heed them, I will be punished. If I do not heed them, they will kill me. It is analogous to a wolf that thirsted for water, but they spread a net at the entrance to the spring. He said: If I go down to drink, I will be trapped, but if I do not go down, I will die of thirst.",
                "<b>“When they [the king’s servants] spoke to him [Mordekhai] daily and he did not heed them, they told Haman, to see whether Mordekhai’s words would prevail; for he had told to them that he was a Jew” (Esther 3:4). </b><br> “When they spoke to him daily” – Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Binyamin bar Rabbi Levi: The children of Rachel, their miracles are equal and their ascent to greatness is equal. Their miracles are equal; that is what is written: “It was when she spoke to Joseph day after day” (Genesis 39:10). Here it written: “When they spoke to him daily and he did not heed them,” and there it is written: “And he did not heed her to lie with her, to be with her” (Genesis 39:10). And their ascent to greatness is equal; that is what is written: “Pharaoh removed his ring from his hand and he gave it to Joseph, and he garbed him in garments of linen” (Genesis 41:42). Here it is written: “The king removed the ring that he had taken from Haman, and he gave it to Mordekhai” (Esther 8:2). There it is written: “He had him ride in his second chariot, and they cried before him: ‘<i>Avrekh</i>’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The meaning of <i>avrekh</i> is unclear. One opinion, based on the ancient Egyptian, is that it means “pay attention.”</i> (Genesis 41:43); here, it is written: “And let the garments and the horse be placed…and they will proclaim before him: So shall be done to the man whose honoring the king desires” (Esther 6:9).",
                "What did Mordekhai say to someone who would say to him: “Why are you violating the king’s command?” (Esther 3:3) Rabbi Levi said: Mordekhai would say: ‘Moses our master cautioned us in the Torah: “Cursed is the man who will craft an idol or a cast figure” (Deuteronomy 27:15), and this wicked one is rendering himself an idol. And Isaiah the prophet cautioned us: “Desist from man, who has breath in his nostrils, as what is he considered?” (Isaiah 2:22).

Because the sight of the eyes of the wicked takes them down to Gehenna; that is what is written: “The children of the great saw the daughters of man”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The children of the great sinned in doing so.

It is written there: “Esau showed contempt [<i>vayyivez</i>] to the birthright” (Genesis 25:34), and here it is written: “It was contemptible in his eyes.”<br>“Haman sought to destroy all the Jews” – Rabbi Shimon ben Yosei ben Lakonya said: In this world, Israel was likened to rocks, as it is stated: “For from the top of rocks I will see them” (Numbers 23:9); “look to the rock from which you were quarried” (Isaiah 51:1). They were likened to stones, as it is stated: “From the shepherd of the stone of Israel” (Genesis 49:24); “the stone that the builders rejected” (Psalms 118:22). The nations of the world were likened to pottery; that is what is written: “He will break it as a potter’s jug is broken” (Isaiah 30:14). If a boulder falls on a clay pot, woe to the pot; if the pot falls on a boulder, woe to the pot; one way or the other, woe to the pot. So it is regarding anyone who confronts them [the Jews]; he will receive his just deserts from them.

Likewise, Israel is the royal purple in which the Holy One blessed be He glories; that is what is written: “My servant Israel, that I glory in you” (Isaiah 49:3); if they are sold, woe to the seller and woe to the buyer. <br>To what is the wicked Haman comparable?

It would take water from the sea in its mouth and pour it on the land, and would take dirt from the land and cast it into the sea. Its fellow came and stood alongside it and said to it: ‘Luckless and unfortunate one! Ultimately, what can you accomplish?’ So said the Holy One blessed be He to the wicked Haman: ‘World class fool! I said I would destroy them, so to speak, and could not, as it is stated: “He said He would destroy them, were it not for Moses, His chosen one, who stood before Him in the breach to turn back His wrath from destruction” (Psalms 106:23), and you said “to destroy, to kill, and to eliminate” (Esther 3:13) [them].

I will cast lots.’ The Holy Spirit cried out: “Over My people they cast lots” (Joel 4:3). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Wicked one son of wicked one, your lot is drawn to be hanged.’ “He cast a <i>pur</i>, that is [<i>hu</i>],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash is claiming that pronoun <i>hu </i>refers to Haman: He cast a <i>pur</i>; upon him was the lot.</i> the lot” – upon him the lot fell. Why? “Indeed, the rod of wickedness will not rest upon the lot of the righteous, lest the righteous extend their hands for wrongdoing” (Psalms 125:3). <br>First, he cast a lot for the days, as it is stated: “for each day.” He cast the lot on Sunday. Its [Sunday’s] angel stood before the Holy One blessed be He and said: ‘Master of the universe: The heavens and the earth were created on me [my day], and You said: “truly My covenant is day and night, have I not set the statutes of heaven and earth?” (Jeremiah 33:25). There is a covenant in their flesh, as it is written: “You shall observe My covenant [you and your descendants that are after you for their generations…circumcise for yourselves every male]” (Genesis 17:9–10), and it is written: “My covenant shall be in your flesh” (Genesis 17:13). And there is a covenant in their mouths, that is the Torah, as it is written: “The book of the Torah shall not depart from your mouth” (Joshua 1:8). And You said: “If the heavens above can be measured and the foundations of the earth below probed…”( Jeremiah 31:37) and it is written: “[when these laws should ever be annulled before Me, says the Lord,] so too will the descendants of Israel cease from being a nation before Me all the days” (Jeremiah 31:35), and this wicked one seeks to eliminate them? Uproot the heavens and the earth first, and then annihilate them.’<br>He cast the lot on Monday. Its angel stood before the Holy One blessed be He and said: ‘Master of the universe: On the second day you separated the upper waters from the lower waters, and likewise, Israel is separated from the nations. That is what is written: “I have distinguished you from the peoples to be Mine” (Leviticus 20:26), and this wicked one wants to eliminate them?

Now, if Israel is eradicated, how do we exist?’<br>He cast the lot on Wednesday. Its angel stood before the Holy One blessed be He and said: ‘Master of the universe: The fourth day – on it the lights were created to provide light for Israel’s use; that is what is written: “Nations will walk by your light and kings by the aura of your shining” (Isaiah 60:3), and on it the stars were created, and your children were likened to stars; if You eliminate them, how do we exist?’<br>He cast the lot on Thursday. Its angel stood before the Holy One blessed be He and said: ‘Master of the universe: The fifth day – on it were created birds [and animals], from which you commanded to present offerings, and with which You grant atonement to and are reconciled with people; if they are eradicated, who will present an offering?’<br>He cast the lot on Friday. Its angel stood before the Holy One blessed be He and said: ‘Master of the universe: The sixth day – on it Adam the first man was created, and you called Your children by his name; that is what is written: “You, My flock, flock of My pasture, you are men [<i>Adam</i>]” (Ezekiel 34:31). If you seek to uproot them, uproot all men and then let him [Haman] gain control over them.’<br>He cast the lot on Shabbat. Its angel stood before the Holy One blessed be He and said: ‘Master of the universe: The Shabbat day – on it all your creations were completed and perfected; that is what is written: “God completed on the seventh day” (Genesis 2:2), and it is written: “It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever” (Exodus 31:17). If you seek to uproot them, uproot the Shabbat and cancel it; then eliminate them.’<br>Once that wicked one saw that the lot would not fall on the days, he moved to months. <br>He began with the month of Nisan, and the merit of Passover arose. <br>Iyyar had the merit of <i>Pesaḥ sheni</i>,<i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to the fourteenth of Iyyar, when those who had been impure or were too distant from the Temple on the fourteenth of Nisan, could present the Passover offering.</i></i> and the merit of the manna that was provided to Israel on the fifteenth of the month. <br>Sivan had the merit of the Torah. <br>Tammuz had the merit of the land.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The allusion is obscure. It perhaps refers to the fact that Ezra came to the Land of Israel on the first of that month (Ezra 7:8-9). Alternatively, there are midrashic traditions that Joshua stopped the sun in his war with the five Emorite kings during that month (<i>Seder Olam Rabba</i>:11).</i> <br>Furthermore, why didn’t the lot fall on Tammuz and Av? Because they said to the Holy One blessed be He: Master of the universe, the calamities that befell your children in us, five in Tammuz and five in Av, are enough. <br>The possibility of Elul arose – [but it had] the merit of the completion of the wall of Jerusalem that was completed during it. That is what is written: “The wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of Elul” (Nehemiah 6:15). There was also the merit of the animal tithe, as it is taught there: On the first of Elul is the New Year for the animal tithe (Mishna <i>Rosh HaShana</i> 1:1). <br>The possibility of Tishrei arose – [but it had] the merit of the <i>shofar</i>, Yom Kippur, and the festivals.<br>The possibility of Marḥeshvan arose – [but it had] the merit of Sarah our matriarch, who died during it.<br>Kislev – [but it had] the merit of Hanukkah. <br>The possibility of Tevet arose – [but it had] the merit of Ezra. That is what is written: “The exiles did so. Ezra the priest…sequestered themselves; [they convened on the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter]...they finished with all the men who had settled with foreign women” (Ezra 10:16–17).<br>The possibility of Shevat arose – [but it had] the merit of the members of the Great Assembly. On the twenty-third of it [the month of Shevat] all Israel gathered over the concubine in Giva (Judges 19–21) and the idol of Mikha (Judges 17–18). <br>The possibility of the first of Adar arose, and no merit was found for it. The wicked one began rejoicing.<br>He then checked the signs of the Zodiac. Lamb [Aries] had the merit of the paschal lamb; that is what is written: “Each man, a lamb for each extended family, a lamb for each household” (Exodus 12:3).<br>Bull [Taurus] – the merit of Joseph, who was called a bull, was found. That is what is written: “A firstborn bull is his majesty” (Deuteronomy 33:17). And the merit of an offering, as it is stated: “A bull, or a sheep, or a goat, when it is born…” (Leviticus 22:27).<br>Twins [Gemini] – the merit of Peretz and Zeraḥ [the sons of Judah], who were called twins, was found in it; that is what is written: “And behold there were twins in her womb” (Genesis 38:27).<br>Lion [Leo] – the merit of Daniel, who was from the tribe of Judah, who was called a lion, [was found in it], as it is stated: “A lion cub is Judah” (Genesis 49:9).<br>Virgin [Virgo] – the merit of Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya, who were comparable to a virgin with whom no man was familiar other than her husband, [was found in it]; thus they did not change their God and their laws, and clung to their Judaism.<br>Scales [Libra] – that is Job, as it is stated: “If only my anger were weighed” (Job 6:2).<br>Scorpion [Scorpio] – that is Ezekiel, as it is stated: “And you sit among the scorpions” (Ezekiel 2:6).<br>Bow [Sagittarius] – that is Joseph, as it is stated about him: “His bow remained taut” (Genesis 49:24).<br>Kid [Capricorn] – that is Jacob, as it is stated: “And the hides of the kids of the goats” (Genesis 27:16).<br>Bucket [<i>d’li</i>] [Aquarius ] – that is Moses, as it is stated: “And he drew water [<i>dalo dala</i>] for us” (Exodus 2:19).<br>He arrived at the sign of Fish [Pisces], that serves during the month of Adar, and no merit was found for it. He immediately rejoiced and said: ‘Adar has no merit and its Zodiac sign has no merit. Not only that, but Moses their teacher died in Adar.’ And he did not know that Moses died on the seventh of Adar and Moses was born on the seventh of Adar. He said: ‘Just as fish swallow, so, I will swallow them.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Wicked one, fish sometimes swallow and sometimes are swallowed. Now, this man will be swallowed by the swallowers.’ Rabbi Ḥanan said: That is what is written: “It was reversed, so that it was the Jews who ruled over their enemies” (Esther 9:1). Rabbi Tanḥuma said: “But the Lord had not determined to expunge [the name of Israel]” (II Kings 14:27); rather, so He spoke: “For I will expunge the memory of Amalek” (Exodus 17:14).",

The Holy One blessed be He said to him [Haman]: ‘There is no sleep before Me; that is what is written: “Behold, the guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps” (Psalms 121:4), and you say that there is sleep before Me? By your life, I will awaken from sleep against that man and eliminate him from the world;’ that is what is written: “Then the Lord awoke as if from sleep…He drove his foes into retreat” (Psalms 78:65–66).<br>Another matter: “There is one people” – he [Haman] said: ‘Their teeth are big, as they eat and drink and say: Delight in Shabbat, delight in the festivals. They cause a decrease in the assets of the world; once every seven days – Shabbat, once every thirty days – the New Moon, in Nisan – Passover, in Sivan – Shavuot,  in Tishrei – Rosh Hashana and the great fast [Yom Kippur], and the festival of Sukkot.’ Aḥashverosh said to him: ‘So they are commanded in their Torah.’ Haman said to him: ‘Had they observed their holidays and our holidays, they would have done well, but they treat your holidays with contempt. “And they do not follow the king’s laws” – as they observe neither calends nor Saturnalia.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Wicked one, you are casting aspersions on their festivals, I will bring you down before them and they will add another festival over your downfall.’ These are the days of Purim; that is what is written: “A fool’s mouth is ruin for him” (Proverbs 18:7).<br>“It is not worthwhile for the king to tolerate them.” For everything that Haman denounced Israel below, [the angel] Michael would advocate for them above. He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe! Your children are being denounced not because they engaged in idol worship, and not for engaging in licentiousness, and not for bloodshed; rather they are being denounced for observing your laws.’ He said to him: ‘I have not, and I will not forsake them.’ That is what is written: “For the Lord will not forsake His people for the sake of His great name” (I Samuel 12:22). Whether they are guilty or innocent, in any case it is impossible to forsake them, because the world cannot exist without Israel.<br>“If a man were to give all the wealth of his house…” (Song of Songs 8:7) – that is Haman the wicked, who gave ten thousand silver talents to obliterate Israel, “…he would be scorned” (Ibid.).",

Come see what He did to the kings who came before us who extended their hand against them, who were greater and more powerful kings than we are. Anyone who came against them to eliminate them from the world, and those who counseled against them, were eliminated from the world and became a proverb for all residents of the world. We, who are not as great as they were, all the more so. Cease speaking of this matter again.’ Nevertheless, Haman would constantly pester Aḥashverosh over this matter and would counsel him with evil counsel regarding Israel.<br>Aḥashverosh said to him: ‘Since this is the situation, we will consult the wise men and the magicians.’ Immediately, he sent for and assembled all the wise men of the nations of the world. They all came before him. Aḥashverosh said to them: ‘Is it your wish that we eliminate this nation from the world?’ They all said to him simultaneously: ‘“Who is he and where is he, who was so presumptuous to do so?” (Esther 7:5) – to seek to cast [lots] in this matter? For if you eliminate Israel from the world, [know that] the world only exists for the sake of the Torah that was given to Israel. That is what is written: “If it were not for My covenant of day and night, had I not set the statutes of heaven and earth, [I would indeed spurn the descendants of Jacob…]” (Jeremiah 33:25-6).<br>Not only that, but all the idolaters are called strangers before the Holy One blessed be He [and Israel are called [His] intimates]; that is what is written: “Also to the foreigner, who is not of Your people Israel” (I Kings: 8:41). But Israel are called intimates; that is what is written: “For the children of Israel, the people who are intimate with Him” (Psalms 148:14). Not only that, but they are called children; that is what is written: “My firstborn son is Israel” (Exodus 4:22); “You are children to the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 14:1). And the Holy One blessed be He is called close to Israel; that is what is written: “The Lord is close to all who call Him sincerely” (Psalms 145:18). There is no nation that is close to the Holy One blessed be He other than Israel, as it is stated: “[For who is a great nation that has God near it] as the Lord our God in all of our calling to Him?” (Deuteronomy 4:7) A person who seeks to extend his hand against the intimates and children of the Holy One blessed be He, how can he escape, as He rules over the upper and the lower worlds, and all living beings. He has the capacity to elevate and to degrade, to put to death and to revive. Go see the previous kings, like Pharaoh and Sennacherib, who transgressed by extending their hand against Israel. What befell them?’<br>Immediately, Haman said to them: ‘The God who drowned Pharaoh in the sea and performed miracles on behalf of Israel, and the mighty acts of which you heard, He is already old and is unable to do anything. Nebuchadnezzar has come and destroyed His Temple and burned His Sanctuary, has exiled Israel and dispersed them among the nations. Where is His power and His might now that He has grown old? As it is stated: “They say: The Lord does not see; the God of Jacob does not comprehend”’ (Psalms 94:7).<br>Once he said this to them along these lines, they immediately accepted his proposal and they reached a consensus to annihilate Israel, and wrote letters and sealed them. This is what they wrote in those letters: Unlimited peace to you. Let it be known to you that there is a person among us, who is of not from our place, but rather a descendant of royalty, from the descendants of Amalek and one of the great ones of this generation; Haman is his name. He asked us a small simple question about a certain people residing in our midst, most despicable of all the peoples, and they are arrogant. They seek our harm, and cursing the king is common among them. What is the curse that they curse us? “The Lord is King forever and ever; nations have perished from His land” (Psalms 10:16), and they also say: “To wreak vengeance on the nations, rebuke among the peoples,” (Psalms 149:7).<br>They repudiate those who have treated them well. Come and see, from that unfortunate, Pharaoh, what did they do? When they went down to Egypt, he received them hospitably, settled them in the finest land in the country, provided for them during the famine years, and fed them all that was best in the land. He had palaces to build, they would build there; nevertheless, he was unable to get them to participate.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, until he ultimately forced them to work.</i> <br>Not only that, but they came to him with a pretext and said to him: ‘In order to sacrifice to the Lord our God, we will go on a three-day journey and we will return afterwards. If you want, lend us silver vessels and gold vessels, and garments.’ They lent them their gold, their silver, and all their fine garments. Each one of them loaded a countless number of their donkeys, until they stripped Egypt; that is what is written: “And they stripped Egypt” (Exodus 12:36), and they fled.<br>When Pharaoh heard that they were fleeing, he followed them to recover his property. What did they do to him? There was a man with them named Moses son of Amram, and with his sorcery he took a staff, uttered an incantation and struck the sea, until it became dry. All of them entered the dry land in the sea and all of them crossed; I don’t know how they crossed, and how the water dried up.<br>When Pharaoh saw this, he entered [the seabed] after them to recover his property. I don’t know what pushed him into the sea. He and his entire army drowned in the sea. They did not remember that he had treated them well. Do you not hear that they are ingrates?<br>Moreover, what did they do to Amalek my grandfather, when he came and waged war against them? It is stated: “Amalek came and waged war with Israel in Refidim” (Exodus 17:8). From where did Amalek come? Rabbi Kruspedai said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: He came from the company of wicked Bilam, as he went to consult with him. He [Amalek] said to him: ‘We know that you are a wise counselor and a purveyor of evil plots, and anyone who receives counsel from you does not fail.’ He [Amalek] said to him: ‘Look what this nation did to Egypt, who had performed many kindnesses to them. If they did so to Egypt, who performed many kindnesses to them, to other nations, all the more so. What do you counsel me?’<br>Bilam said to him: ‘Go and wage war against them, and if you do not wage war against them you will be unable to overcome them, because they can rely on the merit of Abraham their forefather and you are also a descendant of Abraham and can rely on the merit of Abraham.’ They immediately came against them in war.<br>What did that Moses, their leader, do? He had a certain disciple, Joshua son of Nun was his name, and he was extremely cruel and had no mercy. That Moses said to him: “Choose for us men and go out and wage war with Amalek” (Exodus 17:9). I don’t know if those men whom he chose were sorcerers, or whether they were great warriors. What did Moses do? He took a staff in his hand, and I don’t know what he did with it, and when he came against them, I don’t know what incantation he uttered that weakened them and they fell before them; that is what is written: “Joshua weakened Amalek and its people by sword” (Exodus 17:13).<br>They came against Siḥon and Og, the mighty of our land, against whom no creature can prevail, and I don’t know how he killed them. The kings of Midian came against them, and I don’t know how they killed them. Moreover, what did the disciple of that man Moses do? He brought Israel into the land of Canaan, and not only did he take their land, but he killed thirty-one of their kings, and allotted their land to Israel. He had no mercy on them, and those whom he did not seek to kill became their slaves. They came against Sisera and his multitudes and I don’t know what they did to the Kishon Stream that it swept and washed them away and cast them into the Mediterranean Sea, as it is stated: “The Kishon Stream swept them away” (Judges 5:21).<br>They had their first king, Saul was his name, and he went and waged war in the land of my grandfather Amalek, and he killed one hundred thousand of their cavalrymen in one day, and he had no mercy on man, woman, infants and suckling babes, and I do not know how he killed them. In addition, what did he do to my ancestor Agag, upon whom they initially had mercy? Ultimately, a man from them named Samuel came and beheaded him, and left his flesh for the birds of the heavens, as it is written: “Samuel cut Agag into pieces” (I Samuel 15:33), and I do not know why he killed him in this unusual way, as you have heard.<br>After this, they had a certain king named David son of Yishai, who destroyed and eliminated all the kingdoms and had no mercy on them, as it is stated: “David would not leave man or woman alive” (I Samuel 27:11). His son Solomon arose after him and built a certain building for Israel and called it the Temple. I don’t know what they had in it. When they go to war, they enter into it and engage in sorcery there, and when they emerge from it, they kill and destroy the world.<br>And with all the prosperity that they had, they rebelled against their God, and in addition, that God of theirs had grown old. Nebuchadnezzar came and burned that Temple of theirs, exiled them from their land, and brought them into our midst, but they have not yet changed their ugly ways. Even though they are in exile in our midst, they mock us and the faith of our gods. <br>Now we have arrived at a consensus, and have cast lots to eliminate them from the world to determine the time that it will be feasible to annihilate them, and the lot fell on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. Now, when these letters reach you, be prepared for that day, to destroy and kill all the Jews among you, from lad to elder, children and women, on one day, and do not leave from them remnant or refugee.<br>When those letters were sealed and given to Haman, he and all the members of his entourage proceeded joyfully. They met Mordekhai, who was walking ahead of them. Mordekhai saw three children who were coming from school and Mordekhai ran after them. When Haman and his entire entourage saw that Mordekhai was running after the children, they followed Mordekhai to ascertain what Mordekhai would ask them. <br>When Mordekhai reached the children, he asked one of them: ‘Recite your verse to me.’ He said to him: ‘“Fear not from sudden terror, and from the cataclysm of the wicked when it comes”’ (Proverbs 3:25). The second began and said: ‘I read today and with this verse I left school: “Take counsel and it will be negated; speak something and it will not stand, as God is with us”’ (Isaiah 8:10). The third began and said: ‘“Until old age I am He and until gray hairs I will bear you; I have done and I will carry; I will bear and I will rescue”’ (Isaiah 46:4). <br>When Mordekhai heard this, he laughed and was overjoyed. Haman said to him: ‘What is this joy that you rejoiced when hearing the words of these children?’ He said: ‘It is over the good tidings of which they apprised me, that I need not fear the evil designs that you counseled against us.’ Immediately, the wicked Haman became angry and said: ‘I will strike at none other than these children first.’<br>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappḥa said: The wicked Haman came with a great scheme to indict Israel; that is what is written: “Upon the completion of those days, the king made a banquet for all the people who were present in the Shushan citadel” (Esther 1:5). The people mentioned here are none other than Israel; that is what is written: “Happy are you, Israel, who is like you? A people redeemed by the Lord…” (Deuteronomy 33:29). Haman said to Aḥashverosh: ‘The God of these people hated licentiousness. Provide them with prostitutes, make a banquet for them, and decree that they must all attend and eat and drink and do as they please,’ as it is stated: “To act in accordance with the wishes of each man” (Esther 1:8).<br>When Mordekhai saw this, he arose and proclaimed, saying to them: ‘Do not go to eat at the banquet of Aḥashverosh, who invited you only to prosecute you, so there will be a basis for the attribute of justice to prosecute you before the Holy One blessed be He.’ They did not heed the words of Mordekhai, and they all went to the banquet house.<br>Rabbi Yishmael said: Eighteen thousand five hundred went to the banquet house and ate, drank, became intoxicated, and were corrupted. Immediately, the Accuser arose and informed on them before the Holy One blessed be He and said before Him: ‘Master of the universe! How long will you cleave to this nation, who remove their heart and their trust from you? If you will, eliminate this nation from the world because they are not repenting before you.’ The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘What will become of the Torah?’ He said to Him: ‘Master of the universe! It will be satisfied with those above.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Torah will be learned by the angels.</i> He also resolved to eradicate Israel. At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Why do I need a nation for which I made many of my signs and wonders against all who rose against them to harm them? “I would terminate their memory from man”’ (Deuteronomy 32:26).<br>Immediately, the Holy One blessed be He said to the Accuser, ‘bring Me a scroll, and I will write eradication on it.’ At that moment, the Accuser went and brought Him a scroll and He wrote on it. Immediately, the Torah emerged in widow’s garb and raised its voice in weeping before the Holy One blessed be He, and the ministering angels screamed in response to its weeping. They said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, if Israel is abolished from the world, what need is there for us in the world, as it is stated: “Behold, their angels cry out outside, the messengers of peace weep bitterly”’ (Isaiah 33:7). When the sun and the moon heard this, they withheld their light, as it is stated: “I will garb the heavens with blackness and make sackcloth their garment” (Isaiah 50:3).  <br>At that moment, Eliyahu of blessed memory ran in a panic to the eternal patriarchs, and to Moses son of Amram, and said to them: ‘How long will the patriarchs of the world remain dormant in sleep, and not pay attention to the trouble which your descendants are undergoing, over which the ministering angels, the sun, the moon, the stars, the constellations, the heavens, the earth, and all the hosts of the heavens are weeping bitterly, and you are standing by, and not paying attention?’ They said to him: ‘Why?’ He said to them: ‘Because they derived benefit from the banquet of Aḥashverosh. Because of that, a decree was issued against them to eliminate them from this world and to expunge their memory.’<br>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob said to him: ‘If they violated the laws of the Holy One blessed be He and their decree was sealed, what can we do?’ Eliyahu then said to Moses: ‘Loyal shepherd, how many times have you stood in the breach on Israel’s behalf, and you cancelled the decree so He would not destroy, as it is stated: “Were it not for Moses, His chosen one, who stood before Him in the breach to turn back His wrath from destruction” (Psalms 106:23). How will you respond to this trouble, “for the children have come to the birth stool, [but there is no strength to give birth]”?’ (Isaiah 37:3).<br>Moses said to him: ‘Is there an honest person in this generation?’ He said to him: ‘There is, and his name is Mordekhai.’ He said to him: ‘Go and let him know, so that he will stand in prayer there, and I will do so from here, and we will ask for mercy for them before the Holy One blessed be He.’ He [Eliyahu] said to him: ‘Loyal shepherd, the letter of annihilation of Israel has already been written.’ Moses said to him: ‘If it is sealed in mortar, our prayer will be heard, but if it is sealed in blood, what was [decreed] will be.’ He said to him: ‘It is sealed with mortar.’ Moses said to him: ‘Go and let Mordekhai know.’ He immediately went and let Mordekhai know; that is what is written: “Mordekhai knew everything that had been done, and Mordekhai rent his garments” (Esther 4:1). When they told Esther, immediately, “the queen was greatly agitated” (Esther 4:4). What is the meaning of agitated? It teaches that she began menstruating.",

This is analogous to a person who was walking along the way, and from the rigor of the way he sprained his ankle. He said: ‘If only I had a donkey.’ A Roman whose donkey had just given birth to a foal passed by him and said to him: ‘Take this foal and carry it on your shoulders.’ He said: ‘My prayer was answered, but I didn’t ask appropriately, whether it was to ride or to be ridden by.’ So is the prophecy of the nations of the world: “Be ready for that day,” but they do not know whether it is [for them] to kill or to be killed.

                "<b>“For if you are silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place, and you and your father’s house will perish; who knows if it was for a time like this that you attained royalty?” (Esther 4:14). </b><br>“For if you are silent” – if you [Esther] are silent now and refrain from advocating on behalf of your nation, ultimately you will be silent in the future and you will have no claim. Why? Because you have the opportunity to perform good during your life and you [will have] failed to do so. What, do you think that the Holy One blessed be He will abandon Israel? In any case, he will provide them with a redeemer; that is what is written: “Relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place.”",
                "“Esther said, to respond to Mordekhai” (Esther 4:15). She said to him: “Go, assemble all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and fast on my behalf; do not eat and do not drink for three days” (Esther 4:16). These were the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth of Nisan. He sent her [in response]: ‘But isn’t the first day of Passover among them?’ She said to him: ‘Elder of Israel, why is it Passover?’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The festival of Passover was given to the Jewish people; if they are destroyed, of what value is the festival of Passover? It is better to desecrate Passover once so that it may be observed forever more (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Immediately Mordekhai heard and conceded to her contention; that is what is written: “Mordekhai went on [<i>vaya’avor</i>] and acted in accordance with everything that Esther had commanded him” (Esther 4:17). There they say: That he violated [<i>shehe’evir</i>] the first day of Passover<i> </i>with a fast.<br>Regarding that same trouble, Mordekhai prayed to God and he said: ‘It is revealed and known before Your Throne of Honor, Master of the universe, that it is not due to haughtiness or arrogance that I did not prostrate myself to Haman; rather, it is due to my fear of You that I acted in this way, and did not prostrate myself to him. It is because I feared You, and did not wish to grant the honor due to You, to flesh and blood, and I did not want to prostrate myself to anyone other than You. For who am I not to prostrate myself to Haman at the expense of the salvation of Your people Israel? For that, I would be prepared to lick the shoes on his feet.<br>Now, God, rescue us from his hand, and let him fall into the grave that he dug, and let him be ensnared in the net that he concealed at the feet of your pious ones. And let this instigator know that You have not forgotten the promise that You promised us: “And despite this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not have spurned them and will not have rejected them, to destroy them, to violate My covenant with them, as I am the Lord their God”’ (Leviticus 26:44). <br>What did Mordekhai do? He assembled the children and deprived them of bread and water, he dressed them in sackcloth and sat them in ashes. They were shouting, weeping, and engaging in Torah study.<br>At that time, Esther was very frightened due to the evil that had developed for Israel. She removed her royal garments and her glory, donned sackcloth, loosened her hair and filled it with dirt and ashes, afflicted herself in a fast, and fell on her face before God and prayed. She said: ‘Lord, God of Israel, who has ruled since the days of yore and created the world, please help your maidservant, as I have remained an orphan from my father and my mother, and am comparable to a poor woman begging from house to house. So, I am requesting Your mercy from window to window in the palace of Aḥashverosh.<br>Now, Lord, please grant success to this poor maidservant of yours, and deliver the sheep of Your flock from these enemies who have arisen against us, as You have “no restraint to save by many or by few” (I Samuel 14:6). You, father of orphans, please stand to the right of this orphan, who has relied on your mercy, and let me be viewed mercifully by this man, for I fear him. Lower him before me because You lower the haughty.’"

She took her two young women with her; she placed her right hand on one young woman and leaned on her in accordance with the royal custom, and the second young woman walked behind her mistress supporting her jewels, so that the gold would not touch the ground. She put on a joyful face, masked the worry in her heart, and came to the inner courtyard facing the king, and she stood before him.<br>The king was sitting on his royal throne in garments of gold and jewels. He lifted his eyes and saw Esther standing before him, and his wrath was greatly enflamed because she had violated his protocol and she came before him without being summoned. Esther lifted her eyes and saw the king’s face, and his eyes were like fire, blazing from the great fury in his heart.<br>Esther recognized the king’s anger and she was greatly panicked, and her spirit grew faint. She placed her head on the young woman supporting her on the right. Our God saw and took pity on His people, recognized the suffering of the orphan who had placed her trust in Him, invested her with grace before the king, and added beauty to her beauty and magnificence to her magnificence. The king rose from his throne in a frenzy, ran to Esther, hugged and kissed her, and placed his arm around her neck. The king said to her: ‘Queen Esther, why are you afraid? This protocol that we instituted is not incumbent upon you, as you are my beloved and my companion.’ He said to her: ‘Why, when I saw you, did you not speak to me?’ Esther said: ‘My lord the king, when I saw you, my soul was startled due to your greatness.’",
                "“The king said to her: What troubles you, Queen Esther, and what is your request… Esther said: If it pleases the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet… The king said: Hasten Haman…The king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared…Haman emerged on that day joyful and glad of heart, but upon Haman’s seeing Mordekhai at the king’s gate, and he did not stand, and he did not move on his account, Haman became filled with fury…Haman restrained himself…and brought his supporters and Zeresh his wife, etc.” (Esther 5:3–5; 8–10). <br>Among all of them, there was no one capable of giving counsel like Zeresh his wife. He [Haman] had three hundred and sixty-five advisers, corresponding to the days of the solar year. His wife said to him: The person [Mordekhai] about whom you are asking, “If he is of the progeny of the Jews…you will not prevail against him” (Esther 6:13) – unless you approach him with cleverness, with [a strategy] that has never been attempted against members of his nation. If you drop him into a fiery furnace, Ḥananya and his cohorts have already been rescued [from it]; if [you place him in] the lions’ den, Daniel already emerged from it. If you incarcerate him in prison, Joseph already emerged from it. If you ignite a fire in a vat beneath him, Menashe [king of Judah] already pleaded, and the Holy One blessed be He acceded to his plea and he emerged from it. If you exile him to the wilderness, his ancestors already procreated in the wilderness, and they were confronted with numerous ordeals and passed them all and were rescued. If you blind his eyes, Samson took numerous Philistine lives when he was blind. Rather, hang him on a gibbet, as no member of his people has survived it.<br>Immediately, “the matter was pleasing to Haman and he prepared the gibbet” (Esther 5:14). From what tree was that gibbet crafted? The Rabbis said: When he came to prepare it, the Holy One blessed be He called to all the trees of Creation: ‘Who will give [of its wood] so this wicked one [Haman] will be hanged on it?’ <br>The fig said: ‘I will give of myself, as Israel brings first fruits from me. Moreover, Israel was likened to the first fruits [of a fig]; that is what is written: “Like a first fruit on a fig tree in its first season”’ (Hosea 9:10).<br>The grapevine said: ‘I will give of myself, as Israel was analogized to me; that is what is written: “You transported a vine from Egypt”’ (Psalms 80:9).<br>The pomegranate said: ‘I will give of myself, as Israel was analogized to me; as it is stated: “Your temple is like a pomegranate slice”’ (Song of Songs 4:3).<br>The nut said: ‘I will give of myself, as Israel was likened to me; that is what is written: “I have descended to the nut garden”’ (Song of Songs 6:11).<br>The citron said: ‘I will give of myself, as Israel takes from me for a mitzva; that is what is written: “You shall take for you on the first day the fruit of a pleasant tree…”’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This verse refers to the mitzva to take the four species on <i>Sukkot</i>. Rabbinic tradition identifies the “pleasant tree” as the citron.</i> (Leviticus 23:40).<br>The myrtle said: ‘I will give of myself, as Israel was analogized to me; as it is stated: “And he was standing among the myrtles”’ (Zechariah 1:8).<br>The olive said: ‘I will give of myself, as Israel was analogized to me; as it is stated: “The Lord called your name a flourishing olive-tree, fair of fruit and form”’ (Jeremiah 11:16).<br>The apple said: ‘I will give of myself, as Israel was analogized to me; as it is stated: “Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my beloved among the boys” (Song of Songs 2:3), and as it is written: “And the fragrance of your face like apples”’ (Song of Songs 7:9).<br>The palm said: ‘I will give of myself, as Israel was analogized to me; that is what is written: “This, your stature, is likened to a palm”’ (Song of Songs 7:8).<br>Acacia trees and cypress trees said: ‘We will give of ourselves, as the Sanctuary was crafted and the Temple was constructed from us.’<br>The cedar and the date said: ‘We will give of ourselves, as we are analogized to the righteous, as it is stated: “The righteous man flourishes like a palm tree; like a cedar in Lebanon he grows tall”’ (Psalms 92:13).<br>The willow says: ‘I will give of myself, as Israel was analogized to me, as it is stated: “Like willows by streams of water” (Isaiah 44:4); and they take from me for the mitzva of the four species in the <i>lulav</i>.’<br>At that moment, the thorn said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, I, who have nothing to ascribe [<i>litlot</i>] to myself, I will give of myself, and that impure one will be hanged [<i>veyitaleh</i>]. My name is thorn, and he [Haman] is a painful thorn; it is appropriate for a thorn to be hanged on a thorn.’ They found [suitable wood from a thorn] and erected [the gibbet].<br>When they brought it before Haman, he prepared it at the entrance to his house and measured himself on it to show his servants how Mordekhai should be hanged on it. A divine voice replied to him: ‘The tree is suitable for you; this tree has been prepared for you since the six days of Creation.’ The Rabbis there [i.e. Babylonia] say: Where in the Torah is there [an allusion] to Haman? It is, as it is stated: “Was it from the tree [<i>hamin haetz</i>]” (Genesis 3:11), which is expounded to read: Haman <i>haetz</i>.<br>Another matter: “it was on the third day” (Esther 5:1). Israel is never subject to trouble for more than three days, as in Abraham’s regard it is written: “On the third day, Abraham lifted his eyes and saw the place from a distance” (Genesis 22:4). The tribes, “he gathered them into custody for three days” (Genesis 42:17). Jonah, as it is stated: “Jonah was in the innards of the fish three days and three nights” (Jonah 2:1).

She sent and invited Haman to a banquet with the king on the fifteenth of Nisan. Once they ate and drank, Haman said: ‘The king promotes me, his wife honors me, and there is no one in the kingdom greater than I am,’ and his heart was overjoyed; that is what is written: “Haman emerged on that day joyful and glad of heart” (Esther 5:9).",

The snake, as it is written: “Did God actually [<i>af</i>] say” (Genesis 3:1); the baker, as it is written: “I, too [<i>af</i>], in my dream” (Genesis 40:16); the congregation of Koraḥ, as it is written: “Yet [<i>af</i>] [you did not take us] to a land flowing with milk and honey” (Numbers 16:14); Haman, as it is written: “Indeed [<i>af</i>], Queen Esther did not bring anyone.”",
                "After he erected the gibbet, he went to Mordekhai and found that he was sitting in the study hall with the children sitting before him, with sackcloth on their waists, engaging in the study of Torah, and they were screaming and weeping. He counted them and found there twenty-two thousand children. He cast iron chains on them and deployed guards over them. He said: ‘Tomorrow, I will kill these children first and then I will hang Mordekhai.’ Their mothers were bringing them food and water and saying to them: ‘Our children, eat and drink before you die and don’t die hungry.’ Immediately, they placed their hands on their books and took an oath: ‘By the life of Mordekhai our master, we will not eat and drink, but will die while fasting.’ All of them began weeping loudly until their cries reached the heavens. The Holy One blessed be He heard the sound of their weeping approximately two hours into the night.<br>At that moment, the compassion of the Holy One blessed be He was aroused, and He stood up from His throne of justice and sat down on His throne of mercy, and said: ‘What is that loud sound I hear that sounds like goats and lambs?’ Moses our master stood before the Holy One blessed be He and said: ‘Master of the universe, they are neither goats nor lambs, but rather the children of Your people, who are fasting today [and have already been fasting for] three days and three nights, and tomorrow their enemy seeks to slaughter them like goats and lambs.’ At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He took those letters that He had decreed against them that were sealed with mortar seals and He ripped them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Esther Rabba 7:14.  </i> He brought fear upon Aḥashverosh that night; that is what is written: “On that night [sleep deserted the king, and he ordered the book of records, the annals to be brought; and it was read to the king] (Esther 6:1)."

Does the Omnipresent sleep? Does it not already say: “Behold, the guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps” (Psalms 121:4)? Rather, at a time when Israel is immersed in trouble and the nations of the world are at peace [it is said allegorically that God is sleeping, and] for this [reason] it says: “Rouse Yourself; why do You sleep, O Lord?” (Psalms 44:24). <br>King Aḥashverosh’s sleep was disturbed as he saw in his dream that Haman took a sword to kill him; he was frightened and awoke from his sleep. He said to his scribes: ‘Bring the book of records,’ to read and to see what had happened to him. They opened the scrolls and found the matter that Mordekhai reported about Bigtana and Teresh. When they said to the king: “Here is Haman standing in the courtyard” (Esther 6:5), the king said: ‘The thing I saw in my dream is true. This one would not come at this hour except to kill me.’",

That is what is written: “Hannah was speaking upon her heart” (I Samuel 1:13); “Daniel set over his heart” (Daniel 1:8); “David said to his heart” (I Samuel 27:1).

He came to Mordekhai and said: ‘Rise and get dressed.’ How unlucky is this man; last night I was engaged in arranging a gibbet for him, and the Holy one blessed be He arranged a crown for him. ‘I would have arranged for you ropes and nails, and the Holy one blessed be He arranged for you royal garments.

O Lord my God, I cried out to You and You have healed me. O Lord, You brought my soul up from the grave; You have given me life that I not go down to a pit” (Psalms 30:2–4).

For His anger is a moment, life is by His will; in the evening one may lie down weeping, and in the morning, joy” (Psalms 30:5–6). What did that wicked one say? “And I said in my tranquility, I shall never be shaken. O Lord, by Your will You set my mountain strong – You hid Your face, I became terrified” (Psalms 30:7–8).

He pushed him [Haman] onto Esther, and she was crying ‘My lord, the king, here he is overpowering me before you!’ The king said: “Will he also overpower the queen with me in the house?” (Esther 7:8). Haman heard this statement and his face fell. What did Eliyahu, of blessed memory, do? He appeared as Ḥarvona and said to him [to the king]: ‘My lord the king, “indeed, here is the gibbet that Haman had made for Mordekhai…”’ (Esther 7:9). As Rabbi Pinḥas said: One must say ‘Ḥarvona, of blessed memory.’ And Rav said: One must say ‘cursed is Haman, cursed are his sons, cursed is Zeresh his wife, as it is written: “The name of the wicked will rot”’ (Proverbs 10:7). <br>The king immediately commanded to hang him on the gibbet that he had prepared for Mordekhai, and about this, Solomon, in his wisdom, said: “A righteous person will be delivered from trouble and the wicked will come in his stead” (Proverbs 11:8). For Haman got up early to hang Mordekhai and was hanged himself on the gibbet that he prepared for Mordekhai, and [the king] gave everything that was Haman’s to Esther the queen, and Esther gave it to Mordekhai. This is what is written: “On that day King Aḥashverosh gave the house of Haman, adversary of the Jews, to Queen Esther…” (Esther 8:1), and it is written: “As for his harvest, the hungry will eat it and take it from shields [<i>tzinim</i>] and the bound [<i>tzamim</i>] will swallow their wealth”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> The midrash understands this verse idiosyncratically. The word <i>mitzinim</i>, here translated as ‘from shields,’ is usually translated as ‘from thorns’ or ‘from baskets.’ The word <i>tzamim</i>, here translated as ‘the bound,’ is usually translated as ‘the thirsty.’</i> (Job 5:5). “As for his harvest,” that is Haman. “The hungry will eat it,” that is Mordekhai and Esther. “Take it from shields,” not with a weapon, and not with a shield, but with prayer and supplication, as you say: “His truth is a shield [<i>tzina</i>] and a buckler” (Psalms 91:4). That is prayer, which protects him from trouble like a shield protects a person in battle. By the merit of prayer, which is called a shield, he will take Haman. From where [is it known] that they engaged in prayer? That is what is written: “Sackcloth and ashes were worn by many” (Esther 4:3). What is the use of sackcloth and ashes without prayer? “And the bound will swallow their wealth.” Who overcame Haman’s wealth? Mordekhai and Esther and those bound to them.",
                "“And you, write about the Jews as is pleasing in your eyes in the name of the king” (Esther 8:8), and send to all the provinces “to destroy and to kill and to eliminate” (Esther 8:11) all the enemies of the Jews, “on the day that the enemies of the Jews had hoped to have power over them and it was reversed” (Esther 9:1) for them: “It will be renown for the Lord” (Isaiah 55:13) – this is the miracle that the Holy one blessed be He performed, the like of which has never been performed. Was there ever in the world an event like this miracle where Israel extracted vengeance against the nations of the world and did to their enemies as they wished?",
                "<b>“The Jews gathered in their cities in all the provinces of King Aḥashverosh, to lay hand on those who sought their harm. And no one stood against them for the fear of them had fallen on all the peoples” (Esther 9:2). </b><br>“The Jews gathered in their cities…and no one stood against them for the fear of them had fallen on all the peoples.” Israel was becoming stronger, like a lion that has fallen upon flocks of sheep and continues to prey with none to stop him. That is what is written: “The remnant of Israel will be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, like a lion upon the beasts of the forest, and like a young lion among the flocks of sheep…” (Micah 5:7). And they killed Haman’s sons and hanged them. Emperor Hadrian said to Rabbi Yehoshua: ‘Great is the lamb that survives among seventy wolves.’ He said to him: ‘Great is the shepherd who saves it [the lamb] and crushes them before it. That is what is written: “No weapon formed against you will succeed”’ (Isaiah 54:17).",
                "<b>“And Mordekhai went out from before the king in royal dress of blue and white wool, and a great gold crown, and a robe of fine linen and purple. The city of Shushan reveled and rejoiced” (Esther 8:15). </b><br>“And Mordekhai went out from before the king in royal dress…” Rabbi Pinḥas says: Mordekhai reigned over the Jews. Just as the king wears purple, so did Mordekhai wear purple. Just as the king sets a great crown on his head, so did Mordekhai wear “a great gold crown” (Esther 8:15). Just as fear of the king is over the whole land, so was fear of Mordekhai over all of them, as it says: “For fear of Mordekhai had fallen upon them” (Esther 9:3). Just as the king’s coin is accepted in the entire land, so was Mordekhai’s coin accepted. And what was his coin? Mordekhai on one side and Esther on the other. Why? Because he was a good man and a peaceful man and sought peace, as it says: “For Mordekhai the Jew…[a seeker of good for his people and a spokesman of peace for all his descendants] (Esther 10:3). About him scripture says: “Mark the man of integrity and behold the upright one, for there is a future for the man of peace” (Psalms 37:37).",
                "Rabbi Berekhya said: The Holy one blessed be He recorded the redemption of Israel in the Torah, as it is written: “If a stranger who is a resident among you shall prosper…” (Leviticus 25:47). “A stranger who is a resident” – that is Haman, who became great and grew rich, and became prosperous enough  to weigh out ten thousand talents of silver (see Esther 3:9). He is called a resident stranger since he was a descendant of Amalek and was a stranger in Media and Persia. “And your brother becomes poor with him” (Leviticus 25:47) – these are [the people of] Israel who were destitute and poor. “And is sold to a resident stranger” (Leviticus 25:47) – that Aḥashverosh sold them to Haman, to destroy, to kill and to eliminate. “Or to an offshoot [<i>eker</i>] of a stranger’s family” (Leviticus 25:47) – that he made himself an object of idolatry.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash here follows the interpretation in <i>Kiddushin</i> 20a–b that an <i>eker</i> is a false god. According to that reading, the verse is referring to a Hebrew slave who was sold to serve in an idolatrous temple.</i> That is what is written: “Bowing and prostrating themselves to Haman” (Esther 3:2). “After he is sold, he shall have redemption” (Leviticus 25:48) – that the Holy One blessed be He redeemed them from his [Haman’s] hand and delivered them from his decree and rescued them. “One of his brothers shall redeem him” (Leviticus 25:48) – that is Mordekhai, as it is written about him “and accepted by most of his brethren” (Esther 10:3). “Or his uncle or his cousin shall redeem him” (Leviticus 25:49) – that is Esther, who was the daughter of his [Mordekhai’s] uncle, and Israel were redeemed by her. “For I will surely erase [<i>maḥo emḥeh</i>] the memory of Amalek” (Exodus 17:14) – erase [<i>maḥo</i>] in this world, surely erase [<i>emḥeh</i>] in the World to Come. “The memory [<i>zekher</i>] of Amalek” – that is Haman. Read with regard to him, “a male [<i>zakhar</i>] of Amalek.”<br>Even Jacob our forefather alluded to it in the blessing of the tribes: “Benjamin, a wolf who will take prey. In the morning he will consume plunder” (Genesis 49:27) – that is Saul, who was the morning of Israel, as he was the first of the kings and was from the tribe of Benjamin, and [he] smote Amalek and plundered everything they had. “And in the evening will distribute booty” (Genesis 49:27) – that is Mordekhai and Esther, who arose for Israel in their exile, which resembles the evening, and distributed the booty of Haman. [Benjamin] is compared to a wolf, as the Holy One blessed be He set him to stand against the wolf – that is the kings of Media and Persia, who are compared to a wolf. That is what is written, “And behold, another beast, a second one, resembling a wolf”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word in the verse, <i>dov</i>, is generally translated “bear.” However, when it is spelled without a <i>vav</i>, its meaning in Aramaic is “wolf.” In the verse from Daniel, which is written in Aramaic, <i>dov</i> is spelled without a <i>vav</i> (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> (Daniel 7:5). There<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash, written in Eretz Yisrael, refers here to the interpretation of the Babylonian sages, who understood the term <i>dov</i> in this verse as referring to a bear (see <i>Megilla</i> 11a; <i>Kiddushin</i> 72a; <i>Avoda Zara</i> 2b).</i> they say that [the verse refers to] the kings of Media and Persia, who eat like a bear and have no rest like a bear and grow their hair like a bear. The Holy One blessed be He set Mordekhai and Esther to stand against them, as they were from the tribe of Benjamin, as it is written: “A wolf will take prey” (Genesis 49:27).",
                "Rabbi Ḥiya Raba and Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta were walking in the valley of Arbel and they saw the breaking of the dawn’s light. Rabbi Ḥiya Raba said to Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta: So is the greatness of Israel. First a little and then, as it proceeds, it continuously increases. What is the explanation? “Although I sit in darkness, the Lord is a light for me” (Micah 7:8).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even while Israel sits in darkness, God is already setting in motion the chain of events that will lead to their redemption. So, too, the midrash cites the verse from Esther 2:21 in which Mordekhai sits at the king’s gate and hears the plot of Bigtan and Teresh. This event leads to the eventual salvation of the Jewish people.</i> So initially “Mordekhai was sitting at the king’s gate…” (Esther 2:21) and afterwards, “And Mordekhai went forth from the presence of the king [in royal dress of blue and white wool, and with a great crown of gold]” (Esther 8:15), and afterwards, “For the Jews there was light and joy and jubilation and honor” (Esther 8:16).",
                "That is what is written: “Say to God: How awesome are Your works” (Psalms 66:3). How terrifying are Your wonders. [Those slated to be] killed, kill those who would be their killers, and [those slated to be] hanged, hang those who would hang them. [Those who would be] drowned in the sea, drown those who would have drowned them. So it is, “In the greatness of Your power Your enemies cringe before You” (Psalms 66:3).<br>You find the benevolent qualities of the Holy One blessed be He are abundant, lasting, and of superior quality.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The translation of these terms is in accordance with the interpretation of the <i>Etz Yosef</i>. The term abundance in the continuation of the midrash refers to all of the characteristics mentioned here.</i> Benevolence in abundance, kindness in abundance, mercy in abundance, righteousness in abundance, faithfulness in abundance, redemption in abundance, blessing in abundance, praise in abundance, peace in abundance. Benevolence in abundance, as it says: “How abundant is Your benevolence that You have set aside for those who revere You” (Psalms 31:20). Kindness in abundance, as it says: “And abundant in kindness and truth” (Exodus 34:6). Mercy in abundance, as it says: “Your mercy is abundant, O Lord” (Psalms 119:156). Righteousness in abundance, as it says: “And justice and abundant righteousness” (Job 37:23). Faithfulness in abundance, as it says: “New every morning, Your faithfulness is abundant” (Lamentations 3:23). Your redemption is abundant, as it says: “Israel will implore the Lord, for kindness is with the Lord and His redemption is abundant” (Psalms 130:7). Blessing in abundance, as it says: “I will pour out upon you blessing without limit [<i>beli dai</i>]” (Malachi 3:10). What is “without limit” [<i>beli dai</i>]? Until your lips will wear out [<i>yivlu</i>] from saying enough [<i>dai</i>]. Praise in abundance [<i>raba</i>] as it says: “A God dreaded in the great [<i>raba</i>] council of the holy, awesome to all around Him” (Psalms 89:8). And it is written: “How abundant are your works O Lord, You perform them all with wisdom, the earth is full of Your creations” (Psalms 104:24). Peace in abundance, as it says: “All your children will be disciples of the Lord and abundant will be your children’s peace” (Isaiah 54:13). Do not read “your children” [<i>banayikh</i>] but rather “your builders” [<i>bonayikh</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> “Builders” is understood to refer Torah scholars who build up the world through their teachings.</i> “May there be peace within your walls and tranquility in your palaces. For the sake of my brothers and companions I will say: Peace be with you. For the sake of the house of Lord our God, I will seek your good” (Psalms 122:7–9). “May you see children of your children, peace upon Israel” (Psalms 129:6). “Abundant peace to those who love Your Torah and may they not falter” (Psalms 119:165). May the Lord give might to His people; May the Lord bless his people with peace” (Psalms 29:11). <br>Midrash Esther is complete.<br>*!*"
