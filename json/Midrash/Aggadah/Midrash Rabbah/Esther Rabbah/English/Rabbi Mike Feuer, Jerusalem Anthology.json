                "“…who reigned…” (Esther 1:1) And is not yet king. “…from Hodu to Kush…” (ibid.) Isn’t from Hodu to Kush a small thing? Rather, just as he reigned from Hodu to Kush, so he reigned over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces. And similarly “For he had dominion over all on this side of the river, from Tiphsah even to Gaza…” (Kings I 5:4) Isn’t from Tiphsah to Gaza a small thing? Rather, just as he ruled from Tiphsah to Gaza so too he ruled from one end of the world to the other. And similarly “From Your Temple, which is over Jerusalem, kings will bring You tribute.” (Psalms 68:30) Isn’t from the Temple to Jerusalem a small thing? Rather, just as the sacrifices are found from the Temple to Jerusalem so too in the future messengers bearing gifts will be found for the King Messiah. This is what is written “And all kings will prostrate themselves to him…” (Psalms 72:11) R’ Kohen the brother of R’ Chiya bar Aba said: just as the Divine Presence is found from the Temple to Jerusalem, so too the Divine Presence will fill from one end of the world to the other. This is what is written “…and His glory will fill the entire earth. Amen and amen.” (Psalms 72:19) "
