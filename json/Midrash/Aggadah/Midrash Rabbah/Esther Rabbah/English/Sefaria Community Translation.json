            "...Another explanation. “As if a man flees from the lion…” (Amos 5:19) This refers to Nebuchadnezzar. “…and the bear meets him…” This refers to Belshazzar. “…and he comes to the house and leans his hand on the wall, and a serpent bites him.” This refers to Haman, who stirred up passions like a snake, as it is written “Rehum was the secretary, and Shimshai was the scribe…” he (Shimshai) was the son of Haman, “…they wrote a letter about Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king, as is stated.” (Ezra 4:8) And what was written in the letter? “Now issue an order to stop these men…” and “…they will not give the king's due, the head tax, or the meal tax they will not give, and the tax of the kings will suffer.” (Ezra 4:13) ‘The king’s due (minda),’ refers to the measure of the land. ‘The head tax’ refers to the gold and silver tax. ‘Meal tax’ refers to forced labor. ‘and the tax of the kings will suffer,’ Rav Huna and Rabbi Pinchas said: even those things through which the government makes itself popular, like theater houses and circuses will be damaged. Since they sent the letter, their words were heeded and the work on the Temple was stopped. When the Jews saw this they all began to cry out, woe! “Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus…” (Esther 1:1)...",

            "Rabbi Yuda son of Rabbi Simon opened: \"From the kingship of the hypocritical man, from the ensnarers of the people.\"(Job 34:30) Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rosh Laqish – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: \"At a time when the king is hypocritical – or any leader of people - it is snares (<i>moqesh</i>) to the people, because of their stubbornness (<i>qashuyot</i>) and the desire of the people who do not act to the will of the Creator of the World.\" Rabbi Shimon ben Laqish says: \"Safer for people to grow wings for themselves and fly in the air, rather than be handed over and submit to the hand of a hypocritical king.\" Another interpretation: \"from the kingship of the hypocritical man\" this is Aḥasheverosh, who was hypocritical, for he killed his wife [Vashti] because of his friend [Memukhan], and another time he killed his friend [Haman] because of his wife [Esther]. Abba Oriyan, from Sidon, said five things in the name of Rabban Gamliel: \"(1) When lying judges multiply, lying witnesses multiply. (2) When informants multiply, the people's money is stolen. (3) When brazenness multiplies, glory, majesty, and honor are taken from the people. [(4 - not printed here, but found in Yalkut Shimoni on Nach 920:10): When a younger says to an elder, \"I am better than you,\" the years of people are shortened.] (5) When the beloved children act in a way that angers their Father in Heaven, He raises above them a hypocritical king who exacts retribution from them.\" And who is this? This is Aḥasheverosh. And thus when everyone saw this, they began to cry out, \"Woe!\" [(<i>vay</i>)] – \"and so it was\" [<i>vayehi</i>] in the days of Aḥasheverosh.",

            "Rabbi Tanchuma, Rabbi Berakhiya, and Rabbi Chiya Rabbah and in the name of Rabbi Elazar [all] said, \"This midrash came up to our hands from the exile - any place that it is stated, 'and it was (<i>vayehi</i>),' it is nothing but a term of grief [hinting to the sound, (<i>vay</i>), meaning woe].\" Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani said in the name of Rabbi Yonatan, \" 'Any place that it is stated, \"and it was in the days of,\" it is nothing but a term of grief.'\" And there are five: (1) \"And it was in the days of Amrafel\" (Genesis 14:1). What grief was there over there? They made a war to kill Avraham, our father, as it is stated (Genesis  14:2), \"made war.\" [It is comparable] to a dear friend of a king who entered a province, and on his account was the king [concerned] about that whole province. [Then] barbarians came and grappled with him with words. And when he wanted to leave, they all said to him, \"Woe that the king will no longer be concerned about the province as he was\": So [too,] was Avraham a dear friend of the Holy One, blessed be He - as it is written about him (Isaiah 41:8), \"the seed of Avraham, My dear one\"; and it is written (Genesis 12:3), \"and through you shall all the families of the world be blessed.\" And when the kings came and grappled with him, they all said, \"Woe that the Holy One, blessed be He, will not be concerned with the world as He was; since He was concerned with the world for his sake.\" This is [the meaning of] that which the verse stated (Genesis 14:7), \"And they came to Ein Mishpat (which can be understand as the eye of justice)\" - Rabbi Acha said, \"They sought to grapple with no less than the eyeball of the world.\" They said, \"They sought to blind the eye that [suppressed] the trait of [strict] judgment in the world.\" [The verse continues -] \"It (<i>hee</i>) is Kadesh,\" [but] it is written, \"he (<i>hu</i>) is Kadesh\"; meaning to say, he sanctified (<i>hu kidesh</i>) the name of the Holy One, blessed be He and went down to the fiery furnace. When they saw that the things were like this, they cried out. (2) \"And it was in the days of Achaz the son of Yoshiah, King of Yehudah\" (Isaiah 7:1). What grief was there over there? \"It is what is stated by the verse (Isaiah 9:11), \"Aram is in front and the Philistines are behind, etc.\" [It is comparable] to a king that gave his son over to a mentor, and the mentor hated him. He said, \"If I kill him, I will become liable for death. Rather, I will take away his nourishment from him and he will die on his own\": So did the evil Achaz say, \"If there are no goats, there will be no rams; if there is no flock, there will be no shepherd, [and] where will the world be?\" So did he say, \"If there are no masters, there will be no students; if there are no students, there will be no sages; if there is no Torah, there will be no synagogues and study halls.\" What did he do? He passed all the synagogues and study halls and sealed them. And this [is the meaning of] that which the verse states (Isaiah 8:16), \"Bind up the message; seal the instruction with My disciples.\" And when they saw that the things were like this, they all started to cried out, \"Woe that the world is being destroyed\" - when [study of] the Torah was negated, that was in the days of Achaz. (3) \"And it was in the days of Yehoyakim the son of Yoshiyahu\" (Jeremiah 1:3). What grief was there over there? \"I looked at the earth, and behold it was empty and void; at the heavens and their light was not\" (Jeremiah 4:23), [It is comparable] to edicts of the kings that were brought to the provinces of the kingdom. In each and every province, when it came to their hands, everyone would stand on their feet, uncover their heads and read them with fear, trembling and perspiration. But when they were brought to the province of the king, they tore them up and burned them: When the Holy One, blessed be He, sends His messenger to the nations of the world, they repent, cover themselves in sackcloth and fast - as did the people of Nineveh, as it is stated (Jonah 3:7), \"from the order of the king and his principals, etc.\" They, may their memory be blessed, said, \"One who had a beam or a stone that was stolen in his house would destroy the house and remove it and return the theft.\" And because of this did Yonah fear to prophesy to Nineveh. As Rabbi Tarfon said, \"The fish was designated, etc.\" And the nations of the world are afraid in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, and [so, they are] close to repentance, whereas Israel is stiff-necked. This is what the verse stated (Jeremiah 36:23), \"And it was when Yehudi would read three columns or four\" - meaning to say, he read four verses - and in the fifth verse, he read, \"And her tormentors became the head\" (Lamentations 1:5) - and it is is written (Jeremiah 36:23), \"he would tear it with a scribe's blade and throw it into the fire until the end of all of the scroll.\" And when they saw this, everyone began to cry out, \"Woe for the decree that is hanging over us.\" And the other (4) - \"And it was in the days of Achashverosh\" (Esther 1:1). What grief was there over there? [It is comparable] to a king that had a vineyard, and he had three enemies. What did they do? One cut the small berries, the second ripped the clusters and the third uprooted the vines: The king is King of the kings of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He; His vineyard is Israel, as it is stated (Isaiah 5:7), \"For a vineyard of the Lord of Hosts is the House of Israel\"; [And] their three enemies are Pharaoh, Nevukhadnetsar and Haman. Pharaoh began with the small berries, as it is stated (Exodus 1:22), \"Any son that is born, throw him into the river.\" Nevukhadnetsar ripped the clusters, as it is stated (Jeremiah 29:2), \"the craftsmen and the smiths.\" Who are the craftsmen (<i>charash</i>)? These are the ones that pray the mute prayer silently, and are victorious with their prayer over all the nations of the world. The smiths?  That all the nations of the world come in a vice in front of them but [then] flee, as they put a vice on all the nations - and Nevukhadnetsar come to destroy them; and he destroyed the craftsmen and the smiths, and exiled them. The evil Haman [then] came [to] uproot the vines, as it is stated (Esther 3:13), \"to annihilate, to kill and to destroy.\" Everyone began to cry out, \"Woe,\" and they mourned in front of the Omnipresent. (5) \"And it was in the days when the judges ruled\" (Ruth 1:1) - there was famine there; and what grief is greater than famine? And from where [do we know] that there was famine? As it is stated (Ruth 1:1), \"and there was a famine in the land.\" And why was there a famine? Because Israel and the judges were not judging true judgement; as it is is stated, \"And it was in the days when the judges ruled\" - [and] we find [following it], \"he\", which indicates evildoers. [As] so do we find, \"he was Datan and Aviram\" (Numbers 26:9); \"he was Achashverosh\" (Esther 1:1); \"he was [...] Achaz\" (II Chronicles 28:22). So too were the judges. And to what is the matter comparable? To a province that was liable a tax to the king. [So] he sent collectors to collect it. The people of the province rose and smote the collectors and hung them. The judgment that they were liable - as they appointed other judges for themselves - they did to the collectors. So did they do at that time, as Elimelekh would judge the judges; [since] he was a strongman and there were many men below him. He saw the distress and the famine, but he did not warn the sinners to repent from their evil. And he stopped living in Beit Lechem for himself to live in the field of Moav - to sustain his soul during the famine, and the soul of his wife during the famine, and the soul of his sons; and he did not know that [it is] the Torah that sustains its masters and not the vanities of the world. And he was one who was important, as it is stated (Ruth 1:1), \"and a man went from Beit Lechem, Yehudah.\" And we only say, \"man,\" about an important man, as it is stated (Numbers 12:3), \"And the man, Moshe, was very humble.\" As Elimelekh was an important man, as they would consider him [so] in his place - and [yet] he went to save his soul and the soul of his household, and did not trouble himself about the matters of the community; even as he was an important man and they would have believed his words, [such as] to make them repent from their evil and bring them to repentance. And therefore, it occurred to him as it is written in the verse (Ruth 1:3), \"And Elimelekh, the husband of Naomi died.\" And so [too,] his sons died, as it is stated (Ruth 1:5), \"And [...his] two [sons,] Machlon and Khilyon died, and the woman survived her two children and her husband.\" As so were they judging their judges, like Sodom. Rabbi Shimon ben Abba said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, \"Any place that it is stated, 'and it was (<i>vayehi</i>),' it is used for grief and it is used for joy. And when for grief, there is no grief like it, and when for joy, there is no joy like it.\" (The text is missing the following integral part of the midrash, found in Bereishit Rabbah 42:3 and other places: Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachman came and divided it, \"Any place that it is stated 'it will be,' it is used for joy; [but] 'and it was' [is for] grief.\") The Sages responded, \"Behold 'And God said, \"<i>Vayehi</i> (here used as a command form, and not past tense) light\"' [is] joy!\" He said to them, \"It too is not of joy, as the world did not merit to use that light. As so did Rabbi Yehudah bar Simon say, '[Regarding] the light that the Holy One, blessed be He, created on the first day, Adam [could] look and observe from [one] end of the world to the [other] end. [But] since the Holy One, blessed be He, saw the deeds of the generation of Enosh and the generation of the flood, He arose and hid it from them. That is [the meaning of] what the verse states (Job 38:15), \"From the wicked is their light withheld.\" And to where is it hidden? [It is] in the Garden of Eden, for the righteous ones, as it is stated (Psalms 97:11), \"Light is sown for the righteous, and joy for the straight-hearted.\"'\" They responded to him further, \"It states, 'And it was evening and it was morning, one day.'\" He said to them, \"On that day too, it is not of joy, as all the acts of the first day are destined to wither, as it is stated (Isaiah 51:6), 'when the heavens melt away like smoke and the earth wither like a garment.'\" They responded to him, \"Behold, the [acts of] the second day, the third day, the fourth day, the fifth day, the sixth day.\" He said to them, \"They too are not of joy, as all the acts of the six days of creation require further action - for example, wheat needs to be ground; mustard needs to be mellowed; lupine need to be mellowed.\" They responded to him, \"[And what about,] 'And it was that the Lord was with Yosef and he was a successful man' (Genesis 39:7)?\" He said to them, \"It too is not of joy, as that 'bear' chanced upon him from this, as it is stated in the verse, 'after' - 'And it was after these things, and the wife of his master raised, etc.' (Genesis 39:7).\" They responded to him, \"[And what about,] 'And it was that the Lord was with Yehoshua, and his reputation was in all the land' (Joshua 6:27)?\" He said to them, \"It too is not of joy, as Yair the son of Menashe, whose weight corresponded to the majority of the Sanhedrin, fell at that time; as it is stated (Joshua 7:5), 'And the men of Ai smote of them, like thirty-six men' - and the master said, 'That is Yair the son of Menashe, whose weight corresponded to the majority of the Sanhedrin.'\" They responded to him, \"And is it not written (I Samuel 18:14), 'And it was that David was successful in all of his ways and the Lord was with him'?\" He said to them, \"It too is not of joy, as enmity descended into the heart of Shaul from this, as it is stated (I Samuel 18:9), 'And it was that Shaul eyed David.'\" They responded to him, \"And is it not written (II Samuel 7:1), 'And it was when the king sat in his house and the Lord allowed him rest from all of his enemies'?\" He said to them, \"It too is not of joy, as on that same day, Natan the prophet came to David and said to him, 'However you will not build the House' (I Kings 8:19).\" They said to him, \"Behold, we have said what is ours; [now] say what is yours - that 'and it will be' is joy.\" He said to them, \"'And it will be on that day that the mountains will drip with nectar' (Joel 4:18), that will be in the days of the messiah, and there will be great joy for Israel. And so [too,] 'And it will be on that day that a man shall save alive a heifer of the herd and two sheep' (Isaiah 7:21). And so [too,] 'And it will be on that day that living waters will come out from Jerusalem' (Zechariah 14:8). And so [too,] 'And he will be like a tree planted over streams of water' (Psalms 1:3). And so [too,] 'And the remnant of Yaakov will be among many nations' (Micah 5:6).\" They said to him, \"But behold, it is written (Jeremiah 38:28), '<i>vahaya</i> (here used in the past tense, and not like the other examples) when Jerusalem was captured'!\" He said to them, \"It too is not of grief, as on that day was the verdict of Israel for their sins taken; as so is it written (Lamentations 4:22), 'Your sin has been completed, Daughter of Zion, He will not again exile you.'\""

                "It was in the days [of Aḥashveirosh, he was Aḥashveirosh]: Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa said, \"Because he darkened the faces of Israel like the sides of a pot.\" Rabbi B'rekhya said, \"Because he withered the head of Israel with fasting and affliction.\" Rabbi Levi said, \"Because he made them drink gall and wormwood.\" Rabbi Yuda son of Rabbi Simon said, \"Because he tried to destroy the roots of Israel\". Rabbi Taḥlifa son of Bar Ḥana said, \"Because he was the brother of a leader, the brother of Nevukhadnetzar.\" Could he have been his brother? Wasn't one a Chaldean and another a Median? But one suspended work on the Temple and the other destroyed it, so Scripture considers them equivalent. So is it said, \"Also one one lazy in his work is a brother to the destroyer.\" (Proverbs 18:9) \"Also one lazy in his work\" - this is Aḥashveirosh who suspended work on the Temple. \"A brother to the destroyer\" - this is Nevukhadnetzar who destroyed the Temple. Another interpretation: Of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemia one said \"Aḥashveirosh\" - that he killed his wife because of his friend, \"He was Aḥashveirosh\" - that he killed his friend because of his wife. Rabbi Neḥemia said, \"Aḥashveirosh\" - that he suspended work on the Temple, \"He was Aḥashveirosh\" - that decreed it be rebuilt. Did he decree that it be rebuilt? Didn't Koresh decree that? It is written, \"In the first year of King Koresh.\" (Ezra 6:3) At that time all his counselors came to him and said, \"Your father decreed that it not be rebuilt and you decree that it be rebuilt?! Can a king cancel the decrees of a king?\" He said to them, \"Bring me copies of the decrees\". They brought them to him at once, as it is said \"It was found in Aḥm'ta in the capitol\" (Ezra 6:2). What was written in it? \"Therefore make a decree to stop\" (Ezra 4:21) He said to them, \"Does it say forever? It only said 'until a decree is made by me.' Who can tell me that if my father were alive he would not have built it?\" That is why he is included among the prophets, as it is said, \"The elders of the Jews built and prospered etc.\" (Ezra 6:14)",
                "\"He was\" - five for evil and five for good. Five for evil: \"He was a mighty warrior\" (Genesis 10:9) \"He was Eisav the father of Edom\" (Genesis 36:43) \"They were Datan and Aviram\" (Numbers 26:9) \"He was King Aḥaz\" (Chronicles II 28:22) \"He was Aḥashveirosh\" (Esther 1:1). Five for good: \"Avram was Avraham\" (Chronicles I 1:27) \"They were Moshe and Aharon\" (Exodus 6:26) \"They were Aharon and Moshe\" (Exodus 6:27) \"David was the youngest\" (Samuel I 17:14) \"He was Ḥizkiyahu\" (Chronicles II 32:12) \"He, Ezra, went up from Bavel\" (Ezra 7:6). Rabbi B'rekhya said in the name of the Rabbis over there \"We have one that is better than them all 'He is Hashem our G-d, his judgments are in the whole world' (Psalms 105:7 because His quality of mercy is eternal.\"",
                "\"Aḥashveirosh\" Rabbi Levi and the Rabbis: Rabbi Levi said, \"Aḥashveirosh was Artaḥshasta\" and the Rabbis say \"Aḥashveirosh - because anyone who remembers him has a ache (ḥoshesh) in his head (rosho).\" Why did Scripture call him \"Artaḥshasta\"? Because he would rage (rataḥ) and then calm (tash). \"Aḥashveirosh\": Rabbi Yitzhak and the Rabbis. Rabbi Yitzhak said, \"Aḥashveirosh - that all the troubles came in his time, as it is said 'A great mourning for the Jews' (Esther 4:3). He was Aḥashveirosh - that all the good things came in his time, as it is said 'Esther'.\" The Rabbis say 'Aḥashveirosh' - until Esther came to him. 'He was Aḥashveirosh' - once Esther came to him he would not lie with menstruating women.\"",
                "\"Who ruled\" and had not ruled before. \"From India to Kush\" Isn't from India to Kush a small thing? But just as he ruled from India to Kush so he ruled over one hundred and twenty seven provinces. Similarly, \"For he ruled over all the side of the River, from Tifsaḥ to `Aza.\" (Kings I 5:1) Isn't from Tifsaḥ to `Aza a small thing? But just as he controlled from Tifsaḥ to `Aza so he controlled from one end of the world to the other. Similarly, \"From your temple on Yerushalayim, there will kings lead tribute to you\" (Psalms 68:29). Isn't from the Temple to Yerushalayim a small thing? But just as the sacrifices are to be found from the Temple to Yerushalayim so lines of people with gifts will be found for the anointed king. So is it said, \"All kings will prostrate themselves before him\" (Psalms 72:11). Rabbi Kohen brother of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said, \"Just as the Divine Presence is found from the Temple to Yerushalayim so will the Divine Presence will the world from one end to another.\" So it is said, \"His glory will fill the world. Amen and amen.\" (Psalms 72:19)",
                "\"Seven and twenty and one hundred.\"  Rabbi Elazar in the name of Rabbi Hanina: And are there not only two-hundred fifty two provinces in the world, and David ruled over all of them, as it is written: \"And the name of David went out in all of the lands\" (Chronicles I 14:17).  Solomon ruled over all of them, as it is written: \"And Solomon ruled over all of the kingdoms...\" (Kings I 5:1).  Ahav ruled over all of them, as it is written: \"As the Lord God lives, there is no nation or kingdom...\" (Kings I 18:1).  And does a person swear regarding a place that he does not rule?  Further, \"And he counted the youth of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred thirty two\" (Kings I 20:15).  And where were the rest?  Rabbi Levi and the Rabbis; Rabbi Levi said: all were in famine during the time of Elijah.  The Rabbis say: the son of Hadad came and took them, as it is written: \"And the son of Hadad, the king of Aram, gathered all his armies and thirty two kings with him, and horses and chariots, and he rose up and besieged Shomron and waged war with her\" (Kings I 20:1).  We need twenty, and you say thirty two?  Rather, there was a troublesome province, and two provinces were created from it and he made them connected under his hand.  Rabbi Berechia and the Rabbis; Rabbi Berechia said: the children of his pressure [referring to Lamentations 3:13] and his hostages.  The Rabbis said: 'the children of his pressure,' since they were tortured; and 'his hostages,' since they were the hostages of their fathers, and so it is said: \"And the hostages as well\" (Kings II 14:14) that they were the hostages used in exchange for their fathers.  Nebuchadnezzar ruled over all of them, as it is written: \"And wherever the children of men, the animals of the field, and the birds of the skies...\" (Daniel 2:38).  Koresh ruled over all of them, as it is written: \"All of the kingdoms God gave me\" (Ezra 1:2).  Darius ruled over all of them, as it is written: The King Darius wrote to all the peoples...\" (Daniel 6:26).  Aḥashveirosh ruled over half of them.  Why half?  Rabbi Huna in the name of Rabbi Acha and the Rabbis; Rabbi Huna in the name of Rabbi Acha said: God said to him: you divided my kingdom, as you said \"he is the Lord in Jerusalem\" (Ezra 1:3), know that I will surely divide your kingdom.  The Rabbis said: God said to him: you divided the building that was my house, as you said \"It's height was sixty cubits, and sixty cubits wide\" (Ezra 6:3), know that I will surely divide your kingdom.  And let it say one hundred twenty six, what is it teaching us [by saying one hundred twenty seven]?  Rather, so said God to him: you put one of your own to my house, as you said: \"Whoever from among you has his God with him, let him go up\" (Ezra 1:3).  So too I will add one from mine, as God added one in the calculation, thus it says \"Seven and twenty and one hundred provinces.\"",

Hebrew is spoken but it does not have a writing system. Aramaic has a writing system but is not for speaking. They chose to write in Aramaic letters and to speak in Hebrew. A certain man in a guard house said: \"Carve for them the Latin language from the Greek language\". Rabbi Yehudah the son of Rabbi Simon said: \"It is a disgrace that that they [the Romans] seal documents in a language not their own. And Rab Chanin son of Ada said: \"Claws of bronze (Daniel 7:19)\": she does not seal except in her own language. Rab Samuel the son of Nachman said: \"From this a man must repeat his <i>parshiyot</i>, if Moses did not repeat the Torah to us [in Deuteronomy] we would not know from there about the \"camel (<i>shesu'ah</i>) (Deuteronomy 14:7)\", and if Daniel did not repeat the dream to us we would not know from there \"claws of bronze\".

                "Rabbi Azariah began his sermon: \"Do not ogle that red wine as it lends its color to the cup, as it flows on smoothly (Proverbs 23:31)\". Rabbi Azariah said: \"\"Do not ogle that red wine\": because one will covet the blood of a menstruating woman and the blood of a woman with a flow. \"As it lends its color to the cup (<i>bakkos</i>)\": <i>bakkis</i> (\"in a bag\") is written as a euphemism, and this verse agreeing says: \"We shall all have a common purse (<i>kis</i>) (Proverbs 1:14)\". \"As it flows on smoothly\": in the end, his wife speaks to him: \"I saw [a mark] like a red rose\", and he does not refrain from her\". Rabbi Asei said: \"If he is a wise student, at the end he makes clean the contaminated and contaminates the clean\". Another interpretation: \"Do not ogle that red wine\": it definitely reddens him. \"As it lends its color (<i>'eyno</i>) to the cup\": he fixes his eyes (<i>eynav</i>) on the cup; the bartender fixes his eyes on the purse (<i>bakkis</i>) [hence explaining what is written]. \"As it flows on smoothly (<i>meisharim</i>)\": in the end he will empty out (<i>meisher'a</i>) his house. He says: \"What does this ladle of bronze do? What does a ladle of clay do?\" and he sells it and he drinks wine with its price. And [he says]: \"What does this pot of bronze do? What does a pot of clay do?\" and he sells it and he drinks wine with its price. Rabbi Yitzchak son of Radifah said in the name of Rabbi Amei: \"In the end he sells all the furnishings of his house and drinks wine with them\". Rabbi Acha said: \"There is a story about a certain man who sold all the furnishings of his house and drank wine with them, and his children said to him: \"This old man drink away everything and then die? What do we do? Let us get him alcohol and get him drunk and prepare him for burial and lay him out in the cemetery\". They did that, and left him in the cemetery. The wine merchants were passing by that cemetery and they heard that that province's taxes were being collected so they abandoned their wineskins  in the cemetery. When the man woke up he saw wineskins piled around his head. He took it and began to drink. His children said three days later: \"Let us go and see how our father is\". They came and found him drinking! They said: \"See how your Creator cares for you. This is your fate from heaven, and we do not know what do do with you!\". His children decided that a different one each day would give him a drink. It is written: \"You will be like one lying in bed on high seas, like one lying on top of the rigging (Provers 23:34)\".

And the Rabbis based on Rabbi Jose son of Zimra: \"Every place where \"afterward\" (<i>achar</i>) is said it means \"some time later\" [but where it says] \"after\" (<i>acharei</i>) it means \"immediately\". \"<b>When the anger of King Ahasuerus subsided</b>\", \"right when it subsided\" (<i>beshokh</i>) is not written here but rather \"as it subsided\" (<i>keshokh</i>): it was subsiding but had not subsided. \"<b>He remembered Vashti</b>\": that decree which he had decreed upon her that she come naked before him and if she did not come, it would apply to her and kill her and after he did this he had regret. Why? \"<b>What she had done</b>\" was appropriate. \"<b>And what was decreed against her</b>\" was improper. And why did it happen to her thus? Because she did not release Ahashverosh to begin the rebuilding of the Temple, and she said to him: \"What my fathers destroyed, you seek to rebuild?\". \"<b>The king’s servants who attended him said, “Let beautiful young virgins be sought out for Your Majesty</b> (Esther 2:2)\". ",
                "\"<b>Let Your Majesty appoint officers in every province of your realm to assemble all the beautiful young virgins at the fortress Shushan</b> (Esther 2:3)\". Why? Rabbi Huna said because they were despising the daughters of Israel as unattractive, and every foreigner would not look at them, and so they came to the hand of theman assembling them. Rabbi Chanina the son of Shilka and Rabbi Joshua of Sikhnin and Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Yochanan said: \"An Israelite and a gentile are neighbors in one courtyard and the Israelite crushed his food in a jar and the gentile touched it, it is not contaminated, and if a gentile crushed his food in a jar and an Israelite touched it, he says that it is contaminated? But rather there fell together in it foul things and creeping things, the gentile would eat it, and if the Israelite were to have the same thing happen he would break it. So it is written: \"Summon archers against Babylon, All who draw the bow! Encamp against her roundabout, Let none of her people escape. Pay her back for her actions (Jeremiah 50:29)\".

Did she take gold for which she should give gold? \"They have ravished women in Zion, Maidens in the towns of Judah (Lamentations 5:11)\": what does this teach? So the Holy One, blessed be He said: \"You burned after nakedness; by your lives I am bringing upon you a nation which will not seek gold and silver from you. See! It is written: “Behold, I stir up the Medes against them, Who do not value silver Or delight in gold (Isaiah 13:17)\".

This is to make them emulate their Creator as it says [about God] and My name, Jehovah, I did not make known to them. \"Jewish\" -- Why was he called 'Judean' if he was of Benjamin? Because he attested to the unity of God in the world as it says \"[and Mordechai] would not kneel and would not bow] (therefore he was called a part of Judah which means 'to acknowledge God'). And [why] was he a contrarian that ignored the king's decree? Because when Ahasuerus  decreed that everyone should bow to Haman, Haman started wearing an idol so that everyone would bow to the idol, and when he saw that Mordechai refused to bow he became very angry. Mordechai told him \"there is a Lord who is above all the arrogant. How can I forsake him and bow to an idol?\" Thus, because he attested to God's unity, he was called The Jew i.e. the only Jew.  There are those who also compare him to Abraham. Just as Abraham threw himself into the furnace, came out alive, and caused people to recognize God -- this being what is referred to by the verse \"and the souls they made in Haran\" -- Mordechai also helped pepole recognize God in his own day as it says \"And many people of the land converted to Judaism.\" [In conclusion] he attested to the unity of God and His holiness and was therefore called \"the Jew\".",

                "Reish Lakish said:  At the time when the wicked Haman said to Ahasuerus, “Come, let us destroy Israel from the world”, Ahasuerus replied: You cannot overcome them, because their God does not forsake them at all.  Come, see what they did to the ancient kings who came before us who raised up their arms against them.  Those kingdoms were mighty and more numerous than we are.  And yet everyone who came upon them to annihilate them from the world and to scheme against them, they were annihilated from the world and became a lesson for all those who dwell on earth.  And we who do not have their advantages, how much the more so!  Enough of your chatter, recant this decree. Even so, the wicked Haman bothered Ahasuerus about the decree all the time and advised him with wicked schemes about Israel.  Ahasuerus said:  If so (if it really means this much to you), let’s consult the advisors and soothsayers. Immediately, he sent and gathered all the advisors from the nations of the world.  They all came before him.  Ahasuerus said to them:  Is it your will for us to destroy this nation from the world?  They said all at once:  Who is the one who wishes to do thus?!  For if you destroy Israel from the world, the world will cease to exist!  The world only exists because of the Torah which was given to Israel. (As it is written “As surely as I have established my covenant with day and night-- have I not ruled the heavens and the earth?” (Jer. 33:25).  And not only that, but all idolaters are called foreigners before the Holy Blessed one, as it is written, “Or if a foreigner who is not from your nation of Israel…” (1 Kings 8:41), and Israel is called close ones, as it is written “For the Children of Israel, God’s nation of close ones” (Ps. 148:14).  And not only that, but they are also called God’s children, as it is written, “My eldest son is Israel” (Ex. 4:22) and “You are children of the Lord your God” (Deut. 14:1).  And the Holy Blessed One is called a close one of Israel, as it is written, “God is close to all who call on Him, to all who call on Him in truth” (Ps. 145:18).  There is no nation closer to the Holy Blessed One than Israel, as it is written, “(For what great nation has a god as close to it) as our God whenever we call upon Him?” (Deut. 4:7).) And if a person wants to raise a hand against the Holy Blessed One’s close ones and children, how can he survive?  For God rules over the upper and lower worlds and every living soul!  God has the ability to raise up and knock down, to kill and to give life!  Go and investigate what came to pass with the ancient kings who raised their hands against Israel-- what happened to them, like Sanheriv and Pharaoh? Immediately, Haman said to them:  The God who drowned Pharaoh in the sea and did all those miracles and wonders for Israel that you have heard about-- He is elderly and powerless!  Nebuchadnezzar was able to ascend and destroy His house, burn His sanctuary, and exile Israel and scatter them among the nations.  And where is his power and might?  He has aged!  As it says, “They say: The Lord sees not, the God of Jacob does not attend.” (Ps. 94:7) When he presented this argument, they immediately accepted his words and were of one mind to end Israel.  And they wrote proclamations and signed them. And thus was written in those proclamations: Greetings to you who are innumerable!  You surely know that among us there is a man who is not from our place but rather he is from the royal bloodline and from Amalek’s bloodline and he is among the greatest men of our generation -- and his name is Haman. He was asked a small, insignificant question about one of the nations in our midst, lowly among the nations but exceedingly haughty.  They seek our downfall and regularly curse the king. (And what is the curse they curse us with?  “God is King forever, nations shall perish from His land” (Ps. 10:16) and they further say, “To impose retribution upon the nations and punishment upon the peoples” (Ps. 149:7).) And they rebel against those who have done them good.  Come and see what they did to poor Pharaoh.  When they went down to Egypt, he greeted them warmly, settled them in the best of the land, sustained them in the years of famine, and fed them all the best from his land.  His palaces needed to be built and they were employed to build there. Nonetheless, he could not overpower them. And not only that!  They also treated him with deception.  They said, “To sacrifice to our God, we will walk a distance of three days’ travel (Ex. 5:3) and then come back.  If it is your will, lend us silver and gold and clothing.” And they lent their silver and gold and all the nice clothing they had and packed up untold numbers of donkeys.  Thus they completely ransacked Egypt-- as it is written, “They completely ransacked Egypt” (Ex. 12:36) -- and escaped. When Pharaoh heard that they were escaping, he went after them to reclaim his money.  What did they do to him?  They had a man with them named Moshe ben Amram.  With his sorcery he lifted some stick and cast a spell on it and hit the sea until it split.  They all entered on dry land in the midst of the sea and all of them passed through.  I do not know how they passed or how the sea dried up.  When Pharaoh saw this, he went after them to reclaim his money.  I do not know how they pushed him into the sea, but he and all his soldiers drowned.  And they did not recall the good he had done for them.  Do you not agree that they are ingrates?! And further -- what did they do to Amalek my grandfather?  At the time when they did battle -- as it says, “Amalek came and did battle against Israel at Refidim” (Ex. 17:8). And from where was Amalek coming?  Rabbi Keruspedai said in the name of Rabbi Yohanan, he was coming from the wicked Bilaam.  Amalek had gone to seek advice from him.  He said, “I know that you are a schemer and also a wicked planner and all who take advice from you succeed.”  Bilaam said to him, “Look what that nation did to Egypt, who had done so much good for them-- if that’s what they did to Egypt, what would they do to the other nations?!”  Amalek said, “How do you advise me?”  Bilaam said to him, “Go do battle with them.  If you do not do battle with them you will never overcome them, because they rely on the merit of their ancestor Abraham -- but you also are a descendant of Abraham who can rely on his merit!”  Immediately, he went to do battle with them. What did their leader Moshe do?  He had a disciple named Yehoshua bin Nun.  He was exceedingly cruel and had no mercy.  That Moshe said to him, “Choose men for us to do battle with Amalek” (Ex. 17:9).  I do not know whether those men he chose were sorcerers or warriors.  What did that Moshe do?  He picked up his staff.  I do not know what he did with it.  And when they met for battle I do not know what kind of spell he cast, but [the Israelites] let loose and [the Amalekites] fell before them.  Thus it is written, “Joshua subdued Amalek and his people by sword” (Ex. 17:13). They came to Sihon and Og, warriors of our land, before whom no creature can stand.  I do not know how they killed them.  They came to the kings of Midian.  I do not know how they killed them. And further -- what did that disciple of that Moshe do?  He brought the Israelites into the land of Canaan.  It wasn’t enough to take their land, but they also killed thirty one kings and divided up their land among the Israelites.  They were merciless -- those who they did not seek to kill were taken as slaves. They came to Sisera and his troops.  I do not know what they did to Wadi Kishon, which swept them up like ashes and carried them off and threw them in the great sea.  As it says, “The Wadi Kishon swept them away” (Judges 5:21). And they had a first king named Saul.  He led them to battle in the land of my grandfather Amalek.  He killed 100,000 soldiers in one day and he did not take pity on any man, woman, baby, or infant.  I do not know how he killed them.  And further, what did they do to Agag, my ancestor, on whom they had taken pity initially?  In the end, a man came from among them named Samuel and cut him up and fed his flesh to the birds of the sky.  As it says, “Samuel cut down Agag” (1 Sam. 15:33).  And I do not know why he killed him by this unusual method, as you have heard. And after that they had a king named David ben Yishai.  He slaughtered and annihilated all the kingdoms and did not take pity on them, as it says “David left alive neither man nor woman.” (1 Sam 27:11) And after him arose his son, Solomon.  He built a house for the Israelites and called it “The House of Holiness” (beit hamikdash).  I do not know what they had  inside it but when they were going to battle, they would go inside it and do sorcery. And when they came out, they killed and destroyed the world. And in spite of all of the good they had, they rebelled against their God.  And also their God had aged. So Nebuchadnezzar came and burnt their house and exiled them from their land and brought them among us.  Yet they still have not changed their repulsive ways.  Even though they are exiled among us, they mock us and our faith in our gods. So now we have all come to a consensus.  We drew lots to destroy them from the world, to decide at what time we should end them.  The lot fell for them in the month of Adar on the 13th day. Now, when these proclamations arrive to you, you are invited on that day to massacre and destroy all the Jews among you, from child to elder, babies and women in one day.  Thus there will be no shred or survivor left. When the proclamations were signed and given into Haman’s hand, he and all his crew were joyful.  They encountered Mordecai who was walking ahead of them.  Mordecai saw three children coming from school.  He ran after them.  When Haman and his crew saw that Mordecai was running after the children, they followed him to find out what he would ask them.  When Mordecai caught up to the children, he said to one of them, “Quote to me the verse you are learning.”  He said, “Do not fear sudden terror or the disaster of the wicked when it comes” (Prov. 3:25).  The second joined in and said, “I also learned Tanakh today and the last verse I ended on was: Hatch a plot-- it will be foiled!  Agree on an action-- it will not succeed.  For with us is God!” (Isa. 8:10) The third joined in and said, “Til you grow old, I will still be the same.  When you turn gray, it is I who will carry.  I was the Maker and I am the Carrier, I will carry and rescue you.” (Isa. 46:4) When Mordecai heard this, he laughed and was overjoyed.  Haman asked him, “Why are you so joyful about the words of these children?”  Mordecai said, “Because they have given me the good word that I shouldn’t fear from the wicked scheme you are plotting against us!”  Haman was angered and said, “I will lift my hand first against these children.” "

And now, our God, please save us from his hand, and let him fall in the pit that he has dug and be trapped in the net that he hid for the feet of Your pious ones, and that this angering one should know that You have not forgotten Your promise that You promised us (Leviticus 26:44), 'And also with this; in their being in the land of their enemies, I will will not reject them and I will not abhor them to destroy them, to rescind My covenant with them, as I am the Lord, their God.'\"   And what did Mordechai do? He gathered the children, and afflicted them from [receiving] bread and water and clothed them with sackcloth and sat them in the dust, and they were calling out and crying and involved in Torah [study]. And at that time, Esther was very scared because of the evil that had grown in Israel and she took off the clothing of her royalty and splendor and wore sackcloth, and she uncovered the hair of her head and covered it with dust and ashes, and she afflicted herself with fasting. And she fell on her face in front of the Lord and prayed and said, \"Lord, God of Israel, who has ruled from the days of yore and created the world, please help Your maidservant, as I was orphaned without father or mother and am comparable to a poor woman who goes to beg from house to house; so do I beg Your mercy, from window to window in the house of Achasverosh. And now, Lord, please give success to Your maidservant  - this poor woman – and the flock of Your shepherding from these enemies that have risen against us, as You have no impediment from saving with the many or with the few. And, You, O Father of orphans, please stand to the right of this orphan, who trusted in Your kindness, and give me mercy in front of this man, as I feared him; and bring him low in front of me, as you bring the proud ones low.\""

                "After Haman made the tree he went to Mordechai and found him sitting in the study hall with the children surrounding him wearing sackcloth, studying Torah screaming and crying. He counted them and found 12,000 (or 22,000) children. He put chains of iron on them and assigned guards to watch them. He said “Tomorrow, I will first kill these children and then hang Mordechai.” Their mothers brought them food and drink and told them to eat and drink today so they don’t die hungry. Immediately they put their hands on the Torah and swore by the life of Mordechai their teacher not to eat or drink, but rather to die fasting. Their moaning and crying went up to heavens and Hashem heard their crying. At that time, the mercy of Hashem was awakened and he got up from the seat of judgement and sat in the seat of mercy. He said what is this great cry that i hear, like sheep and goats? Moshe Rabeinu stood up and said, it is not sheep or goats, it is the children of your nation who are fasting and praying because tomorrow they will be slaughtered like sheep and goats. At that time, Hashem took the letters that he signed with the decree against the Jewish people and ripped them up. He then caused Acheshveirosh great discomfort, as it is written “At that night, the king couldn’t sleep” "

                "[Esther 6:1] \"That night the sleep of the king wandered\" - Heaven's [sleep] wandered. This is the throne of the King of all kings, the Holy One , blessed be He, who saw Israel in sorrow. And is there sleep in relation to the Omnipresent? Does it not already say (Psalms 121:4) \"Behold, he does not slumber, nor sleep, He guards Israel\"? Rather, [God is only asleep] in a time when Israel is embroiled in distress, and the nations of the world are in peace, and therefore  it says, (Psalms 44:24) \"Awake! Why do You sleep, O God?\" \"The sleep of the king wandered\" - Ahashverosh, for he saw in his dream Haman drawing a sword to kill him. He panicked and awoke from his sleep. He said to his scribe: Bring me the book of chronicles, to read and to see what happened to him. And the scribes began, and they found the matter of Mordechai informing about Bigtan and Teresh. And once they said to the king, \"Behold, Haman is standing in the courtyard,\" the king said, \"What I saw in my dream was true! He has only come at this time to kill me.\"",
                "[Esther 6:4] \"To hang Mordechai on the tree that he had prepared for him\" - It was taught: He prepared it for him, and about him it is said, (Psalms 7:13, Psalms 7:15) \"And he prepared for him instruments of death, his arrows against the persecutors... A pit, he made it and dug it out, and he has fallen into the ditch he made.\"",
                "\"And Haman said in his heart...\" (Esther 6:6) - The wicked are ruled by their hearts. \"And Esav said in his heart\" (Genesis 27:41). \"The fool says in his heart\" (Psalms 14:1). \"And Yeravam said in his heart\" (I Kings 12:26). \"And Haman said in his heart\" (Esther 6:6). But the righteous rule their hearts. That is as it is written: \"And Chanah spoke upon her heart\" (Samuel 1:12). \"And Daniel decided upon his heart\" (Daniel 1:8). \"And David said to his heart\" (I Samuel 27:1). And they are emulating their creator, \"And God said to His heart\" (Genesis 8:21).",
                "He went to Mordechai: Once it was told to Mordechai that he was coming, he became extremely frightened. He was sitting and his students were in front of him. He said to his students, \"My sons! Run away from here, so you will not be burned by my coals, for the wicked Haman is coming to kill me.\" They said, \"If you die, we will die with you.\" He said to them, \"If so, let us stand in prayer, and we will pass away in the midst of prayer.\" They finished praying. They delved into the laws of the commandment of the Omer, for that day was the 16th of Nissan, and on that day they would have been offering the Omer when the Holy Temple was still there. Haman came to them. He said to them, \"What are you dealing with?\" They said to him, \"The commandment of the Omer. That's what is written: [Leviticus 2:1] 'And when you bring a grain offering to God...' There they said the laws of the handful [of the barley for the priest].\" They showed it to him. \"One of those would they do the handful from the Omer.\" He said to them, \"The Omer, is it of gold or silver?\" They said to him, \"It is not of gold, nor silver, nor wheat, but barley.\" He said to them, \"How much is its price, 10 Kantars [i.e. a lot]?\" They said to him, \"It's enough [to buy it] with but 10 Mon [i.e. very little].\" He said to them, \"Get up from the dirt! The 10 ma'ahs of yours will [surely] triumph over my 10,000 bundles of silver.\" Once [Mordechai] finished his prayers, Haman said to him, \"Get dressed in the royal clothes.\" He said to him, \"What, do you mean to disgrace the kingdom? Is there anyone who dresses in the royal clothes without getting washed [first]?\" [Haman] went and sought a bathkeeper, but he could not find. What did he do? He wrapped his loins and brought him in to wash [in his private bath]. Once he left [the bath], [Haman] said to him, \"Old man, put on this crown.\" He said, \"What, you mean to disgrace the kingdom? Is there anyone who puts on a royal crown without getting a haircut [first]?\" [Haman] sought a barber but couldn't find. What did he do? He went home and brought scissors, and he sat him down and was cutting his hair. He began to groan. [Mordechai] said to him, \"What's with you that you're groaning?\" He said to him, \"Woe to the father of that man [me], who is letting go of his opportunity as king, to control everything, and has become a bathkeeper and a barber!\" [Mordechai] said to him, \"Is it any wonder? I don't know the father of that man [if he was] a bathkeeper and a barber in Kfar Krainos, but you indeed found his scissors!\" [Haman] said to him, \"Get up! Ride upon these horses!\" [Mordechai] said to him, \"I don't have the strength. I'm old!\" He said to him, \"And I'm not an old man?\" He said to him, \"Didn't you do this to yourself [i.e. this is your fault]?\" He said to him, \"Get up, I'll lean my neck, and you can step on top of it, and you will go up and ride, to fulfill for you that which is written, (Deuteronomy 33:29), 'You shall tread on their high places.'\"",

                "(Esther 6:12) \"And Mordechai returned to the gate of the king\" - This teaches that he returned to his sackcloth and his fasting. Rabbi Chelbo said: Anyone who wears sackcloth and fasts should not remove it until his request is fulfilled."
