            "Rabbi Abba bar Kahana began: “Raise your voice, Bat-Galim, [listen, Layish; destitute is Anatot]” (Isaiah 10:30). Isaiah said to Israel: Instead of reciting songs and psalms before idols, raise your voice in words of Torah, raise your voice in synagogues. “Bat-Galim” – just as these waves [<i>galim</i>] are conspicuous in the sea, so their ancestors were conspicuous in the world.<br>Another matter: “Bat-Galim” (Isaiah 10:30) – <i>bat golim</i>, daughter of exiles: daughter of Abraham, the one of whom it is written: “There was a famine in the land and Abram descended to Egypt [to reside there]” (Genesis 12:10); daughter of Isaac, of whom it is written: “Isaac went to Avimelekh, king of the Philistines, to Gerar” (Genesis 26:1); daughter of Jacob, of whom it is written: “He went to Padan Aram” (Genesis 28:5). “Listen” (Isaiah 10:30), listen to My commandments, listen to words of Torah, listen to words of prophecy, listen to perform acts of righteousness and good deeds.<br>“Layish [<i>Laisha</i>]” (Isaiah 10:30) – and if not, <i>laisha</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is one of the biblical terms for lion.</i> the lion will ascend upon you. This is the wicked Nebuchadnezzar, in whose regard it is written: “The lion has ascended from its lair” (Jeremiah 4:7). “Destitute [is Anatot]” (Isaiah 10:30) – destitute of righteous individuals, destitute of prophecy, destitute of mitzvot<i></i> and good deeds. “Anatot” – and if not,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If you do not listen to all these warnings.</i> “Anatot,” – that resident of Anatot will come and prophesy in your regard, as it is written: “The words of Jeremiah son of Ḥilkiyahu, of the priests who were in Anatot…” (Jeremiah 1:1). When the punishment arrived, he lamented over them, <i>eikha</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Eikha</i> means “how,” and is the opening word of the book of Lamentations, which begins: “How does the city that was full of people sit solitary?” (Lamentations 1:1). <i>Eikha</i> is also the Hebrew name of the book of Lamentations. The prologue to <i>Eikha Rabba</i> records how different Sages would begin their study of Lamentations. They would often begin by expounding a verse that in their view encapsulated the essence of the book, before beginning with the first verse. Thus, many of these introductions conclude with the word <i>eikha</i>, which is used as an expression of lamentation, as well as a reference to Lamentations 1:1 and a transition from the Sage’s introduction to his actual recitation or study of Lamentations (see <i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i>",
            "Rabbi Abba bar Kahana began: “Who is the wise man who will understand this…” (Jeremiah 9:11). Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: If you have seen towns uprooted from their place in the Land of Israel, know that they did not provide the salaries of the Bible teachers and the Mishna teachers, as it is stated: “For what reason did the land perish.… The Lord said: Because they have forsaken My Torah” (Jeremiah 9:11–12).<br>Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] would dispatch Rabbi Asi and Rabbi Ami to go out and establish [educational programs] in the cities of Israel. They would enter the city and say to [the residents]: ‘Bring us the guardians of the city.’ They would bring them the head of the city watch and the police. They would say to them: ‘Are these the guardians of the city? These are the destroyers of the city.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is because the people rely on them for their security and do not place their trust in God.</i> [The residents] would say to them: ‘Who are the guardians of the city?’ They would say to [the residents]: ‘They are the Bible teachers and the Mishna teachers, who contemplate, review, and observe the Torah day and night, because it is stated: “You shall contemplate it day and night” (Joshua 1:8), and it says: “If the Lord does not build a house…[if the Lord does not guard a city, in vain does the watchman keep vigil]”’ (Psalms 127:1).<br>Rabbi Huna and Rabbi Yirmeya said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel ben Rabbi Yitzḥak: We have found that the Holy One blessed be He overlooked idol worship, forbidden sexual relations, and bloodshed, but did not overlook disdain of the Torah, as it is stated: “For what reason did the land perish?” (Jeremiah 9:11). It is not written here that it was due to idol worship, forbidden sexual relations, and bloodshed;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is despite the fact that the generation in which the First Temple was destroyed was considered to have been derelict regarding these very grave sins; see <i>Yoma</i> 9b.</i> rather, “Because they have forsaken My Torah” (Jeremiah 9:12).<br>Rabbi Huna and Rabbi Yirmeya said in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: It is written: “They have forsaken Me and did not observe My Torah” (Jeremiah 16:11). If only they had forsaken Me and observed My Torah. By engaging in it, the light that is in it would have returned them to the good [path].<br>Rav Huna said: Study Torah even if it is not for its own sake, as through doing so not for its own sake, one comes to do so for its own sake. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Each and every day a Divine Voice emerges from Mount Ḥorev and says: Woe unto the people due to the affront to Torah.<br>Shmuel taught it in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Ami: When does the kingdom issue a decree<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A decree against the Jews.</i> and the decree is effective? When Israel casts the words of Torah to the ground; that is what is written: “A host was given for the continual offering for transgression; [it cast truth to the ground, and it acted and succeeded]” (Daniel 8:12). “Host” is nothing other than kingdoms, as it is stated: “The Lord will reckon with the host of heaven in heaven [and with the kings of the earth on the earth]” (Isaiah 24:21). “The continual offering” – this is Israel, as it is written: “You shall contemplate it day and night” (Joshua 1:8). “For transgression” – this is the transgression of Torah. Whenever Israel casts the words of Torah to the ground, the kingdom issues a decree and it is effective, as it is stated: “It cast truth to the ground…,” and “truth” is nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “Acquire truth and do not sell” (Proverbs 23:23).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In context, this verse refers to Torah.</i> If you cast the words of Torah to the ground, the kingdom succeeds immediately; that is what is written: “And it acted and succeeded.” Rabbi Yehuda ben Pazi said: “Israel has forsaken good…” (Hosea 8:3), and good is nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “For I have given you a good lesson, [My Torah, do not forsake it]” (Proverbs 4:2).<br>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: No philosophers arose for the nations of the world like Bilam ben Beor and Avnimus the weaver. They said to them:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The nations of the world said to the philosophers.</i> ‘Are we able to successfully challenge this nation?’ They said to them: ‘Go and visit their synagogues; if the children are reciting aloud, you will be unable to overcome them, but if not, you will be able to overcome them, for this is what their patriarch promised them when he said to them: “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau” (Genesis 27:22): As long as the voice of Jacob is in the synagogues and the study halls, the hands are not the hands of Esau.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">War with Israel will be futile.</i> But, when his voice is not reciting in the synagogues and the study halls, the hands are the hands of Esau.’ So, it says: “Therefore, just as straw consumes a tongue of fire, [and a flame destroys stubble, their root will become rot and their blossom will rise like dust; for they have forsaken the Torah of the Lord of hosts, and they have scorned the word of the Holy One of Israel]” (Isaiah 5:24). Does straw consume fire? Is it not the way of fire to consume straw, and yet it states: “Therefore, just as straw consumes a tongue of fire.” Rather, “straw” – this is the house of Esau, as it is stated: “The house of Jacob will be fire, the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for straw” (Obadiah 1:18). “A tongue of fire” – this is the house of Jacob; “and a flame destroys stubble” – this is the house of Joseph; “their root will become rot” – these are the patriarchs, who are the roots of Israel; “and their blossom will rise like dust” – these are the tribes, who are the blossoms of Israel. Why? “For they have forsaken the Torah of the Lord of hosts…” Rabbi Yudan said: “For they have forsaken the Torah of the Lord of hosts” – this is the written Torah; “and they have scorned the word of the Holy One of Israel” – this is the Oral Torah. When they cast the words of Torah to the ground, Jeremiah began lamenting over them, <i>eikha</i>.<br>“So said the Lord of hosts: Attend, and call for the lamenting women” (Jeremiah 9:16). Rabbi Yoḥanan, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, and the Rabbis: Rabbi Yoḥanan said: [This is analogous] to a king who had two sons. He grew angry at the first, took the rod, struck him, and exiled him. He said: Woe unto him, from what tranquility was he exiled. He grew angry at the second, took the rod, struck him, and exiled him. He said: It is I whose culture is faulty. So too, the ten tribes were exiled, and the Holy One blessed be He began saying this verse in their regard: “Woe unto them, as they have strayed from Me” (Hosea 7:13).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He placed the blame on them.</i> When Judah and Benjamin were exiled, the Holy One blessed be He said, as it were: “Woe is Me, for My hurt” (Jeremiah 10:19).<br>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: [This is analogous] to a king who had two sons. He grew angry at the first, took the rod, struck him, and he convulsed and died. He began lamenting him. He grew angry at the second, took the rod, struck him, and he convulsed and died. He said: I no longer have the strength to lament them; rather, call the lamenting women, and they will lament them. So too, the ten tribes were exiled, and the Holy One blessed be He began lamenting them: “Hear this matter that I recite as a lamentation for you, house of Israel” (Amos 5:1). When Judah and Benjamin were exiled, the Holy One blessed be He said, as it were: I no longer have the strength to lament them. That is what is written: “Call for the lamenting women…and let them hasten and take up wailing over us, [and our eyes will shed tears, and our eyelids will flow with water]” (Jeremiah 9:16–17). It is not written here, “over them,” but rather, “over us,” Me and them. It is not written here, “and their eyes will shed tears,” but rather, “our eyes,” Mine and theirs. It is not written here, “and their eyelids will flow with water,” but rather, “our eyelids,” Mine and theirs.<br>The Rabbis say: [This is analogous] to a king who had twelve sons. Two died, and he began taking solace with the [remaining] ten. Two more died, and he began taking solace with eight. Two died, and he began taking solace with six. Two died, and he began taking solace with four. Two died, and he began taking solace with two. When they all died, he began lamenting them: “How does…sit solitary?” (Lamentations 1:1).",
            "Rabbi Abba bar Kahana began: “I did not sit in the company of revelers and rejoice” (Jeremiah 15:17) – The congregation of Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: Master of the universe: I have never entered the theaters and the circuses of the nations of the world and played and rejoiced with them.<br>“Because of Your hand I sat solitary” (Jeremiah 15:17) – the hand of Pharaoh touched me, and I did not sit solitary. The hand of Sennacherib touched me, and I did not sit solitary. When Your hand touched me, I sat solitary: “How does…sit solitary?” (Lamentations 1:1).",
            "Rabbi Abbahu began: “But they, like men [<i>ke’adam</i>], have violated the covenant” (Hosea 6:7) – this is Adam the first man. The Holy One blessed be He said: I brought Adam the first man into the Garden of Eden, I commanded him, and he violated My command. I sentenced him to banishment and expulsion, and I lamented him with <i>eikha</i>. I brought him into the Garden of Eden, as it is stated: “He placed him in the Garden of Eden” (Genesis 2:15). I commanded him, as it is stated: “The Lord God commanded the man saying.… [but from the tree of knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat]” (Genesis 2:16–17). He violated My command, as it is stated: “Have [you eaten] from the tree from which I commanded you [not to eat?]” (Genesis 3:11). I sentenced him to banishment, as it is stated: “He banished the man” (Genesis 3:24). I sentenced him to expulsion, as it is stated: “The Lord [God] sent him from the Garden of Eden” (Genesis 3:23). I lamented him with <i>eikha</i>, as it is stated: “He said to him: Where are you [<i>ayeka</i>]” (Genesis 3:9); it is written <i>eikha</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ayeka</i> and <i>eikha</i> are each spelled <i>alef</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>kaf</i>, <i>heh</i>. Thus, it is as though God used the word <i>eikha</i>, how, regarding Adam, as if to say: How did this come to be, just as the first word of Lamentations is how [<i>eikha</i>].</i><br>His descendants, too, I brought into the Land of Israel, as it is stated: “I brought you into a fruitful land” (Jeremiah 2:7). I commanded them, as it is stated: “Command the children of Israel” (Leviticus 24:2). They violated My command, as it is stated: “All Israel has violated your Torah” (Daniel 9:11). I sentenced them to banishment, as it is stated: “From My house I will banish them” (Hosea 9:15). I sentenced them to expulsion, as it is stated: “Send them from My presence and let them go” (Jeremiah 15:1). I lamented them with: “How does…sit solitary?” (Lamentations 1:1).",
            "Rabbi Abbahu in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina began: “Therefore, so said the Lord [God]: Woe, city of bloodshed, [the pot whose filth is in it, and its filth has not gone out of it. Take it out piece by piece; no lot has been drawn over it]” (Ezekiel 24:6) – woe to the city in which blood has been shed. “The pot whose filth is in it” – whose filth is in it;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash is translating the Hebrew phrase into Aramaic, which was the commonly spoken language when the midrash was composed.</i> “and its filth has not gone out of it” – its filth has not gone out of it; “take it out piece by piece” – they would be exiled in increments.<br>How were they exiled? Rabbi Elazar says: The tribe of Reuben and the tribe of Gad were exiled first. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: The tribe of Zebulun and the tribe of Naphtali were exiled first; that is what is written: “The first [<i>ka’et</i>] has dealt lightly with the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali” (Isaiah 8:23).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The phrase “has dealt lightly” is interpreted to mean lightened the population by exiling these tribes.</i> How does Rabbi Elazar interpret the verse of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman? Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: Like the time [<i>ka’et</i>] that the tribes of Reuben and Gad were exiled, so were the tribe of Zebulun and the tribe of Naphtali exiled. “But the latter has dealt severely [<i>hikhbid</i>]” (Isaiah 8:23) – Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: He dragged them as with a broom [<i>makhbid</i>]. That is what is written: “I will sweep it with a broom of destruction” (Isaiah 14:23).<br>“No lot has been drawn over it” (Ezekiel 24:6) – Rabbi Naḥman said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: What is “no lot has been drawn over it”? The Holy One blessed be He said: When I drew lots over the nations of the world to exile them, they were not exiled. Why, then, were you exiled? “For its blood was within it” (Ezekiel 24:7).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a reference to the blood of Zekharia, the High Priest and prophet who was killed in the Temple, as the midrash will discuss.</i> Why to that extent? It was “to arouse fury” (Ezekiel 24:8).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They left the blood of Zekharia uncovered in order to arouse God’s fury.</i><br>Rabbi Yudan asked Rabbi Aḥa, he said to him: Where did Israel kill Zekharia, in the Israelite courtyard or in the women’s courtyard? He said to him: Neither in the Israelite courtyard nor in the women’s courtyard, but rather in the priestly courtyard. And they did not treat his blood like the blood of a deer nor like the blood of a gazelle. Regarding the blood of a gazelle and the blood of a deer it is written: “He shall pour out its blood and cover it with dirt” (Leviticus 17:13). But here it is written: “For its blood was within it; on a bare rock it placed it. It did not pour it on the ground to cover it with dirt” (Ezekiel 24:7).<br>Another matter: “Therefore, so said the Lord [God]: Woe, city of bloodshed” (Ezekiel 24:9) – woe to the city in which blood has been spilled. “I too will increase the conflagration” (Ezekiel 24:9) – I will increase the punishment. “Increase the wood” (Ezekiel 24:10) – these are the legions; “ignite the fire” (Ezekiel 24:10) – these are the kings; “consume the flesh” (Ezekiel 24:10) – this is the public. “Blend the mixture” (Ezekiel 24:10) – Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Neḥemya said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: Because all Israel were saying: Nebuchadnezzar has gathered all the wealth in the world, and he needs our wealth?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They assumed that Nebuchadnezzar would have no reason to attack them and they would remain safe.</i> The Holy One blessed be He said: As you live, I will render your wealth dear to him like those spices that are served at a feast.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It was customary to burn incense at the end of a feast. Although all the food had already been consumed, this was considered a significant and desirable addition. Similarly, Nebuchadnezzar will seek your wealth in addition to all he has already amassed (Maharzu).</i> “The bones will be charred” (Ezekiel 24:10) – you find that when Israel were exiled, their bodies became heated like a spiced dish.<br>“Place it empty upon its coals” (Ezekiel 24:11) – Rabbi Elazar said: Had it been stated [that it was] broken, there could have been no remedy forever, but it says “empty,” and any empty vessel will ultimately be filled. Why to that extent? <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Why was Israel made to suffer so much?</i> “So that it will be heated and its bottom will burn, [and its impurity] will be melted within it, [that its filth may be consumed]” (Ezekiel 24:11).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">God carried out all this punishment in order to ultimately purify Israel rather than to destroy Israel.</i> Because they sinned they were exiled, and once they were exiled, Jeremiah began lamenting over them, <i>eikha</i>.",
            "Rabbi Abbahu in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina began: “Ephraim will be desolation” (Hosea 5:9). When? “On the day of rebuke [<i>tokheḥa</i>]”<b> </b>(Hosea 5:9), the day when the Holy One blessed be He is destined to contend [<i>lehitvake’aḥ</i>] with them in judgment. You find that when the Ten Tribes were exiled, Judah and Benjamin were not exiled. The Ten Tribes were saying: Why did He exile us and He did not exile them? It is because they are residents of His palace. Is there, perhaps, partiality here? Heaven forbid, there is no partiality here. Rather, they had not yet sinned; and when they sinned, He exiled them. The Ten Tribes said: This is our God, this is our God. This is mighty, this is mighty, this is truth, this is truth, and He does not show favor even to members of His household. When they sinned they were exiled. When they were exiled, Jeremiah began lamenting over them, <i>eikha</i>.",
            "Rabbi Abbahu in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina began: “Its gates will lament and mourn” (Isaiah 3:26) – lamenting from within, mourning from without; “its gates” – the first destruction and the second destruction.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The destruction of the first and second Temples.</i> “It will be emptied” (Isaiah 3:26) – empty of words of Torah, empty of words of prophecy, empty of the righteous, empty of mitzvot<i></i> and good deeds.

Rather, it was from the One who rests His Divine Presence in Zion. “How have we been plundered?” – how is it that plunderers have come upon us? “We are greatly ashamed, for we abandoned the land” (Jeremiah 9:18) – this is the Land of Israel, as it is written: “A land that the Lord your God seeks” (Deuteronomy 11:12). “And they have cast down our dwellings” (Jeremiah 9:18) – these are the synagogues and the study halls.<br>Another matter: “We are greatly ashamed, for we abandoned the land [<i>aretz</i>]” – these are the words of Torah, just as it says: “Its measure is longer than the earth [<i>eretz</i>]” (Job 11:9).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This verse is understood as referring to the Torah.</i> “And they have cast down our dwellings” – these are the synagogues and the study halls.<br>Another matter: “We are greatly ashamed, for we abandoned the land [<i>aretz</i>]” – this is the Temple, just as it says: “From the foundation in the ground [<i>haaretz</i>] to the lower ledge” (Ezekiel 43:14).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a reference to the Temple.</i> “And they have cast down our dwellings” – through the destruction of the First Temple and the destruction of the Second Temple.

            "Rabbi Yitzḥak began: “We are ashamed, for we heard disgrace; humiliation covered our faces, as strangers came upon the sanctuaries of the House of the Lord” (Jeremiah 51:51).

            "Rabbi Yitzḥak began: “But you did not call Me, Jacob, for you wearied of Me, Israel” (Isaiah 43:22). Rabbi Yoḥanan understood this from this verse: “A prophecy of Damascus: Behold, Damascus is removed from being a city, and it will be a heap of ruins. Abandoned are the cities of Aroer” (Isaiah 17:1–2). He is standing in Damascus and mentions Aroer, but is Aroer not within the boundaries of Moav?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Damascus is in the territory of ancient Aram, whereas Aroer is in Moav.</i> Rather, there were three hundred and sixty-five houses of idol worship in Damascus, and each and every one of them they would worship one day, and they had one day on which they would worship all of them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There were 365 idols, each with its own house of worship. The people of Damascus would dedicate one day a year to worship each of them. There was also one day per year when they would worship all of the idols. Aroer is mentioned with Damascus because even the gods of Amon were worshipped in Damascus.</i> Israel made all of them a joint deity and worshipped them, as it is written: “The children of Israel continued to do what was evil in the eyes of the Lord, and they worshipped the Be’alim, the Ashtarot, the gods of Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the children of Amon, and the gods of the Philistines; they forsook the Lord and did not worship Him” (Judges 10:6), even together with other gods. Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: Shall the wife of a priest not be like an innkeeper?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The wife of the priest is distinguished whereas the innkeeper is considered lowly.

The king said: If only my servant had made me the equal of his circle of friends. So too, the Holy One blessed be He said: If only My children had made Me like a dessert that is served last. Rather, “but you did not call Me, Jacob” (Isaiah 43:22). You stand and engage in business all day and do not grow weary, but to pray before Me you are weary. He stands and engages in business all day and does not grow weary, but when his friend says to him: Come and pray, he says: I cannot. Regarding Baal what is written? “They called in the name of the Baal from morning until noon, saying: Baal, answer us. But there was neither sound nor response. They danced near the altar that they had made” (I Kings 18:26). That is, “but you did not call Me, Jacob” – if only I had not known you, Jacob. Why? “For you wearied of Me, Israel” (Isaiah 43:22).<br>“You did not bring Me the sheep of your burnt offerings” (Isaiah 43:23) – the two daily offerings that they would sacrifice each day, as it is stated: “The one lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the second lamb you shall offer in the afternoon” (Numbers 28:4). “And you did not honor Me with your offerings” (Isaiah 43:23) – these are the offerings of the most sacred order. “I have not burdened you with a meal offering” (Isaiah 43:23) – this is the handful from the meal offering.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A handful is taken from each meal offering and burned on the altar.

Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: It is written: “Refraining from a quarrel is honor for a man” (Proverbs 20:3) – the Holy One blessed be He said: It would have been honorable for Me had I not engaged with this nation.

It is “your path and your deeds,” your evil path and your rebellious deeds. “This is your wickedness, for it is bitter, as it has reached until your heart” (Jeremiah 4:18) – this is the Great Sanhedrin as they are called the heart of Israel, as it is written: “My heart is to the lawmakers of Israel” (Judges 5:9). When they provoke Me, My heart is not to the lawmakers of Israel. The Holy One blessed be He said: “As it has reached until your heart” – this is the Temple, just as it says: “My eyes and My heart will be there always” (II Chronicles 7:16).

It was because they did not leave any place where they did not engage in idol worship. Initially, they would worship it clandestinely.

However, here, “For its blood was in its midst” (Ezekiel 24:7).

He said to him: Neither in the women’s courtyard nor in the Israelite courtyard, but rather in the priestly courtyard.

But the blood was still seething. He brought lads and maidens and killed them onto it, but it did not rest. He brought schoolchildren and killed them onto it, but it did not rest. He brought eighty thousand young priests and killed them until their blood reached the blood of Zekharia, but the blood was still seething. He said: ‘Zekharia, Zekharia, I have eliminated all the good ones among them, would you be content if I eradicate all of them?’ When he said that, it immediately rested.

Alternatively, “all your officers wandered together; from the bow they were bound” – as [the enemies] would untie the strings of their bows and bind with them. “All those found among you were bound together, they fled afar” (Isaiah 22:3) – they distanced themselves from hearing the words of Torah, just as it says: “From afar the Lord has appeared to me” (Jeremiah 31:2).<br>“Therefore, I said: Turn from me, I will weep bitterly” (Isaiah 22:4) – Reish Lakish said: On three occasions the ministering angels sought to recite song before the Holy One blessed be He but He did not allow them to do so.

Regarding the generation of the Flood, what is written? “The Lord said: My spirit shall not abide in man forever” (Genesis 6:3).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash interprets the word abode [<i>yadon</i>] in the sense of singing praise [<i>yaron</i>], such that the verse means that God’s praise will not always be able to be sung over the occurrences regarding mankind. This interpretation is based on the fact that the Hebrew letters <i>dalet</i> and <i>resh</i> look very similar and are sometimes interchanged (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> At the sea it is written: “One did not approach the other the entire night” (Exodus 14:20).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The terminology of this verse is reminiscent of the verse in Isaiah (10:3) describing the angels singing song to God.</i> Regarding the destruction of the Temple it is written: “Therefore, I said: Turn from me, I will weep bitterly; do not rush to comfort me” (Isaiah 22:4). It is not written here: Do not continue [to comfort me], but rather, “do not rush [<i>ta’itzu</i>].” The Holy One blessed be He said to the ministering angels: The words of comfort that you are reciting before Me, they are insults [<i>ni’utzin</i>] for Me. Why? “For it is a day of turmoil, trampling and confusion [<i>mevukha</i>] from the Lord, God of hosts” (Isaiah 22:5) – a day of turbulence, a day of plundering, and a day of weeping [<i>bekhiya</i>]. “Of the Valley of Vision” (Isaiah 22:1) – it is the valley about which all the seers prophesy. “Breaching the wall and crying [<i>vesho’a</i>] to the mountain” (Isaiah 22:5) – for they were breaching the walls of their houses, using [the materials] for shields, and placing them atop their citadels [<i>sho’eihem</i>].<br>“Elam carried the quiver” (Isaiah 22:6) – Rav said: This is a collection of arrows. “Among chariots of men are horsemen, and Kir bared a shield” (Isaiah 22:6), for they were breaching the walls [<i>kirot</i>] of their houses and using [the materials] for shields. “And it was that your choicest valleys [<i>amakayikh</i>] filled with chariots” (Isaiah 22:7) – Rav said: To the full depth of [<i>umkah</i>] the sea waters. “And the horsemen directed themselves [<i>shot shatu</i>] to the gate” (Isaiah 22:7) – like weaving [<i>mishteyei</i>] they went and like weaving they came,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They crossed like the warp and woof strings on a loom.</i> and they appeared to be many.<br>“He laid bare the covering of Judah” (Isaiah 22:8) – exposing what was covered. “You looked on that day to the weapons in the house of the forest” (Isaiah 22:8) – Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: The Israelites had a weapon at Sinai, and the ineffable name was etched upon it. When they sinned it was taken from them. That is what is written: “The children of Israel were stripped of their ornament from Mount Ḥorev” (Exodus 33:6). How was it taken from them? Rabbi Aivu and the Rabbis: Rabbi Aivu said: It peeled off on its own. The Rabbis say: An angel descended and peeled it off.<br>“You saw that the breaches of the city of David were many.… And you counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke the houses to fortify the wall” (Isaiah 22:9–10) – this teaches that they would shatter their houses and add to the wall. But did Hezekiah not already do so? Is it not written: “He took courage and rebuilt the entire breached wall…” (II Chronicles 32:5)?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah criticized the people for adding to the wall, whereas Hezekiah similarly rebuilt the walls as protection from his enemies and was not criticized.</i> Hezekiah, however, put his trust in the Lord, God of Israel, but you did not put your trust in Him. That is what it says: “You did not look to the One who planned it, and you did not see the One who fashioned it long ago” (Isaiah 22:11).<br>“The Lord, God of hosts, called on that day for weeping and for lamentation” (Isaiah 22:12) – the ministering angels said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, it is written: “Majesty and glory are before Him” (Psalms 96:6), and You say this?’ He said to them: ‘I will teach you. That is what it says: “Disrobe and bare yourselves, and place a belt upon your waist” (Isaiah 32:11) – this is how you shall lament. “Smiting upon the breasts” (Isaiah 32:12) – on the first destruction and on the second destruction. “Over pleasant fields” (Isaiah 32:13) – on the house of My delight, which I made like a field. That is what it says: “Zion will be plowed like a field” (Micah 3:12). “Over a fruitful vine” (Isaiah 32:12) – this is Israel, just as it says: “You transported a vine from Egypt” (Psalms 80:9).’<br>Another matter: “The Lord, God of hosts, called on that day…” (Isaiah 22:12) – that is what was stated in the verse by the sons of Koraḥ through the Divine Spirit: “These I remember, and pour out my soul within me, [how I passed on with the throng and led them to the house of God]” (Psalms 42:5). Regarding whom did the sons of Koraḥ recite this verse? Regarding the congregation of Israel, as the congregation of Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, I remember the security, tranquility, and calm in which I existed, and now it has grown distant from me. I am weeping and moaning and saying: If only I could be restored to the earlier times when the Temple was built, and You would descend to it from heaven On High and rest Your Divine Presence upon me. The nations of the world would laud me, and when I would request mercy for my iniquities, You would answer me. But now I am in shame and humiliation.’ They also said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, my soul is desolate within me when I pass by Your Temple and it is destroyed, and a still small voice within it says: The place where the descendants of Abraham sacrificed offerings before You, the priests would stand on the platform, and the Levites would laud with their lyres, shall foxes prance in it? That is what is written: “On Mount Zion, which is desolate; foxes walk upon it” (Lamentations 5:18). But what shall I do? My iniquities have brought this upon me, the false prophets who were in my midst misled me from the path of life to the path of death.’ That is why it is stated: “These I remember, and pour out my soul within me…”<br>Another matter: “The Lord, God of hosts, called on that day for weeping and for lamentation…” (Isaiah 22:12) – when the Holy One blessed be He sought to destroy the Temple, He said: As long as I am inside it, the nations of the world will not touch it. So, I will avert My eyes from it, and I will take an oath that I will not attend to it until the time of the end of days. Then the enemies will come and destroy it. Immediately, the Holy One blessed be He took an oath by His right hand, and withdrew it behind Him. That is what is written: “He withdrew His right hand from before the enemy” (Lamentations 2:3). At that moment, the enemies entered the Sanctuary and burned it. Once it was burned, the Holy One blessed be He said: I no longer have an abode on the earth; I will remove My Divine Presence from it, and I will ascend to My original location. That is what is written: “I will go and return to My place, until they will be punished and they seek My presence” (Hosea 5:15). At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He was weeping and saying: Woe is Me for what I have done. I rested My Divine Presence below for the sake of Israel. Now that they have sinned, I have returned to My original place. Heaven forbid that I have become a laughingstock to the nations and a mockery to the people. At that moment, Metatron<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">98</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the name of an important angel.</i> came and fell on his face and said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, I will weep but You shall not weep.’ He said to him: ‘If you do not allow Me to weep now, I will enter a place into which you have no authorization to enter, and I will weep, as it is stated: “But if you will not heed it, my soul will weep in concealed places due to your arrogance…”’ (Jeremiah 13:17).<br>The Holy One blessed be He said to the ministering angels: ‘Come and let us go, you and I, and let us see what the enemies did in My Temple.’ Immediately, the Holy One blessed be He and the ministering angels went, with Jeremiah before Him. When the Holy One blessed be He saw the Temple, He said: Certainly, this is My Temple and this is My resting place that enemies entered and did in it as they pleased. At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He was weeping and saying: Woe is Me for My Temple. My children, where are you? My priests, where are you? My beloved, where are you? What could I do for you? I warned you but you did not repent. The Holy One blessed be He said to Jeremiah: ‘Today I am like a person who had an only son, made a wedding canopy for him, and he died within his wedding canopy; do you not feel pain for Me or for My son? Go and call Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses from their graves, as they know how to weep.’ [Jeremiah] said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, I do not know where Moses is buried.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Go, stand on the bank of the Jordan, raise your voice, and call: Son of Amram, son of Amram, arise and see your flock who have been consumed by enemies.’ Immediately, Jeremiah went to the Cave of Makhpela and said to the patriarchs of the world: ‘Arise, as the time has arrived that you are summoned before the Holy One blessed be He.’ They said to him: ‘Why?’ He said to them: ‘I do not know,’ because he feared that they would say: In your days this befell our children? Jeremiah left them and stood on the bank of the Jordan, and called out: ‘Son of Amram, son of Amram, arise, the time has arrived that you are summoned before the Holy One blessed be He.’ He said to him: ‘What is different about today that I am summoned before the Holy One blessed be He?’ Jeremiah said to him: ‘I do not know.’ Moses left him and went to the ministering angels, as he was familiar with them from the time of the giving of the Torah. He said to them: ‘Ministers On High, do you know why I am summoned before the Holy One blessed be He?’ They said to him: ‘Son of Amram, do you not know that the Temple has been destroyed and Israel has been exiled?’ He was screaming and weeping until he reached the patriarchs of the world. Immediately, they rent their garments, placed their hands on their heads, and were screaming and weeping until the gates of the Temple. When the Holy One blessed be He saw them, immediately, “the Lord, God of hosts, called on that day for weeping and for baldness and for donning sackcloth” (Isaiah 22:12). Had it not been for the verse that is written, it would have been impossible to say it. They were weeping and walking from this gate to that gate like a person whose deceased relative is lying before him. The Holy One blessed be He was lamenting and saying: Woe to a king who was successful in his youth and in his old age was not successful.<br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: When the Temple was destroyed, Abraham came before the Holy One blessed be He weeping, pulling out his beard, tearing out the hair of his head, striking his face, rending his garments, ashes on his head, and he was walking in the Temple and lamenting and screaming. He said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Why am I different from all nations and tongues that I have come to this state of shame and humiliation?’ When the ministering angels saw him, they too composed lamentations standing in rows and saying: “[Behold, their angels cry out outside.…] The highways are desolate, wayfarers have ceased; [he breached the covenant, rejected cities, regarded no man]” (Isaiah 33:7–8). What is “the highways are desolate”? The ministering angels said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘The highways to Jerusalem that You prepared so that travelers would never cease from them, how have they become desolation?’ “Wayfarers have ceased” – the ministering angels said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘The ways upon which Israel would travel on the festivals, how have they become idle?’ “Breached the covenant” – the ministering angels said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, the covenant of their patriarch Abraham has been breached, by means of whom the world was settled, and by means of whom You were recognized in the world as God on High, Maker of the heavens and the earth.’ “Rejected cities” – the ministering angels said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Have You rejected Jerusalem and Zion after You chose them?’ That is what is written: “Did You reject Judah, did Your soul loathe Zion…?” (Jeremiah 14:19). “Regarded no man [<i>enosh</i>]” – the ministering angels said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘You did not consider Israel even like the generation of Enosh, who were the originators of idol worshippers.’ At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He attended to the ministering angels. He said to them: ‘Why are you composing lamentations like this, standing in rows?’ They said to Him: ‘Master of the universe, why did You not pay attention to Abraham, Your beloved, who came to Your House and lamented and wept?’ He said to them: ‘From the day that My beloved passed away from before Me to his eternal home, he did not come to My House, and now: “What has My beloved to do in My House?”’ (Jeremiah 11:15).<br>Abraham said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe: Why did You exile my children, deliver them into the hand of the nations, kill them with all kinds of uncommon deaths, and destroy the Temple, the place where I elevated my son Isaac as a burnt offering before You?’ The Holy One blessed be He said to Abraham: ‘Your children sinned and violated the entire Torah and the twenty-two letters that are in it.’ That is what is written: “All Israel have violated Your Torah” (Daniel 9:11). Abraham said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, who will testify against Israel that they violated Your Torah?’ He said to him: ‘Let the Torah come and testify against Israel.’ Immediately, the Torah came to testify against them. Abraham said to it: ‘My daughter, you have come to testify against Israel that they violated your mitzvot, and you have no shame before me? Remember the day that the Holy One blessed be He circulated you among every nation and they did not want to accept you, until my descendants came to Mount Sinai and accepted you and honored you. Now you come to testify against them on their day of distress?’ Once the Torah heard this, it stood to one side and did not testify against them.<br>The Holy One blessed be He said to Abraham: ‘Let the twenty-two letters come and testify against Israel.’ Immediately, the twenty-two letters came. <i>Alef</i> came to testify against Israel that they violated the Torah. Abraham said to it: ‘<i>Alef</i>, you are the leader of all the letters, and you come to testify against Israel on their day of distress? Remember the day that the Holy One blessed be He revealed Himself on Mount Sinai and began with you, “I am [<i>anokhi</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">99</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Anokhi</i> begins with the letter <i>alef</i>.</i> the Lord your God” (Exodus 20:2) – no nation other than my descendants accepted you, and you come to testify against my descendants?’ Immediately, <i>alef</i> stood to one side and did not testify against them.<br><i>Bet</i> came to testify against Israel. Abraham said to it: ‘My daughter, have you come to testify against my descendants, who are diligent in the five books of the Torah, as you are at the head of the Torah?’ That is what is written: “In the beginning [<i>bereshit</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">100</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereshit</i>, the first word of the Torah, begins with a <i>bet.</i></i> God created” (Genesis 1:1). Immediately, <i>bet</i> stood to one side and did not testify at all.<br><i>Gimel</i> came to testify against Israel. Abraham said to it: ‘My daughter, have you come to testify against my descendants that they violated the Torah? Is there any nation who fulfills the mitzva of ritual fringes, which you appear at its head?’ That is what is written: “You shall make for yourselves twisted threads [<i>gedilim</i>]” (Deuteronomy 22:12).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Gedilim</i>, which in Hebrew is the first word of this verse, begins with a <i>gimel.</i></i> Immediately, <i>gimel</i> stood to one side and did not testify at all. When all the letters saw that Abraham had silenced them, they were ashamed, stood by themselves, and did not testify against Israel.<br>Immediately, Abraham began [speaking] before the Holy One blessed be He and said: ‘Master of the universe, at one hundred years You gave me a son. When he achieved cognition and was a thirty-seven-year-old young man, You said to me: Sacrifice him as a burnt-offering before Me. I became like a cruel person to him and had no mercy on him. Rather, I, myself, bound him. Will You not remember this on my behalf and have mercy on my descendants?’<br>Isaac began and said: ‘Master of the universe, when my father said to me: “God, Himself, will see to the lamb for a burnt offering, my son” (Genesis 22:8), I did not delay fulfillment of Your words, and I was bound willingly upon the altar and extended my neck under the knife. Will You not remember this on my behalf and have mercy on my descendants?’<br>Jacob began and said: ‘Master of the universe, did I not remain in Laban’s house for twenty years? When I departed from his house, the wicked Esau encountered me and sought to kill my children, and I endangered my life on their behalf. Now they are delivered into the hand of their enemies like sheep to slaughter after I raised them like chicks and suffered the travails of child raising on their behalf, as most of my days I experienced great suffering for their sake. Will You not now remember this on my behalf to have mercy on my descendants?’<br>Moses began and said: ‘Master of the universe, was I not a loyal shepherd over Israel for forty years? I ran before them like a horse in the wilderness, yet when the time came for them to enter the land, You decreed against me that my bones would fall in the wilderness. Now that they have been exiled you sent to me to lament them and weep over them.’ This is the parable that people say: From the goodness of my master it is not good for me, and from his evil it is bad for me.<br>At that moment, Moses said to Jeremiah: ‘Go before me so I may go and bring them. I would like to see who is going to restrain them.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If I bring them back no one will dare stand in their way.</i> Jeremiah said: ‘It is impossible to go on the way due to the corpses.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I am a priest, and it is prohibited for me to contract impurity imparted by a corpse.</i> He said to him: ‘Nevertheless.’ Immediately, Moses went and Jeremiah was before him, until they reached the rivers of Babylon. They saw Moses and said to each other: ‘The son of Amram has come from his grave to redeem us from the hand of our adversaries!’ A Divine Voice emerged and said: ‘It is a decree from before Me.’ Immediately, Moses said to them: ‘My children, to return you is impossible, as the decree has already been issued. Rather, the Omnipresent will return you speedily.’ He left them. At that moment, they raised their voice in great weeping until their weeping ascended On High. That is what is written: “By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat and also wept” (Psalms 137:1).<br>When Moses came to the patriarchs of the world, they said to him: ‘What have the enemies done to our descendants?’ He said: ‘Some of them they killed, some of them they tied their hands behind them, some of them were bound in iron chains, some of them were stripped naked, some of them died on the way and their carcasses were left for the bird of the heavens and the animals of the earth, and some of them were cast in the sun hungry and thirsty.’ Immediately, they all began weeping and lamenting: ‘Woe over what has befallen our children! How have you become like orphans without a father; how do you lie in the afternoon and in the summer without garment and without covering; how have you walked on mountains and on gravel with shoes removed and without sandals; how have you carried bundles filled with sand; how have your hands been bound behind you; how have you been unable to swallow even the spittle in your mouths?’ Moses began and said: ‘Cursed sun! Why did you not darken when the enemy entered the Temple?’ The sun responded to him: ‘Moses, loyal shepherd, how could I darken, they did not allow me and did not relent from me, as they took me with sixty rods of fire and said to me: Go and shine your light.’<br>Again Moses began and said: ‘Woe over your radiance, Temple, how has it gone dark? Woe that its time to be destroyed arrived, the Sanctuary was burned, schoolchildren killed, and their fathers sent to captivity, exile, and the sword.’ Again Moses began and said: ‘O captors, by your lives! You killers, do not kill cruelly and do not implement total annihilation, do not kill a son in the presence of his father, or a daughter in the presence of her mother, for the time will come when the Master of heaven will settle the score with you.’ But the wicked Chaldeans did not do so, but rather, would seat the son on his mother’s lap and say to his father: Rise and slaughter him. The mother would cry and her tears would fall on him, and his father would hang his head. He also said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, You wrote in Your Torah: “An ox or a sheep, it and its offspring you shall not slaughter on one day” (Leviticus 22:28). But have they not killed many, many children and their mothers, and yet You are silent!’<br>At that moment, Rachel our matriarch interjected before the Holy One blessed be He and said: ‘Master of the universe, it is revealed before You that Your servant Jacob loved me abundantly and worked for my father seven years for me. When those seven years were completed and the time for my marriage to my husband arrived, my father plotted to exchange me with my sister for my husband. The matter was extremely difficult for me when I became aware of that plot, and I informed my husband and gave him a signal to distinguish between my sister and me so that my father would be unable to exchange me. Afterward, I regretted what I had done and suppressed my desire. I had mercy on my sister, so that she would not be led to humiliation. In the evening they exchanged me with my sister for my husband, and I transmitted to my sister all the signals that I had given to my husband, so that he would think that she is Rachel. Moreover, I entered beneath the bed on which he was lying with my sister. He would speak with her and she would be silent, and I would respond to each and every matter that he said, so that he would not identify my sister’s voice. I performed an act of kindness for her, I was not jealous of her, and I did not lead her to humiliation. If I, who is flesh and blood, was not jealous of my rival, and I did not lead her to humiliation and shame, You who are a living and eternal merciful King, why were You jealous of idol worship that has no substance, and You exiled my descendants, and they were killed by sword, and the enemies did to them as they pleased?’ Immediately, the mercy of the Holy One blessed be He was aroused and He said: ‘For you, Rachel, I will restore Israel to its place.’ That is what is written: “So said the Lord: A voice is heard in Rama, wailing, bitter weeping. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be consoled for her children, as they are not” (Jeremiah 31:14). And it is written: “So said the Lord: Restrain your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears, as there is reward for your actions.… And there is hope for your future, the utterance of the Lord, and your children will return to their borders” (Jeremiah 31:15–16).",
            "Rabbi Yoḥanan began: “Give honor to the Lord your God before it grows dark…” (Jeremiah 13:16) – when was this verse fulfilled in their regard? It was with the death of Hezekiah. That is what is written: “Hezekiah lay with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent of the tombs of the descendants of David, and they accorded him honor upon his death” (II Chronicles 32:33). What honor did they accord him? Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon, Rabbi Ḥanin, and the Rabbis: Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: They built a meeting place of the Sages above Hezekiah’s tomb. When they would go there, they would say to him: ‘Teach us.’ Rabbi Ḥanin said: They placed a Torah scroll above Hezekiah’s tomb and said: The one who is placed in this coffin fulfilled everything that is written in this. The Rabbis said: They arranged rugs for him from the entrance of their houses to the tombs of the descendants of David. Why to that extent? It was so their feet would not be exposed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">104</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They walked without shoes as a sign of mourning and put out the rugs so that their feet would not be injured by the hard ground or the cold. The fact that the entire populace took upon themselves customs of mourning was an honor for Hezekiah.</i> Nevertheless, their feet were exposed. Jeremiah said to them: If when you arranged rugs from the entrance of your houses to the tombs of the descendants of David your feet were exposed, when “your feet will stumble on the mountains of the night” (Jeremiah 13:16), all the more so.<br>The Divine Presence traveled ten journeys: From cherub to cherub,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Divine Presence had been focused on the cherub on the right side, and moved to the cherub on the left (Maharzu).</i> from cherub to the threshold of the Sanctuary, from the threshold of the Sanctuary [back] to the cherubs, from the cherubs to the eastern gate, from the eastern gate to the courtyard, from the courtyard to the roof, from the roof to the altar, from the altar to the wall,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a reference to the wall surrounding the Temple courtyard.</i> from the wall to the city, and from the city to the Mount of Olives.<br>From cherub to cherub, as it is written: “The glory of the Lord rose from upon the cherub” (Ezekiel 10:4). From the cherub to the threshold of the Sanctuary, as it is written: “The glory of the God of Israel ascended from upon the cherub upon which it had been to the threshold of the Sanctuary” (Ezekiel 9:3). From the threshold of the Sanctuary to the cherubs, as it is written: “The glory of the Lord emerged from upon the threshold of the House and stood upon the cherubs” (Ezekiel 10:18). “Emerged” – the verse should have said, “entered,” and yet it says, “emerged”? What is “emerged”? Rabbi Aḥa said: [This is analogous] to a king who was emerging from his palace in anger. After he left he returned and caressed and kissed the walls of the palace and the pillars of the palace, and he was weeping and saying: Let there be peace upon my palace, let there be peace upon my royal house, let there be peace upon the house of my honor, let there be peace, from now on let there be peace. So too, when the Divine Presence emerged from the Temple, it returned and caressed and kissed the walls of the Temple and the pillars of the Temple, and it was weeping and saying: Let there be peace upon My Temple, let there be peace upon My royal house, let there be peace upon the house of My honor, let there be peace, from now on let there be peace.<br>From the cherubs to the eastern gate, as it is written: “The cherubs lifted their wings…[and it stood at the entrance of the east gate of the House of the Lord]” (Ezekiel 10:19). From the eastern gate to the courtyard, as it is written: “The courtyard was filled with the aura of the glory of the Lord” (Ezekiel 10:4). From the courtyard to the roof, as it is written: “Better to live on a corner of a roof” (Proverbs 25:24). From the roof to the altar, as it is written: “I saw the Lord standing upon the altar” (Amos 9:1). From the altar to the wall, as it is written: “Behold, the Lord is standing upon a wall made with a plumb line [<i>anakh</i>]” (Amos 7:7). Another matter: What is <i>anakh</i>? This is the Sanhedrin of seventy-one, the numerical value of <i>anakh</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Alef</i> – 1, <i>nun</i> – 50, <i>kaf</i> – 20 = 71</i> “The Lord said: Behold, I am placing a plumb line” (Amos 7:8). Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash here does not include Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon’s statement. See <i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 33:2, where his exposition of this verse is stated.</i> From the wall to the city, as it is written: “The voice of the Lord calls to the city” (Micah 6:9). From the city to the Mount of Olives, as it is written: “The glory of the Lord ascended from above the midst of the city and stood upon the mountain that was east of the city” (Ezekiel 11:23).<br>Rabbi Yonatan said: For three and a half years the Divine Presence stayed resting on the Mount of Olives, believing that perhaps Israel would repent, but they did not. A Divine Voice was proclaiming and saying: “Return wayward children” (Jeremiah 3:14), “return to Me and I will return to you” (Malachi 3:7). Since they did not repent, it said: “I will go and return to My place” (Hosea 5:15). Regarding that moment, it says: “Give honor to the Lord your God before it grows dark” (Jeremiah 13:16) – before it grows dark for you from matters of Torah, before it grows dark for you from matters of prophecy. “And before your feet will stumble on the mountains of the night, and you will hope for light” (Jeremiah 13:16) – in Babylon; “but He will render it the shadow of death” (Jeremiah 13:16) – in Media; “and will render it a fog” (Jeremiah 13:16) – in Greece. “But if you will not heed it” (Jeremiah 13:17) – in Edom; “My soul will weep in concealed places due to your arrogance” (Jeremiah 13:17) – Why does the verse state: “Due to your arrogance”? These are the idol worshippers, who are arrogant and say: “Where is their God, the Rock in whom they sought refuge?” (Deuteronomy 32:37). Alternatively, “due to your arrogance” – due to the ministering angels, who are arrogant and say: “What is man that You remember him…” (Psalms 8:5). “And my eyes will weep and shed tears because the flock of the Lord was taken captive” (Jeremiah 13:17) – you find that until Israel was exiled, they were divided into flocks, the priestly flock by itself, the Levite flock by itself, the Israelite flock by itself. Once they were exiled, they became one flock; “because the flock of the Lord was taken captive”– it is not written here, “because they were taken captive [<i>nishbu</i>],”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The term <i>nishbu</i> is plural, whereas the term <i>nishba</i> is singular.</i> but rather, “because the flock of the Lord was taken captive [<i>nishba</i>].”",

Is she not a fool? Rabbi Reuven said: In the Greek language they call a fool <i>more’a</i>, “woe to <i>more’a</i>” (Zephaniah 3:1), woe to the fool. “<i>Venigala</i>”– because they would distance themselves from hearing matters of Torah, they were distanced [<i>nigala</i>] from the priesthood. “The city of <i>hayona</i>” (Zephaniah 3:1) – they should have learned from the city of Jonah [<i>Yona</i>], from Nineveh. I sent one prophet to Nineveh and he caused them to repent, while Israel in Jerusalem, how many prophets did I send to them! That is what is written: “The Lord warned Israel, and Judah, by means of every prophet of every vision, saying: Repent from your evil ways, and observe My commandments and My statutes…” (II Kings 17:13). And it is written: “I sent to you all My servants the prophets daily, time and again” (Jeremiah 7:25); “time and again” in the morning, “time and again” in the evening. “But they did not listen” (Jeremiah 7:26) – because they did not listen they were exiled.

Rabbi Huna the Great of Tzippori says: It is an expression of convulsing. That is what is written: “And groan [<i>venaak</i>] the groans of [<i>naakot</i>] the slain” (Ezekiel 30:24).

            "Rabbi Ze’eira began: “My lyre is for mourning, and my flute is for the voice of weepers” (Job 30:31). There it is taught: Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: There were no days as joyous for Israel as the fifteenth of Av and as Yom Kippur, on which the daughters of Jerusalem would go out in white borrowed garments so as not to embarrass one who did not have one. All the garments require immersion. The daughters of Israel would go out in them and dance in the vineyards.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishna <i>Taanit</i> 4:8.</i> It is taught: One who did not have a wife would turn to there. What would they say? ‘Young man, lift your eyes and see what you are choosing for yourself.

Rather, it is because he removed the collar from his neck and placed it on the neck of the masses, and he did not say: All the people should ascend and pray, but rather, anyone who wishes to ascend let him ascend.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hoshea was punished, and the rest of his kingdom was punished as well (see II Kings 17:6), because he did not encourage them to ascend to Jerusalem and most of the people did not actually ascend. Previously it had been the king’s fault that the people did not ascend, as they could not go because of the sentries; subsequently it was the people’s fault, and therefore the entire kingdom was punished.</i><br>Rabbi Shmuel bat Naḥmani [said], and some say it in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzḥak: [The fifteenth of Av is] the day the tribes were permitted to enter into marriage with one another, as it is stated: “And every daughter who inherits an inheritance [from the tribes of the children of Israel shall be a wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father]” (Numbers 36:8), and it is written: “And no inheritance shall pass from tribe to another tribe…” (Numbers 36:9). Is it possible for a daughter to inherit [from] two tribes? Rather, say on this basis, her father was from one tribe and her mother from another tribe.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse refers to a daughter who inherits “from the tribes of the children of Israel,” implying that her parents were from different tribes. But then the verse goes on to state that a woman cannot marry a man from a different tribe. The Sages understood this to mean that it was only in the first generation when Israel entered the land that women could not marry men from other tribes. The date when it was officially determined that from then on it was permissible was the fifteenth of Av.</i><br>The Rabbis said: [It is] the day the tribe of Benjamin was permitted to enter the congregation, as it is written: “Cursed is one who gives a woman to Benjamin” (Judges 21:18). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They read a verse and drew them near, they read a verse and distanced them. They read a verse and drew them near: “A nation and an assembly of nations shall be from you” (Genesis 35:11).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">132</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When God promised this to Jacob, Benjamin had not yet been born, meaning that it was necessary to ensure that Benjamin would procreate.</i> They read a verse and distanced them: “Ephraim and Manasseh will be like Reuben and Simeon for me” (Genesis 48:5) – as they are not considered with their brothers.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">133</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The total of twelve tribes could be achieved without Benjamin, with the addition of Ephraim and Manasseh.</i> Rav Yehuda said that Shmuel said: It was the day that the tribes were permitted [to marry each other].<br>Rav Matna said: It was the day that the slain of Beitar were allowed to be buried. Rabbi Eliezer the Great said: It is reasonable on the fifteenth; from that point on, the intensity of the sun wanes and they would no longer chop wood for the arrangement. Rabbi Menasya said: They called it the day of the breaking of the scythe. From that point on: One who adds, adds, and one who does not add, will be gathered.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">134</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From this point on, the nights begin to be lengthy. Since night is a good time for Torah study, the midrash states that years of life will be added for one who adds to his hours of Torah study. One who does not will die young.</i><br>Rabbi Avin and Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is the day that the digging for those who died in the wilderness was halted. Rabbi Levi said: Every eve of the ninth of Av, Moses would dispatch a herald to the entire camp, saying: ‘Go out and dig,’ and they would go out and dig graves and sleep in them. In the morning, he would dispatch a herald saying: ‘Rise and separate the dead from the living,’ and they would stand and take themselves out. Fifteen thousand and more were subtracted,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Each year</i> for a total of six hundred thousand. In the fortieth year, the last one, they did so and found themselves intact. They said: It appears that we were mistaken in our calculation, and they did the same on the tenth, the eleventh, the twelfth, the thirteenth, and the fourteenth. When the moon was full, they said: It appears that the Holy One blessed be He abrogated the decree from upon us, and they then rendered it a holiday. But due to their iniquities, mourning beset this world with the destruction of the Temple twice. That is what is written: “My lyre is for mourning, and my flute is for the voice of weepers” (Job 30:31). “The people wept that night” (Numbers 14:1) – when they were exiled, Jeremiah began lamenting over them: “How does…sit solitary?” (Lamentations 1:1).",
            "“For the mountains I will take up weeping and wailing…” (Jeremiah 9:9) – Rabbi Aḥa said: Nebuchadnezzar commanded Nevuzaradan three matters concerning Jeremiah: “Take him and keep your eyes on him” (Jeremiah 39:12) – on him and not on his nation. “Do not do anything harmful to him” (Jeremiah 39:12) – to him do not do, but to his nation do as much harm as you please. “As he will say to you so you shall do to him” (Jeremiah 39:12) – but not to his nation. Jeremiah would see a group of lads placed in collars, and he would place his head with them, and Nevuzaradan would come and remove him from them. He then would see elders chained in chains. He would place his neck with them, and Nevuzaradan would come and remove him from them. Nevuzaradan said to him: ‘Look, you are one of three things; either you are a false prophet, or you are contemptuous of suffering, or you are a shedder of blood. Maybe you are a false prophet, as all these years you are prophesying about this city that it will be destroyed, and now that it is being destroyed, your soul is greatly troubled. Or you are contemptuous of suffering, as I do not wish to do you any harm, but you wish to do yourself harm, as though to say: Suffering is nothing for me. Or you are a shedder of blood, as the king commanded me extensively in your regard that I not do you any harm, and you seek to do harm so that the king will hear and execute this man.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">136</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nevuzaradan was referring to himself.</i><br>Ultimately, he said to him: ‘If you agree, come and I will keep my eye on you,’ but he did not accept it, as it is stated at the end of the portion, until it was stated to him from the mouth of the Almighty.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">137</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nevuzaradan had suggested that Jeremiah come to Babylon under his protection or remain in the Land of Israel, but Jeremiah had insisted on remaining with the other captives who were being exiled to Babylon, until God spoke to him.

He said to him: ‘Jeremiah, if you remain here, I will go with them, and if you go with them, I will remain here.’ He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, if I go with them, in what way can I benefit them? Rather, let their King, their Creator go with them, as He can benefit them greatly.’ That is what is written: “After Nevuzaradan, captain of the guards, sent him …and he had been bound in chains” (Jeremiah 40:1). Rabbi Aḥa said: As it were, both he and Him were bound in chains. Similarly, it is written: “And I am in the midst of the exile” (Ezekiel 1:1).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">138</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“And I” is expounded to mean: I – Ezekiel; and – God.</i><br>Until where was Jeremiah’s prophecy?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">139</sup><i class=\"footnote\">What was the last prophecy Jeremiah conveyed to those who were being led into exile. Alternatively, the midrash assumes that the book of Jeremiah is not written in chronological order, and asks which was his last prophecy (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Rabbi Yaakov and Rabbi Aba, and some say Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Yoḥanan: one said: Until, “He who scattered Israel will gather them” (Jeremiah 31:9). The other says: Until, “there is hope for your future, the utterance of the Lord, and your children will return to their border” (Jeremiah 31:16).<br>Upon his return,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">140</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From Rama (see Jeremiah 40:1).</i> he would find severed toes cast on the mountains. He would gather them, caress them, hug them, kiss them, and place them in his garment. He would say to them: ‘My children, did I not warn you of this and say to you: “Give honor to the Lord your God before it grows dark and before your feet will stumble on the mountains of the night” (Jeremiah 13:16)?’ Regarding that moment it is stated: “For the mountains I will take up weeping and wailing, and for the oases [<i>neot</i>] of the wilderness a lamentation” (Jeremiah 9:9) – for those beautiful and excellent mountains I will take up weeping and wailing, on the abodes [<i>neot</i>] of Jacob that have been transformed into a lamentation. “They did not hear the sound of livestock [<i>mikneh</i>]” (Jeremiah 9:9) – they did not hear the sound of words of Torah or the sound of the words of prophecy, but rather <i>mikneh</i>, the sound of words that arouse jealousy [<i>mekaneh</i>]. They aroused His zealotry with idol worship [<i>avoda zara</i>], just as it says: “They would arouse His jealousy with strangers [<i>zarim</i>]” (Deuteronomy 32:16). Therefore, “from the birds of the heavens to the animals, they have wandered and gone” (Jeremiah 9:9).<br>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥalafta said: For fifty-two years, no bird was seen flying in the Land of Israel. What is the source? “From the birds of the heavens to the animals [<i>behema</i>], they have wandered and gone” (Jeremiah 9:9); the numerical value of <i>behema</i> is fifty-two.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">141</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bet</i> – 2; <i>heh</i> – 5;<i> mem</i> – 40;<i> heh</i> – 5 = 52</i><br>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Forty years before, they<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">142</sup><i class=\"footnote\">God caused the Babylonians to plant the trees in preparation for the impending exile.</i> would plant date palms in Babylon, indicating that sweet foods accustom the tongue to Torah. Rabbi Ḥanina son of Rabbi Abbahu said: There are seven hundred species of kosher fish, eight hundred species of kosher grasshoppers, and innumerable birds, and all of them were exiled with Israel to Babylon. When they returned, all of them returned with them with the exception of one fish whose name is <i>shibuta</i>. How were the fish exiled?

Rabbi Ḥanina and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: one said: Because they fertilize it. The other said: Because they overturn its soil.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">144</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Before Israel was exiled, it would produce even without these measures.</i><br>Rabbi Yudan said: For seven years, [the curse] of sulfur and salt<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Deuteronomy 29:22</i> was fulfilled for them. Why to that extent? “He will promote a covenant with the multitudes for one period of seven years” (Daniel 9:27). What did the Cuthites among them do? They would sow it in small plots. They would sow here, and it would be burned, they would sow there and it would be burned. There was an incident involving an individual who was standing and plowing in the Beit Arava Valley, and his hand grasped his plowshare. Hot soil arose and burned his arm, to realize what is stated: “Sulfur and salt, its entire land is afire” (Deuteronomy 29:22).<br>Rabba bar Kahana said: They are neither an indication of forgiveness in the land nor an indication of desolation of the land,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">146</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This statement refers to the return of the birds and fish to the Land of Israel, and to the original exit of the birds and fish from the land (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> but rather it is from before Him, to realize what is stated: “Fear of you and dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, [and upon every bird of the heavens, and upon all that crawls on the ground, and upon all fish of the sea]” (Genesis 9:2).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">147</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since these creatures are subject to domination by man, it stands to reason that if humanity could no longer reside in the land of Israel, neither could these creatures.</i> But in the future, everything will return.

                "<b>“How does the greatly crowded city sit alone? She has become like a widow. Great among the nations, a princess among the states: She has become a vassal” (Lamentations 1:1).</b><br>“How [<i>eikha</i>] does…sit [alone].” Three prophesied with the term <i>eikha</i>: Moses, Isaiah, and Jeremiah. Moses said: “How [<i>eikha</i>] can I bear alone…” (Deuteronomy 1:12). Isaiah said: “How [<i>eikha</i>] did [the faithful city] become a harlot?” (Isaiah 1:21). Jeremiah said: “How [<i>eikha</i>] does [the greatly crowded city] sit alone?” Rabbi Levi said: This is analogous to a noblewoman who had three friends. One saw her in her tranquility, one saw her in her debauchery, and one saw her in her disgrace. So, Moses saw them in their glory and their tranquility and said: “How [<i>eikha</i>] can I bear alone your troubles?” Isaiah saw them in their debauchery and said: “How [<i>eikha</i>] did [the faithful city] become a harlot?” Jeremiah saw them in their disgrace and said: “How [<i>eikha</i>] does [the greatly crowded city] sit [alone]?”<br>They asked ben Azai, saying to him: ‘Our teacher, expound for us one matter from the scroll of Lamentations.’ He said to them: ‘Israel was exiled only after they denied the Unique One of the world, circumcision that was given after twenty generations, the Ten Commandments, the five books of the Torah; the numerical value of <i>eikha</i>.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Alef—</i>the Unique One of the world; <i>yod—</i>the Ten Commandments; <i>kaf—</i>twenty generations; <i>heh—</i>five books of Moses.</i><br>Rabbi Levi said: Israel was exiled only after they denied the thirty-six instances of <i>karet</i> in the Torah and the Ten Commandments, the numerical value of “how does…sit solitary [<i>eikha yasheva badad</i>]?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Eikha</i>: <i>Alef</i>  -1,  yod – 10, <i>kaf</i> – 20, <i>heh</i> – 5 = 36. <i>Badad</i>: Beit<i></i> – 2, <i>dalet</i> – 4, <i>dalet</i> – 4 = 10.</i><br>Rabbi Berekhya [said] in the name of Rabbi Avdimai of Haifa: [This is analogous] to a king who had a son. When he would perform his father’s will, [the king] would clothe him in fine silk, and when he would not perform his will, he would clothe him in the garments of an olive-press worker [<i>badad</i>]. So too Israel, as long as they would perform the will of the Holy One blessed be He, it is written: “I clothed you in embroidery” (Ezekiel 16:10). Rabbi Sima said: Purple garments. Onkelos translated: Embroidered garments. But when they do not perform the will of the Holy One blessed be He, He clothes them in the garments of olive-press workers. That is what is written: “How does…sit solitary [<i>badad</i>]?”<br>Rav Naḥman said that Shmuel said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: The Holy One blessed be He summoned the ministering angels and said to them: ‘A flesh and blood king, when a relative of his dies and he mourns, what does he typically do?’ They said to Him: ‘He hangs sackcloth on his entrance.’ He said to them: ‘I, too, will do so.’ That is what is written: “I clothe the heavens in blackness and I place sackcloth as their garment” (Isaiah 50:3). ‘A flesh and blood king, what [else] does he typically do?’ They said to Him: ‘He extinguishes the lamps.’ He said to them: ‘That is what I will do,’ as it is stated: “The sun and the moon darkened and the stars withdrew their shining” (Joel 4:15). ‘A flesh and blood king, what does he typically do?’ ‘He overturns the beds.’ ‘That is what I will do,’ as it is stated: “Until thrones were set in place and the Ancient One sat” (Daniel 7:9), [implying,] as it were, that they had been overturned.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Beds were a general term for anything one would sit on. The fact that the thrones, in this verse, were set in place, implies that previously they had been overturned as a sign of mourning.</i> ‘A flesh and blood king, what does he typically do?’ ‘He walks barefoot.’ ‘That is what I will do,’ as it is stated: “His path is in tempest and in storm, and clouds are the dust of His feet” (Nahum 1:3). ‘A flesh and blood king, what does he typically do?’ ‘He rends his purple garments.’ ‘That is what I will do,’ as it is stated: “The Lord accomplished what He devised; He implemented [<i>bitza</i>] His statement [<i>emrato</i>]” (Lamentations 2:17). Rabbi Yaakov of Kefar Ḥanan explained it: What is <i>bitza emrato</i>? It is that He rent His purple garments.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word rent, or tear, in Aramaic, <i>biza</i>, is similar to <i>bitza</i>. The word <i>emrato</i> is spelled the same as <i>imrato</i>, which in rabbinic parlance means the edge of one’s garment (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> ‘A flesh and blood king, what does he typically do?’ ‘He sits in silence.’ ‘That is what I will do,’ as it is stated: “Let him sit alone and be silent” (Lamentations 3:28). ‘A flesh and blood king, what does he typically do?’ ‘He sits and weeps.’ ‘That is what I will do,’ as it is stated: “The Lord, God of hosts, called on that day for weeping and for lamentation and for baldness” (Isaiah 22:12).<br>Another matter: <i>Eikha</i>, Jeremiah said to them: ‘What did you see in idol worship that you are so enthusiastic to follow it? If it had a mouth to engage in debate, we would have said this.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We would have proven the falseness of idolatry and the idols themselves would have had to concur. The word <i>eikha</i> is being interpreted as two words: <i>Ei, ka</i>, “if…this” (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Instead, we will speak of it and we will speak of Him.’ We will speak of it, “So said the Lord: Do not learn the way of the nations, and from the signs of the heavens do not be frightened, though the nations are frightened by them” (Jeremiah 10:2). We will speak of Him: “Tell them this: The gods who did not make the heavens and the earth shall vanish from the earth and from under these heavens. [He makes the earth with His might]” (Jeremiah 10:11–12). “The Portion of Jacob is not like these, for He is the one who forms everything, and Israel is the tribe of His inheritance, the Lord of hosts is His name” (Jeremiah 10:16).<br>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda says: The term <i>eikha</i> is nothing other than an expression of reproof. That is what is written: “How [<i>eikha</i>] can you say: We are wise, and the law of the Lord is with us...”? (Jeremiah 8:8). Rabbi Neḥemya says: The term <i>eikha</i> is nothing other than an expression of lamentation. That is what is written: “The Lord God called to the man, and said to him: Where are you [<i>ayeka</i>]?” (Genesis 3:9), woe are you [<i>oy lekha</i>]. When was the scroll of Lamentations composed? Rabbi Yehuda says: It was composed in the days of Yehoyakim.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This was before the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple. This is consistent with Rabbi Yehuda’s view that the term <i>eikha</i> is a term of reproof. In his view, Lamentations, or <i>Eikha</i>, was composed as a warning before the destruction.</i> Rabbi Neḥemya said to him: ‘Does one weep over the dead before he dies? Rather, when was it composed? After the destruction of the Temple. This is its solution: “How [<i>eikha</i>] does…sit solitary?”’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This phrase implies that Jerusalem was already desolate.</i>",
                "“The greatly crowded city,” Rabbi Shmuel taught: There were twenty-four thoroughfares in Jerusalem, each and every thoroughfare had twenty-four streets, each and every street had twenty-four market streets, each and every market street had twenty-four store streets, each and every store street had twenty-four courtyards, each and every courtyard had twenty-four houses, and each and every courtyard would have twice the number of those who departed from Egypt emerging from it.<br>Know that it is so, as Rabbi Elazar said: There was an incident involving a traveler who was ascending to Jerusalem who took with him two hundred camels laden with pepper. He passed Tyre and found a certain tailor who was sitting near the city gates. He said to him: ‘What are you carrying?’ He said to him: ‘Pepper.’ He said to him: ‘Will you not give me a bit?’ He said to him: ‘No.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The tailor asked to purchase a small amount, but the traveler wanted to sell his entire stock to one customer.</i> He said to him: ‘Then you will have a purchaser only in another city.’ When he arrived in Jerusalem, he found a certain tailor sitting at the gate of the walls, who said to him: ‘What are you carrying?’ He said to him: ‘Continue your cutting.’ He found another tailor who said to him: ‘What are you carrying?’ He said to him: ‘Continue your sewing.’ He said to him: ‘If I can purchase them, fine. But if not, I will bring you a person who can purchase all of them.’ He said to him [again]: ‘What are you carrying?’ He said to him: ‘Pepper.’ He took him and brought him into a certain courtyard and he showed him a <i>kor</i> of dinars. He said to him: ‘Look at these coins. If they are currency in your land, take from them.’ In the morning, [the visiting merchant] went to stroll in the marketplace and one of his friends encountered him. He said to him: ‘What are you carrying?’ He said to him: ‘Pepper.’ He said to him: ‘Do you not have any that you could give me for one hundred dinars, for I have a feast today!’ He said: ‘I already sold it to so and so.’ He went to him. He said to him: ‘Do you have the pepper that you purchased? Give me a bit as I have a feast.’ He said to him: ‘What can I tell you? I already sold it to a certain tailor. However, I will tell him and he will give it to you.’ He went and he found it in a certain residence. Those who were in the first line [or purchasers] took one ounce each. Those who were in the second line took one-half ounce each. Those who were in the third line did not sense that there had been any at all, to realize what is stated: “The greatly crowded city.”<br>If you wish to ascertain how many multitudes there were in Jerusalem, you can ascertain it from the priests. Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin [said] in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: [This is analogous] to a pile of grain that was located in the grain marketplace. Everyone came to measure it but could not. There was one clever man there. He said to them: ‘If you seek to measure it, you can calculate it on the basis of its <i>teruma</i>.’ So too, if you wish to ascertain how many multitudes there were in Jerusalem, you can ascertain it from the priests. That is what is written: “Solomon slaughtered the peace-offering that he slaughtered to the Lord, cattle, twenty-two thousand, and of the flock, one hundred and twenty thousand” (I Kings 8:63). And we have learned: A bull is sacrificed by twenty-four [priests] and a ram by eleven.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishna <i>Yoma</i> 2:7. The reference is to the number of priests who participated in all the rituals involved in the sacrifice of these offerings.</i><br>That is what is said of the first Temple. However, in the second Temple, one time King Agrippa sought to ascertain the number of the multitudes that were in Jerusalem. He said to the priests: ‘Set aside for me one kidney from each and every paschal offering.’ They set aside six hundred thousand pairs of kidneys, twice the number of those who departed from Egypt, and there was not any paschal offering that did not have more than ten registrants.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One had to register in advance for a paschal offering, and such offerings were generally divided between numerous individuals.</i> Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: Even forty and even fifty. Bar Kappara said: Even one hundred, [and this is] not including one who was impure or on a distant journey. One time, they entered the Temple Mount and it could not hold them. There was one elderly man there and they trampled him. They called that Passover<i></i> the Passover of the crushed, because they crushed the elderly man.<br>How did Israel procreate? A person would marry off his son at the age of twelve to a woman fit to bear children. He would then marry off his grandson at the age of twelve. One would not reach the age of twenty-six until he saw children of his children, to realize what is stated: “May you see the children of your children. Peace to Israel” (Psalms 128:6).",
                "“She has become like a widow.”<i></i> Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: They did not go to extremes vis-à-vis the attribute of justice, and the attribute of justice did not go to extremes in their regard.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They did not sin in an extreme fashion and they were not punished in an extreme fashion (see <i>Matnot Kehuna;</i> Maharzu).</i> They did not go to extremes vis-à-vis the attribute of justice, as it is stated: “The people were like complainers” (Numbers 11:1). “Complainers” is not written here, but rather, “like complainers.” “The princes of Judah were like those who move boundaries” (Hosea 5:10). “Those who move boundaries” is not written here, but rather, “like those who move boundaries.” “For like a wayward cow [Israel has strayed]” (Hosea 4:16), “For a [wayward] cow” is not written here, but rather, “like a wayward cow.” The attribute of justice, too, did not go to extremes in their regard. “She has become like a widow”—“A widow” is not written here, but rather, “like a widow”—like a woman whose husband went to a country overseas and plans to return to her. “He drew His bow like an enemy” (Lamentations 2:4), “enemy” is not written here, but rather, “like an enemy.” “The Lord was like an enemy” (Lamentations 2:5), “enemy” is not written here, but rather, “like an enemy.”<br>Another matter, “she has become like a widow.” Rabbi Ḥama bar Ukeva and the Rabbis, Rabbi Ḥama bar Ukeva said: [This is analogous] to a widow who was demanding her sustenance but was not demanding her marriage contract.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">After a man’s death, his widow may choose to continue to live in his home and to be supported by his estate. She may also leave and demand payment of the sum specified in her marriage contract. Israel is compared here to a widow who chooses to be supported by her late husband’s estate rather than leaving and cutting all ties to her husband.</i> The Rabbis said: [This is analogous] to a king who grew angry at the queen and wrote her a bill of divorce and then snatched it from her. Any time that she sought to marry another, he would say to her: ‘Where is your bill of divorce?’ Any time she would demand her sustenance, he would say to her: ‘Have I not already divorced you?’ So too, any time Israel would seek to engage in idol worship, the Holy One blessed be He would say to them: “Where is your mother’s bill of divorce?” (Isaiah 50:1). Any time they request that He perform miracles on their behalf, the Holy One blessed be He says to them: ‘I have already divorced you.’ That is what is written: “I sent her away and gave her bill of divorce to her” (Jeremiah 3:8).<br>Another matter, “she has become like a widow.” Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis, Rabbi Akiva says: “Widow,” and you say “like a widow”? Rather, a widow from the Ten Tribes, but not a widow from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Akiva is asserting that Jerusalem is described as a widow from the Ten Tribes but not from Judah and Benjamin, because he holds that Lamentations was composed before Judah and Benjamin were exiled (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>). Alternatively, because he holds that the Ten Tribes are not destined to return, but Judah and Benjamin will eventually return (Maharzu). </i> The Rabbis say: A widow from these and from those, but not from the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “For neither Israel nor Judah is widowed from its God” (Jeremiah 51:5).",
                "“Great [<i>rabati</i>] among the nations,” but was it not already stated [in the verse]: “greatly [<i>rabati</i>] crowded”? Why does the verse say: “Great [<i>rabati</i>] among the nations”? It means great in intellect. Rabbi Huna [said] in the name of Rabbi Yosei: In any province to which one of the residents of Jerusalem would go, they would offer a seat of honor for him to sit upon so they could hear his wisdom.<br>An individual from Jerusalem went to a province, and the time arrived for him to die. He summoned his landlord and deposited his belongings with him. He said to him: ‘If my son comes from Jerusalem and performs three wise deeds, give him what is mine. If not, do not give him what is mine.’<br>They<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The residents of the province mentioned above.</i> made an agreement between them that none of them would show another’s house to a visitor. He [the individual from Jerusalem] died and he passed to his eternal home. Some time later, his son came. When he entered the gate of the wall of that province, he saw one carrying a bundle of wood. He said: ‘Are you selling the bundle of wood?’ He said to him: ‘Yes.’ ‘Take its price from me and take it to so-and-so.’ He took its price and took it to so-and-so. He was going and [the deceased man’s son] was following him until he reached his residence. He said to him:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The wood seller said to the landlord.</i> ‘Hey, so-and-so, come take a bundle of wood.’ He said to him: ‘Did I tell you to bring me a bundle of wood?’ He said to him: ‘True, you did not tell me, but it belongs to this person who followed me.’ Immediately, he opened his house before him, and they greeted one another. That is one [wise] deed.<br>He said to him: ‘Who are you?’ He said: ‘I am the son of the man who died in your [house].’ He brought him in and prepared a cooked meal for him. That man<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The landlord.</i> had two sons and two daughters. When the time of the meal arrived, they brought before him for the meal five cooked pullets. When they were ready to eat, he said to him:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The host said to the guest.</i> ‘Take and distribute it.’ He [the guest] said to him: ‘It is not mine.’ He [the host] said to him: ‘I want you to take and distribute it.’ He took and distributed it, and placed one pullet between the man and his wife. He took the second pullet and placed it between the two men who were his two sons. He took the third and placed it between his two daughters. He took two pullets and placed them before himself. He ate them and they did not say anything to him. This is the second [wise] deed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It will be explained below why the guest did this and why it was considered a wise deed.</i><br>At evening time, [the host] brought a fattened chicken for the meal. He said to [the guest]: ‘Take and distribute it.’ He said to him: ‘It is not mine.’ He said to him: ‘Take and distribute it, as that is my will.’ He took and distributed it and placed the head before the man. He took the innards and placed it before his wife. He took the two thighs and gave them to his two sons. He took the two wings and gave them to his two daughters. He took the entire body and placed it before himself. This is the third [wise] deed.<br>[The landlord] said: ‘Is this how they distribute in your place? You distributed the first time and I did not say anything to you, and now you do this?’ He said to him: ‘Did I not say to you that it is not mine? Nonetheless, what I have distributed, I distributed properly. The first time, you brought five pullets for the meal. You, your wife, and the pullet equal three. Your two sons and the pullet equal three. Your two daughters and the pullet equal three. I and the two pullets equal three. Did I take anything from your portions? Now, you brought a chicken. I took the head and gave it to you, as you are the head of the household. I took the innards and placed them before your wife, because children emerge from her innards. I took the two thighs and placed them before your two sons, because they are the pillars of the house. I took the two wings and placed them before your daughters, as tomorrow they will depart, fly from your house, and go to their husbands. I took this ship,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When the body of the chicken without the extremities  is cut open it resembles a ship.</i> as I came in a ship and I will go in a ship. Rise and give me what is mine that my father deposited with you, and I will leave immediately.’ He gave him what was his and he went in peace. That is what is stated: “Great among the nations,” great in intellect.<br>Four Jerusalemites came to Athens and were received by a certain person. In the evening he made a feast for them. After they ate and drank, he prepared four beds for them. One of them was broken and supported by the next one. When they got up from the feast to go to sleep, he said: ‘I heard that the residents of Jerusalem are extremely wise, let me hear some of what they are saying.’ He went and slept in [a room] adjacent to theirs.<br>The one who was sleeping on the broken bed awoke during the night and said to the others: ‘What do you think, that I am sleeping on a bed? I am sleeping on the ground but I am suspended.’ Another said to them: ‘The meat that we ate this evening had the taste of dog.’ Another said to them: ‘And the wine that we drank tonight had the taste of a grave.’ Another said to them: ‘You are wondering about those [matters]? The man who is the homeowner is not even the son of his father.’<br>When the man heard these matters, he said: ‘One is true and three are false.’ He arose in the morning and went to the butcher. He said to him: ‘Give me from the meat that you gave me last night.’ He said to him: ‘I have none.’ He said to him: ‘What was special about it?’ He said to him: ‘We had one lamb that was a suckling and its mother died. We had a female dog and the lamb suckled from it. At night, we were short on meat and I sought to bring some. I did not have any other, so I gave you from that [lamb].’ He said: ‘Two are true and two are false.’<br>He went to the winemaker. He said to him: ‘Give me some of that wine that you gave me last night.’ He said to him: ‘I have none.’ He said to him: ‘What was special about it?’ He said to him: ‘We had one vine and it was planted over our father’s grave. I squeezed it and placed it in wicker baskets. I was short on wine and I sought to bring some. I did not have any other, so I gave you from that [vine].’ He said: ‘Three are true and one is false.’<br>He went to his mother and said to her: ‘Whose son am I?’ She said to him: ‘My son, you are the son of your father.’ He said to her: ‘Tell me the truth, whose son am I, and if not I will sever your head.’ She said to him: ‘My son, your father was unable to beget children and I feared lest his relatives take my property.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">After his death, as the wife was not considered an heir.</i> Did I perform a sin that I went and engaged in an illicit relationship and brought you into all this wealth and property?’ He said to her: ‘What do we see here?

                "A certain Jerusalemite went to see a merchant in Athens. He was put up in an inn. He found people who were beginning to sit and drink wine. After he ate and drank, he sought to sleep there. They said to him: ‘We agreed among ourselves that we will not receive any person as a lodger until he performs three jumps.’ He said to them: ‘I do not know how you jump. Get up and perform it before me, and I will perform it like you after you.’ One of them stood, jumped, and found himself in the middle of the inn. He performed another jump and found himself at the gate at the entrance of the inn. He performed another jump and found himself outside.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">All those inside followed the jumper outside to watch him.</i> [The Jerusalemite] stood and bolted the gate in their faces.

It is because he knew that he did not give any coins of his own that he took the bad ones for himself and he placed the good ones before this man. But let us draw lots.

Nine exit, eight enter, two pour, one drinks, and twenty-four are attendants.’ He could not respond and they took his garments. He came to Rabbi Yoḥanan, their teacher.

Isaiah said: “You will call Your walls salvation” (Isaiah 60:18). Jeremiah said: “See [<i>re’e</i>], Lord, for I am in distress” (Lamentations 1:20). Isaiah said: “You will see and your heart will be gladdened” (Isaiah 66:14). Jeremiah said: “They heard [<i>shamu</i>] that I sigh” (Lamentations 1:21). Isaiah said: “Comfort, comfort My people” (Isaiah 40:1). Jeremiah said: “Let all their wickedness come [<i>tavo</i>] before You” (Lamentations 1:22) Isaiah said: “I will bring them to the mountain of My holiness” (Isaiah 56:7).<br>Another matter, “I remember my song [<i>neginati</i>] in the night” (Psalms 77:7). Rabbi Aivu and Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon, Rabbi Aivu says: The congregation of Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘I remember how I was broken before You in the night of the kingdoms,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The times during which Israel suffered persecution at the hands of foreign nations is are referred to here as night.</i> just as it says: “Blessed is God, the Most High, who broke [<i>migen</i>] your enemies into your hand”’ (Genesis 14:20). Rabbi Yehuda says: I remember the songs that I sang before You in the nights, just as it says: “[The Lord is to save me] and we will play my songs all the days of our lives” (Isaiah 38:20), this is the night of Pharaoh, as it is written: “It was at midnight” (Exodus 12:29). And the night of Gideon who smote the Midianite and Amalekite camp, as it is written: “It was on that night” (Judges 7:9). And the night of Sennacherib, in whose regard it is written: “It was on that night, and the angel of God emerged” (II Kings 19:35).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Rabbi Yehuda, the reference is to the songs Israel sang when they experienced salvation at night. Each of the three verses cited refers to an event in which an enemy of Israel was defeated at night.</i><br>“I meditate with my heart” (Psalms 77:7), I speak with my heart. “And my spirit searches” (Psalms 77:7), I examine my actions. And it says: “Will the Lord forsake forever? Will He never again appease?” (Psalms 77:8). God forbid, He has not abandoned and will not abandon, as it is written: “For the Lord will not forsake forever” (Lamentations 3:31).<br>“Will He never again appease [<i>lirtzot</i>]” or be appeased [<i>leratzot</i>]? In the past He would appease others. When Moses was angry, it says: “And he returned [<i>veshav</i>] to the camp” (Exodus 33:11). Read it as: And return [<i>veshuv</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Despite Moses’s anger in the wake of the sin of the Golden Calf, God implores him to return to the camp.</i> When Elijah was angry, it says: “Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus” (I Kings 19:15); but now, He does not appease, and is not appeased.<br>“Has His kindness come to an end [<i>he’afes</i>] forever, [is His decision final for all generations]?” (Psalms 77:9). What is <i>he’afes</i>? Rabbi Reuven said: It is a Greek term, just as it says: “He will say none [<i>afes</i>]” (Amos 6:10).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>afes</i> is a Greek term meaning “let go,” similar to the usage of the term in Amos, where one is asked if there is anyone with him and he says “none,” meaning dismiss the thought from your mind. Thus, It is not God’s kindness that has ceased, but He has let go of it in the sense that He has ceased to implement His kindness in the world.</i> Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa and Rabbi Simon, Rabbi Ḥanina said: Has the matter that the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses, “I will favor whom I favor” (Exodus 33:19), concluded? Rabbi Simon says: It has already been concluded, and this was confirmed by means of Jeremiah: “For I have withdrawn My peace [and kindness and mercy from this people]” (Jeremiah 16:5).<br>“Has God forgotten to be gracious [<i>ḥanot</i>]” (Psalms 77:10), has God forgotten His encampment [<i>ḥanoto</i>] in the wilderness, “According to the word of God they would encamp” (Numbers 9: 20). Has He forgotten “God, merciful and gracious [<i>veḥanun</i>]”? (Exodus 34:6). “Has He closed in anger His mercy? Sela” (Psalms 77:10); even though He is angry, His mercy is near. Yet Zion said: ‘The Lord has forsaken me and my Lord has forgotten me,’ as it is written: “Zion said: The Lord has forsaken me [and the Lord has forgotten me]” (Isaiah 49:14).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">However, God responds: “Yet I will not forget you” (Isaiah 49:15).</i><br>“Then I said: This is my weakness [<i>ḥaloti</i>], [the right hand of the Most High has changed]” (Psalms 77:11). Rabbi Alexandrai said: Because we did not entreat [<i>ḥilinu</i>] You in repentance, the right hand has changed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The right hand signifies God’s support and giving. This has changed from supporting Israel to supporting its enemies (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: The oath that He made with us at Ḥorev<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is another name for Sinai.</i> has been violated [<i>nitḥalela</i>], and so the right hand has changed.<br>Rabbi Simon said: Have you ever heard that the orb of the sun is ill and unable to rise and serve? For His servants there are no illnesses, but before Him there is illness?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The term <i>ḥaloti</i> is expounded to mean illnesses [<i>ḥolayin</i>], such that the verse reads “this is my illness.” As the midrash explains, it cannot be that God’s providence has changed due to His illness, as that is impossible.</i> Rabbi Yitzḥak said: [This is analogous] to a mighty person who was there in a province, and all the residents of the province relied on him and would say: ‘No troops will come here. If troops came to the city, once he would emerge and show his face, they would flee immediately.’ One time the troops came, and he said to them: ‘My right hand hurts.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since he is not ready for battle, the enemies are no longer afraid of him.</i> However, the Holy One blessed be He is not so, but rather, “Behold, the Lord’s hand is not too short to save…” (Isaiah 59:1).<br>“The right hand of the Most High has changed.” Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: If it is due to illnesses, there is hope, for one who is hurt will ultimately heal. But if it has changed, there is no hope.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the case of the change to God’s right hand, as it were, there is hope, because the change is based on something akin to illness. The verse from Isaiah cited above is followed by the following: “But your iniquities have separated between you and your God” (Isaiah 59:2) (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> That is the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi &lt;who said:=\"\" “for=\"\" you=\"\" have=\"\" despised=\"\" us,=\"\" [you=\"\" were=\"\" exceedingly=\"\" angry=\"\" at=\"\" us]”=\"\" (lamentations=\"\" 5:22).=\"\" if=\"\" it=\"\" is=\"\" despising,=\"\" there=\"\" is=\"\" no=\"\" hope.=\"\" if=\"\" it=\"\" is=\"\" anger,=\"\" there=\"\" is=\"\" hope,=\"\" as=\"\" one=\"\" who=\"\" is=\"\" angry=\"\" will=\"\" ultimately=\"\" be=\"\" appeased.=\"\"&gt;<br>Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai said: The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘You wept a gratuitous weeping; ultimately, you will weep a weeping of substance.’ Where did Israel weep a gratuitous weeping? “Moses heard the people weeping according to its families” (Numbers 11:10). “The entire congregation raised and sounded their voice [and the people wept that night]” (Numbers 14:1). Where did Israel weep a weeping of substance? Rabbi Aivu and Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon, Rabbi Aivu said: Once in Rama and once in Babylon. In Rama, as it is written: “So said the Lord: A voice is heard in Rama, wailing, bitter weeping, [Rachel weeping for her children]” (Jeremiah 31:15). In Babylon, as it is written: “By the rivers of Babylon, [there we sat and also wept]” (Psalms 137:1). Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: One in the “province of Judah” (Ezra 5:8) and one in Babylon. In the province of Judah, “she weeps bitterly at night” (Lamentations 1:2). In Babylon, “by the rivers of Babylon.”<br>Rabbi Aivu said: So said the Holy One blessed be He to Israel: ‘As a reward for that weeping, I will gather in your exiles.’ That is what is written: “So said the Lord, restrain your voice from weeping…there is hope for your future, the utterance of the Lord” (Jeremiah 31:16–17).<br>“She weeps bitterly [<i>bakho tivkeh</i>],” she will weep [<i>bakho</i>] due to one calf; she will weep [<i>tivkeh</i>] due to two calves.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">75</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash expounds the doubled Hebrew expression <i>bakho tivkeh</i> (in which the root <i>bet-kaf-heh</i> is used twice consecutively) to refer to two sins: The sin of the Golden Calf in the wilderness and Jeroboam’s two golden calves in the Land of Israel (see I Kings 12:26–30).</i> Another matter, over Judah, and over Zion and Jerusalem.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zion and Jerusalem count as one. Alternatively, they are separate and there is a third source of weeping expressed in the verse in Lamentations, which continues: “her tears are on her cheeks” (Lamentations 1:2).</i> Another matter, she will weep [<i>bakho</i>] over the exile of the Ten Tribes; she will weep [<i>tivkeh</i>] over the exile of Judah and Benjamin. Another matter, she weeps and causes others to weep with her, she weeps and causes the Holy One blessed be He to weep with her, as it is written: “The Lord, God of hosts, called on that day for weeping and for lamentation” (Isaiah 22:12). She weeps and causes the ministering angels to weep with her, as it is written: “Behold, their angels cry out outside [<i>ḥutza</i>], [the messengers of peace weep bitterly]” (Isaiah 33:7). Rabbi Ze’eira said: <i>Ḥitza</i> is written,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>ḥutza</i> is written without a <i>vav</i>, such that it can be read <i>ḥitza</i>.</i> it is unnatural [<i>ḥitza</i>] for him to slaughter him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Ze’eira interprets this verse as pertaining to God’s command to Abraham to sacrifice Isaac. The angels responded that this was a command that violated human nature.</i> Rabbi Berekhya said: Just as it says: “He took him outside [<i>haḥutza</i>] [and said: Look now toward the heavens]” (Genesis 15:5).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Berekhya cites this verse to demonstrate that <i>ḥutza</i> refers to the heavens. Thus, he interprets the verse in Genesis to mean that God took Abraham outside and directed him to look toward the heavens, and he interprets the verse in Isaiah to mean that the angels cry in the heavens.</i><br>“She will weep [<i>bakho</i>],” she weeps and causes the heavens and the earth to weep with her. That is what is written: “The sun and the moon darkened” (Joel 2:10). “She will weep [<i>bakho</i>],” she weeps and causes the mountains and the hills to weep with her. That is what is written: “I saw the mountains [they are quaking, and all the hills have disintegrated]” (Jeremiah 4:24). “She will weep [<i>bakho</i>],” she weeps and causes the seventy nations to weep with her. Rabbi Pinḥas said: The seventy bulls that Israel would sacrifice on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> correspond to the seventy nations, so that the world would not be vacant of them. “She will weep [<i>bakho</i>],” she weeps and casues the congregation of Israel to weep with her. That is what is written: “The entire congregation raised [<i>vatisa</i>]…[and the people wept that night]” (Numbers 14:1). Rabbi Ḥunya taught it in the name of Rabbi Neḥemya: <i>Vatisa</i> is written, they left a bad debt for the generations, just as it says: “When you lend [<i>tasheh</i>] to your neighbor” (Deuteronomy 24:10).",
                "“At night,” why at night? Because sound travels only at night, that is why it is stated: “At night.” Rabbi Aivu said: Night draws lamentation with it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When one cries at night, it has a greater impact on those who hear it, and they are moved to cry as well.</i> There was an incident involving a certain woman who was in Rabban Gamliel’s neighborhood.

When his disciples sensed it, they arose and evacuated her from his neighborhood.",

Alternatively, over her judges, just as you say: “They strike [the judge of Israel] on the cheek [<i>haleḥi</i>] with a rod” (Micah 4:14). Alternatively, over her lads; you find that when the enemies entered the Temple, they seized the lads and bound their hands behind them. They were weeping and the tears were flowing on their cheeks. They could not wipe them and they fell on their cheeks like the scar of a boil.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The tears seared their cheeks, similar to a wound, because they could not wipe them off.</i>",
                "“She has no comforter.” Rabbi Levi said: Any place that it is stated: “Has no [<i>ein</i>],” [ultimately] she will have. “Sarai was barren, she had no [<i>ein</i>] child” (Genesis 11:30), but [ultimately] she had, as it is stated: “The Lord remembered Sarah” (Genesis 21:1). Similarly, “Hannah had no [<i>ein</i>] children” (I Samuel 1:2), and [ultimately] she had, as it is stated: “For the Lord remembered Hannah” (I Samuel 2:21).

Alternatively, “due to affliction [<i>me’oni</i>],” because they took the collateral of a poor man [<i>ani</i>] into their homes, just as it says: “If he is a poor man, you shall not sleep with his collateral” (Deuteronomy 24:12).

He said to them: ‘Where is the king?’ They went and said to Vespasian: ‘A certain Jew wishes to inquire after your wellbeing.’ He said to them: ‘Let him come.’ When he came he said: ‘Long live my lord, the emperor.’ He said to him: ‘You greeted me with the greeting of a king, but I do not reign [as king], and if the king will hear of it, he will kill me.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, “he will kill that man.” Vespasian was referring to himself, as it was considered an act of rebellion to allow oneself to be treated as a king.</i> [Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakai] said to him: ‘If you are not [yet] the king, ultimately you will reign, as this Temple will be destroyed only by a king, as it is stated: “The Lebanon will fall by a mighty one”’ (Isaiah 10:34). They took him and placed him behind seven partitions.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They placed him in detention in a place where there was no daylight.</i> They would ask him: ‘What hour of the night is it?’ He would tell them. ‘What hour of the day is it?’ He would tell them. How did Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakai know? It was from his studies.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Based on the amount of material that he covered, he was able to calculate the time that elapsed (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i><br>Three days later, Vespasian went to bathe in the Gafna spring. After he bathed and put on one of his shoes, tidings reached him informing him that Nero had died and that the citizens of Rome had crowned him king. He sought to put on his other shoe, but it did not fit. He sent and had Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakai brought and he said to him: ‘Are you not able to tell me? All these days I would wear two shoes and they would fit me, now one fits and one does not fit.’ He said to him: ‘You received good tidings, as it is written: “Good tidings fatten the bone”’ (Proverbs 15:30). He said to him: ‘What shall I do so it will fit?’ He said to him: ‘Is there a person whom you hate or who wronged you? Let him pass before you and your flesh will recede, as it is written: “A depressed spirit dries bones”’ (Proverbs 17:22).<br>They began telling parables before him: ‘What should one do to a barrel in which a snake has nested?’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Their point was to trap him into admitting that he should have fought against the zealots of Jerusalem.</i> He said to them: ‘One brings a snake charmer, charms the snake, and leaves the barrel intact.’ Pangar said: ‘One kills the snake and breaks the barrel.’ ‘What should one do to a cabinet in which a snake has nested?’ He said to them: ‘One brings a snake charmer, charms the snake, and leaves the cabinet intact.’ Pangar said: ‘One kills the snake and burns the cabinet.’ Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakai said to Pangar: ‘All neighbors who perform evil perform it in their own neighborhood. Not only do you fail to plea in our favor, you speak to our detriment.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pangar was the governor of Arabia, which is near the Land of Israel.

Make a [different] request and I will grant it.’ He said to him: ‘I request that you leave the gate of the western gate, which points toward Lod, so that anyone who emerges for four hours will be saved.’ After [Vespasian] conquered it, he said to him: ‘If you have someone who is beloved to you or someone with whom you are close, send and bring him before the soldiers enter.’ He sent to Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua to take out Rabbi Tzadok. They went and found him at the city gate. When he came, Rabban Yoḥanan stood before him. Vespasian said to him: ‘You stand before this repulsive old man?’ He said to him: ‘By your life, if there was another like him, and you had double the [number of your] soldiers, you would not be able to conquer [the city.’ He said to him: ‘What is his strength?’ He said to him: ‘He eats one <i>gamzuz</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A fruit similar to a fig (<i>Arukh</i>).</i> and from it studies one hundred chapters.’ He said to him: ‘Why is he so emaciated?’ He said to him: ‘It is due to the effects of fasts and abstinences.’ [Vespasian] sent and brought physicians and they would feed him a little at a time and would give him to drink a little at a time, until his body was restored [to good health]. Elazar, his son,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">113</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The son of Rabbi Tzadok.</i> said to him: ‘Father, give them their reward in this world, so that they will have no merit with you in the World to Come.’ He gave them [a method for] mathematical calculations with fingers<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This was a method of using the fingers to aid in easy computations of multiplication tables from six to nine (<i>Yefei Anaf</i>).</i> and scales.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">115</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He introduced to them a new type of scale for weighing.</i><br>After he conquered it, he distributed the four sides to the four governors.

They destroyed theirs, he did not destroy his. [Vespasian] sent and had him brought and said to him: ‘Why did you not destroy yours?’ He said to him: ‘By your life, I did so for the glory of the kingdom. Had I destroyed it, people would not know what you destroyed. When the people will see [the remaining wall], they will say: Look at the power of Vespasian, what he destroyed.’ He said to him: ‘By your life, you have spoken well; however, because you violated my command, that man<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">116</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference is to Pangar himself.</i> will ascend to the roof and cast himself from it.

That is what is written: “Whose flesh is the flesh of donkeys” (Ezekiel 23:20). And Rabbi Berekhya said: Because the sea would cast them to the dry land and the dry land cast them to the sea. The sea said to the dry land: ‘Accept your people,’ and the dry land said to the sea: ‘Accept your people.’ The dry land said: ‘If when I accepted only Abel’s blood, it is stated in my regard: “Cursed is the land” (Genesis 3:17), how can I accept the blood of this entire multitude?’ [This continued] until the Holy One blessed be He took an oath to it that He would not place it on trial.

Isaiah said: “A prophecy of Moav: For on the night that Ar of Moav is plundered, it is ruined; for on the night that Kir of Moav is plundered, it is ruined” (Isaiah 15:1). Jeremiah said: “Behold, days are coming, the utterance of the Lord, and I will sound to Raba of the children of Amon an alarm of war, and it will become a mound of desolation, and its environs will be burned in fire, and Israel will inherit its inheritors, said the Lord” (Jeremiah 49:2).

What is “He said,” “He said,” twice? It is that the Holy One blessed be He spoke to the angel, and the angel [then] said to the cherub: ‘Even though the Holy One blessed be He decreed upon me to take the coals, I am not allowed to enter behind your partition. Rather, perform an act of kindness and give me two of your coals so I will not be burned.’ That is what is written: “He carried it and placed it into the cupped hands of the one clothed in linen” (Ezekiel 10:7). What is “he carried it and he placed it”? Rabbi Yitzḥak said: He cooled them and placed them in his hand.<br>Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin [said] in the name of Rabbi Levi: For six years the coals were dimly smoldering in Gabriel’s hand, and he believed that Israel would repent. When they did not repent, he sought to cast them upon them in rage. The Holy One blessed be He summoned him and said to him: ‘Gabriel, Gabriel!

It is the charity that Israel performs with the hand. That is what is written: “For Your righteousness, God, reaches on high” (Psalms 71:19).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">153</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse is interpreted to mean that the merit of the charity that God commanded Israel to perform “reaches on high,” in that it supports even the heavens.</i><br>Similarly, “The man of God approached and said to the king of Israel, and said: So said the Lord: [Because Aram said: The Lord is a God of mountains and not a God of lowlands, I will deliver all this great multitude into your hand, and you will know that I am the Lord]” (I Kings 20:28). What is “and said” twice?

What is “he said,” “he said,” twice? Rav said in the name of Rabbi Elazar: Before he sensed that she was Jewish, he would speak to her directly. Once he sensed that she was Jewish, King Aḥashverosh spoke to the translator and the translator spoke to Queen Esther.<br>Similarly, “The Lord said to Moses: Speak to the priests, sons of Aaron, and say to them” (Leviticus 21:1). Why do I need these two sayings? It is that in the first saying, He said to him: “He shall not become impure from a corpse among his people”<b> </b>(Leviticus 21:1). In the second, He said to him: ‘If you come upon a corpse that it is a mitzva<i></i> to bury, impurify yourself for it.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">154</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although a priest is forbidden from becoming impure from a corpse, if there is a corpse that has no one to bury it, it is a mitzva for anyone, even a priest, to see to the burial.</i> Since in this world you impurify yourself for a corpse that it is a mitzva<i></i> to bury, in the future you will not become impure from any corpse, for there will be no death in the future, as it is stated: “He will eliminate death forever” (Isaiah 25:8).<br>Alternatively, “for Your righteousness, God, reaches on high, [for the great deeds You have done]” these are the two luminaries.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">155</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to the sun and the moon.</i> “God, who is comparable to You” (Psalms 71:19), in that You suppress the attribute of justice.

Everyone grinds wheat, yet it says “grind flour”? Rather, Jerusalem said to the daughter of Babylon: Had war not been waged against me from on high, could you have waged war against me? Had fire not been sent against me from on high, could you have overcome me? Rather, you killed a dead lion. You ground already ground flour. You set fire to a burned city. That is why it says: “From on high He sent fire into my bones and He crushed them [<i>vayirdena</i>].” What is “and He crushed them [<i>vayirdena</i>]”? Moved them, just as you say: “He scooped [<i>vayirdehu</i>] it into his hands” (Judges 14:9).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">157</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash is interpreting the word <i>vayirdena</i> to mean “he moved them” rather than “He crushed them.” Thus, the verse is interpreted to mean that God sent fire from on high against the Temple, and the enemy merely moved the burned bones.</i><br>Alternatively, <i>vayirdena</i> [means] ruled, just as it says: “He will rule [<i>veyerd</i>] from sea to sea” (Psalms 72:8). Alternatively, <i>vayirdena</i> [means] subjugated, just as it says: “For he subjugated [<i>rodeh</i>] the entire region beyond the River” (I Kings 5:4). Alternatively, <i>vayirdena</i> [means] plowing [<i>radya</i>], as it is taught: Rufus plowed the Sanctuary. Rabbi Beiva of Rangaya said: <i>Vayirdena</i>, he saw [<i>vayar</i>] the attribute of justice [<i>din</i>] harming it.<br>“He spread a net for my feet.” Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: If you see benches filled with Babylonians situated in the Land of Israel, anticipate the footsteps of the Messiah.

He brought the first and said to him: ‘Prostrate yourself to the idol.’ He said to him: ‘God forbid, I will not prostrate myself to the idol.’ He said to him: ‘Why?’ [He responded:] ‘Because so it is written in our Torah: “I am the Lord your God”’ (Exodus 20:2). Immediately, he took him out and executed him.<br>He took out the second and said to him: ‘Prostrate yourself to the idol.’ He said to him: ‘God forbid, my brother did not prostrate himself and I will not prostrate myself.’ He said to him: ‘Why?’ He said to him: ‘Because so it is written in our Torah: “You shall have no other gods before Me”’ (Exodus 20:3). Immediately, he issued a decree against him and they executed him. He took out the third and said to him: ‘Prostrate yourself to the idol.’ He said to him: ‘I will not prostrate myself.’ He said to him: ‘Why?’ He said to him: ‘Because so it is written in our Torah: “For you shall not prostrate yourself to another god”’ (Exodus 34:14). Immediately, he issued a decree against him and they executed him. He took out the fourth and [the son] recited his verse: “One who sacrifices to gods shall be destroyed” (Exodus 22:19). He issued a decree against him and they executed him. He took out the fifth and he, too, recited his verse: “Hear Israel, the Lord is our God the Lord is one” (Deuteronomy 6:4). Immediately, he issued a decree against him and they executed him. He took out the sixth and he, too, recited his verse: “For the Lord your God is in your midst, a God great and awesome” (Deuteronomy 7:21). Immediately, he issued a decree against him and they executed him.<br>He took out the seventh, who was the youngest of them all. He said: ‘My son, prostrate yourself to the idol.’ He said to him: ‘God forbid.’ He said to him: ‘Why?’ He said to him: ‘Because so it is written in our Torah: “You shall know this day, and restore to your heart, that the Lord, He is the God in the heavens above and upon the earth below, there is no other” (Deuteronomy 4:39). Moreover, we took an oath to our God that we will not exchange Him for another God, as it is stated: “You have exalted the Lord today [to be your God]” (Deuteronomy 26:17). And just as we took an oath to Him, so He took an oath that He would not exchange us for a different nation, as it is stated: “The Lord has exalted you today [to be a people of distinction for Him]”’ (Deuteronomy 26:18).<br>The emperor said to him: ‘Your brothers had full days, full lives, and experienced goodness, but you are young, you have not had full days, you have not had a full life, and you have never experienced goodness. Prostrate yourself to the idol and I will do good things for you.’ He said to him: ‘It is written in our Torah: “The Lord will reign forever” (Exodus 15:18). And it says: “The Lord is king forever, nations have been eliminated from His land” (Psalms 10:16). You will cease and His enemies will cease. Flesh and blood lives today and dies tomorrow, is wealthy today and poor tomorrow; but the Holy One blessed be He lives and persists forever and for all time.’ The emperor said to him: ‘See your brothers slain before you. I am casting my ring to the ground before the idol, lift it so everyone will know that you heeded my voice.’ He said to him: ‘It is a shame for you, emperor; if you fear people, who are your equivalent, will I not fear the King of kings, the Holy One blessed be He, the eternal God?’ He said to him: ‘Is there a God in the world?’ He said to him: ‘Woe are you, emperor, have you seen a world without a master?’<br>He said to him: ‘Does your God have a mouth?’ He said to him: ‘Regarding your gods it is written: “They have a mouth but cannot speak” (Psalms 115:5). Regarding our God it is written: “By the word of the Lord the heavens were made; [by the breath of His mouth, all their hosts]”’ (Psalms 33:6).<br>He said to him: ‘Does your God have eyes?’ He said to him: ‘Regarding your gods it is written: “They have eyes but cannot see” (Psalms 115:5). Regarding our God it is written: “They are the eyes of the Lord ranging throughout the land”’ (Zechariah 4:10).<br>He said to him: ‘Does your God have ears?’ He said to him: ‘Regarding your gods it is written: “They have ears but cannot hear” (Psalms 115:6). Regarding our God it is written: “The Lord listened and heard”’ (Malachi 3:16).<br>He said to him: ‘Does your God have a nose?’ He said to him: ‘Regarding your gods it is written: “They have a nose but cannot smell” (Psalms 115:6). Regarding our God it is written: “The Lord smelled the pleasing aroma”’ (Genesis 8:21).<br>He said to him: ‘Does your God have hands?’ He said to him: ‘Regarding your gods it is written: “They have hands but cannot feel” (Psalms 115:7). Regarding our God it is written: “My hand, too, laid the foundation”’ (Isaiah 48:13).<br>He said to him: ‘Does your God have feet?’ He said to him: ‘Regarding your gods it is written: “They have feet but cannot walk” (Psalms 115:7). Regarding our God it is written: “His feet will stand that day on the Mount of Olives”’ (Zechariah 14:4).<br>He said to him: ‘Does your God have a throat?’ He said to him: ‘Regarding your gods it is written: “They cannot produce sound with their throats” (Psalms 115:7). Regarding our God it is written: “Sound emerges from His mouth”’ (Job 37:2).<br>He said to him: ‘If there are all these attributes in your God, why does He not rescue you from my hand, like He rescued Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya from the hand of Nebuchadnezzar?’ He said to him: ‘Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya were upright, and Nebuchadnezzar was a king worthy of having a miracle performed through him. But you are not worthy, and we have been condemned to death at the hand of Heaven. If you do not execute us, there are many executioners for the Omnipresent, many wolves, lions, snakes, leopards, and scorpions to attack us and kill us. But ultimately, the Holy One blessed be He is destined to exact retribution from you for our blood.’ Immediately, he issued a decree against him to execute him.<br>His mother said to him: ‘By the life of your head, emperor, give me my son and I will hug him and kiss him.’ He gave him to her, and she bared her breasts and nursed him with her milk. She said to him: ‘By the life of your head, emperor, execute me first and then execute him.’ The emperor said to her: ‘I will not heed you because it is written in your Torah: “An ox or a sheep, it and its offspring you shall not slaughter on one day”’ (Leviticus 22:28). She said to him: ‘You absolute fool, have you already fulfilled all the mitzvot and only this one remains?’ Immediately, he commanded to execute [the son]. His mother fell upon him and was hugging him and kissing him. She said to him: ‘My son, go to Abraham your patriarch and say to him: So said my mother: Do not be overly impressed with yourself and say: I built an altar and sacrificed Isaac, my son. My mother built seven altars and sacrificed seven sons on one day. Yours was an ordeal, mine was an action.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">181</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Your was a test to see if you were willing to sacrifice your son, but you did not actually sacrifice him.

When he was executed, the Sages calculated the age of that child and it was discovered that he was two years, six months, and six and one half hours. At that moment, all the nations of the world screamed out and said: ‘What is the God of these people doing to them that they are killed on His behalf all the time?’ In their regard it is written: “For we are killed all day long for You” (Psalms 44:23).<br>Sometime later, that woman went mad and she fell from the roof and died, to realize what is stated: “She who bore seven is miserable” (Jeremiah 15:9).

Is it possible that Zedekiah saw others plucking out his eyes and he did not have the intelligence to smash his head against the wall until his soul departed, but he rather caused his sons to be slaughtered before his eyes?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">184</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nebuchadnezzar had Zedekiah’s sons slaughtered before his eyes, and then had Zedekiah’s eyes blinded (II Kings 25:7). According to the Sages, they first inserted iron rods into his eyes but had not yet blinded him; they finished blinding him only after he saw his sons slaughtered (<i>Tanḥuma, Vaetḥanan</i> 1). The midrash here asks why Zedekiah did not kill himself to spare himself this torture. </i> Rather, regarding that moment it is stated: “The heart of the king and the heart of the princes will fail…” (Jeremiah 4:9). Rabbi Neḥemya said: For the departure of priesthood and kingship. That is what is written: “These are the two anointed men who attend the Lord of all the land” (Zechariah 4:14); these are Aaron and David. Aaron is demanding his priesthood and David is demanding his kingdom.<br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: For dereliction in the study of Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">185</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This opinions interprets the verse “for these I weep” to mean due to these sins, namely the dereliction in the study of Torah.</i> That is what is written: “These are the statutes and the ordinances” (Deuteronomy 12:1).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">186</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This verse is stated regarding the Torah.

That is what is written: “These you shall perform to the Lord on your appointed days” (Numbers 29:39). The Rabbis said: For the abrogation of the [non-priestly] watches.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">187</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference is to the groups of Israelites, corresponding to the twenty-four priestly watches, who would spend the week in prayer and Torah study so that the Temple service would be pleasing to God; see <i>Taanit</i> 26a.</i> What benefit does the world have from the watches? On Monday they would fast on behalf of the seafarers. On Tuesday they would fast on behalf of the wayfarers. On Wednesday they would fast on behalf of the children, so that diphtheria would not afflict their mouths and cause them to die. On Thursday they would fast on behalf of the pregnant women, that they would not miscarry, and on behalf of the nursing women, that their children should not die. But is it not so that one may not fast on behalf of two matters simultaneously, as it is written: “We fasted and we requested from our God about this”? (Ezra 8:23). And a verse in Daniel says: “For them to request mercy from before the God of heaven regarding this secret” (Daniel 2:18), and not regarding two.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">188</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Both verses mention requesting from God regarding “this,” in singular.</i> Rather, it is like that which Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: For drought and exile one fasts for both of them simultaneously.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">189</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They are related, because due to famine people wander from their homes in search of food. Similarly, miscarriage and the death of infants are closely enough related that one can pray regarding both simultaneously.</i> However, one does not fast on the day before Shabbat or on the day following Shabbat, in deference to Shabbat.<br>“My eye, my eye sheds water.” Rabbi Levi said: This is analogous to a doctor who had pain in one eye. He said: ‘Let my eye weep for my eye.’ So too, Israel is called the eye of the Holy One blessed be He. That is what is written: “For the eye of man and all the tribes of Israel is toward the Lord” (Zechariah 9:1). As it were, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Let My eye weep for My eye.’<br>“For a comforter, restorer of my soul, has grown distant from me.” What is the name of the messianic king? Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: The Lord is his name, as it is stated: “This is his name that they will call him: The Lord is our righteousness” (Jeremiah 23:6). As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: It is good for a province when its name is like that of its king, and the name of its king is like that of its God. It is good for a province when its name is like that of its king, as it is written: “The name of the city from that day shall be: The Lord is there” (Ezekiel 48:35). The name of its king like the name of its God, as it is stated: “This is his name that they will call him: The Lord is our righteousness” (Jeremiah 23:6).<br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: His name is Tzemaḥ, as it is stated: “Behold a man, Tzemaḥ is his name, and he will sprout [<i>yitzmaḥ</i>]” (Zechariah 6:12). Rabbi Yudan said: Menaḥem is his name, as it is stated: “For a comforter [<i>menaḥem</i>]…has grown distant from me.” Rabbi Ḥanina said: And they do not disagree; the numerical value of this equals the numerical value of that, <i>Menaḥem</i> equals <i>Tzemaḥ</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">190</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Menaḥem:</i> <i>mem</i> – 40, <i>nun</i> – 50, <i>ḥet</i> – 8, <i>mem</i> – 40 = 138. <i>Tzemaḥ:</i> <i>tzadi</i> – 90, <i>mem</i> – 40, <i>ḥet</i> – 8 = 138.</i> The following supports that [statement] of Rabbi Yudan in the name of Rabbi Aivu: There was an incident involving a certain person who was plowing. One of his oxen lowed. A certain Arab passed near him and said to him: ‘What are you?’ He said to him: ‘I am a Jew.’ He said to him: ‘Unharness your ox, untie your plow.’ He said to him: ‘Why?’ He said to him: ‘The Temple of the Jews is destroyed.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">191</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Therefore, you should mourn rather than work your field.</i> He said to him: ‘How do you know?’ He said to him: ‘I know it from the lowing of your ox.’ While he was still conversing with him, it lowed again. He said to him: ‘Harness your ox, tie your plow, as the redeemer of the Jews was born.’ He said to him: ‘What is his name?’ He said to him: ‘His name is Menaḥem.’ ‘What is his father’s name?’ He said to him: ‘Hezekiah.’ He said to him: ‘Where do they live?’ He said to him: ‘In Birat Arva, that is in Bethlehem of Judah.’ That man sold his oxen, sold his plow, and became a seller of felt garments for children. He would enter a city and leave a city, enter a province and leave a province, until he arrived there.<br>All of the women of the village came to purchase from him, but the mother of a certain child did not purchase from him.

Some time later that man said: ‘I will go and see how that child is doing.’ He came to her, he said to her: ‘How is the child doing?’ She said to him: ‘Did I not say to you that he has a harsh fate?

Who said this verse? If you say it was Jeremiah, would it be possible for him not to eat? Would it be possible for him not to sleep? Rather, who said it? One before whom there is neither eating nor sleeping, as it is written: “Behold, the Guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps” (Psalms 121:4). Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said in the name of Rabbi Levi: It is written: “God said: Let the water…pool [<i>yikavu</i>]” (Genesis 1:9). The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Let the water hope [<i>yekavu</i>] to participate in what I am destined to do with them.’ Rabbi Ḥagai said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: This is analogous to a king who built palaces, and he settled mute residents in them. Each day they would rise early and inquire after the wellbeing of the king, lauding him with gestures with their fingers. The king said: ‘If these people, who are mute, laud me in this manner, if they were able to speak, all the more so.’ What did he do? He settled residents who could speak in [the palaces]. They arose and took possession of the king’s palace and said: ‘This palace is only ours.’ At that moment, the king said: ‘Let the world be restored to the way that it was.’ So too, at the beginning of the creation of the world, [God’s] praises would ascend only from the water. That is what is written: “It is from the sound of many waters, the mighty breakers of the sea” (Psalms 93:4). What would they say? “The Lord is mighty on high” (Psalms 93:4). At that time, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘If those who do not have a mouth, a tongue, speech, or articulation, laud me in this way, when I create people, all the more so.’ When He created people, the generation of Enosh and the generation of the Flood stood and rebelled against Him. At that time, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Let the world be restored to the way that it was, as it was stated: “The rain was upon the earth”’ (Genesis 7:12).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">198</sup><i class=\"footnote\">God brought the Flood in order to return the world to a state in which water covered the face of the earth.</i><br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: [This is analogous] to one who had a staff and a wicker basket.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">199</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He was poor.</i> He garnered wealth and purchased a flock.

Appear to us, You who led Joseph like a flock, You who sit enthroned above the cherubs” (Psalms 80:2). The flock is Israel, as it is stated: “You are my flock, the flock of My pasture” (Ezekiel 34:31). The wolves who entered His flock and mauled them are the enemies who entered the Temple. At that moment the Holy One blessed be He said: “Would that my head was water and my eyes a source of tears [and I would weep day and night]” (Jeremiah 8:23).<br>It is written: “These I remember, and pour out my soul: [When I used to go with a throng of people in a procession [<i>edadem</i>] to the House of God, a celebrating multitude with voice of song and thanksgiving]” (Psalms 42:5).

On the roads, they would say: “Our feet were standing at your gates, Jerusalem” (Psalms 122:2). On the Temple Mount, what would they say? “Halleluya. Praise the Almighty in His holy place” (Psalms 150:1). In the Temple courtyard, what would they say? “Let all who breathe praise the Lord” (Psalms 150:6). But now, we are silent [<i>edadem</i>]; we ascend in silence and we descend in silence.’<br>“These I remember.” In the past, I would ascend with songs and psalms before the Holy One blessed be He, just as it says: “With voice of song and thanksgiving” (Psalms 42:5).

Similarly, “Hannah had no [<i>ein</i>] children” (I Samuel 1:2), and ultimately she had, as it is stated: “For the Lord remembered Hannah” (I Samuel 2:21). Similarly, “she is Zion, she has no one [<i>ein</i>] seeking her” (Jeremiah 30:17), and ultimately she had, as it is stated: “A redeemer will come to Zion” (Isaiah 59:20).

It is not against you today, but against the house with which I have war, and God has said that I should make haste” (II Chronicles 35:20–21). It is by the word of the Holy One blessed be He that I am ascending. “Restrain yourself from god who is with me” (II Chronicles 35:21), this is an expression of idol worship. “Yoshiyahu did not turn his face from him…and did not heed the words of Nekho from the mouth of God” (II Chronicles 35:22), this [alludes to] Jeremiah, who said to Yoshiyahu: ‘So I received from my teacher Isaiah: “I will provoke Egypt against Egypt”’ (Isaiah 19:2). He did not heed him. Rather, he said to him: ‘Did Moses, the teacher of your teacher, not say this: “A sword will not pass in the land” (Leviticus 26:6)? And the sword of that wicked one is passing in my land and my borders.’ But he did not realize that his entire generation was idol worshippers.

When Rabbi Elazar concluded his prayer, he sent and had him brought. He said to him: ‘What did that Cuthite say to you?’ He said to him: ‘I do not know what he whispered in my ear, and I did not hear anything from him, as I was standing in prayer and I do not know what he was saying.’ Ben Koziva was filled with rage. He gave him one kick with his foot and killed him. A Divine Voice emerged and said: “Woe to the worthless shepherd who abandons the flock; a sword upon his arm and upon his right eye” (Zechariah 11:17). It said to him: ‘You paralyzed the arm of Israel and blinded their right eye; therefore, the arm of this man “will wither and his right eye will go blind”’ (Zechariah 11:17). Immediately, the iniquities caused Beitar to be captured. Ben Koziva was killed and they brought his head to Hadrian.

The blood would roll boulders [weighing] forty <i>se’a</i>  and would flow four <i>mil</i> into the sea. And lest you say it is proximate to the sea, it is a distance of four <i>mil</i> from the sea.

He applied to himself the verse: “My eye distressed my soul…” (Lamentations 3:51).<br>There were two brothers in Kefar Ḥaruva and they would not allow a Roman to pass there whom they did not kill.

There it is written: “Any man from the children of Israel, or from the strangers who resides among them, who shall hunt game of a beast…he shall [pour out its blood and] cover it with dirt” (Leviticus 17:13). However, here it is written: “For its blood was within it; on a bare rock it placed it. It did not pour it on the ground to cover it with dirt” (Ezekiel 24:7). Why to that extent? “To arouse fury to take vengeance, I placed its blood upon the bare rock that it not be covered” (Ezekiel 24:8).<br>Israel performed seven transgressions on that day: They killed a priest, a prophet, and a judge, they spilled innocent blood, they desecrated the Name, they impurified the Temple courtyard, and it was Shabbat and Yom Kippur. When Nevuzaradan ascended, he saw that the blood of Zekharya was boiling. He said to them: ‘What is this?’ They said to him: ‘It is the blood of bulls and sheep.’ He brought bulls and sheep but [their blood] was not similar. He said to them: ‘If you tell me, fine.

He said to it: ‘Zekharya, I have eliminated the best of your people. Is it your will that all of them will be eliminated?’ Immediately, it rested. That wicked one contemplated repentance, and said: ‘One who eliminates a single Israelite soul, it is written in his regard: “Whoever sheds the blood of man, his blood will be spilled by man” (Genesis 9:6), this man who eliminated many souls, all the more so.’ Immediately, the Holy One blessed be He became filled with mercy for them, and He intimated to the blood, and it was absorbed in its place.<br>Eighty thousand young priests breached the armies of Nebuchadnezzar with gold shields in their hands.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They escaped the siege imposed by the Babylonian army.</i> They went to the Ishmaelites, who took out salty foods and inflated wineskins.

That is what is written: “A prophecy of Arabia: In the forest in Arabia you will stay the night, caravans of Dedanites. Bring water to the thirsty. The inhabitants of the land of Teima greeted the wanderer with his bread [for they wandered due to swords, due to the drawn sword and to the bent bow]” (Isaiah 21:13–15).

But you did not fulfill: “Bring water to the thirsty.” Was it because it was good for them that they came to you? “For they wandered due to swords” (Isaiah 21:15), it is due to the sword of Nebuchadnezzar that they wandered.<br>“Due to a drawn [<i>netusha</i>] sword” (Isaiah 21:15), it is because they did not observe their Sabbatical Years properly, just as it is said: “But the seventh, you shall leave it fallow and relinquish it [<i>untashtah</i>]” (Exodus 23:11). “And to the bent [<i>derukha</i>] bow” (Isaiah 21:15), it is because they did not observe Shabbat properly, just as it is said: “In those days I saw in Judah some treading [<i>dorekhim</i>] winepresses on the Shabbat” (Nehemiah 13:15). “And due to the rigor of the war” (Isaiah 21:15), because they did not engage in the give and take of the war of Torah, of which it is written: “Therefore, it is said in the book of the Wars of the Lord” (Numbers 21:14).<br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From Giveton to Antipatris there were six hundred thousand cities, the smallest of which was Beit Shemesh.

Rabbi Pinḥas said: In any less than fifty days. But since iniquity caused [their downfall], “He destroyed, in His ire, the strongholds of the daughter of Judah, He brought them to the ground.”<br>“He profaned a kingdom and its princes.” “He profaned a kingdom,” this is Israel, just as it says: “You will be for Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation” (Exodus 19:6). “And its princes,” these are the guardian angels On High. You find that until the enemies came, Jeremiah would say to them: ‘Repent so you will not go into exile.’ They said to him: ‘If the enemies will come, what can they do to us?’ One [Israelite] said: ‘I will surround it with a wall of water.’ Another said: ‘I will surround it with a wall of fire.’ Another said: ‘I will surround it with a wall of iron.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Each of them boasted that they could accomplish this by invoking the name of an angel (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> The Holy One blessed be He said to them: You are using that which is Mine. The Holy One blessed be He rose and changed the names of the angels. The one appointed over water, He tasked over fire; the one appointed over fire, He tasked over iron.

Rabbi Berekhya said: Of what shall he complain about the One who gives life to the worlds? If he seeks to complain, it should be each man for his sins.

Jacob, too, did so. I am engaged in crowning his son king in Egypt, and he expresses a grievance before Me: “[Why do you say, Jacob…] my way is hidden from the Lord” (Isaiah 40:27). His children, too, I am engaged in providing them with easily digestible bread so that no one among them will be afflicted with indigestion or diarrhea, and they express a grievance before Me: “Our soul loathes this insubstantial bread” (Numbers 21:5).

I was joyful that the words of Uriya were realized, and ultimately the words of Zechariah are destined to be realized.’ They said to him in these words: ‘Akiva, you have comforted us.

                "<b>“Why do You forget us forever, forsake us for so long?” (Lamentations 5:20).</b><br>“Why do You forget us forever?” Rabbi Yehoshua bar Avin said: Jeremiah employed four expressions: Spurning, rejection, forsaking, and forgetting. Spurning and rejection, as it is written: “Did You spurn Judah, did Your soul reject Zion?” (Jeremiah 14:19). And he was answered by Moses, as it is written: “I did not spurn them and I did not reject them” (Leviticus 26:44). Forsaking and forgetting, as it is written: “Why do You forget us forever, forsake us for so long?” And he was answered by Isaiah, as it is written: “These too may forget, but I will not forget you” (Isaiah 49:15).<br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Jeremiah employed four expressions: Spurning, anger, forsaking, and forgetting. Spurning, he answered himself, as it is written: “So said the Lord: If the heavens above can be measured and the foundations of the earth below probed, I too will spurn all the descendants of Israel because of everything that they did, the utterance of the Lord” (Jeremiah 31:37).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the heavens and earth cannot be measured, Israel will not be spurned.</i> Anger, he was answered by Isaiah, as it is stated: “For I will not contend forever and I will not be eternally angry” (Isaiah 57:16).",
                "<b>“Return us to You, Lord, and we will return; renew our days as of old” (Lamentations 5:21).</b><br>“Return us to You, Lord, and we will return.” The congregation of Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, it is incumbent upon You to return us.’ He said to them: ‘It is incumbent upon you, as it is stated: “Return to Me and I will return to you, said the Lord” (Malachi 3:7).’ It said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, it is incumbent upon you, as it is stated: “Return us, God of our salvation” (Psalms 85:5).’ That is why it is stated: “Return us to You, Lord, and we will return.”<br>“Renew our days as of old [<i>kekedem</i>].” Like Adam the first man, just as it says: “He banished the man; He stationed…east [<i>mikedem</i>] of the Garden of Eden” (Genesis 3:24).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Adam repented after being banished from Eden, and his repentance was accepted (Rabbi David Luria).</i> Alternatively, “renew our days as of old.” Just as it says: “The offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasant to the Lord, as in the days of old and as in former years” (Malachi 3:4). “As in the days of old,” this is Moses, as it is written: “He remembered the days of old, Moses, His people” (Isaiah 63:11). “And as in former years,” like the years of Solomon. Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] says: “As in the days [<i>kimei</i>] of old,” as in the days of Noah, as it is stated: “For, like the waters of [<i>ki mei</i>] Noah, this is for Me” (Isaiah 54:9). “And as in former years,” like the years of Abel, when there was not yet idolatry in the world.",
                "<b>“For You have despised us, You have been exceedingly angry with us” (Lamentations 5:22).</b><br>“For You have despised us, You have been exceedingly angry with us.” Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: If it is despising, there is no hope; if it is anger, there is hope, as anyone who is angry will ultimately be assuaged.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish interprets the verse based on the doubled term for despised in the Hebrew [<i>ma’os me’astanu</i>], such that the verse can be understood to imply the following: If You have despised [<i>ma’os</i>], You will continuously despise us; but if You are exceedingly angry with us, there is yet hope.</i>"
