                "<b>“The Song of Songs that is Solomon’s” (Song of Songs 1:1).</b><br>Prologue of the Sages. “The Song of Songs,” that is what [the verse] written by Solomon states: “Have you seen a man diligent in his labor? He will stand before kings, he will not stand before dark ones” (Proverbs 22:29). “Have you seen a man diligent in his labor” – This is Joseph, in whose regard it is written: “He came into the house to perform his labor [and none of the men of the house were there, in the house]” (Genesis 39:11). Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda says: It was a day of disgrace and manure,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash is referring here to Egyptian ritual worship, and uses these words to describe it in order to demean such idolatry.</i> and a day of theater. Rabbi Neḥemya says it was a day of theater in honor of the Nile. Everyone went to see, and he entered to perform his labor to calculate the accounts of his master.<br>Rabbi Pinḥas says in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Abba: Anyone who serves his master properly is set free. From where do we derive this? From Joseph. Because he served his master properly, he was set free. Therefore, “he will stand before kings,” this is Pharaoh, as it is stated: “Pharaoh sent and summoned Joseph, and they rushed him from the dungeon” (Genesis 41:14). “He will not stand before dark ones,” this is Potiphar, as the Holy One blessed be He blinded his eyes and castrated him.",
                "Another matter, “have you seen a man diligent…,” this is Moses in the labor of [constructing] the Tabernacle; therefore, “he will stand before kings,” this is Pharaoh, as it is stated “Arise early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh” (Exodus 8:16). “He will not stand before dark ones,” this is Yitro. Rabbi Neḥemya said: You have rendered the sacred profane; rather, “he will stand before kings,” this is the King of kings, the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “He was there with the Lord forty days” (Exodus 34:28). “He will not stand before dark ones,” this is Pharaoh, as it is stated: “There was a thick darkness [in the entire land of Egypt]” (Exodus 10:22).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pharaoh is referred to as dark because his land became dark. Alternatively, the reference is due to the fact that Moses announced that he would no longer come to see Pharaoh after the plague of darkness (see Exodus 10:29).</i>",
                "Another matter, “have you seen a man diligent in his labor…,” these are the righteous who are engaged in the labor of the Holy One blessed be He; therefore, “he will stand before kings,” as they stand resolute in the Torah, as it is stated: “Through me kings reign” (Proverbs 8:15).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This statement is stated from the persective of the Torah. Thus, one who stands resolute in Torah is able to stand before kings.</i> “He will not stand before dark ones,” these are the wicked, as it is stated: “Their deeds are in the dark” (Isaiah 29:15), and it is written: “Let their way be dark and slippery” (Psalms 35:6).",
                "Another matter, “have you seen a man diligent in his labor,” this is Rabbi Ḥanina. They said: One time, he saw the residents of his city taking up burnt offerings and peace offerings [to the Temple in Jerusalem]. He said: All of them are taking peace offerings up to Jerusalem and I am not taking up anything. What shall I do? Immediately, he went to the wilderness of his city, in the ruins of his city.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An area of the city that had become ruins and was therefore uninhabited (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> He found a particular stone there and he went and smoothed it, chiseled it, and painted it. He said: ‘I take it upon myself to take it up to Jerusalem.’ He sought to hire laborers, he said to them: ‘Will you take this stone up to Jerusalem for me?’ They said to him: ‘Give us one hundred gold pieces as our wages and we will take your stone to Jerusalem for you.’ He said to them: ‘From where do I have one hundred gold pieces, or [even] fifty to give to you?’ He was unable to find [enough money] at that time, and immediately they went on their way. Immediately, the Holy One blessed be He summoned for him five angels in the guise of men. They said to him: ‘Rabbi, give us five <i>sela</i> and we will take your stone up to Jerusalem for you, provided that you give your hand [and carry it] with us.’ He gave his hand and they found themselves standing in Jerusalem. He sought to give them their wages but did not find them. The incident came to the Chamber of Hewn Stone.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This was the seat of the Great Sanhedrin. He sought direction in what he should do with the money since he was unable to locate the laborers.</i> They said to him: ‘Our rabbi, it appears that ministering angels took the stone to Jerusalem for you.’ Immediately, he gave the Sages those wages with which he hired the angels.",
                "Another matter, “have you seen a man diligent in his labor,” this is Solomon son of David. “He will stand before kings,” as he was diligent in the construction of the Temple; that is what is written: “He built it in seven years” (I Kings 6:38), and another verse says: “Solomon built his palace in thirteen years” (I Kings 7:1). Is the result that the construction of Solomon’s palace was finer and more elaborate than the construction of the Temple? Rather, this is what they said: In the construction of his palace, he was indolent; in the construction of the Temple he was diligent and was not indolent. Huna [said] in the name of Rav Yosef: If everyone assists the king, all the more so that everyone assists for the honor of the King of kings, the Holy One blessed be He, even spirits, even demons, and even ministering angels.<br>Yitzḥak son of Rav Yehuda bar Yeḥezkel said: It is written: “I have built [<i>bano baniti</i>] an abode for You” (I Kings 8:13); I have built for you a built building.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse is quoting Solomon as saying that he put up a building, the Temple, that was actually built by itself.</i> Rabbi Berekhya said: “The House that they were building,” is not written here, but rather: “The House, in its construction” (I Kings 6:7), [indicating that] it was built on its own, as it is stated: “It was built of whole stones that were transported” (I Kings 6:7). “Built” is not written here, but rather, “it was built [<i>nivna</i>].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash understands the term <i>nivna</i> as a reflexive term, indicating that it built itself.</i> This teaches that the stone would lift itself and be placed on the row of stones. Rav said: Do not be astonished by this. What is written below? “One stone was brought and placed at the entrance to the den” (Daniel 6:18). Were there stones in Babylon?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Babylon has only lowlands and soft earth, and no mountains.</i> Rather, it flew from the Land of Israel at that moment and came and settled at the entrance to the pit. Rav Huna said, in the name of Rav Yosef: An angel descended in the image of a stone lion and settled at the entrance of the pit. That is what in written: “My God sent His angel and closed the lions’ mouths” (Daniel 6:23). Do not be astonished; if in honor of that righteous one [Daniel], it is written: “One stone was brought,” in honor of the Holy One blessed be He<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For the building of the Temple.</i> all the more so.<br>“He will stand before kings”—he will stand before kings of the Torah. “He will not stand before dark ones,” this is the group of the wicked. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: When [the Sages] voted, and concluded that three kings and four commoners do not have a portion in the World to Come, they sought to add Solomon to them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This was due to what is described in I Kings 11:1–10.</i> A Divine Voice emerged and said: “Do not touch My anointed ones” (Psalms 105:15). Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: Moreover, he is listed as the head of a [royal] genealogical lineage, as it is stated: “Reḥavam the son of Solomon [reigned in Jerusalem]” (I Kings 14:21). Rabbi Yudan bar Simon said: Moreover, the Divine Spirit rested upon him and he composed these three books: Proverbs, Song of Songs, and Ecclesiastes.",
                "That is what is written: “Your sons will be in the stead of your fathers” (Psalms 45:17). You find a righteous person begetting a righteous person, a wicked person begetting a wicked person, a righteous person begetting a wicked person, and a wicked person begetting a righteous person. Each of them has [an allusion in] the Bible, has [an allusion in a popular] proverb, and has [an allusion in] common parlance. A righteous person begetting a righteous person has [an allusion in] the Bible and has [an allusion in] a proverb. The Bible, as it is written: “Your sons will be in the stead of your fathers.” It has a proverb: A scion<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The scion (a shoot or twig of a plant used to form a graft) of a fig tree.</i> that established a fig tree. A wicked person begetting a wicked person has [an allusion in] the Bible, has [an allusion in] a proverb, and has [an allusion in] common parlance. The Bible, as it is written: “Behold, you have risen in the stead of your fathers, [a brood of sinful men]” (Numbers 32:14). A proverb, [as it is written]: “as the ancient proverb says: From the wicked, wickedness will emerge” (I Samuel 24:14). [In] common parlance, from where? What does the beetle bear? Ticks that are worse than it. A righteous person begetting a wicked person has [an allusion in] the Bible: “Thistles will emerge in the stead of wheat” (Job 31:40). A proverb, [as it is written]: They<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Partridges.</i> beget fledglings that are not like them; they raise those that are not similar to them. A wicked person begetting a righteous person has [an allusion in] the Bible: “In the stead of a brier, a cypress will rise” (Isaiah 55:13). [And] a proverb: From the thorn, a rose will emerge.<br>But Solomon was a king, son of a king; a wise man, son of a wise man; a righteous man, son of a righteous man; a nobleman, son of a nobleman. You find that everything that is written regarding this one is written regarding that one. David reigned forty years, and that one [Solomon] reigned forty years. David reigned over Israel and Judah, and his son reigned over Israel and Judah. His father [David] built the foundations [of the Temple] and he [Solomon] built the superstructure. His father reigned from one end of the earth to [the other] end, and that one reigned from one end of the earth to [the other] end. David wrote books and Solomon wrote books. David recited songs and Solomon recited songs. David said vanities and Solomon said vanities.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They instructed the people not to chase after temporal pleasures, which are mere vanities (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>).</i> David said words and Solomon said words.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They spoke words of wisdom inspired by the Divine Spirit.</i> David stated proverbs and Solomon stated proverbs. David lauded with “then” and Solomon lauded with “then.” David built an altar and Solomon built an altar. David sacrificed an offering and Solomon sacrificed an offering. David took up the Ark and Solomon took up the Ark.<br>David reigned forty years, as it is stated: “The days that David reigned over Israel were forty years” (I Kings 2:11). Solomon reigned forty years, as it is stated: “Solomon reigned in Jerusalem, over all Israel, for forty years” (II Chronicles 9:30). David reigned over Israel and Judah, as it is stated: “The Lord, God of Israel, chose me from all the house of my father [to be king over Israel forever, for He has chosen Judah]” (I Chronicles 28:4). Solomon reigned over Israel and Judah, as it is stated: “Judah and Israel were numerous...” (I Kings 4:20).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The passage is discussing the reign of Solomon, and begins: “Solomon was king over all Israel” (I Kings 4:1). Thus, the verse cited in the midrash specifically mentions Israel and Judah because he was king over both.</i> David built the foundations [of the Temple], as it is stated: “King David rose on his feet [and said: …it was in my heart to build a resting place for the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, and for the footstool of our God, and I prepared to build]” (I Chronicles 28:2). Solomon built the superstructure, as it is stated: “I have built an abode for You” (I Kings 8:13). David said words, as it is stated: “These are David’s last words” (II Samuel 23:1). Solomon said words, as it is stated: “The words of Kohelet ben David, king in Jerusalem” (Ecclesiastes 1:1). David said vanities, as it is stated: “Indeed, everyone is vanity, every standing man, Selah” (Psalms 39:6). Solomon said vanities, as it is stated: “Vanity of vanities, said Kohelet; vanity of vanities, everything is vanity” (Ecclesiastes 1:2). David stated proverbs, as it is stated: “As the ancient proverb says: From the wicked, wickedness will emerge” (I Samuel 24:14). Solomon stated proverbs, as it is stated: “The proverbs of Solomon son of David” (Proverbs 1:1). David wrote books, as Psalms is attributed to him. Solomon wrote books: Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs. David lauded with “then,” as it is stated: “Then our mouths will be filled with laughter, and our tongues with song. Then the nations will say…” (Psalms 126:2). Solomon lauded with “then,” as it is stated: “Then Solomon said: The Lord said…” (I Kings 8:12). David took up the Ark, as it is stated: “David, and the elders of Israel […were walking to take up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord]” (I Chronicles 15:25). Solomon took up the Ark, as it is stated: “Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel… [to take up the Ark of the Covenant…]” (I Kings 8:1). David recited songs, as it is stated: “David spoke to the Lord the words of this song…” (II Samuel 22:1). Solomon recited songs, as it is stated: “The Song of Songs that is Solomon’s.”<br>Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Yonatan of Bet Guvrin in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: Since you equate them, equate them regarding all aspects. Just as his [Solomon’s] father was forgiven for all his iniquities, as it is stated: “The Lord has also put away your sin; you shall not die” (II Samuel 12:13), so, too, in his regard. Moreover, the Divine Presence rested upon him and he composed three books: Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs.",
                "Another matter, “The song of songs”—that is what the verse said: “The heart of the wise will make his mouth prevail” (Proverbs 16:23); the heart of the wise man is filled with wisdom. What can attest to him, what can indicate that he is full of wisdom? His mouth will indicate his wisdom; his mouth will be instructive in his regard. “He will increase his lesson on his lips” (Proverbs 16:23); by expressing matters of Torah from his heart, he increases the lesson of Torah. They stated an analogy, to what is the matter comparable? To a barrel that is filled with gems and pearls, is sealed with a tight cover, placed in one corner, and no one knows what is in it; one person comes and empties it, and everyone knows what is in it. So too, Solomon’s heart was filled with wisdom, but no one knew what was in it. When the Divine Presence rested upon him, and he composed three books, everyone became aware of his wisdom.<br>“He will increase his lesson on his lips,” the lesson that he added to matters of Torah elevated him, as it is stated: “I applied my heart to seek and to scout [<i>velatur</i>] wisdom” (Ecclesiastes 1:13). What is <i>velatur</i>? It is to become a scout for wisdom. That is what is written: “So they may scout [<i>veyaturu</i>] the land of Canaan” (Numbers 13:2). One who is expert in Bible, I will go to him; one who is expert in Mishna, I will go to him, as it is stated: “To scout wisdom.”<br>Another matter, “to seek and to scout [<i>latur</i>],”—to fulfill the quota [<i>latur</i>] and go beyond [<i>lehotir</i>]. The poet, when he composes an alphabetic acrostic poem, at times he finishes [the alphabet] and at times he does not finish it. However, Solomon composed an alphabetic acrostic and [added lines for] five additional letters, as it is written: “His songs were a thousand [<i>alef</i>] and five” (I Kings 5:12); his song was an alphabetic acrostic<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word a thousand [<i>alef</i>] is read as a reference to the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, <i>aleph</i>, indicating an alphabetical acrostic poem.</i> and five. It was not only regarding matters of Torah that Solomon would scout, but rather: “Everything that is done under the sun” (Ecclesiastes 1:13), such as how one can sweeten mustard [and] how one can sweeten mandrakes. The Holy One blessed be He said: You scouted after matters of Torah, by your life, I will not withhold your reward. I will rest My Divine Spirit upon you. Immediately, the Divine Spirit rested upon him and he composed Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs.",
                "Another matter, “The song of songs,” that is what the verse says: “Beyond the fact that Kohelet was wise” (Ecclesiastes 12:9). Had another person said them,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The lessons stated in the book of Ecclesiastes.</i> you would have been required to bend your ear and listen to those matters; more so because Solomon said them. Had he said them on his own, you would have been required to bend your ear and listen to them; more so because he said them through the Divine Spirit.<br>“Beyond the fact that Kohelet was wise, moreover, he taught the people knowledge, considered [<i>izen</i>] and investigated, composed many proverbs” (Ecclesiastes 12:9). He considered matters of Torah, investigated matters of Torah, and made ears [<i>ozynayim</i>] for the Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This can be understood to mean that he attracted many listeners for matters of Torah. Or it could be understood to mean that he crafted handles [<i>oznayim</i>] for the Torah in the sense that he explained the Torah and thereby made it more accessible, just as the handles of a vessel allow one to easily lift and transport it.</i> You find that until Solomon arose, there was no analogy.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">No one composed analogies to help the masses understand difficult Torah concepts.</i> Rav Naḥman <said two>, Rav Naḥman said: [This is analogous] to a large palace in which there were numerous entrances, and everyone who would enter it would stray from the path of the entrance.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They were unable to find the entrance that would take them where they needed to go.</i> One clever man came and took a skein and hung it on the path of the entrance. Everyone would enter and exit by means of the skein. So too, until Solomon arose, there was no person who was able to understand matters of Torah. Once Solomon arose, everyone began discoursing regarding matters of Torah. Rav Naḥman <said another version>: This is analogous to a thicket of reeds into which no person could enter. One clever man came and took a scythe and cut [them]. Everyone began entering and exiting through the cut area. So it was with Solomon.<br>Rabbi Yosei said: [This is analogous] to a large basked filled with produce, but it did not have a handle, and it could not be moved. One clever man came and crafted handles for it and it began to be moved by means of the handles. So too, until Solomon arose, no one was able to understand matters of Torah. Once Solomon arose, everyone began discoursing regarding matters of Torah.<br>Rabbi Sheila said: [This is analogous] to a large jug that was filled with boiling water but it did not have a handle so that it could be moved. One came and crafted a handle and it began to be moved by means of the handle.<br>Rabbi Ḥanina said: [This is analogous] to a deep well filled with water, and its water was cold, sweet, and excellent, but no creature could drink from it. One man came and tied rope to rope and string to string, drew from it and drank. Everyone began drawing and drinking. So too, from word to word and proverb to proverb, Solomon comprehended the secrets of the Torah, as it is written: “The proverbs of Solomon son of David” (Proverbs 1:1). By means of Solomon’s proverbs, he was able to comprehend matters of Torah.<br>The Rabbis say: Do not let this analogy be insignificant in your eyes, as by means of the analogy a person can comprehend matters of Torah. This is analogous to a king who lost a gold piece in his house, or a fine gem; is it not by means of a wick worth an <i>isar</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A small copper coin.</i> that he finds it? So too, do not let the analogy be insignificant in your eyes, as by means of the analogy a person comprehends matters of Torah. Know that it is so, as Solomon, by means of analogy, comprehended the minute details of the Torah.<br>Rabbi Yudan said: It is to teach you that anyone who says matters of Torah in public will be privileged to have the Divine Spirit rest upon him. From whom do you learn [this]? From Solomon, as because he said matters of Torah in public, he was privileged to have the Divine Spirit rest upon him, and he composed three books: Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs.",
                "Rabbi Pinḥas ben Yair began: “If you seek it like silver…” (Proverbs 2:4). If you seek matters of Torah like these hidden treasures, the Holy One blessed be He will not withhold your reward. This is analogous to a person, if he loses a <i>sela</i> or a <i>kilarin</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This was a valuable ornament of gold inlaid with a jewel.</i> in his house, he will kindle several lamps, several wicks, until he finds them. The matter can be inferred <i>a fortiori</i>; if for these, that [enhance] the temporal life of this world, a person kindles several lamps and several wicks until he discovers them and finds them, matters of Torah, that [are essential for] life in this world and in the World to Come, do you not need to search for them like these hidden treasures? That is: “If you seek it like silver….” Rabbi Elazar said: In all my days, no one preceded me to the study hall and I did not leave a person there and exit. One time I awoke early and I found the collectors of manure and collectors of straw,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These individuals would arise very early to collect straw and manure from public thoroughfares in order to sell them as fertilizer. They had begun their work before Rabbi Elazar had gone to the study hall.</i> and I said: “If you seek it like silver and search for it like for hidden treasures, then you will understand fear of the Lord” (Proverbs 2:4–5). We are not even like the collectors of manure and collectors of straw. Thus we have learned that Rabbi Pinḥas ben Yair used to say: Alacrity leads to cleanliness. Cleanliness leads to purity. Purity leads to sanctity. Sanctity leads to humility. Humility leads to fear of sin. Fear of sin leads to piety. Piety leads to the Divine Spirit. The Divine Spirit leads to the resurrection of the dead. The resurrection of the dead leads to Elijah the prophet, of blessed memory.<br>Alacrity leads to cleanliness, as it is stated: “He shall complete atoning<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The term <i>kapara</i> means atonement as well as cleanliness. This verse, which is about the service of the High Priest in the Temple on Yom Kippur, indicates that it is the completion of a service, which is accomplished through alacrity, that leads to atonement, or cleanliness.</i> for the Sanctuary” (Leviticus 16:20). Cleanliness leads to purity, as it is stated: “The priest shall atone for her and she will be purified” (Leviticus 12:8). Purity leads to sanctity, as it is stated: “He shall purify it and he shall sanctify it” (Leviticus 16:19). Sanctity leads to humility, as it is stated: “For so said the Exalted and Most High, who abides forever and whose name is holy: Exalted and holy I will dwell and I will be with the downtrodden and lowly” (Isaiah 57:15). Humility leads to fear of sin, as it is stated: “In the wake of humility is fear of the Lord…” (Proverbs 22:4). Fear of sin leads to piety, as it is stated: “Then you spoke in a vision to your pious ones” (Psalms 89:20).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some suggest that the text here should read: “The mercy [<i>ḥesed</i>] of the Lord is forever and ever upon those who fear Him” (Psalms 103:17), in accordance with the parallel text of the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Shekalim</i> 3:3). The term <i>ḥesed</i>, translated in the verse as mercy, is related to the term <i>ḥasidut</i>, piety (see <i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Piety leads to the Divine Spirit, as it is stated: “Then you spoke in a vision to your pious ones” (Psalms 89:20). The Divine Spirit leads to the resurrection of the dead, as it is stated: “I will place My spirit in you, and you will live” (Ezekiel 37:14). The resurrection of the dead leads to Elijah the prophet, of blessed memory, as it is stated: “Behold, I am sending Elijah the prophet to you [before the coming of the great and terrible day of the Lord]” (Malachi 3:23).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“The great and terrible day of the Lord” is understood as a reference to the resurrection of the dead. Elijah will come before the resurrection of the dead, but it is the need to perform the resurrection of the dead that leads to his coming (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> <br>Rabbi Matna said: What wisdom made as a crown on its head, humility made as a sandal on its heel. What wisdom made a crown on its head [<i>roshah</i>], as it is stated: “The beginning of wisdom is fear of the Lord” (Psalms 111:10), humility made a sandal on its heel [<i>akevah</i>], as it is stated: “In the wake of [<i>ekev</i>] humility is fear of the Lord…” (Proverbs 22:4).<br>The resurrection of the dead is by means of Elijah the prophet, of blessed memory. That is what is written: “Then you will understand fear of the Lord, and you will find knowledge of <the sacred> <God>” (Proverbs 2:5), this is the Divine Spirit.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Commentaries struggle to understand this line, which does not prove that resurrection of the dead is by means of Elijah. Some suggest that it be deleted (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). Others suggest that this is a proof that alacrity eventually leads to understanding via the Divine Spirit, as indicated above. This is because the verse that precedes the one cited here relates to alacrity (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>).</i> <br>Rabbi Simon [said] in the name of Rabbi Ḥalafta: [This is analogous] to a royal adviser who grew prominent in the king’s palace. The king said to him: ‘Make a request; what shall I give you?’ The adviser said: If I request silver and gold, he will give them to me; gems and pearls, he will give them to me. He said: I will request the king’s daughter, and everything will be included. So too, “In Givon, the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream at night; God said: Request; what shall I give you?” (I Kings 3:5). Solomon said: If I request silver, gold, gems and pearls, he will give them to me. But I will request wisdom and everything will be included. That is what is written: “Give Your servant an attentive heart” (I Kings 3:9). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Solomon, you requested wisdom and you did not request wealth and property and the lives of your enemies. By your life, wisdom is granted you, and thereby, I will give you wealth and property.’ Immediately, “Solomon awakened and behold, a dream” (I Kings 3:15). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: The dream was fulfilled; a donkey brayed and he knew what it was braying, a bird tweeted and he knew what it was tweeting. Immediately, “he came to Jerusalem and stood before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord. He sacrificed burnt offerings, he performed peace offerings, and he made a feast for all his servants” (I Kings 3:15). Rabbi Elazar said: From here it is derived that one makes a feast upon completion of the Torah. Rabbi Yudan said: It is to teach you that anyone who teaches Torah in public is privileged to have the Divine Spirit rest upon him, as so Solomon did. He taught and the Divine Spirit rested upon him and he composed three books: Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs.",
                "Another matter, “The song of songs,” Rabbi Aivu and Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Aivu said: Song, one, of songs, two; that is three.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The term song is singular while the term songs is plural. Adding the two terms together, they refer to three songs, indicating that Song of Songs is really comprised of three independent songs.</i> Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: Song of Songs is entirely one. The other two, what do you do with them? [One is] “A song of ascents for Solomon” (Psalms 127:1) and one is: “A psalm, a song for the dedication of the House, by David” (Psalms 30:1). They thought to say that David said it. But you say it was attributed to David,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One might think that David composed Psalm 30 with divine inspiration, despite the fact that it is about the Temple, which was built after his death. The midrash clarifies that Solomon composed it and attributed it to David because David had made the preparations necessary for the construction of the Temple. Thus, the verse is to be understood as referring to the “House by David,”—the Temple, whose construction was prepared by David.</i> as it is stated: “Your neck is like the tower of David” (Song of Songs 4:4).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a reference to the Temple.</i> Rather, it is just like Song of Songs; Solomon said it, and attributed it to David.<br>When you analyze you say that all the actions of that man [Solomon] were threefold. Solomon rose to three levels. Regarding the first level, it is written: “For he ruled over the entire region beyond the River” (I Kings 5:4). Regarding the second level, it is stated: “Solomon was the ruler [over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt]” (I Kings 5:1). Regarding the third level, it is stated: “Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king” (I Chronicles 29:23). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Is it possible for a person to sit on the throne of the Lord, in whose regard it is written: “For the Lord your God is a consuming fire” (Deuteronomy 4:24), and it is written: “A river of fire flowed and emerged [from before Him]” (Daniel 7:10), and it is written: “His throne was sparks of fire” (Daniel 7:9), and you say: “Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord”? Rather, just as the throne of the Holy One blessed be He rules from one end of the earth to the other, so, too, the throne of Solomon ruled from one end of the earth to the other. Just as the throne of the Lord judges without witnesses and forewarning, so, too, the throne of Solomon judged without witnesses and forewarning. Which [trial] was that? That was the trial of the harlots. That is what is written: “Then two women, [who were harlots,] came” (I Kings 3:16).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They each had a baby, and one of the babies died. Each claimed the living baby was hers, and they came before King Solomon for adjudication. See I Kings 3:16–28.</i> Who were they? Rav said: They were spirits. The Rabbis say: They were childless women awaiting levirate marriage.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If a man dies without children, his widow is subject to the law of levirate marriage, whereby the brother of her dead husband must marry her. The husbands of these women had died without living children, but while their wives were pregnant, and the women subsequently gave birth. However, a child who dies within the first thirty days of its life does not exempt the mother from undergoing levirate marriage, and therefore an outcome of the case would be the determination of which woman would be subject to levirate marriage (<i>Midrash HaMevo’ar</i>).</i> Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: They were actual harlots, and Solomon issued his ruling without witnesses and forewarning.<br>Solomon descended three descents. The first descent: After he was a great king from one end of the earth to the other, his kingdom diminished and he was king only over Israel. That is what is written: “The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel” (Proverbs 1:1). The second descent: After he was king over Israel, his kingdom diminished and he was king only over Jerusalem. That is what is written: “I am Kohelet, I was king over Israel in Jerusalem” (Ecclesiastes 1:12). The third descent: After he was king over Jerusalem, his kingdom diminished and he was king only over his house,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reading in the Gemara (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 20b) is that he was king only over his own bed.</i> as it is stated: “Behold Solomon’s bed; [sixty mighty men are around it, from the mighty of Israel,] all armed with a sword… [from fear in the nights]” (Song of Songs 3:7–8). He was not even king over his bed, as he feared the spirits.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even in his own bed he was not a powerful king, as indicated in the verses cited in the midrash. He feared the spirits who had deposed him from his throne; see <i>Kohelet Rabba</i> 1:12.</i> <br>He saw three worlds. Rabbi Yudan and Rabbi Ḥunya, Rabbi Yudan said: King, commoner, and king, wise man, fool, and wise man, wealthy, indigent, and wealthy.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He was a king, wise, and wealthy, and then he became a commoner, a fool, and indigent, and then he once again became a king who was wise and wealthy. These were Solomon’s three worlds, meaning three stages of life.</i> What is the reason? “I have seen everything in the days of my vanity” (Ecclesiastes 7:15). A person relates his troubles only during the days of his wellbeing.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, since this verse was written at the end of Solomon’s life, it is apparent that he was restored to his position of wellbeing, as a king who was wise and wealthy.</i> Rabbi Hunya said: Commoner, king, and commoner, fool, wise man, and fool, indigent, wealthy, and indigent. What is the reason? “I am Kohelet, I was king over Israel in Jerusalem” (Ecclesiastes 1:12). “I was,” I was when I was; however, now, I am no longer.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, since this verse was written at the end of Solomon’s life, it is apparent that he ended his life as a commoner who was a fool and indigent. Since Solomon did end his life as a wise king, this is to be understood to mean that he did not regain the levels of power, wisdom, and wealth that he once had (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> <br>He violated three prohibitions: He amassed horses, he amassed women, he amassed silver and gold,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These were in violation of the Torah’s commandments regarding the behavior of kings; see Deuteronomy 17:16–17.</i> as it is stated: “The king rendered the silver in Jerusalem like stones” (II Chronicles 9:27). Would they not have been stolen? Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: They were ten-cubit stones and eight-cubit stones.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, the silver and gold pieces on the streets of Jeusalem were too heavy to steal.</i> Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: Even the weights that were in use during Solomon’s era were of gold; that is what is written: “Silver was not considered anything in the days of Solomon” (II Chronicles 9:20). He amassed women, as it is stated: “King Solomon loved many foreign women, and Pharaoh’s daughter…from the nations of whom the Lord said to the children of Israel: Do not consort with them and they shall not consort with you… [to them Solomon cleaved for love]” (I Kings 11:1–2).<br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: It is due to: “You shall not marry them” (Deuteronomy 7:3).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In addition to the fact that Solomon married too many women, the verse in Kings appears to critique him for marrying foreign women. This is due to the fact that he violated the verse cited here from Deuteronomy.</i> Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: “For love” (I Kings 11:2); for actual love, for licentiousness.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He consorted with them but did not marry them. Thus, he did not violate the prohibition stated in Deuteronomy 7:3, but his conduct was considered improper.</i> Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: It is written: “He, too, the foreign women caused him to sin” (Nehemiah 13:26); it teaches that he would have relations with them when they were menstruants and they would not inform him. Rabbi Yosei ben Ḥalafta says: “For love,” to render them beloved [to God], to love them, to draw them near, to convert them, and to cause them to enter beneath the wings of the Divine Presence. It turns out that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai, and Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili all said the same thing. Rabbi Yosei ben Ḥalafta disagrees with the three of them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Rabbi Yosei ben Ḥalafta, the verse does not criticize Solomon for the fact that he married foreign women.</i> <br>Three adversaries confronted him. That is what is written: “The Lord raised up an adversary for Solomon, Hadad the Edomite” (I Kings 11:14); and it is written: “God raised up an adversary for him: Retzon son of Elyada” (I Kings 11:23); and it is written: “He was an adversary for Israel all the days of Solomon,” (I Kings 11:25).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although this verse refers to Retzon, the midrash may be interpreting this as a reference to Jeroboam, whom the next verse (I Kings 11:26) states rebelled against Solomon. Thus, Jeroboam is the third adversary (see <i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> He amassed horses, as it is stated: “A chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred silver pieces and a horse for one hundred and fifty” (I Kings 10:29).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse previously established (I Kings 10:26) that Solomon had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, which were considered very large numbers.</i> <br>He stated three proverbs: “The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel” (Proverbs 1:1); “the proverbs of Solomon: A wise son brings joy to a father” (Proverbs 10:1); “these, too, are the proverbs of Solomon, that the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied” (Proverbs 25:1).<br>He said three vanities: “Vanity [<i>havel</i>] of vanities [<i>havalim</i>] said Kohelet…” (Ecclesiastes 1:2), <i>havel</i>, one, <i>havalim</i>, two;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Havel</i> is a singular term, whereas <i>havalim</i> is a plural term.</i> that is three.<br>He recited three songs: Song, one, of songs, two, that is three.<br>He was called three names: Yedidya, Solomon, Kohelet. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said these three, [and also] Agur, Yakeh, Lemuel, Itiel,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These additional names are based on Proverbs 30:1 and 31:1.</i> are seven. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: The primary among them are Yedidya, Kohelet, Solomon. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman concedes that these [additional] four were added for him and that he was called by them, and they must be expounded: Agur, because he amassed [<i>agur</i>] matters of Torah; bin-Yakeh, a son [<i>bin</i>], who vomited [<i>hekia</i>] for a time, like this basin that is filled for a time and emptied for a time; so, too, Solomon studied Torah for a time and forgot it for a time. Lemuel,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is expounded as though it were written Nemuel.</i> who spoke to God [<i>nam laEl</i>] with all his heart. He said: I can amass and not sin. “To Itiel, to Itiel and Ukhal” (Proverbs 30:1). Itiel, God [<i>el</i>] is with me [<i>iti</i>] and I will prevail [<i>veukhal</i>].<br>He wrote three books: Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs. Which of them did he write first? Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great and Rabbi Yonatan, Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great said: He wrote Proverbs first, then Song of Songs, and then Ecclesiastes, and he derived it from this verse: “He spoke three thousand proverbs” (I Kings 5:12); proverbs, this is the book of Proverbs; “his songs were one thousand and five” (I Kings 5:12), this is Song of Songs, and he said Ecclesiastes last.<br>The <i>baraita</i> of Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great disagrees with this statement.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This <i>baraita</i> represents an alternate tradition regarding Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great’s opinion, different from the statement cited previously in his name.</i> The <i>baraita</i> says: He wrote the three of them simultaneously, and the statement says that he wrote each and every one individually. Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great taught: It was only in Solomon’s old age that the Divine Presence rested upon him and he composed three books: Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs. Rabbi Yonatan said: He wrote Song of Songs first, then Proverbs, and then Ecclesiastes. Rabbi Yonatan derived it from the way of the world. When a person is young, he says words of song, when he matures, he says words of proverbs, when he grows old, he speaks of [how the pleasures of the world are] vanities. Rabbi Yannai, the father-in-law of Rabbi Ami said: Everyone concedes that he composed Ecclesiastes last.",
                "Rabbi Elazar bar Avina in the name of Rabbi Aḥa and the Rabbis. Rabbi Elazar said [in the name of Rabbi Aḥa]: “He spoke three thousand proverbs” regarding each and every matter. “His songs were one thousand and five”—one thousand and five reasons for each and every matter. The Rabbis say: “He spoke three thousand proverbs” on each and every verse. “His songs were one thousand and five”—one thousand and five reasons for each and every proverb. “His proverbs were” is not written here, but rather, “his songs were one thousand and five”—the song of the proverb, the reason for the matter, [and another] reason for the matter.<br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: We reviewed the entire book of Proverbs and we found written in it only nine hundred and fifteen verses, and you say three thousand proverbs? Rather, you do not have any verse that does not have two or three thoughts, like: “A nose ring of gold and an adornment of fine gold” (Proverbs 25:12), “a nose ring of gold in the snout of a pig” (Proverbs 11:22). <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The first verse equates “a nose ring of gold and an adornment of fine gold.” The second verse mentions only the nose ring of gold, but it also applies to an adornment of fine gold.</i> “Do not glorify yourself before a king, and do not stand in the place of the great” (Proverbs 25:6). It goes without saying do not sit; do not sit, and it goes without saying, do not speak.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">By teaching that one should not stand in the place of the great, by corollary Solomon is also teaching that one should not sit in their place, and that one should not speak there.</i> <br>We learned:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishna <i>Yadayim</i> 3:5.</i> Rabbi Akiva said: God forbid, not even one person in Israel disagreed regarding Song of Songs, claiming that it does not impurify the hands,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a rabbinic decree that any sacred scroll renders <i>teruma</i> or one’s hands impure. (This decree was enacted so that people would not store their <i>teruma</i> with those scrolls; that could result in vermin attracted by the <i>teruma</i> gnawing at the scrolls and causing them damage.) Thus, if one were to hold that a scroll of the Song of Songs does not render one’s hands impure, that would mean it is not part of the Bible.</i> as there is no day in the entire history of the world like the day that Song of Songs was given. Why? It is because all the Writings are holy, and this is the holy of holies. Regarding what did they disagree? It is regarding Ecclesiastes. Rabbi Yoḥanan bar Rabbi Yehoshua son of Rabbi Akiva’s father-in-law said in accordance with the statement of ben Azai: So they disagreed, so they concluded.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There was a dispute regarding both Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes, but the conclusion was that both are part of the Bible and therefore render one’s hands impure.</i> <br>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya stated a parable for it. [It is comparable] to one who took a <i>se’a</i> of wheat to the baker [and] said to him: ‘Produce for me from it flour, fine flour.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Grind the wheat into flour, and then sift it repeatedly to produce fine flour.</i> Produce for me from it one loaf, from the fine flour, [produced from] the flour.’ So, of all of Solomon’s wisdom, only Song of Songs is fine flour for Israel. Song of Songs, the best of songs, the finest of songs, the most excellent of songs; we will recite songs to the One who has made us into a song in the world, just as you say: “Wail, songs of the palace” (Amos 8:3); the praises of the Temple.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse addresses songs as if they are people, alluding to the fact that the people of Israel are like a song in that they represent the glory of God.</i> <br>Another matter, Song of Songs, the best of songs, the finest of songs, the most excellent of songs; we will recite songs [<i>shirim</i>] to the One who rendered us the remnants [<i>shiyurim</i>] of the world, just as it is stated: “The Lord alone will lead him” (Deuteronomy 32:12).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse is expounded to mean that the Lord will lead him alone, meaning that the people of Israel will remain alone in tranquility at the end of days.</i> Rabbi Yoḥanan [said] in the name of Rabbi Aḥa in the name of Rabbi Shimon bar Abba: We will recite songs and praise to the One who is destined to rest the Divine Spirit upon us. We will recite many songs before Him.<br>In all the songs, either He lauds them, or they laud Him. In the song of Moses, they laud Him and say: “This is my Lord and I will glorify Him” (Exodus 15:2). And in the song of Moses, He lauds them: “He would mount him on the elevations of the earth” (Deuteronomy 32:13). However, here, they laud Him and He lauds them. He lauds them, “Behold, you are fair, my love” (Song of Songs 1:15) and they laud Him: “Behold you are fair my beloved, pleasant, too” (Song of Songs 1:16).<br>Rabbi Shimon in the name of Rabbi Ḥanin of Tzippori said, it is a double song.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">God and Israel praise each other.</i> Rabbi Simon said: Doubled and redoubled.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In many verses, the praise is doubled even from the perspective of one speaker, such as: “Behold, you are fair, my love, behold, you are fair” (1:15).</i> <br>Rabbi Levi said: The numerical value of <i>shir</i> corresponds to the years of the patriarchs and the Ten Commandments.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs is a tribute to Israel, as implied by the fact that the numerical value of the word <i>shir</i>, song, corresponds to the number of years of the lives of the patriarchs, plus the Ten Commandments given to Israel at Sinai.</i> <i>Shir</i> is five hundred and ten.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shin</i> 300, <i>yod</i> 10, <i>reish</i> 200, equal 510.</i> If you say that there is a surplus in them,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Abraham lived 175 years, Isaac, 180, and Jacob, 147, plus 10 commandments, equal 512, not 510.</i> deduct from them the years of famine<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One year during the lifetime of Abraham, and one year during the lifetime of Isaac.</i> that are not included in the tally.<br>Another matter, Rabbi Yudan and Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan [said]: Every place that “King Solomon” is mentioned in this scroll, the verse is speaking of King Solomon.

The whole Torah in its entirety is six hundred and thirteen commandments.

She said: ‘I am not worthy to be even his maidservant;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This means she is agreeing to marry him.</i> however, I wish to hear it from his mouth.’ When that messenger returned to the king his face was glad, but his conversation was not comprehensible to the king.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">85</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The messenger was glad that the woman had agreed to marry the king, but embarrassed to report that hearing the king’s proposal only from the messenger was insufficient for her, and therefore he did not clearly communicate her response.</i> The king, who was clever, said: From the fact that his face is glad, apparently she accepted, but his conversation is not comprehensible to me, so apparently she said: I want to hear it from his mouth. So too, Israel is the well-born woman, the messenger is Moses, the king is the Holy One blessed be He. At that moment: “Moses returned the statement of the people to the Lord” (Exodus 19:8). Why, then, does the [next] verse state: “Moses related the statement of the people to the Lord” (Exodus 19:9)? Because it is stated: “Behold, I am coming to you in a thickness of cloud, so that the people will hear while I speak with you, and they will believe also in you forever. Moses related the statement of the people to the Lord” (Exodus 19:9).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">86</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this verse God indicated that He would not speak directly to the people, but rather He would speak to Moses, and Moses would speak to the people.</i> [Moses] said to Him: ‘This is what they demanded.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Moses told God that the people wanted Him to speak directly to them.</i> He said to [Moses]: ‘Does one listen to a baby [and give him] everything he asks?’ Rabbi Pinḥas [said] in the name of Rabbi Levi: The proverb says: One who was bitten by a snake, a rope frightens him.

Therefore he was fearful of relaying their request for God to speak directly to them.</i> <br>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: This is what they demanded: They said: ‘We wish to see the glory of our King.’ Rabbi Pinḥas [said] in the name of Rabbi Levi: It was revealed before the Holy One blessed be He that Israel is destined to exchange His glory for that of another, as it is stated: “They exchanged their glory” (Psalms 106:20). [God agreed to speak to them] so that they would not say: ‘Had He shown us His glory and His greatness, we would have believed in Him. Now that He did not show us His glory and His greatness, we do not believe in Him.’ [This is] to uphold what is stated: “Do not enter into judgment with your servant, [for no living man will be justified before You]” (Psalms 143:2).",
                "Rabbi Yudan in the name of Rabbi Yuda bar Rabbi Simon, Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Neḥemya. Rabbi Yehuda says: At the moment that Israel heard: “I am the Lord your God” (Exodus 20:2), Torah study was affixed in their heart and they would study and would not forget. They came to Moses and said: ‘Moses our master, you become an intermediary between us, as it is stated: \"You speak to us and we will hear” (Exodus 20:16), “Now, why shall we die? (Deuteronomy 5:22). What benefit would there be in our demise?’ They reverted to studying and forgetting. They said: ‘Just as Moses is flesh and blood and transient, so, too, his teaching is transient.’ Immediately, they returned and came to Moses and said to him: ‘Moses our master, if only He would appear to us a second time. If only “let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth.” If only Torah study will be affixed in our heart as it was.’ He said to them: ‘This will not [happen] now, but [it will occur] in the future, as it is written: “I will place My Torah within them and on their heart I will write it”’ (Jeremiah 31:32).<br>Rabbi Neḥemya said: At the moment that Israel heard: “You shall not have [other gods before Me]” (Exodus 20:3), the evil inclination was uprooted from their heart.

One came, the first guest; he poured him a cup and gave it to him. The second came, and he poured him a cup and gave it to him. When the king’s son came, he gave him the entire cellar. So too, Adam, the first man, was commanded with seven commandments.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The commentaries write that the text should state “six commandments,” as the midrash goes on to list only six.

Judah [was commanded] regarding [levirate marriage with] a childless sister-in-law, as it is stated: “Judah said to Onan: Consort with your brother's wife, and consummate levirate marriage with her” (Genesis 38:8). [The children of] Israel [were commanded] regarding all the positive commandments and the negative commandments.<br>Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina and the Rabbis say: This is analogous to a king who would distribute provisions to his troops by means of dukes, governors, and commanders. When his son came, he gave it to him directly.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Similarly, God gave the commandments to Adam and Noah without direct and public Divine revelation, but He gave the Torah to Israel with direct and public Divine revelation.</i> Rabbi Yitzḥak says: This is analogous to a king who was partaking of fine pastry; when his son came, he gave it to him directly.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He shared the fine royal pastry with his son, and gave it to him directly.

This one says the source of the <i>halakha</i> and that one says the source of the <i>halakha</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Each one provided a source for his opinion as to the halakhic conclusion in the matter under discussion.</i> The Holy One blessed be He says: ‘Their passion comes from Me.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Their commitment to arrive at the true <i>halakha</i> is for the sake of Heaven, and therefore, are the words of the living God (see <i>Eiruvin</i> 13b). Rabbi Neḥemya explains the meaning of the phrase: “Let him kiss me [<i>yishakeni</i>] with the kisses of his mouth” as related to “their passion” [<i>shukeyotehon</i>]. </i> Rabbi Yehuda said: Even the vanity that emerges from his mouth,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">98</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even if those discussing the halakhic matter are mistaken in their analysis and claims.</i> as it is stated: “Job opens his mouth in vanity” (Job 35:16), the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘His passion is from Me.’<br>The Rabbis say: The souls of these are destined to be taken with a kiss. Rabbi Azarya said: We find that the soul of Aaron was taken only with a kiss; that is what is written: “Aaron the priest ascended Mount Hor at the command of [<i>al pi</i>] God and he died there” (Numbers 33:38).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">99</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash interprets the phrase <i>al pi</i> according to its literal meaning, such that the verse states “with the mouth of God,” meaning with a Divine kiss.</i> From where is it derived that the soul of Moses [also departed with a kiss]? As it is stated: “Moses, servant of the Lord, died there…at the command of [<i>al pi</i>] God” (Deuteronomy 34:5). From where is it derived that [the soul of] Miriam [departed with a kiss]? As it is written: “Miriam died there” (Numbers 20:1). Just as “there” that is written below, was with the mouth of God, so, too, here, it is the same, but it is improper to state it explicitly.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">100</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the word “there” appears regarding the death of Moses, who died with a kiss, the use of the term “there” regarding the death of Miriam implies that she died in the same manner. However, the verse did not state this explicitly regarding Miriam because it would have been improper to indicate the kiss regarding a woman (see <i>Bava Batra</i> 17a).</i> The rest of the righteous, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “Let him kiss me from the kisses of his mouth.” If you engaged in matters of Torah that kiss your lips, ultimately, everyone will kiss you on the mouth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So too, God will collect your soul with a Divine kiss (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>).</i> <br>Another matter, “let him kiss me [<i>yishakeni</i>] with the kisses”—He will arm me, He will purify me, He will cleave to me.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\">All of these are connoted by the word <i>yishakeni</i>, as the midrash will explain.</i> <i>Yishakeni</i>, He will arm me, from what is written: “Armed [<i>noshekei</i>] with bows, right-handed and left-handed” (I Chronicles 12:2). Rabbi Shimon bar Naḥman said: Matters of Torah were likened to weapons. Just as these weapons serve their owners in times of war, so, too, matters of Torah serve one who exerts sufficient effort in their study. Rabbi Ḥana bar Aḥa cites it from here: “Exaltation of God [is in their throats, and a double-edged [<i>pifiyot</i>] sword is in their hand]” (Psalms 149:6); just as this sword cuts with both its edges,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It can thereby save the life of its owner on two planes.</i> so too, Torah provides life in this world and life in the World to Come.<br>Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Neḥemya, and the Rabbis. Rabbi Yehuda says: The Torah that was stated by one mouth [<i>peh</i>] is stated by many mouths [<i>piyot</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">104</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is based on the verse from Psalms cited above, which compares Torah to a double-edged [<i>pifiyot</i>] sword. Originally it was stated to Israel by Moses, and then all of the children of Israel spoke about it. Similarly, throughout the generations, when a scholar teaches a Torah insight, it is later repeated by his students (Maharzu).</i> Rabbi Neḥemya said: Two Torahs were stated, one oral and one written.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a continuation of the previous statement. The written Torah is stated in one matter, compared to one mouth, whereas the oral Torah, which was not given with one exact text, is communicated in different forms by different people. This is comparable to a plurality of mouths (Maharzu).</i> The Rabbis say: They decree on the supernal, and they perform, on the earthly, and they perform.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Sages have multiple mouths in the sense of multiple audiences, as the angels and human beings both observe their decrees.</i> Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: The reason of the Rabbis is as it is written: “As there were princes of sanctity and princes of God” (I Chronicles 24:5). “Princes of sanctity,” these are the ministering angels, as it is written: “I profaned the princes of sanctity” (Isaiah 43:28). “Princes of God, these are Israel, as it is written in their regard: “I said: You are divine” (Psalms 82:6), as they decree on the heavenly, and they perform, on the earthly, and they perform, when they conduct themselves in purity.<br>Another matter, “let him kiss me [<i>yishakeni</i>] with the kisses of his mouth”—let him purify me, like a person who causes two pools to meet [<i>mashik</i>] each other and unites them,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If there is not enough water in one or both of the pools to serve as a ritual bath, which purifies, joining them together can allow them to serve in this capacity.</i> as it is stated: “Like the meeting [<i>mashak</i>] of cascading pools he joins it” (Isaiah 33:4).<br>Another matter, “let him kiss me [<i>yishakeni</i>] with the kisses of his mouth”—<i>yishakeni</i>, He will cleave to me, as it is stated: “The sound of the wings of the creatures would touch [<i>mashikot</i>] one another” (Ezekiel 3:13).

                "“…for your love is better than wine” (Song of Songs 1:2). We learned there (Mishna <i>Avoda Zara</i> 2:5): Rabbi Yishmael asked Rabbi Yehoshua as they were walking on the way: ‘Why did [the Sages] prohibit the cheese of the gentiles?’ [Rabbi Yehoshua] said to him: ‘Because they curdle it with the stomach contents of an animal carcass.’ He said to [Rabbi Yehoshua]: ‘But are the stomach contents of a burnt offering not more stringent than the stomach contents of an animal carcass, yet they said that a priest who is broad minded<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He is not particular about what he eats.</i> swallows it raw.’ What is, swallows it raw? He gulps it down. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: They rendered it like a tainted cup; he may not benefit, but he is not liable for misuse of consecrated items.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">110</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, if one eats the stomach contents of a consecrated animal, one is not liable for misuse of a consecrated item. This proves that it is not considered a food item, therefore its consumption is not a normal act of eating. Similarly, the stomach contents of an unslaughtered animal carcass should not be considered a food item, and should not render the cheese non-kosher.</i> [Rabbi Yishmael] said to him:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">111</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the mishna, this is stated as a response to a second explanation given by Rabbi Yehoshua for the prohibition of eating the cheese of gentiles: They curdle it in the stomach contents of animals that have been slaughtered as an idolatrous sacrifice.</i> ‘If so, why did they not prohibit benefit from it?’ [Rabbi Yehoshua] diverted his attention to another matter. He said to him: ‘Yishmael, my brother, how do you read it? For Your love [<i>dodekha</i>] is better than wine, or your love [<i>dodayikh</i>] [is better] than wine?’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">112</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Do you think that the term “your love” is stated in the masculine form [<i>dodekha</i>], indicating that it is being stated by the woman, representing Israel, to the man, representing God, or is it stated in the feminine form [<i>dodayikh</i>], indicating that it is stated by the man, representing God, to the woman, representing Israel. Rabbi Yishmael answered that it is vocalized <i>dodayikh</i>, in the feminine.</i> He said to him: ‘The matter is not so, as its counterpart teaches in its regard: “Your oils [<i>shemanekha</i>] have a goodly fragrance”’<b> </b>(Song of Songs 1:3).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">113</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Just as this verse is in the masculine, so, too, the previous verse, which is the verse under discussion, is also in the masculine.</i><br>Why did he not reveal it to him?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">114</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Why did he divert his attention rather than answering his question?</i> Rabbi Yonatan said: It is because they had prohibited it only recently,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">115</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When the Sages issue a decree, for the first year they do not reveal the reason behind it, so that people will accept the decree without questioning its rationale.</i> and Rabbi Yishmael was young.

When they grow and become Torah scholars, reveal the secrets of Torah to them. Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: “These are the ordinances that you shall place [<i>tasim</i>] before them” (Exodus 21:1), just as this treasure [<i>sima</i>] is not revealed to every person, the same is true of matters of Torah.<br>Rav Huna raised a question and Rabbi Ḥama bar Ukva posed a difficulty:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">117</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some suggest that the text should read: Rav Huna, citing Rabbi Hama bar Ukva, posed a difficulty (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> If he sought to divert him, he should have diverted him from the five verses in the Torah that require resolution.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">118</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In each of these cases there are two phrases, and it is unclear whether a particular word which appears at the border of the two belongs to the first or second phrase.</i> These are they: “<i>se’et</i>” (Genesis 4:7); “cursed” (Genesis 49:7);<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Does “cursed” belong to the previous verse: “And with their will they hamstrung an ox that is cursed” or does it belong to the beginning of this verse: “Cursed is their wrath, as it is fierce”? </i> “tomorrow” (Exodus 17:9);<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Is it “Go out and battle Amalek tomorrow” or is it “Tomorrow I will stand at the top of the hill”?</i> “crafted like almonds” (Exodus 25:34);<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">121</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Is it “four cups crafted like almonds,” or is it “like almonds are its knobs and flowers”?</i> “arise” (Deuteronomy 31:16).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">122</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Is it “you will lie with your ancestors and arise,” or is it “this people will arise and it will stray”?</i> Is it, “if you do well you will receive forgiveness [<i>se’et</i>],” or is it “you will bear your sin [<i>se’et</i>] if you do not do well”? Rabbi Tanḥuma said: I have another: “The sons of Jacob came from the field when they heard” or “when they heard [the men were saddened] and they came from the field” (Genesis 34:7). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: It is written: “And the Lord commanded me” (Deuteronomy 4:14); there are matters that He said to me myself, and there are matters that He told me to say to my children.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">123</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some matters of Torah are meant to publicized to all, and others are meant to be communicated only to those who are worthy.</i> Rabbi Eila said: There are matters that one seals [<i>meshikin</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">124</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is derived from <i>yishakeni</i>. Rabbi Yehoshua raised this verse to Rabbi Yishmael in order to allude to the fact that not everything is meant to be publicized (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> in one’s mouth.<br>How so? One verse says: “I store Your saying in my heart, so as not to sin against You” (Psalms 119:11), and one verse says: “With My lips I have recounted all the ordinances of Your mouth” (Psalms 119:13). In what sense can both these verses coexist? Rather, as long as Ira HaYa’iri, David’s mentor, was alive, “I store Your saying in my heart”; when he departed, “with my lips I have recounted.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">125</sup><i class=\"footnote\">David did not publicize halakhic matters during the lifetime of his teacher because a disciple is prohibited from issuing halakhic rulings in the presence of his teacher (<i>Eruvin</i> 63a).</i>",
                "Another matter, “as your love [<i>dodekha</i>] is better than wine”; matters of Torah are similar to each other, they are companions to one another, they are close to each other, just as you say: “Or his uncle [<i>dodo</i>] or his cousin” (Leviticus 25:49).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">126</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Just as the term <i>dod</i> indicates a familial relationship, that of an uncle (<i>dodo</i>, his <i>dod</i>, means his uncle), the term <i>dodekha</i>, “your <i>dod</i>,” in the verse, indicates a close relationship. This is interpreted as referring to matters of Torah, which are close to each other in the sense that one passage sheds light on another.</i> “However, a spring, or cistern, a gathering of water, [shall be pure]” (Leviticus 11:36), [yet] render food susceptible to impurity, as it is stated: “But if water shall be placed on a seed […it shall be unclean for you]” (Leviticus 11:38).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">127</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This verse teaches the law that food items become susceptible to impurity only if they have already come into contact with water or another liquid. One might have thought that a pool of water that can render an impure item pure, such as those mentioned in verse 36, would not render food items susceptible to impurity. The juxtaposition of the verses teaches that the water referred to in verse 38 includes even the types of water in verse 36, and although these pools of water can render an impure item pure, they also render food items susceptible to impurity. This is an example of how one verse can shed light on another.</i><br>Shimon bar Abba [said] in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: The words of the scribes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">128</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Oral Law transmitted by the Sages, as well as rabbinic ordinancs.</i> are as dear as matters of Torah. What is the reason? “Your palate is like fine wine” (Song of Songs 7:10).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The palate represents that which is stated by the Sages, while wine represents what emerges directly from the grape, a metaphor for the written Torah.</i> The scholars [said] in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: The words of the scribes are dearer than matters of Torah, as it is stated: “Your palate is like fine wine.”<br>One who says there are no phylacteries, which contradicts matters of Torah, is exempt;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One who denies the existence of the commandment to don phylacteries does not assume the status of a rebellious elder, as one who disputes matters written explicitly in the Torah is not considered an elder.</i> [one who says they have] five compartments, which adds to the words of the scribes, is liable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The head phylactery has four compartments, each with a small scroll upon which a passage from the Torah is written. This is part of the Oral Law given to Moses at Sinai. An elder who claims there are five compartments would attain the status of a rebellious elder, who is executed (see Deuteronomy 17:12). Thus, one who contravenes matters transmitted by the Sages is punished more severely than one who contradicts the Written Torah.</i> <br>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Pazi derived it from this:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">132</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From the following statement, which is from the Mishna (<i>Berakhot</i> 1:3).</i> Rabbi Tarfon said: I was [once] coming on the road and I stopped and reclined to recite <i>Shema</i> in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai. I endangered myself due to armed robbers.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">133</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Tarfon endangered himself by stopping his travels in order to recite <i>Shema</i> in a reclining position, as required by Beit Shammai for the evening <i>Shema</i>. The Sages responded to him that he deserved to lose his life for violating the opinion of Beit Hillel, which does not require reclining for <i>Shema</i>.</i> You see, had he refrained from reciting it, he would have merely violated a positive command. Now that he recited it, he is liable to lose his life; that is: The words of the scribes are dearer than matters of Torah.<br>Rabbi Ḥanina son of Rabbi Ada said in the name of Rabbi Tanḥum bar Aḥa: They are more stringent than matters of Torah and prophecy; it is written: “Do not preach, they preach” (Micah 2:6). This is analogous to a king who sent his officials to the provinces. Regarding one, he wrote: If he shows you my seal and my insignia, trust him, but if not, do not trust him. Regarding the other one, he wrote: Even if he does not show you my seal and my insignia, trust him. So too, regarding prophecy, it is written: “If a prophet will arise in your midst” (Deuteronomy 13:2).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">134</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is only when the truth of his prophecy is proven that the people are commanded to obey him.</i> Regarding words of the scribes, it is written: “On the basis of the Torah that they will instruct you” (Deuteronomy 17:11); “that the Torah will instruct you” is not written here, but rather, “that they will instruct you.” “And the judgment that they will say to you, [you shall do;] you shall not deviate from the matter that they will tell you, right or left” (Deuteronomy 17:11) – [if they tell you that] the right is the right and the left is the left, heed them; and even if they tell you that the right is the left and that the left is the right.",
                "Another matter, “as your love is better than wine”—matters of Torah were analogized to water, to oil, to honey, and to milk. To water, “ho, everyone who is thirsty, go to water” (Isaiah 55:1); just as water [extends] from one end of the earth to the other, as it is written: “To the One who spreads the earth over the water” (Psalms 136:6), so too, Torah, [extends] from one end of the earth to the other, as it is stated: “Its measure is longer than the earth” (Job 11:9). Just as water provides life to the world, as it is stated: “A garden spring, a well of living water” (Song of Songs 4:15), so too, Torah provides life to the world, as it is stated: “They are life for those who find them” (Proverbs 4:22), and it is written: “Go, purchase and eat” (Isaiah 55:1).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This phrase is interpreted as referring to Torah, and comparing it to food, which sustains life.</i> Just as water is from the heavens, as it is stated: “At the sound of his placement of plenteous water in the heavens” (Jeremiah 10:13), so too, Torah is from the heavens, as it is stated: “That I spoke to you from the heavens” (Exodus 20:19). Just as water [rains down] with thunderous sound, as it is stated: “The voice of the Lord is on the water” (Psalms 29:3), so too, the Torah [was given] with thunderous sound, as it is stated: “It was on the third day when it was morning, there was thunder and lightning” (Exodus 19:16). Just as water restores the soul, as it is stated: “God split the hollow that was in Lehi, [and water emerged from it. He drank, and his spirit returned]” (Judges 15:19), so too, Torah: “The Torah of the Lord is complete, restoring the soul” (Psalms 19:8). Just as water purifies a person from impurity, as it is stated: “I will sprinkle pure water upon you, and you will be purified” (Ezekiel 36:25), so too, Torah purifies the impure from his impurity, as it is stated: “The words of the Lord are pure words” (Psalms 12:7). Just as water purifies the body, as it is stated: “He shall immerse his flesh in water [and become pure]” (Leviticus 14:9), so too, Torah purifies the body, as it is stated: “Your saying is extremely pure” (Psalms 119:140).<br>Just as water covers the nakedness of the sea, as it is stated: “As the water covers the seabed” (Isaiah 11:9), so too, Torah covers the nakedness of Israel, as it is stated: “Love covers all transgressions” (Proverbs 10:12). <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">136</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Torah renders those who engage in it beloved to God.</i> Just as water descends drop by drop but becomes streams upon streams, so too, Torah, a person studies two <i>halakhot</i> today and two tomorrow, until he becomes a flowing stream. Just as water, if a person is not thirsty, it is not pleasant for his body, so too, Torah, if one does not exhaust himself [in its study], it is not pleasant for his body. Just as water forsakes an elevated place and goes to a low place, so too, Torah forsakes one who is arrogant and cleaves to one who is self-effacing. Just as water is not preserved in vessels of silver and gold, but rather, in the lowliest of the vessels, so too, Torah is preserved only in one who renders himself like an earthenware vessel. Just as regarding water, a great man is not ashamed to say to his inferior: ‘Give me water to drink,’ so too, in matters of Torah, a great man is not ashamed to say to his inferior: ‘Teach me one chapter, one matter, one verse, or even one letter.’ Just as water, when a person does not know how to sail on it, he will ultimately capsize, so too, in matters of Torah, if a person does not know how to navigate them and to issue rulings in them, ultimately, he will capsize.<br>Rabbi Ḥanina of Caesarea said: Just as water is drawn to gardens, orchards, lavatories, and bathhouses, could it be that the same is true of matters of Torah? The verse states: “For the ways of the Lord are straight” (Hosea 14:10). Rabbi Ḥama bar Ukva said: Just as water causes the plants to grow, so too, matters of Torah cause anyone who exerts himself sufficiently in their study to grow.<br>If so, just as water becomes spoiled and foul in the jug, is the same true regarding matters of Torah? The verse states: “[better than] wine”—just as wine, the longer it ages in the jug it improves, so too matters of Torah, the longer they age in the body of a person, the greater they become. If so, just as water is not recognizable in the body, is the same true regarding matters of Torah? The verse states: “Wine”—just as wine is recognizable in the body, so too, matters of Torah are recognizable in the body. [People] motion, point, and say: ‘This is a Torah scholar.’ If so, just as water does not cause the heart to rejoice, is the same true of matters of Torah? The verse states: “Wine”—just as wine causes the heart to rejoice, as it is stated: “Wine will cause the heart of a person to rejoice” (Psalms 104:15), so too, matters of Torah cause the heart to rejoice, as it is stated: “The precepts of the Lord are upright, causing the heart to rejoice” (Psalms 19:9).<br>If so, just as wine is sometimes harmful to the head and the body, is the same true regarding matters of Torah? The verse states “oil” (Song of Songs 1:3) just as oil is pleasant for the head and the body, so too, matters of Torah are pleasant for the head and the body, as it is stated: “Your word is a lamp to my feet” (Psalms 119:105). If so, just as oil is bitter at its outset and sweet at its culmination, is the same true regarding matters of Torah? The verse states: “Honey and milk” (Song of Songs 4:11); just as they are sweet, so too, matters of Torah are sweet, as it is stated: “Sweeter than honey” (Psalms 19:11). If so, just as honey has waste,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">137</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a reference to the wax of the honeycomb, and to the elements that are found mixed in with honey before it is purified.</i> is the same true regarding matters of Torah? The verse states: “Milk,” just as milk is pure, so too, matters of Torah are pure, as it is written: “Gold and glass cannot equal it” (Job 28:17). If so, just as milk is bland, is the same true regarding matters of Torah? The verse states: “Honey and milk.” Just as honey and milk when they are mixed do not harm the body, so it is with matters of Torah, as it is stated: “It will be healing for your navel” (Proverbs 3:8), “as they are life for those who find them” (Proverbs 4:22).<br>Another matter, “as your love is better,” these are the patriarchs; “than wine,” these are the princes.<br>Alternatively, “as your love is better,” these are the offerings; “than wine,” these are the libations. Rabbi Ḥanina said: Had Moses known how beloved the offerings would be when the Israelites performed that deed,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">138</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The sin of the Golden Calf.</i> he would have sacrificed all the offerings in the Torah. Instead, he ran to the merit of the patriarchs, as it is stated: “Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob your servants” (Exodus 32:13).<br>Another matter, “as your love is better,” these are the Jewish people; “than wine [<i>yayin</i>],” these are the gentiles; <i>yod</i>, ten, <i>yod</i>, ten, <i>nun</i>, fifty, the seventy nations,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">139</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The numerical value of <i>yod</i> is ten and of <i>nun</i> is fifty, such that the numerical value of the word <i>yayin</i> (<i>yod-yod-nun</i>) is seventy, which corresponds to the seventy nations of the world.</i> to teach you that Israel is more beloved to the Holy One blessed be He than all the nations."

Rabbi Yehoshua says: If all the seas were ink, the swamps were quills, the heavens and the earth were sheets of parchment, and all people were scribes, they would not suffice to write the matters of Torah that I have learned, and I culled only the equivalent of one who dips the tip of his quill, like a brush, in the sea. Rabbi Akiva says: I do not have the ability to say what my teachers said; rather, my teachers culled from it, but I did not cull from it, but rather, like one who smells a citron. The one who smells enjoys, but the citron is not lacking. And like one who fills from an aqueduct and like one who lights from a lamp to a lamp.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">142</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In all of these cases, one gains from the original item without taking anything noticeable from it. In the metaphors of Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua, they compared what they had learned to one who actually takes a miniscule amount of substance from the source.</i> <br>One time, Rabbi Akiva tarried in his arrival at the study hall. He arrived and sat outside. A question was asked: Is this the <i>halakha</i>? They said: ‘The <i>halakha</i> is outside.’ Again a question was asked. They said: ‘Torah is outside.’ Again a question was asked. They said: ‘Akiva is outside, make room for him.’ He came and sat before the feet of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Eliezer’s study hall was configured like an oblong arena, and there was one stone there that was designated for him [Rabbi Eliezer] to sit upon. One time Rabbi Yehoshua entered and began kissing that stone. He said: ‘This stone is like Mount Sinai and the one who sits on it is like the Ark of the Covenant.’",
                "Another matter, “by the fragrance of your good oils,” Rabbi Aḥa [said] in the name of Rabbi Tanḥum ben Rabbi Ḥiyya: There are two oils, the oil of priesthood and the oil of kingship.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">143</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The plural term oils in the verse refers to these two positions. Kings and High Priests were anointed with special oil during their inaugurations.</i> The Rabbis say: There are two Torahs, the written Torah and the Oral Torah.<br>Rabbi Yudan said: “Your name is like poured oil [<i>shemen</i>],” oil improves on anyone who engages in the greatness [<i>shamna</i>] of the Torah. This is [consistent with another] opinion of Rabbi Yudan, who said: “The yoke will be broken due to the oil” (Isaiah 10:27). The yoke of Sennacheribwas broken due to Hezekiah and his associates, who were engaged in the greatness of Torah.<br>Another matter, “your name is like poured oil,” just as this oil is bitter at its outset and sweet at its culmination, so too, “your beginning may be small, but your end will soar very high” (Job 8:7). Just as this oil improves only by means of crushing, so too, Israel repents only by means of crushing. Just as this oil does not mix with other liquids, so too, Israel, does not intermingle with the nations of the world, as it is written: “You shall not marry them” (Deuteronomy 7:3). Just as this oil, a full cup does not cause a drip like other liquids, so too, matters of Torah do not dislodge matters of cynicism.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">144</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If a drop of oil falls into a full cup of a different liquid, since the oil floats to the top, it is the oil that overflows rather than the other liquid. Similarly, if one’s heart is full of cynicism and one hears words of Torah, the Torah will not penetrate (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>).</i> Just as this oil, when you have a cupful of oil in your hand and a drop of water falls into it, a corresponding drop of oil is dislodged, so too, if a matter of Torah enters the heart a corresponding matter of cynicism is dislodged, and if a matter of cynicism enters the heart,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the case if one’s heart has some cynicism, but is not saturated with cynicism.</i> a corresponding matter of Torah is dislodged. Just as this oil brings light to the world, so too, Israel is light for the world, as it is stated: “The nations will walk by your light” (Isaiah 60:3). Just as this oil is superior to all liquids, so too, Israel is superior to all nations, as it is stated: “The Lord your God will place you supreme” (Deuteronomy 28:1).

                "Rabbi Yoḥanan interpreted the verse regarding Abraham our patriarch. When the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Go you from your land, from your birthplace” (Genesis 12:1), to what was it analogous? To a flask of balsam oil that was placed in one corner and its fragrance did not diffuse. One came and moved it from its place and its fragrance diffused. So, too, the Holy One blessed be He said to Abraham: ‘Abraham, you have many good deeds, you have many mitzvot, move yourself around in the world and your name will be exalted in the world.’ “Go, you,” what is written thereafter? “I will render you a great nation” (Genesis 12:2).<br>“Therefore, young women love you.” The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Here are many young women,’ as it is written: “Abram took Sarai his wife, Lot his nephew, all the property that they acquired, and the souls that they made in Ḥaran” (Genesis 12:5).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">149</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The allusion to young women is derived from “the souls that they made in Haran.”</i> But is it not so, that if the whole world were to gather to create a single mosquito, they would be unable to create it? Rather, these are the proselytes that Abraham and Sarah proselytized.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">150</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference to souls alludes to the fact that Abraham and Sarah proselytized both men and women.</i> That is why it is stated: “And the souls that they made in Ḥaran.” Rabbi Ḥonya said: Abraham would proselytize the men and Sarah, the women. Why does the verse state: “That they made in Ḥaran”? It teaches that Abraham our patriarch would bring them into his house, feed them, give them drink, befriend them, and draw them near under the wings of the Divine Presence. You learn that anyone who brings a single person into the midst of the wings of the Divine Presence, the verse ascribes to him as though he created him, formed him, and molded him.<br>Rabbi Berekhya said: Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, from the fact that You bring light to the world, Your name is exalted in the world. What is the light? It is salvation, as when You bring us light, many proselytes come and convert and join us, such as Yitro and Raḥav. Yitro heard and came; Raḥav heard and came.’ Rabbi Ḥanina said: When the Holy One blessed be He performed a miracle for Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya, many proselytes converted, as it is written: “For upon his seeing his children, My handiwork, in his midst, they will sanctify My name” (Isaiah 29:23). What is written thereafter? “Those of misguided spirit will gain understanding” (Isaiah 29:24).<br>Another matter, “therefore, the young women love you,”because You gave us the plunder of Egypt, the plunder of the sea, the plunder of Siḥon and Og, and the plunder of the thirty-one kings. Alternatively, “therefore, the young women [<i>alamot</i>] love you,” because You obscured [<i>shehe’elamta</i>] from them the day of death and the day of consolation, they love You. Alternatively, “therefore, the young women love you,” with youthfullness and alacrity. Alternatively, “therefore, the young women love you,” these are the penitents. Alternatively, “therefore, the young women love you,” this is the third group, as it is stated: “I will bring the third through the fire, and I will refine them like the refining of [silver]” (Zechariah 13:9). Alternatively, “therefore, the young women love you,” these are the proselytes; that is what is written: “Lord, I heard Your renown; I was afraid, Lord; your deeds are in the midst of the years…” (Habakkuk 3:2). Alternatively, “therefore, the young women love you,” this is the generation of persecution, as it is stated: “For we are killed all day long for You; we are considered as sheep for slaughter” (Psalms 44:23).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">151</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Accordingly, the term young maidens [<i>alamot</i>] is related to <i>al mut</i>, beyond death.</i> Alternatively, “therefore, the young women love you,” this is Israel, as it is stated: “Rather, it is from the Lord’s love of you, and from His observance of the oath…” (Deuteronomy 7:8).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">152</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This verse states that God loves Israel, not that Israel loves God. The midrash may be citing this verse as an introduction to the following one, which states that God “keeps covenant and mercy with those that love him” (Deuteronomy 7:9), indicating that Israel loves God (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Alternatively, “therefore, the young women love you,” because you obscured from them the reward of the righteous.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">153</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Therefore, when they perform mitzvot, it is an expression of love of God, rather than in order to receive reward (<i>Yefei Kol</i>).</i> <br>As Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Ḥelbo said: The Holy One blessed be He is destined to render Himself the head of the circle for the righteous in the future. What is the reason? “Direct your heart to its ramparts [<i>leḥeila</i>]” (Psalms 48:14); a circle [<i>leḥola</i>] is written,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">154</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In fact, the word is written <i>leḥeila</i>, and its spelling cannot be vocalized <i>leḥola</i>. It is possible that the point of the midrash is that the more common construct of this word would be <i>leḥeilah</i>, or even <i>leḥomatah</i>. The fact that it is written <i>leḥeila</i> is in order to hint to the similar word, <i>leḥola</i> (see <i>Etz Yosef</i>; <i>Midrash Hamevoar</i>).</i> righteous on this side and righteous on that side, and the Holy One blessed be He in the middle of them, and they youthfully dance before Him in circles, and indicate to each other with a finger and say: “For this is God, our God, forever and ever. He will lead us beyond death” (Psalms 48:15). In two worlds He will lead us, in this world and in the World to Come.<br>Another matter, “He will lead us beyond death [<i>al mut</i>],” with youth [<i>alemut</i>] and alacrity. Alternatively, “beyond death [<i>al mut</i>],” like those young women, as it is stated: “Amid the drumming young women [<i>alamot</i>]” (Psalms 68:26). Alternatively, “beyond death [<i>al mut</i>],” Akilas translated: <i>Athanasia</i>, a world in which there is no death, and [people] motion to each other with a finger and say: “For this is God, our God, forever and ever. He will lead us beyond death.” In two worlds He will lead us, in this world and in the World to Come. In this world, as it is written: “For the Lord your God has blessed you” (Deuteronomy 15:6),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">155</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This verse appears in a passage that describes God leading Israel through the wilderness.</i> and in the World to Come, as it is written: “The Lord will lead you always” (Isaiah 58:11)."

Rather, bring Me good guarantors that you will observe it, and I will give it to you.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">156</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash is expounding on the term “draw me [<i>moshkheni</i>],” which is related to the term collateral [<i>mashkon</i>], or “take collateral from me [<i>mashkeni</i>].”</i> They said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, our ancestors will be guarantors for us.’ He said to them: ‘Your ancestors need guarantors.’ To what is this matter analogous? It is to one who went to borrow from the king. [The king] said to him: ‘Bring me a guarantor and I will lend to you.’ He went and brought him a guarantor. [The king] said to him: ‘Your guarantor needs a guarantor.’ He went and brought him a second guarantor. [The king] said to him: ‘Your guarantor requires a guarantor.’ Once he brought him a third guarantor, he said: ‘Know that because of this, I am lending to you.’ So, too, when the Israelites stood to receive the Torah, He said to them: ‘Bring Me good guarantors that you will observe it, and I will give it to you.’ They said before him: ‘Master of the universe, our ancestors are guaranteeing for us.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘I have [claims against] your ancestors.

And it is written: “Like foxes among the ruins, so are your prophets, Israel” (Ezekiel 13:4). Rather, bring me effective guarantors and I will give it to you.’ They said: ‘Our children are guaranteeing for us.’ The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘They are certainly good guarantors, I will give it to you on their account.’ That is what is written: “From the mouths of infants and sucklings You founded strength” (Psalms 8:3), and strength means only Torah, as it is stated: “The Lord will give strength to His people (Psalms 29:11). When payment is demanded from the borrower, but he lacks resources to pay, who is apprehended? It is the guarantor. That is what is stated: “You forgot the Torah of your God; I, too, will forget your children” (Hosea 4:6). Rabbi Aḥa said: “I, too,” [means that] as it were, I, too, am subject to forgetfulness. Who will say at the [reading of the] Torah before Me: Bless the blessed Lord? Is it not the sucklings?

That is at night; in the morning, from where is it derived? “In the morning light they perform it, for it is in their power” (Micah 2:1). From them, no remnant remained, but from these, a remnant remained;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">162</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Generation of the Flood sinned only during the day and there were no survivors, while the Ten Tribes sinned night and day, and there were survivors.</i> by what merit? Rabbi Yitzḥak interpreted it to their credit, [as] Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] said: It was by the merit of, “behold a remnant remained in it, [who are brought forth]” (Ezekiel 14:22), “who bring forth” is not written here, but rather, “who are brought forth.” [This teaches that a remnant remained] in the merit of the righteous men and the righteous women, the prophets and the prophetesses, who would emerge from them.<br>Rabbi Ḥanina said: A statement was made regarding the coastal cities that was not stated regarding the Generation of the Flood: “Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast, the nation of the Keretim” (Zephaniah 2:5)—a nation that is liable to be punished with <i>karet</i>. By whose merit were they rescued? It was by the merit of one God-fearing person whom they produced each and every year. Rabbi Levi interpreted it to their credit: “Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast, the nation of the Keretim”—a nation that established [<i>karat</i>] a covenant,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">163</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is an allusion to the fact that some members of this nation converted and fulfilled the covenant of circumcision. This merit prevented the destruction of the nation at that time, but the punishment was only temporarily averted (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> as it is stated: “He established [<i>vekharot</i>] a covenant with him” (Nehemiah 9:8).<br>Rabbi Yehoshua bar Nehemiah said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: A statement was made regarding the tribes of Judah and Benjamin that was not stated regarding the Sodomites. Regarding the Sodomites it is written: “Their sin is very weighty” (Genesis 18:20), but regarding the tribes of Judah and Benjamin it is written: “He said to me: The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is very very great” (Ezekiel 9:9). Rabbi Tanḥuma said: We have another verse: “The iniquity of the daughter of my people exceeded [the sin of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment, and no hands seized it]” (Lamentations 4:6). Rabbi Tanḥuma said: One hand did not seize another, they did not extend their hands to perform mitzvot; but these extended their hands to perform mitzvot.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">164</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Tanḥuma explains why Sodom was overthrown in a moment whereas the tribes of Judah and Benjamin were not, despite the fact that their sins were greater than those of Sodom. The Sodomites did not extend their hands to assist one another or perform mitzvot, whereas the tribes of Judah and Benjamin did.</i> “The hands of merciful women [cooked their children, they were food for them]\" (Lamentations 4:10). Why [did they act] in such a way? It was because they provided “food [<i>levarot</i>] for them in the disaster of the daughter of my people”<b> </b>(Lamentations 4:10).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">165</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash interprets the verse in Lamentations to mean the starving people of Jerusalem would give the small amount of food they had to others in order to attempt to console [<i>lehavrot</i>] them for the loss of family members. The reference to cooking their children is understood allegorically in the sense that they deprived them of food in order to console others. Thus, the verse states that the merciful women deprived their own children of food. Why did they act in such a way? In order to attempt to console others.</i>",

Rabbi Avun said: [This is analogous] to a king who grew angry at a noblewoman and incited wicked neighbors against her, and she began shouting: ‘My lord the king, rescue me!’ So too regarding Israel, “Sidonites, Amalek, <and Maon oppressed you> and you called to Me and I rescued you from their hand” (Judges 10:12).<br>Another matter, “draw me [<i>moshkheni</i>]; we will run after you,” You endanger me [<i>maskineni</i>], so we will run after You.

When people experience economic distress, that can cause them to repent.</i> like what Rabbi Akiva said: Poverty is appropriate for the daughter of Jacob like a [decorative] red strap on the neck of a white horse. Alternatively, “draw me [<i>moshkheni</i>]; we will run after you,” from the collateral that You have taken from me [<i>mashkineni</i>], we will run after You. From the great collateral that you have taken from me, we will run after You, as Rabbi Menaḥama said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: It is written: “We have done injury [<i>ḥavol ḥavalnu</i>] to you” (Nehemiah 1:7), this is the first destruction and the second destruction, that were taken as collateral due only because of us.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">168</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference here is to the destruction of the two Temples. The Temple is presented as something great that was taken as collateral in the sense that it was taken due to the debt generated by the sins of Israel. The trauma of destruction can cause people to repent.</i> <br>Rabbi Berekhya [said] in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Ilai: It is written: “Moses led Israel [from the Red Sea]” (Exodus 15:22); he led them away from the sin at the sea.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">169</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They sinned at the sea by complaining against God and Moses before the splitting of the sea (see <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 21:10) or by carrying an idol with them (see <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 24:1–3).</i> They said to him: ‘Moses our master, to where are you leading us?’ He said to them: ‘To Eilim, from Eilim to Alush, from Alush to Mara, from Mara to Refidim, and from Refidim to Sinai.’ They said: ‘To wherever you go and lead us, we are with you.’ This is analogous to one who went and married a woman from a village. He said to her: ‘Arise and come with me.’ She said to him: ‘From here to where?’ He said to her: ‘From here to Tiberias, and from there to Burseki, from Burseki to the upper marketplace, and from there to the lower marketplace.’ She said to him: ‘To wherever you go and take me, I will go with you.’ So too, Israel said: “My soul cleaves after You” (Psalms 63:9). Rabbi Yosei bar Ika said: The verse proclaims and says: “Draw me; we will run after you,”—if to Bible, to Bible; if to Mishna, to Mishna; if to Talmud, to Talmud; if to <i>Tosefta</i>, to <i>Tosefta</i>; if to <i>aggada</i>, to <i>aggada</i>.",

In the merit of their saying: “Everything that the Lord had said, we will perform and we will heed” (Exodus 24:7), He immediately revealed it to them. Rabbi Berekhya said: It is written: “He told you His covenant [<i>berito</i>]” (Deuteronomy 4:13); He told you the book of Genesis, which is the beginning of the creation [<i>beriyato</i>] of the world. “That He commanded you to perform, the ten precepts” (Deuteronomy 4:13), these are the Ten Commandments, ten for the Bible and ten for the Talmud.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">173</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ten Commandments are to be understood as they are written, and are also to be expounded in the manner of Talmudic analysis.</i> From where, then, will Elihu ben Berekhel the Buzite<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">174</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One of Job’s friends (see Job 32:2).</i> come and reveal to Israel the secrets of [<i>ḥadrei</i>] Behemoth and Leviathan,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">175</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some suggest that the text of the midrash should be emended.

Rabbi Akiva said to him: ‘Enough, Papis, one may not challenge the words of the One who spoke and the world came into being, because everything is true and everything is just,’ as it is written: “I saw the Lord sitting on a high and exalted throne” (Isaiah 6:1). Rabbi Simon said: It is a throne that distinguishes between death and life. “And all the host of the heavens attending Him on His right and on His left” (I Kings 22:19). Is there left On High? But is it not all right, as it it is stated: “Your right, Lord, is glorious in power; Your right, Lord, smashes the enemy” (Exodus 15:6)? Why, then, does the verse state: “On His right and on His left”? Rather, these incline to the right and these incline to the left; these advocate exoneration and these advocate condemnation. Rabbi Yoḥanan in the name of Rabbi Aḥa cites it from here: “The truth of the matter and a great host” (Daniel 10:1). One arrives at the truth when it is accomplished with a great host, as it is written: “The Lord God is truth” (Jeremiah 10:10). What is truth? Rabbi Aivun said: That He is the living God and King of the universe.<br>Rabbi Elazar said: Anywhere that it is stated: “And the Lord,” it is He and His court. The paradigm of them all [is the verse]: “And the Lord has spoken evil in your regard” (I Kings 22:23).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">236</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This verse is the culmination of a passage in which the prophet Mikhaihu, speaking to King Ahab, begins: “I saw the Lord sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right and on His left” (I Kings 22:19).</i> That is the paradigm of them all. How, then, does Rabbi Elazar interpret that verse of Rabbi Papis: “He is of one mind, and who can respond to Him”? Rather, He alone seals the verdict for all creatures and no being seals it with Him. What is the seal of the Holy One blessed be He? Rabbi Beivai said in the name of Rabbi Reuven: Truth, as it is stated: “However, I will tell you what is inscribed in the writ of truth” (Daniel 10:21). If truth, why inscribed, and if inscribed, why truth?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">237</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The implication of “truth” is that it is indelible, while the implication of “inscribed” is that it can be erased.</i> Rather, until the ruling is signed, it is “inscribed”; once the ruling is signed, it is “truth.”<br>Reish Lakish said: Why is it “truth [<i>emet</i>]”? <i>Alef</i> is the first of the letters, <i>mem</i> is in the middle, and <i>tav</i> is at their end; this is to say: “I am first and I am last and aside from Me there is no God” (Isaiah 44:6). “I am first,” as I did not receive My kingdom from another. “And I am last,” as I will not transfer it to another, as there is none [other] in the world. “And aside from Me there is no God,” as there is no second to Me.",
                "Rabbi Papis expounded: “Behold, the man has become like one [<i>ke’aḥad</i>] of us” (Genesis 3:22), like the Unique One [<i>keyeḥido</i>] of the world. Rabbi Akiva said to him: ‘Enough, Papis.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">238</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One cannot suggest a parallel between any being and God.</i> He said to [Rabbi Akiva]: ‘How do you interpret [the phrase] “has become like one of us”?’ [Rabbi Akiva] said to him: ‘Like one of the ministering angels.’ The Rabbis say: It is neither in accordance with the statement of this one, nor in accordance with the statement of that one, but rather it teaches that the Holy One blessed be He presented two paths before him, the path of life and the path of death. He [Adam] chose the path of death and forsook the path of life.",
                "Rabbi Papis expounded: “They exchanged their glory for the cast image of a [grass-eating] bull” (Psalms 106:20). I might understand that it was the heavenly bull;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">239</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is one of the four beasts that draw the Divine Chariot.</i> the verse [therefore] states: “Grass-eating.” Rabbi Akiva said to him: ‘Enough, Papis.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">240</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Were that the meaning, it would have been sufficient to write “an eating bull.”</i> He said to [Rabbi Akiva]: ‘And how do you interpret [the phrase]: “they exchanged their glory for the cast image of a [grass-eating] bull”?’ [Rabbi Akiva answered: ‘Perhaps it is a bull typical] of the rest of the days of the year?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">241</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Perhaps it was an image of a bull when it is clean and nice looking.</i> The verse states “grass-eating,” you do not have anything as repugnant and repulsive as a bull when it is eating grass.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">242</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is because the bull drools a lot while eating.</i> Rabbi Yudan says in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: The Egyptian magicians performed sorcery for them and it appeared to be undulating [<i>meratet</i>] before them, just as you say: “Damascus has weakened. It turned to flee but was seized with trembling [<i>retet</i>]” (Jeremiah 49:24).",
                "Rabbi Papis expounded: “To a mare [<i>lesusati</i>] in Pharaoh's chariots”—<i>lesisati</i> is written.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">243</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>lesusati</i> is written without a<i> vav</i> such that it can also be read <i>lesisati</i>.</i> The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Just as I was gladdened [<i>sasti</i>] to eliminate the Egyptians at the sea, so I would have been gladdened to eliminate the enemies of Israel.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">244</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The “enemies of Israel” is used here as a euphemism for the people of Israel themselves.</i> Who caused them to be saved? “On their right and on their left” (Exodus 14:22); due to the merit of the Torah thay they were destined to receive from the right of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “From His right, a fiery law to them” (Deuteronomy 33:2). “And on their left,” this is <i>mezuza</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">245</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>mezuza</i> is situated to the left of the door when one is leaving the house. They were saved partially in the merit of their future fulfillment of the mitzva of<i> mezuza</i>.</i> Alternatively, on their right, this is reciting <i>Shema</i>, “and on their left,” this is [the <i>Amida</i>] prayer.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">246</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Like the right, reciting <i>Shema</i> is superior because in it one does not request fulfillment of his own needs. By contrast, in the <i>Amida</i> prayer we request fulfillment of our own needs. This is exemplified in the verse: “Length of days is on its right; on its left is wealth and honor” (Proverbs 3:16) (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>).</i> Rabbi Akiva said to him: ‘Enough, Papis. Every place that gladness [<i>sisa</i>] is stated, it is written with a <i>sin</i>, and here with a <i>samekh</i>.’ He said to [Rabbi Akiva]: ‘How do you interpret [the phrase] “to a mare in Pharaoh's chariots”?’ [Rabbi Akiva answered:] ‘Pharaoh mounted a stallion, and the Holy One blessed be He, as it were, revealed Himself on a stallion. That is what is written: “He mounted a cherub and flew” (Psalms 18:11). Pharaoh said: ‘A stallion kills its owners in war;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">247</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is because its conduct is more aggressive.</i> rather, I will ride on a mare.’ That is what is written: “To a mare in Pharaoh's chariots.” Pharaoh then rode on a red horse, on a white horse, or on a black one. As it were, the Holy One blessed be He revealed Himself on a red, white, and black horse. That is what is written: “You trampled in the sea with Your horses” (Habakkuk 3:15), interchanging horses.<br>The wicked Pharaoh emerged with armor and a helmet; as it were, the same is true of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated; “He donned righteousness like armor [and a helmet of salvation on His head]” (Isaiah 59:17). [Pharaoh] brought naphtha;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">248</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A flammable liquid, which he brought in order to use in battle.</i> as it were, the same is true of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “Hail and coals of fire passed through His clouds” (Psalms 18:13). [Pharaoh] brought catapult stones; as it were, the same is true of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “And the Lord provided thunder and hail” (Exodus 9:23). [Pharaoh brought] swords and spears; as it were, the same is true of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “Many bolts of lightning” (Psalms 18:15). [Pharaoh] brought arrows; as it were, the same is true of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “He shot His arrows” (Psalms 18:15). Rabbi Levi said: “He shot his arrows and dispersed them” (Psalms 18:15) [teaches] that the arrows would scatter them; “many bolts of lightning and they confounded them” (Psalms 18:15) teaches that they would confuse them and confound them. He removed their banners<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">249</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Without the banners, the formation of their camp disintegrated.</i> and they did not know what they were doing.<br>Pharaoh emerged in full armor; as it were, the same is true of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “The Lord will emerge like a mighty man” (Isaiah 42:13). [Pharaoh] thundered with his voice; as it were, the same is true of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “The Lord would thunder from the heavens” (II Samuel 22:14). [Pharaoh] heartened them [his soldiers] with his voice; as it were, [the same is true of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated]: The Most High would project His voice” (II Samuel 22:14). Pharaoh emerged with fury; as it were, [the same is true of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated:] “With fury You trod the earth” (Habakkuk 3:12). [Pharaoh emerged] with a bow; as it were, [the same is true of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated:] “Your bow will be bared” (Habakkuk 3:9). [Pharaoh emerged] with shield and armor; as it were, [the same is true of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated:] “Grasp Your shield and armor” (Psalms 35:2). [Pharaoh emerged] with a flashing spear; as it were, [the same is true of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated:] “The glow of the flash of Your spear” (Habakkuk 3:11).<br>Rabbi Berekhya [said] in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: When Paharaoh exhausted all his weapons, the Holy One blessed be He began exalting over him. He said to him: ‘Wicked one, do you have wind, do you have a cherub, do you have wings?’ From where did the Holy One blessed be He cause them to fly [to the sea]? Rabbi Yudan said: The Holy One blessed be He removed them from between the wheels of the Divine Chariot and flew them at the sea. Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said: One who is flesh and blood rides upon something that carries him, and it is an item that has substance; however, the Holy One blessed be He is not so; He carries what He rides upon, and He rides upon an item that has no substance. That is what is written: “He mounted a cherub and flew, and He soared on wings of wind” (Psalms 18:11).<br>One verse says: “He soared [on wings of wind]” and one verse says: “He was seen on wings of wind” (II Samuel 22:11). In what sense can both verses be reconciled? Rabbi Aḥa said: From here [it may be derived] that the Holy One blessed be He has had many worlds and He emerges to be seen in them.",
                "“I have likened you [<i>dimitikh</i>], my love,” Rabbi Eliezer said: [This is analogous] to a princess who was taken captive and her father was about to redeem her. She was motioning to her captors and saying to them: ‘I am for you, I am yours, and I will follow you.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">250</sup><i class=\"footnote\">She said this out of fear of what they might do to her if her father was unable to redeem her.</i> Her father said to her: ‘Do you believe that I do not have the wherewithal to redeem you? I am silencing you [<i>duma dimitikh</i>], be silent.’ So too, when the Israelites were encamped at the sea: “Egypt pursued them and overtook them encamped by the sea” (Exodus 14:9). The Israelites, in their fear, were motioning to the Egyptians and saying to them: ‘We are for you, we are yours, and we will follow you.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘Do you believe that I do not have the wherewithal to redeem you? I am silencing you [<i>duma dimitikh</i>], I have silenced you.’ That is what is written: “The Lord will wage war for you and you shall be silent” (Exodus 14:14).",
                "Another matter, “I have likened you [<i>dimitikh</i>], my love,” the Rabbis say: Because Israel appeared like mares, and [the horses of] the wicked Egyptians were aroused stallions, and they were pursuing them until they sank in the sea. Rabbi Simon said: Heaven forbid, Israel did not appear like mares, but rather the waves of the sea appeared like mares and [the horses of] the wicked Egyptians were aroused stallions, and they pursued them until they sank them in the sea. The Egyptian would say to his horse: ‘Yesterday, I would drag you to the Nile and you would not follow me, and now, you are sinking me in the sea?’ The horse would say to its rider: “He cast into the sea [<i>rama bayam</i>]” (Exodus 15:1); see what is in the sea [<i>re’eh ma bayam</i>]. A trap is prepared for you in the sea. Rabbi Yishmael taught: “The Lord overthrew Egypt in the midst of the sea” (Exodus 14:27); it teaches that the horse would cast its rider upward and he would descend downward with the horse above him. Rabbi Levi said: Like one who stirs a pot; what is below rises to the top and what is above descends below.<br>“My love [<i>rayati</i>]”—what is <i>rayati</i>? Rabbi Yonatan said: My benefactor; it is they who provide for Me two daily continual offerings. That is what is written: “The one lamb you shall offer in the morning” (Numbers 28:4), as Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: Israel would sacrifice two continual offerings each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. The one in the morning was sacrificed for transgressions that were performed at night, and the one in the afternoon was sacrificed for transgressions that were performed during the day. There was, then, no person in Jerusalem who would remain overnight with iniquity ascribed to him, as it is stated: “Righteousness would dwell there” (Isaiah 1:21).<br>Another matter, “I have likened you, my love [<i>rayati</i>]”—the shepherds [<i>rayata</i>] of My world, as you accepted the Torah. Had you not accepted it, I would have restored My world to emptiness and disorder, as Rabbi Ḥanina said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: It is written: “The earth and all its inhabitants melt away; I set its pillars firm, Selah” (Psalms 75:4). Had Israel not stood at Mount Sinai and said: “Everything that the Lord has spoken we will perform and we will obey” (Exodus 24:7), the world would have melted away and returned to emptiness and disorder. Who firmly established the world? “I [<i>anokhi</i>] set its pillars firm, Selah.” Due to the merit of “I [<i>anokhi</i>] am the Lord your God” (Exodus 20:2),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">251</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Due to the fact that Israel accepted the Torah, represented by the first of the Ten Commandments, “I am the Lord your God,” God set the the world on a firm foundation.</i> “I set its pillars firm.”"

Rabbi Aḥa said: Did Aaron have two beards, as it is written: “Descending onto the beard, the beard of Aaron”?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">253</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Why does it say the word beard twice?</i> Rather, when Moses saw the anointing oil descending onto the beard of Aaron, it was comparable for him as though it descended onto the beard of Moses, and he rejoiced; therefore, it is stated: “Onto the beard, the beard of Aaron.”",

He positioned trumpets, horns, and a shofar, the governor of that province awakened them and brought them out to meet the king, and the king walked before them until he reached his palace. So too, the Holy One blessed be He arrived early, as it is stated: “It was on the third day when it was morning,” and it is written: “For on the third day, the Lord will descend before the eyes of the entire people” (Exodus 19:11). Israel slept through that entire night because sleep during [the season of] <i>Shavuot</i> is pleasant and the night is short. Rabbi Yudan said: Not even a flea stung them. The Holy One blessed be He came and found them asleep.

Why “a second time”? From here [it may be derived] that he had circumcised them the first time. Immediately, “Joshua made flint knives for himself, and circumcised the children of Israel at the Hill of the Foreskins” (Joshua 5:3). What is “at the Hill of the Foreskins”?

Rabbi Neḥemya says: Prior to the messianic era, poverty will proliferate, prices will be high, the vine will produce its fruit but the wine will spoil, and the entire monarchy will be transformed to heresy, but there will be no rebuke. Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: The son of David will come only in a generation whose face is like that of a dog. Rabbi Levi said: The son of David will come only in a generation whose face is impudent and which is deserving of elimination. Rabbi Yanai said: If you see generation after generation reviling and blaspheming God, anticipate the footsteps of the messianic king.

To a dove that was fleeing a hawk, entered the crevice of a rock, and encountered a nesting serpent. It was unable to enter, as the serpent was still nesting. It would be unable to reverse its course because the hawk was positioned outside. What did the dove do? It began shrieking and striking itself with its wings so that the owner of the dovecote would come and rescue it. This is what the Israelites were analogous to at the sea. They were unable to descend into the sea because the sea had not yet been split for them. They were unable to reverse their course because Pharaoh was approaching. What did they do? “They were very frightened and the children of Israel cried out to the Lord” (Exodus 14:10). Immediately, “The Lord saved [Israel] on that day” (Exodus 14:30).<br>Rabbi Yehuda [said] in the name of Rabbi Ḥama of the village of Teḥumin: This is analogous to a king who had an only daughter, and he desired to hear her speak [to him]. What did he do? He issued a proclamation and said: The entire people shall emerge to the assembly grounds. When they emerged, what did he do? He signaled to his servants and they suddenly attacked her like bandits. She began screaming: ‘Father, father, save me!’ Similarly, when the Israelites were in Egypt, the Egyptians enslaved them and they began screaming and directing their eyes to the Holy One blessed be He. That is what is written: “It was during those many days, and the king of Egypt died. The children of Israel sighed due to the work and they cried out” (Exodus 2:23). Immediately, “God heard their groaning” (Exodus 2:24). The Holy One blessed be He heard their prayer and took them out with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. The Holy One blessed be He desired to hear their voices, but they were unwilling. What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He hardened Pharaoh’s heart and he pursued them. That is what is written: “The Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued…” (Exodus 14:8), and it is written: “Pharaoh approached” (Exodus 14:10). What is “approached [<i>hikriv</i>]”? He brought Israel closer [<i>hikriv</i>] to repentance. When they saw [Pharaoh and his army], they directed their sights to the Holy One blessed be He, and they cried out before Him, as it is stated: “The children of Israel raised their eyes and, behold, the Egyptians were traveling after them and they were very frightened; the children of Israel cried out to the Lord” (Exodus 14:10) with the same cry that they cried out in Egypt. Once the Holy One blessed be He heard, He said: ‘Had I not done so to you, I would not have heard your voice.’ Regarding that moment, He said: “My dove, in the clefts of the rock.” “Let me hear a voice,” is not written here, but rather, “your voice,” the voice that I heard in Egypt.

The Sages identified Edom with Rome.</i> Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: This is analogous to a province that would produce great swordsmen for the king. There was a certain woman there who gave birth to a puny son, and she would call her son: Tall and Quick. She said to them: ‘My son is tall and quick and you do not make him a great swordsman?’ They said to her: ‘If, in your eyes, he is tall and quick, in our eyes he is puniest of the puny.’ So too, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘This wicked Esau, his father called him great [<i>gadol</i>],’ as it is stated: “He called Esau, his elder [<i>hagadol</i>] son” (Genesis 27:1). His mother called him great, as it is stated: “The garments of Esau, her elder [<i>hagadol</i>] son (Genesis 27:15). The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘If, in your eyes, he is great, in My eyes, he is small,’ as it is stated: “Behold, I made you small among the nations” (Obadiah 1:2). And if he is great, the slaughterer corresponds to the bull. That is what is written: “There is a sacrifice for the Lord in Botzra and a great slaughter in the land of Edom” (Isaiah 34:6). “That ruin the vineyards,” this is Israel, as it is written: “For the house of Israel is the vineyard of the Lord of hosts” (Isaiah 5:7). “As our vineyards are in bloom,” just as it says: “There is no cluster to eat, or a first fruit that my soul desires” (Micah 7:1).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">148</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Romans are able to persecute Israel, compared to a vineyard, because the fruits of the vineyard are just beginning to bloom, but there are none that are fully formed yet. This represents the fact that the Jews were not sufficiently righteous.</i> <br>Rabbi Berekhya said: “Little foxes,” these are the four kingdoms, as it is stated: “There are four upon earth that are little” (Proverbs 30:24). “That ruin the vineyards,” this is Israel, as it is written: “For the house of Israel is the vineyard of the Lord of hosts” (Isaiah 5:7). “As our vineyards are in bloom,” who caused our vineyards to be in bloom?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">149</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash should read: What caused our vineyard to be damaged?

He said to me: “Behold you are fair my love” (Song of Songs 4:1), and I said to Him: “Behold, you are fair, my beloved, pleasant too” (Song of Songs 1:16). He said to me: “Happy are you Israel, who is like you?” (Deuteronomy 33:29). I said to Him: “Who is like You among the powers, Lord?” (Exodus 15:11). He said to me: “Who is like Your people Israel, one nation in the land” (I Chronicles 17:21).

What is “great”? Rabbi Ḥama ben Rabbi Ḥanina said: Greater than that of his God. He said to them: ‘Your <i>omer</i>, how was it prepared for sacrifice?’ They said: ‘With thirteen sifters.’ He said to them: ‘But mine is with fourteen sifters.’<br>“My heart is bewildered” (Isaiah 21:4), this is the court, which erred in the calculation of one day.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They erred in the calculation of the end of the Babylonian exile, and were therefore bewildered as to why it had not yet ended.

You should reign before me.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This implies that Media would rule before Persia. According to the extant text of the midrash, this is difficult to understand, as Cyrus the Persian would have been correct in offering Darius the first rule. Apparently the correct version is that Darius offered Cyrus first rule, and Cyrus responded that Darius should rule first based on the order implied in the verse in Daniel (Maharzu).</i> When that wicked one<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Belshatzar.</i> heard, he dispatched and said to his armies: ‘Any nation and kingdom that rebelled against me, we will invade them.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Wicked one, you sent to everyone,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">You sent threats to all the nations who rebelled.</i> did you perhaps send to me?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Did you repent your sins in an attempt to revoke the decree that you will be stripped of your kingdom?</i> By your life, the punishment of that man<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Belshatzar.</i> will not come from anywhere else, but rather from Me.’ That is what is written: “For it is not from the east or the west…but God is the Judge; He humbles this one and elevates that one” (Psalms 75:7–8), He will humble Belshatzar and elevate Cyrus and Darius.<br>Cyrus and Darius were Belshatzar’s gatekeepers. When he heard these verses, he said to them: ‘Anyone whom you see here tonight, even if he says to you: I am the king, remove his head.’ It is not the way of kings to situate their lavatories within their halls, but rather outside their halls. His bowels were loose all that night and he went out and they did not notice him. When he entered, they noticed him. They said to him: ‘Who are you?’ He said to them: ‘I am the king.’ They said to him: ‘Is this not what the king commanded, that anyone whom we see here this night, even if he says to you: I am the king, remove his head?’ What did they do? They took a branch from the candelabrum and pierced his brain. That is what is written: “On that night, Belshatzar the Chaldean king was killed (Daniel 5:30).<br>At what hour was he killed? Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman, Rabbi Elazar said: At the time when sleep begins. Rabbi Shmuel said: When one can distinguish between a wolf and a dog. They do not disagree.

That is what is written: “For a cup is in the hand of the Lord with foaming wine…He pours from it. [But the dregs are sucked, drunk by all the wicked of the earth]” (Psalms 75:9).<br>This is why the prophet mocks and says: “Go down and sit on the dust” (Isaiah 47:1). The punishment fits the crime; just as there: “The elders of the daughter of Zion will sit silently on the ground” (Lamentations 2:10), so here: “Go down and sit on the dust.” Rabbi Ḥunya said: So said Jerusalem to the daughter of Babylon: Old, worn out, repulsive harlot, go down.

That is what is written: “At that time Merodakh Baladan…sent.”<br>What did he write in them? Greetings to Hezekiah, greetings to the great God, greetings to Jerusalem. When the letters had been dispatched he reconsidered and said: ‘I acted improperly. I had the greetings to Hezekiah precede those to his God.’ Immediately, he arose from his throne, took three steps, recalled the letters and wrote other letters in their place. He wrote in them: Greetings to the great God of Hezekiah, greetings to Hezekiah, and greetings to Jerusalem. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘You arose from your throne and took three steps in My honor; by your life, I will establish three cosmopolitan kings from you who will rule from one end of the world to the other.’ These are they: Nebuchadnezzar, Evil Merodakh, and Belshatzar.

Had He not “sent fire into my bones” (Lamentations 1:13), could you have overcome me?

Once she grew and signs of puberty appeared, the king said: ‘It is not befitting my daughter’s honor to speak with me in public; make her a partition, and when I need to speak with her I will speak with her from behind the partition.’ So it is written: “Because Israel is a lad and I loved him,” (Hosea 11:1).

That is what is written: “It shall be, if from the eyes of the congregation” (Numbers 15:24). There are two hundred and forty-eight limbs in a person, and all of them come and go only after the eyes. So too, Israel is unable to do anything without their Sanhedrin. “Doves” – just as this dove is faultless, so too, Israel is pleasant as they walk when they ascend on the occasions of the pilgrimage festivals. Just as the dove is conspicuous, so too, Israel is conspicuous in haircut, circumcision, and ritual fringes. Just as the dove is modest, so too, Israel is modest. Just as a dove extends its neck for slaughter, so too, Israel: “For we are killed for You all day” (Psalms 44:23). Just as the dove atones for evils, so too, Israel atones for the nations, as all the seventy bulls that they sacrifice on the festival [of <i>Sukkot</i>] correspond to the seventy nations, so that the world will not be bereft of them. That is what is written: “In return for my love, they accuse me; but I am all prayer” (Psalms 109:4).<br>Just as the dove, from the time it meets its mate, it does not exchange it for another, so too Israel, from the time they came to know the Holy One blessed be He, they did not exchange Him for another.

Just as the dove, even though you take its fledglings from beneath it, it will never forsake its dovecote, so too Israel, even though the Temple was destroyed, the three annual pilgrimage festivals were not abrogated. Just as the dove produces a new brood each and every month, so too Israel renew for themselves Torah, mitzvot, and good deeds each month. Just as the dove travels far afield and returns to its dovecote, so too Israel; that is what is written: “They will stir like a bird from Egypt” (Hosea 11:11) – this is the generation of the wilderness; “and like a dove from the land of Assyria” (Hosea 11:11) – these are the Ten Tribes. These and those, “I will settle them in their houses, the utterance of the Lord” (Hosea 11:11).<br>Rabbi says: There is a type of dove that they feed it, and its counterparts smell it and come to its dovecote. So too, when an elder sits and teaches, many proselytes convert at that time, such as Yitro, who heard and came, and Raḥav heard and came. So too Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya, many proselytes converted at that time. What is the reason? “When he sees his children” (Isaiah 29:23); what is written thereafter? “Those of misguided spirit will attain understanding” (Isaiah 29:24).<br>Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] was sitting and expounding, and the audience was dozing.

When did the dove bring light to the world? In the days of Noah. That is what is written: “The dove came to him in the evening, and there was an olive leaf plucked in its mouth…” (Genesis 8:11). What is plucked [<i>taraf</i>]? Dead, just as you say: “Joseph has been torn apart [<i>tarof toraf</i>]” (Genesis 37:33).

That is what was stated by Ezekiel: “Son of man, say to it: You are a land that has not been cleansed, that has not been rained upon on the day of fury” (Ezekiel 22:24). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even the upper millstones were dissolved in the water.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This strengthens the question: If the destruction was so great, where did the dove find an olive branch (Maharzu). Alternatively, this supports Rabbi Levi’s answer: Since the destruction was so great, it must be that the olive branch was found in a place that remained unaffected by the Flood (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Rabbi Taryi said: The gates of The Garden of Eden were opened for it, and from there it brought it. Rabbi Aivu said to him: Had it brought it from the Garden of Eden, should it not have brought a quality item such as cinnamon or balsam?

That is what is written: “You shall inform your children, saying: Israel crossed [this Jordan] on dry land” (Joshua 4:22). Rabbi Huna said: Israel the patriarch.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The fact that the verse mentions Israel instead of the more common term for the nation, “children of Israel,” is meant to hint to the fact that they crossed in the merit of Israel, i.e., Jacob.</i> Rabbi Yudan [said] in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: We find in three places, in the Torah, in the Prophets, and in the Writings, that Israel crossed the Jordan due only to the merit of Jacob our patriarch. In the Torah: “For with my staff I crossed this Jordan” (Genesis 32:11); in the Prophets: “You shall inform your children, saying: Israel crossed this Jordan on dry land” (Joshua 4:22) – Israel the patriarch; in the Writings: “What is it, sea, that makes you flee?

Some suggest that the text should read “like a flock of ordered ewes” (Song of Songs 4:2). Rabbi Elazar then states that if this is an allusion to the army that conquered Canaan, they must have been sixty thousand, because if there were more they would not have been “ordered” and organized (<i>Yefei Kol</i>).</i> This is the opinion of Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar said: Every war that involves more than sixty thousand is a war of pandemonium. Rabbi Yehuda said in the name of Ḥizkiya: Wherever it states about ten, about twenty, about thirty, about forty, it is saying either more or less. There it is stated: “About forty thousand, the vanguard of the army” (Joshua 4:13), and here it is stated: “Forty-four thousand seven hundred and sixty” (I Chronicles 5:18).

Which is this? This is the Temple, as it is stated: “You are awesome, God, from Your Temple” (Psalms 68:36). From where does awe emerge? Is it not from the Temple? This is what it says: “You shall observe My Sabbaths and you shall revere My Sanctuary” (Leviticus 26:2) – as it is sanctified in its destruction just as it was sanctified while it was built.

Let the sound come and atone for the sound of evil speech. There was no atonement for one who murders unwittingly, but the Torah designated atonement for it, this is the death of the High Priest, as it stated: “He shall dwell in it until the death of the High Priest” (Numbers 35:25).

An answer slipped the mind of Rabbi Yonatan at that moment and he did not respond to him.

There were two <i>amora’im</i>; one said exile [<i>gola</i>], and one said their Redeemer [<i>go’alah</i>].

What is <i>uvakirkarot</i>? Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda: Like those elders who are unable to ride covered wagons and they carry them on sedan chairs.

By the merit that they recited song at the sea. Rav Naḥman said: By the merit of the faith that Abraham had, as it is stated: “And he believed in the Lord” (Genesis 15:6). Rabbi Ḥelbo said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: It is written: “Israel saw the great power […and they believed in the Lord]” (Exodus 14:31). He was still leading them; could they not believe?

Just as Senir is hostile to plowing [<i>soneh nir</i>], so too, Isaac was subject to an ordeal only once. “And Ḥermon” – this is Jacob.

Just as this leopard is impudent, so the Canaanites were impudent. That is what is written: “Not a man remained in the Ai [or Beit El who did not come out after Israel]” (Joshua 8:17).<br>Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Elazar: It would have been fitting for Israel to have sung song over the downfall of Siḥon and Og, and it would have been fitting for Hezekiah to have sung song over the downfall of Sennacherib, as it is written: “But Hezekiah did not reciprocate according to the reward bestowed upon him” (II Chronicles 32:25). <Why?> “As his heart had grown haughty” (II Chronicles 32:25). You see Hezekiah, a king and a righteous man, and you say “as his heart had grown haughty”? Rather, his heart had grown too haughty to sing a song. Isaiah came to Hezekiah and his associates. He said to them: “Sing to the Lord” (Isaiah 12:5). They said to him: Why? “For He has performed grandeur” (Isaiah 12:5). They said to him: It is already “known throughout the land” (Isaiah 12:5).

That is what is written: “The angel of the Lord emerged and smote the Assyrian camp” (Isaiah 37:36). In the morning, Hezekiah arose early and found them bound. He said: It seems that these came only to aid me. He untied them and they went and related the miracles and mighty exploits of the Holy One blessed be He. That is what is written: “Thus says the Lord: The product of Egypt and the merchandise of Kush” (Isaiah 45:14). “The product of Egypt” – this is Pharaoh king of Egypt; “and the merchandise of Kush” – this is Tirhaka king of Kush. “And the Sabeans, men of stature” (Isaiah 45:14) – these are their armies. “Will pass over to you” (Isaiah 45:14) – this is Hezekiah and his associates. “They will be yours (Isaiah 45:14)” – they are already at peace with you. “They will follow you and pass in chains (Isaiah 45:14)” – in manacles. “They will prostrate themselves to you” (Isaiah 45:14) – this is Jerusalem. “They will pray before you” (Isaiah 45:14) – this is the Temple. What would they say? “There is only God with you; there is none other except for God” (Isaiah 45:14). Isaiah said before the Holy One blessed be He: Master of the universe, “indeed [<i>akhen</i>] You are God who conceals Himself” (Isaiah 45:15). What is “<i>akhen</i>”? Where [<i>ekhan</i>] are You hiding, God? Indeed, You have the dynamism, and You conceal Yourself?

Rather, he said: “Now I know that the Lord has rescued His anointed one.… Some come on chariots [and some on horses but we will make mention of the name of the Lord our God]” (Psalms 20:7–8).

He called his son-in-law and said to him: ‘To whom are you a bridegroom?’ He said to him: ‘I am your first son-in-law, [married] to your older daughter.’ He said to him: ‘What is this?’ He said to him: ‘This is my seal and this is my signet,’ and likewise [occurred with] the second [son-in-law].<br>At that moment, the king said: My daughters are sheltered from immorality and you slander and demean them? By your lives, I will administer justice against you. So it is with the nations, because they would taunt Israel and say: “Egypt enslaved the children of Israel [with harshness]” (Exodus 1:13); if they compelled them to perform labor, all the more so [they must have dominated] their bodies and their wives. At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He said: My sister, My bride, a locked garden. What is a locked garden?

Who did the fathers themselves resemble? The paterfamilias of the families. That is what is written regarding Reuben: “The families of the Reubenites [<i>haReuveni</i>]” (Numbers 26:7).

Alternatively, Rabbi Marinos is disputing Rabbi Hoshaya’s point and saying that just as members of any family can be referred to in this manner, the term Reubenite does not mean anything special (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Rabbi Huna in the name of Rabbi Idi: <i>Heh</i> at the beginning of the word and <i>yod</i> at the end; God [<i>yod-heh</i>] attests for them that they were indeed the sons of their fathers.<br>Rabbi Pinḥas said: “A locked garden” – these are the virgins. “A locked fountainhead” – these are the non-virgins.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">136</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although there is an opening – <i>gal</i> means door in Aramaic – it remains locked before men other than her husband.</i> “A sealed spring” – these are the males.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">137</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They did not engage in illicit sexual activity.</i> It was taught in the name of Rabbi Natan: “A locked garden, a locked fountainhead” – why was it [written] twice?

They did not change their name: Reuben and Simeon descended [to Egypt]; Reuben and Simeon ascended. They did not call Reuben Rufus, they did not call Simeon Luleyani, Joseph, Listis, or Benjamin, Alexandra.<br>They did not change their language. There, it is written: “The survivor came and told Abram the Hebrew” (Genesis 14:13), and here it is written: “The God of the Hebrews has called upon us” (Exodus 5:3), and it is written: “That it is my mouth speaking to you” (Genesis 45:12), in the sacred tongue.<br>They did not speak slander, as it is stated: “Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask each man from his neighbor” (Exodus 11:2).

Joseph descended to Egypt and sheltered himself from licentiousness, and all the males were sheltered by his merit.<br>Rabbi Pinḥas in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya: The sheltering from licentiousness was itself sufficient that by its merit Israel would have been redeemed from Egypt. What is the reason? “A locked garden is my sister, my bride.” What is written thereafter? “Your branches [<i>shelaḥayikh</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">142</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They merited to be sent [<i>lehishalaḥ</i>] from Egypt.</i> are an orchard of pomegranates.”<br>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: [This is analogous] to one to whom an inheritance fell at the site of a garbage dump. The heir was indolent and he sold it at a minimal price. The purchaser went and industriously excavated there and found a treasure. He built a large palace. The purchaser began walking in the marketplace with servants following him [all due] to the treasure that he had purchased there. The seller saw and was sorrowful, saying: Woe is me over what I lost. So too, when Israel was in Egypt, they were enslaved in mortar and bricks and they were contemptible in the eyes of the Egyptians. When they saw their flags encamped at the sea in the array of a royal army, the Egyptians became sorrowful, saying: Woe are we, what did we send from our land?

Rabbi Idi interprets the phrase “eat, friends” as a reference to the princes.</i> that is what is written: “I will sacrifice to You burnt offerings of fattened animals [with the burning of rams; I will sacrifice bulls and goats]” (Psalms 66:15). What offering includes bull, rams, and goats? Say that this is the offering of the princes. That is what is written: “And for the peace offering, two oxen, [five rams, five goats]” (Numbers 7:17). Rabbi Shimon ben Yosena said: Why does he call the princes “friends”? It is because He intended to make them beloved and to draw them close.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrash questions why the verse in Song of Songs, which states “eat, friends,” and is interpreted as referring to the princes, used the term friends. The answer is that God, by accepting their offerings, sought to make them beloved to the Israelites and draw them near to Him.</i><br>Rabbi Shimon ben Yosena said: In every other circumstance, an individual may not bring a voluntary incense offering, but here<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the offerings of the tribal princes upon the inauguration of the Tabernacle.</i> there was a voluntary incense offering. In every other circumstance, an individual may not bring a voluntary sin offering, but here there was a voluntary sin offering. In every other circumstance, the offering of an individual does not override impurity and Shabbat, but here the offering of an individual did override Shabbat and impurity. In every other circumstance, an individual brings a sin offering only for a sin, but here an individual brought a sin offering not for a sin. Another matter: “Eat, friends” – these are the princes; “drink abundantly, beloved ones” – these are the libations.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The princes were so overjoyed to bring their offerings that it was as though they were inebriated.</i><br>Another matter: “Eat, friends” – Rabbi Berekhya said: [This is analogous] to a king who made a feast and invited guests, but an insect fell onto the tray. Had the king withdrawn his hand, everyone would have withdrawn his hand. The king extended his hand, so everyone extended his hand.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although these offerings were anomalous, since they were accepted by God, the princes could also partake of the parts that were not burned on the altar.</i> “Drink abundantly, beloved ones” – Rabbi Yannai said: [This is analogous] to a king who made a feast and invited guests, and he would circulate among them and say to them: ‘May it be pleasant for you and may it be sweet for you.’ Rabbi Abbahu said: [This is analogous] to a king who made a feast and invited guests. After they ate and drank, he said: ‘Take this fine portion and give it to the host.’ Here, too, it was so.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the analogy, a particular nobleman made the feast for the king and the king’s guests, and did not eat because he was busy ensuring that the king and the guests were satisfied. The king eventually ensured that the host also was able to eat. So too, after parts of the princes’ offerings were burned on the altar and other parts were given to the priests, the princes also partook of the remainder of the offerings.</i> “I came to my garden, my sister, my bride; I gathered my myrrh with my perfume; I ate my honeycomb with my honey” – you, too, eat. “I drank my wine with my milk” – you, too, “eat, friends; drink abundantly, beloved ones.”",

Is there a palate that is greater and sweeter than that?<br>Reish Lakish said: This is only if one has remorse for his previous actions. How so? Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: If there was a person who was completely wicked all his days and ultimately he became completely righteous, in his regard the verse states: “The wickedness of the wicked person, he will not stumble over it on the day of his repentance from his wickedness…” (Ezekiel 33:12). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Moreover, all the transgressions that he performed, the Holy One blessed be He tallies them for him as merits.

Who can enter into a dispute with his Creator? Now He will eliminate them from the world. When the Holy One blessed be He saw that the nations of the world were joyful, he transformed it for [Israel] into good, as it is stated: “If your sins will be like scarlet, they will be whitened as snow; if they will be reddened like crimson, they will be like wool” (Isaiah 1:8). The nations of the world were astounded and said: Is that a response, is that rebuke; rather, He came only to amuse Himself with His children.<br>When the Holy One blessed be He said: “Hear, mountains, the Lord’s quarrel, and the strong foundations of the earth, [the Lord has a quarrel with His people,] and with Israel He will contend” (Micah 6:2), the nations of the world rejoiced and said: How can they enter into a dispute with their Creator? Who can enter into a dispute with his Creator? Now He will eliminate them from the world. When the Holy One blessed be He saw the joy of the nations of the world, he transformed it for them into good. That is what is written: “My people, what did I do to you and how did I tire you?

When the Holy One blessed be He saw the joy of the nations of the world, he transformed it for them into good, as it is stated: “In the womb he was at his brother’s heels, [and in his strength he strove with God]” (Hosea 12:4).<br>Rabbi Yudan said: This is analogous to a widowed woman who was complaining about her son to a judge. Once she saw that the judge sentences people with fire and tar, with punishments and rods, she said: If I inform the judge of my son’s misdeeds, he will kill him. When the previous trial ended, he said to her: ‘Is this your son?’ He said to her: ‘How did this son of yours mistreat you?’ She said to him: ‘Sir, when he was in my womb he kicked me.’ He said to her: ‘This is not [cause for] a trial.’ That is what is written: “In the womb he was at his brother’s heels” (Hosea 12:4).

That is what is written: “If we continue to hear [the voice of the Lord our God we shall die]” (Deuteronomy 5:22). That is what is written: “My soul departed when he spoke” (Song of Songs 5:6). The spoken word returned before the Holy One blessed be He and said: ‘Master of the universe: You are alive and enduring, and Your Torah is alive and enduring, and You send me to the dead? They are all dead.’ At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He then sweetened the spoken word for them. That is what is written: “The voice of the Lord is mighty; the voice of the Lord is majestic” (Psalms 29:4). Rabbi Ḥama bar Rabbi Ḥanina said: “The voice of the Lord is mighty” – for the lads; “the voice of the Lord is majestic” – for the elderly. Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: The Torah that the Holy One blessed be He sent to Israel restored their souls to them. That is what is written: “The Torah of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul” (Psalms 19:8).<br>Another matter: “His palate is sweet” – [this is analogous] to a king who spoke harshly to his son, and [the son] was afraid and he fainted. When the king saw that he had fainted, he began embracing and kissing him, appeasing him, and saying to him: ‘What is it with you, are you not my only son and am I not your father?’ So too, when the Holy One blessed be He said: “I am the Lord your God” (Exodus 20:2), their souls immediately departed. When they died, the angels began embracing and kissing them, and saying to them: ‘What is it with you? Fear not, “you are children to the Lord your God”’ (Deuteronomy 14:1), and the Holy One blessed be He sweetened the speech on His palate and said to them: ‘Are you not My children? “I am the Lord your God.” You are My people, you are beloved to Me.’ He began appeasing them until their souls were restored and they began requesting of Him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They began requesting that He not speak with them directly any longer.</i> That is: “His palate is sweet.” The Torah began requesting mercy for Israel from the Holy One blessed be He.

Rabbi Levi said: The parable says, a gate that does not open for a mitzva will open for a doctor.<br>Another matter, “I went down to the nut garden,” just as a stone breaks a nut, so too, the Torah is called a stone and the evil inclination is called a stone. The Torah is called a stone, as it is stated: “I will give you the stone tablets” (Exodus 24:12), and the evil inclination is called a stone, as it is stated: “I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh (Ezekiel 36:26). Rabbi Levi said: [This is analogous] to a desolate place which was afflicted by gangs. What did the king do? He positioned members of the royal guard there to defend it, so [the bandits] would not accost passersby. So too, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘The Torah is called stone and the evil inclination is called stone, let the stone protect from the stone.’<br>Another matter, “I went down to the nut garden,” just as the nut cannot be smuggled past the tax collector because its [rattling] can be heard and it is conspicuous, so too Israel, any place that one of them goes, he cannot say that he is not a Jew. Why? Because he is conspicuous. That is what is written: “Everyone who sees them will recognize them, for they are the descendants of the blessed of the Lord” (Isaiah 61:9).<br>Another matter, “I went down to the nut garden,” just as the nut, if you have a sack filled with nuts, you can [still] put numerous sesame seeds and mustard seeds into it and it will hold them, so too, numerous proselytes have come and joined Israel. That is what is written: “Who has counted the dust of Jacob” (Numbers 23:10).<br>Another matter, “I went down to the nut garden,” just as the nut, if you take one from the pile, all of them collapse and roll onto one another, the same is true of Israel; if one of them is stricken all of them feel it. That is what is written: “Shall one man sin, and You will rage against the entire congregation?” (Numbers 16:22).<br>Rabbi Berekhya said: Just as the nut has four compartments and a space in the middle, so were Israel were situated in the wilderness; four banners, four camps, and the Tent of Meeting in the middle.

Israel comes under their control unscathed and emerges unscathed. “The Shulamite,” a nation in whose midst the eternal One who lives in peace [<i>shalom</i>] moves about; that is what is written: “I have moved about in a tent and a Tabernacle” (II Samuel 7:6).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">God rested His presence in the Tabernacle in the midst of Israel. The Tabernacle resided in four places in the Land of Israel: Gilgal, Shilo, Nov, and Givon, corresponding to the four times “return” is written here, as though the word Shulamite is written with each one (Maharzu, <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 66:2).</i> <br>Another matter, “the Shulamite,” a nation to whom [a blessing] concluding with peace is [recited] each day, just as it says: “And grant you peace [<i>shalom</i>]” (Numbers 6:26). Alternatively, “the Shulamite,” the nation that I am destined to settle in an abode of peace; that is what is written: “My people will live in a peaceful abode…” (Isaiah 32:18). Another matter, “the Shulamite,” the nation to whom I extend peace; that is what is written: “Behold, I will extend peace toward it” (Isaiah 66:12).<br>Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Maron said: A nation that completes [<i>mashlemet</i>] the stability of the world, both in this world and in the World to Come. Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: A nation that all the good of the word comes only due to its merit. That is what is written: “God will give you from the dew of the heavens, and from the fat of the earth” (Genesis 27:28); “you,” the matter is dependent upon you and your merit, as it is written: “The Lord will open for you His good storehouse” (Deuteronomy 28:12), the matter is dependent upon you and your merit.<br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Tanḥum and Rabbi Ḥanan, the son of Rabbi Berekhya from Botzra, [said] in the name of Rabbi Yirmeya: The nation that made peace between Me and My world, as had they not accepted My Torah, I would have returned My world to emptiness and disorder, as Huna said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: It is written: “The earth and all its inhabitants melt away” (Psalms 75:4). Had Israel not stood before Mount Sinai and said: “Everything that the Lord has said, we will perform and we will heed” (Exodus 24:7), the world would have begun to disintegrate. Who buttressed the world? It is I [<i>anokhi</i>], as it is stated: “I [<i>anokhi</i>] set its pillars firm, Selah” (Psalms 75:4); by the merit of: “I [<i>anokhi</i>] am the Lord your God” (Exodus 20:2), I set its pillars firm.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">God caused the pillars of the world to be firm in the merit of the people of Israel accepting the Ten Commandments, the first of which was “I am the Lord your God” (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i>",

That is what is written: “Therefore the young women love you” (Song of Songs 1:3). And until when will you be killed for His sake? As it is written: “For we are killed for Your sake all day” (Psalms 44:23). And until when will you perform acts of kindness on His behalf, and for Him Himself, while He repays you with harshness? Come over to us and we will appoint you dukes, governors, and generals. “And we will gaze [<i>veneḥezeh</i>] upon you,” you will be the focus [<i>meḥezyatei</i>] of the world. That is what is written: “You shall discern [<i>teḥezeh</i>] from among the entire people [capable men… to be leaders of thousands…]” (Exodus 18:21).<br>Israel responds to them: “Why will you gaze at the Shulamite like at a dance of two companies?” Have you ever heard that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob engaged in idol worship, such that their descendants would engage in idol worship in their wake? Our ancestors did not engage in idol worship and we, in their wake, will not engage in idol worship. But what can you do for us?

Rather, how fair are your feet in sandals, daughter of my beloved.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is an alternate explanation of the midrash. The verse cannot be taken literally as praising the feet, as they are sometimes covered. Rather, the verse is praising Israel for how they observe <i>mitzvot</i> that have to do with shoes, such as <i>ḥalitza</i>. Israel is referred to as “daughter of my beloved” because Abraham was beloved by God (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> <br>Rabbi Berekhya said: This is what was expounded by two mountains of the world, Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua, who said: “How fair are your feet in sandals [<i>bane’alim</i>].” Your feet were so fair<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The merit of traveling to Jerusalem for the pilgrimage festivals was so great (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> that they would serve as a barrier before all troubles.<br>There was an incident involving one who forgot to lock the doors of his house and ascended on his way to the pilgrim festival.

When he returned, he found lions surrounding the wheat.<br>Rabbi Pinḥas said: There was an incident involving two wealthy brothers from Ashkelon who had wicked neighbors from the nations of the world.

It is to a king who had many daughters, some of whom were married [and living] in a nearby place, and some of whom were married [and living] in a distant place. One day they all came to ask after the welfare of their father the king. The king said: ‘Those who are married at a nearby place can go and return any time, but those who are married in a distant place cannot go and return any time. Therefore, while all of them are here with me, we will all make a festival for one day and celebrate with them.’ So too, the assembly of Passover, since [the days] transition from winter to summer, the Holy One blessed be He said it is [feasible] for them to go and return at this time. However, the assembly of the Festival [of <i>Sukkot</i>], because [the days] transition from summer to winter, and the dust on the roads is difficult and the clods of earth are difficult [for travelers]; therefore, it is not fifty days removed. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘It is not [feasible] for them to go and return at this time. Rather, while all of them are here, we will all make a festival for one day and celebrate.’ Therefore, Moses cautions Israel and says to them: “On the eighth day it shall be an assembly for you” (Numbers 29:35).

The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Anyone who can overcome the [urge to engage in] licentiousness, I attribute to him credit as though he overcame both of them.’<br>Rabbi Yehuda said: [This is analogous] to a snake charmer who had snakes.

He assembled all kinds of musicians and they were playing hymns before it, and [the idol] was saying: ‘I am the Lord your God.’ When Daniel saw this, he said to him: ‘Do you not give me permission to ascend and kiss your idol on its mouth?’ He said: ‘Why on its mouth?’ He said to him: ‘Because it is speaking sensible matters.’ Immediately, he granted him permission and he climbed. He adjured the frontplate, saying to it: ‘I am flesh and blood and I am an emissary of the Holy One blessed be He. Make certain that the Name of Heaven will not be desecrated through you. I decree upon you that you follow me.’ He came to kiss [the idol] and took what it had swallowed from its mouth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He took out the High Priest’s frontplate.</i> After he descended, all the types of musicians reassembled and played hymns before it, but it would not do anything.

To an apple orchard. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Elazar understands the verse in Daniel to indicate that Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya smelled when they emerged from the furnace, but they did not smell like fire.

The residents of his province said to him: ‘Our lord the king, it is your praise, and it is proper, that your daughter be with you in the province.’ He said to them: ‘Why do you care?’ They said to him: ‘Perhaps tomorrow you will go to her and live near her [in order to be] with her due to your love for her.’ He said to them: ‘I will marry off my daughter outside the province, but I will live with you.’ So too, when the Holy One blessed be He said to give the Torah to Israel, the ministering angels said to the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, “that You set Your glory” (Psalms 8:2), it is Your happiness, it is Your glory, it is Your praise that Your Torah remain in Heaven.’ He said to them: ‘Why do you care?’ They said to Him: ‘Perhaps tomorrow you will rest Your Divine Presence on the lower worlds.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘I give My Torah in the lower worlds, but I reside in the upper worlds. I am giving My daughter with her marriage contract in another province, to be honored with her husband with her beauty and her pleasantness, as she is the daughter of a king and they will respect her, but I will reside with you in the upper worlds.’ Who articulated this? Habakkuk, as it is stated: “His glory covered the heavens, and His praise filled the earth” (Habakkuk 3:3). Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: Every place that the Holy One blessed be He rested His Torah, He rested His Divine Presence. Who articulated this? David. That is what is written: “Let them praise the name of the Lord, for His name alone is exalted, His glory across earth and heaven” (Psalms 148:13) – first over the earth and thereafter over the heavens."

What did [the servant] do? He began beating him with a stick. He said to him: ‘Do not heed your father.’ [The prince] said to him: ‘You great fool, father placed me in your charge only because I would not heed him, and you say to me: Do not heed your father?’ So too, when the iniquities caused the Temple to be destroyed, and Israel was exiled to Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar said to them: ‘Do not heed the Torah of your Father in Heaven, but rather: “Fall and prostrate yourselves to the image that I made”’ (Daniel 3:15). Israel said to him: ‘You great fool, the Holy One blessed be He placed us in your charge only because we would prostrate ourselves to an image, just as it says: “The images of the Chaldeans engraved with vermilion” (Ezekiel 23:14), and you say to us: “Fall and prostrate yourselves to the image that I made”?

From whom do you derive this? From the tribe of Issachar and from the tribe of Naphtali. The tribe of Naphtali, because they would engage in and study Torah with suffering, took a reward of one thousand. That is what is written: “From Naphtali one thousand officials” (I Chronicles 12:35).

Additionally, the sages of Issachar were supported by the tribe of Zebulun, whereas Naphtali did not receive outside support (see <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 99:9).</i><br>Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Rabbi Bon: One who studies Torah not in his place takes a reward of one thousand, and [one who studies] in his place takes a reward of two hundred.

This is the Garden of Eden, which is entirely spices. That is why it is stated: “On the mountains of spices.”<br>Another matter: “The one who dwells in the gardens, companions” (Song of Songs 8:13) – Rabbi Yirmeya [said] in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great: If two colleagues debate a matter of <i>halakha</i> and yield to one another in <i>halakha</i>, the verse states in their regard: “Then those who fear the Lord spoke [<i>nidberu</i>] one to another, and the Lord listened and heard” (Malachi 3:16); and <i>dibbur</i> is an expression of nothing other than subduing, as it is stated: “He subdues [<i>yadber</i>] peoples beneath us” (Psalms 47:4). Moreover, if they were mistaken, The Holy One blessed be He corrects their error for them. What is the source? “The Lord listened and heard,<b> </b>and<b> </b>a book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the Lord and those who think of His name” (Malachi 3:16). “The Lord… heard and [a book of remembrance] was written” – [this indicates] that He writes it on their hearts, just as it says: “On their heart I will write it” (Jeremiah 31:32). “A book of remembrance [was written] before Him” – that He reminds them of it. For whom? “For those who fear the Lord and those who think of His name.”<br>Rabbi Yudan said: When Israel is reading the Torah in groups,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is based on the similarity of the word groups [<i>ḥavurot</i>] and companions [<i>ḥaverim</i>].</i> “your voice, let me hear it” (Song of Songs 8:13).

Some of them were eating and drinking and blessing the king, and some of them were eating and drinking and cursing the king. The king sensed it and sought to introduce commotion at his feast and break it up. A noblewoman entered and advocated on their behalf. She said to him: My lord the king: Instead of looking at those who are eating and drinking and cursing you, look at those who are eating and drinking and blessing you and praising your name. So too, when Israel are eating and drinking, blessing, praising, and lauding the Holy One blessed be He, He hears their voices and is appeased. When the nations of the world eat and drink, curse, blaspheme, and scorn the Holy One blessed be He with the licentiousness that they mention, at that moment, the Holy One blessed be He considers even destroying His world. The Torah enters and advocates and says: Master of the universe, instead of looking at those who blaspheme and anger You, look at Your people Israel, who bless, praise, and laud Your great name with Torah, hymns, and praise. The Divine Spirit shouts: “Flee, my beloved”; flee from the nations of the world and cleave to Israel.<br>“And be like a gazelle” – just as this gazelle, while it is sleeping, one of its eyes is open and one of its eyes is closed, so too: when Israel performs the will of the Holy One blessed be He, He looks upon them with His two eyes; that is what is written: “The eyes of the Lord are to the righteous” (Psalms 34:16). But when they do not perform the will of the Holy One blessed be He, He looks upon them with one of His eyes, as it is stated: “Behold, the eye of the Lord is toward those who fear Him, [toward those who await His mercy, to deliver their souls from death, and to keep them alive in famine]” (Psalms 33:18–19).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even when they do not sufficiently fulfill the will of God, He still protects them due to whatever fear of God they still do have, although He does so with “one eye.” He protects them from death and famine but does not grant them abundance.</i> <br>“On the mountains of spices” – Rabbi Simon said: The Holy One blessed be He said: Wait for Me until I sit in judgment on their mountains, that is, their guardian angels, who are situated with Me in Heaven. That is what is written: “On the mountains of spices.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word spices [<i>besamim</i>] can also be vocalized to read <i>bashamayim</i>, in Heaven.</i> Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Like this: “You shall take for yourself chief spices” (Exodus 30:23) – chief.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word “chief” in the verse is unnecessary, as the continuation of the verse details exactly which spices should be brought. This indicates that the word spices refers to that which is “chief,” of primary importance. Consequently, the verse in Song of Songs can be understood to refer to the guardian angels of the nations, even without reading <i>besamim</i> and <i>bashamayim</i> (<i>Yefe Kol</i>).</i> Camels bearing gold, and “spices”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is based on I Kings 10:2, which describes what the Queen of Sheba brought to Solomon, and states that she brought “camels that bore spices and gold.”</i> – gold and spices.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This sentence is difficult to understand, and some commentaries suggest that it does not belong in the text (see <i>Yefe Kol</i>). Some suggest that the midrash is highlighting, based on the verse in Kings, that gold and spices are items associated with royalty and greatness. Therefore, the reference to spices in the verse in Song of Songs can refer to the guardian angels of the nations, which represent their ultimate level of power and greatness.</i> <br>Rabbi Ḥonya [said] regarding the statement of Rabbi Yitzḥak: The Holy One blessed be He does not exact retribution from a nation below until He humbles its guardian angels above. There are five verses in this regard. One, as it is written: “It will be on that day that the Lord will reckon with the host of the heavens in Heaven” (Isaiah 24:21), and thereafter “with the kings of the earth” (Isaiah 24:21). Two, “how have you fallen from the heavens, shining morning star” (Isaiah 14:12), and thereafter, “you have been felled to the ground” (Isaiah 14:12). Three, “For my sword has been sated in the heavens” (Isaiah 34:5), and thereafter, “it shall descend upon Edom” (Isaiah 34:5). Four, “to bind their kings with fetters” (Psalms 149:8), and thereafter, “and their nobles with iron chains” (Psalms 149:8). Rabbi Tanḥuma said: “To bind their kings with fetters” – these are the guardian angels above, “and their nobles with iron chains,” these are the rulers below. Five, “to execute judgment as it is written” (Psalms 149:9), and thereafter, “this is glory for all His devoted ones, Halleluya” (Psalms 149:9).<br>The greatness of Israel is likened to four matters: to the grain harvest, to the grape harvest, to spices, and to a birthing mother. To the grain harvest: When a field is reaped before its time, even its straw is no good, but at its time, it is good. That is what is written: “Extend the scythe, as the harvest is ripe” (Joel 4:13). It is likened to the grape harvest: When a vineyard is harvested before its time, even its vinegar is no good, but at its time, it is good. So too, “sing about it, a vineyard of wine” (Isaiah 27:2) – when the vineyard becomes [ready to produce] wine, pluck it. It is likened to spices: Just as spices that are harvested when they are soft and moist, their fragrance does not diffuse; but when they are dry and are then harvested, their fragrance diffuses. It is likened to a birthing mother: When a woman gives birth before her time, the offspring does not survive. When she gives birth at her time, it lives. Thus, it is written: “Therefore, He will give them up until the time that the birthing mother gives birth” (Micah 5:2). Rabbi Aḥa said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: “I am the Lord, at its time I will hasten it” (Isaiah 60:22) – if you do not merit, at its time. If you merit, I will hasten it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Redemption will come by a particular time, but if Israel merits, it will come sooner.</i> So may it be His will, speedily in our days, amen."
