            "The halakhah is: A Jew who was walking on the way Erev Shabbat and it grew dark, and he had in his hand coins or something else, what should he do? This is what our sages taught? One for whom the path grows dark [erev Shabbat] he should give his wallet to a non-Jew. And why is it permitted to give it to a non-Jew? R. Levi said, when the children of Noah were commanded, they were commanded only about seven things, and Shabbat was not one of them, therefore they allowed it to be given to a non-Jew. And R. Yose bar Hanina said: A non-Jew who keeps Shabbat before he accepts upon himself circumcision is obligated for the death penalty. Why? For they were not commanded to keep this. And why did you says that a non-Jew who keeps Shabbat is liable for the death penalty? R. Hiyya b. Abba said in the name of R. Yohanan: It is the way of the world that a king and a matron are having a discussion, and one who sticks their head in, are they not liable for death? Thus Shabbat is a matter between Israel and God, as it says, \"Between me and the children of Israel.\" [Thus any non-Jew who puts himself between them before he accepts circumcision, is obligated for death.] ..."
