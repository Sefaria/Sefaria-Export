            "... Another explanation. “When the Lord, your God, expands your boundary…” (Deuteronomy 12:20) The Rabbis say: this is speaking of Jerusalem. Who is able to see the calm of Jerusalem when the Holy One expands it? R’ Shimon bar Nachman says: to what is this to be compared? To a country, etc. “And then the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem shall be pleasant to the Lord, as in the days of old and former years.” (Malachi 3:4) “Lo, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and awesome day of the Lord, that he may turn the heart of the fathers back through the children, and the heart of the children back through their fathers-lest I come and smite the earth with utter destruction.” (Malachi 3:23-24) Behold I send My angel and he will clear the way before Me. And suddenly the Master whom you desire will come into His palace and the angel of the covenant whom you desire, behold he is coming says the Lord of Hosts. “Therefore, so said the Lord: 'I have returned to Jerusalem with mercy; My house shall be built there,' says the Lord of Hosts. 'And a plumb line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem.' Further, proclaim, saying: so said the Lord of Hosts, 'My cities shall yet spread out with prosperity, and the Lord shall yet console Zion and shall yet choose Jerusalem.'” (Zechariah 1:16-17) “Be exceedingly happy, O daughter of Zion; Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem. Behold! Your king shall come to you. He is just and victorious; humble, and riding a donkey and a foal, the offspring of she-donkeys.” (Zechariah 9:9)"
