            "[Moshe] said before Him: Master of the world, let Yehoshua assume my title, and I will live.",
            "The Almighty said: Do for him what he does for you.",
            "Moshe immediately arose and went to Yehoshua's home. Yehoshua was frightened and said, \"Moshe, my rabbi, come next to me.\" They left to go, and Moshe walked on Yehoshua's left. They entered the Tent of Meeting, and the pillar of cloud descended and stood in between them.",
            "When the pillar of cloud left, Moshe went to Yehoshua and said: What did God say to you?",
            "Yehoshua said to him: When He would speak with you, did I know what He said to you?",
            "At that moment Moshe cried and said: One hundred deaths are preferable to a single feeling of envy!…",
            "Once he accepted death, the Almighty began comforting him. He said to him: I swear, in this world you led My children, so in the future, too, I will lead them through you."
