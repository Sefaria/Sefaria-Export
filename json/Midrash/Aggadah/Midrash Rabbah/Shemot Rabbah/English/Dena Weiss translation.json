            "He said I am the God of your father. This is as it is written, \"A fool will believe anything...\". \"Peti\" is the language of seduction (pituy) as it says, \"when a man seduces\" (yifteh). R. Yehoshua the Kohen b. Nehemiah said, When the Holy Blessed One revealed Himself to Moshe he was a prophetic novice. The Holy Blessed One said, If I reveal Myself to him in a great voice I will frighten him, with a small voice I will sour him on prophecy. What did He do? He revealed Himself to him with the voice of his father. Moshe said, \"Here I am! What does father ask?\" The Holy Blessed One said, \"I am not your father, rather I am the God of your father. I came to you with seduction so that you would not be afraid.\""
