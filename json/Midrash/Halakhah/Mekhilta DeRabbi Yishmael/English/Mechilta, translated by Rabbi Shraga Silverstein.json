If so, why is it written \"to Moses and to Aaron\"? We are hereby taught that just as Moses was \"included\" in the words (i.e., by their being spoken to him), so, Aaron was included in the words (i.e., by his \"overhearing\" them). And why did He not speak (directly) to him? In deference to Moses. We find Aaron, then, to be excluded from all the (direct) addresses in the Torah except for three (Leviticus 10:8, Numbers 18:1, Numbers 18:8), where it is impossible (to understand otherwise).",

Whence would I derive (the same for) Aaron? (It is, therefore, written (here) \"to Moses and to Aaron.\" Moses is being likened to Aaron. Just as Moses was a \"judge\" to Pharaoh, so, Aaron. Just as Moses spoke his words without fear, so, Aaron.",

For the gentiles are close to repentance — so that they not make Israel (who do not repent) liable (by invidious contrast). An analogy: The bondsman of a Cohein flees from his master, saying: I will go to the cemetery, a place where my master cannot come after me. His master: I have (messengers) like you. Thus, Jonah said: I will go outside the land, a place where the Shechinah is not revealed. For the gentiles are close to repentance, (this, so as not to render Israel liable by invidious contrast.) The Holy One responds: I have many messengers like you, viz. (Jonah 1:4) \"Then the L–rd cast a great wind on the sea, etc.\"",

One claimed the honor of the Father and the father of the son; another, the honor of the Father, but not the honor of the son; another, the honor of the son, but not the honor of the Father. Jeremiah claimed the honor of the Father and the honor of the son, viz. (Eichah 3:42) \"We have offended and rebelled\" (the honor of the Father); \"You have not forgiven\" (the honor of the son). Therefore, his prophecy was \"doubled,\" (Jeremiah 36:33) \"… and many other words were added to them\" (the prophecies of Jeremiah). Eliyahu claimed the honor of the Father, but not the honor of the son, viz. (I Kings 19:10) \"I have been very jealous for the L–rd, the G–d of hosts, etc.\" And what is stated in this regard? (Ibid. 15-16) \"And the L–rd said to him: Go, return on your way to the desert of Damascus … And Yehu the son of Nimshi shall you anoint to be king over Israel, and Elisha the son of Shafat … shall you anoint to be a prophet in your place.\" What is the intent of this? He does not desire your prophecy (because you do not claim the honor of Israel).",

(Jonah 1:3) \"And the word of the L–rd came to Jonah a second time, saying.\" What is the intent of this? We will speak with him a second time, but not a third, (for he did not claim the honor of the L–rd).",

Yochanan said: Jonah went (on that voyage) only to cast himself into the sea, as it is written (Jonah 1:12) \"And he said to them: Lift me up and cast me into the sea.\" All this do you find with Moses and the (other) prophets, that they gave their lives for Israel. What is written of Moses?

Eliezer says: (The intent is) Go out and say it to them and return word to Me, viz. (Ibid. 19:8) \"and Moses returned the words of the people to the L–rd,\" and (Ezekiel 9:11) \"And, behold, the man clothed in linen on whose loins was the scribe's slate returned word saying I have done according to all that You have commanded me,\" and (Iyyov 38:35) \"Did you dispatch lightning bolts, so that they should go forth and say to you 'Here we are'\"? The messengers of the Holy One Blessed be He are not as those of flesh and blood. The messengers of flesh and blood must return to their sender. Not so Your messengers, but \"Did You dispatch lightning bolts so that they should go forth?\" It is not written \"and they shall return and say.\" Wherever they go they are before You and they say we have fulfilled Your embassy, in fulfillment of (Jeremiah 23:24) \"Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?\"",

(Ezekiel 9:2-11) \"And, behold, six men were coming, etc.\" — whereupon they fulfilled their embassy. Of those who were commanded to carry out the evil decree (i.e., to destroy), we do not learn that they returned report.

Joshua served Moses and the spirit of the L–rd reposed upon him. Elisha served Eliyahu and the spirit of the L–rd reposed upon him. Why am I different? (Ibid.) \"I wearied myself with groanings but I did not find rest,\" \"rest\" being prophecy, as in (Numbers 11:21) \"And the spirit rested upon them … and they prophesied in the camp,\" (II Kings 2:15) \"And the spirit of Eliyahu has rested on Elisha,\" (Isaiah 11:2) \"And the spirit of the L–rd will rest upon him.\" Come and see how the L–rd answered him (Jeremiah 45:4-5) \"Thus said the L–rd. What I have built I am going to destroy, and what I have planted I am going to uproot, and you are seeking 'great things' for yourself?\", \"great things\" being prophecy, as in (II Kings 8:4) \"Tell me, now, of all the 'great things' that Elisha (the prophet) has wrought,\" and (Jeremiah 33:3) \"Call Me and I will tell you (Jeremiah the prophet) 'great things' and in forms that you have not known,\" (G–d) saying to Baruch the son of Neriah, as it were: If there is no vineyard, there is no (need of a) fence; if there is no flock, there is no shepherd. Why? (Jeremiah 45:5) \"For I am going to bring evil upon all flesh.

If one transgresses a positive commandment and repents, he \"does not move from there\" until he is forgiven. And of this it is written \"Repent, you wayward sons.\" If one transgresses a negative commandment and repents, there is no power in penitence to atone; but penitence suspends (punishment) and Yom Kippur atones. And of this it is written \"On this day atonement will be made for you.\" If one willfully transgresses (sins punishable by) krithuth (cutting-off) and judicial death penalty and repents, there is no power in penitence to suspend, but penitence and Yom Kippur atone for one half, and afflictions purge and atone for the other half. And of this it is written \"I will punish their offense with the rod, and their transgression with plagues.\" If one desecrates the name of heaven and repents, there is no power in penitence to suspend or on Yom Kippur to atone, or in afflictions alone to purge. But penitence, Yom Kippur, and afflictions suspend, and the day of death purges. And of this it is written (\"This transgression will not be forgiven you) until you die.\" And (I Samuel 3:14) \"The transgression of the house of Eli will not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.\" It is not atoned for by sacrifice or offering, but it is atoned for by death.",

A positive commandment and a negative commandment, aside from \"You shall not take the name.\" (Which is) from \"You shall not take the name\" and up?

                "\"And if these three … then she shall go out free\": I might think, \"free\" of a get (a divorce, if he marries her). How, then, would I understand (Devarim 24:1) \"then he shall write her a bill of divorce\"? As obtaining with other women, other than a Hebrew maid-servant. It is, therefore, written \"And if these three … then she shall go out free\" — free of money (payment), but not free of a get.",
                "\"then she shall go out free\": when she is a bogereth (i.e., after twelve and a half years); \"without money\": when she is a na'arah (from twelve and a day until twelve and half.) Now it follows that if she goes out in the days of na'aruth, she does not go out in the days of bagruth. (Why, then, write both?) If only one were written, I would say that it referred to the days of bagruth. And this would follow, viz.: Since (at a certain stage) she leaves her father's jurisdiction and (at a certain stage) she leaves her master's jurisdiction, then just as she leaves her father's jurisdiction when she changes from what she was, so, she leaves her master's jurisdiction when she changes from what she was — i.e., when she had been a na'arah and becomes a bogereth. Therefore, so that there be no room to contest (her leaving the master's jurisdiction when she is a na'arah), both are written: \"then she shall go out free\" — (uncontestedly,) when she is a bogereth; \"without money\" — when she is a na'arah. R. Yonathan says: \"Then she shall go out free\": when she is a na'arah; \"without money\": when she is a bogereth.",

                "\"For whoever does work upon it, that soul shall be but off\" — a complete work. If one wrote one letter (on the Sabbath) in the morning, and another towards evening; or if he wove one strand in the morning and another towards evening, I might think that he is liable. It is, therefore, written \"And you shall keep the Sabbath, for it is holy to you. Those who profane it shall be put to death. For whoever does work upon it, that soul shall be cut off\" — a complete work.",
                "\"that soul shall be cut off from the midst of its people\": What is the intent of this? From (Ibid.) \"Those who profane it shall be put to death,\" I know only of one who profanes it wilfully after prior warning by witnesses. Whence do I derive (the same for) one who profanes it in and of himself? From \"and it shall be cut off.\"",

                "(Exodus 31:15) \"Six days will work be done.\" And a different verse (Ibid. 20:9) \"six days shall you work, and you shall do all of your work.\" How are these two verses to be reconciled? — When Israel do the L–rd's will, their work will be done by others, viz. \"will work be done.\" And thus is it written (Isaiah 61:8) \"And strangers will arise and graze your sheep, and the sons of strangers, your farmers and your vintners.\"",

From (Leviticus 23:4) \"These are the festivals of the L–rd, callings of holiness,\" I might think that just as the holiness of the festivals (i.e., the determination of their times by intercalation and the like) is relegated to beth-din, so, the holiness of Sabbath. It is, therefore written \"and the seventh day, a Sabbath of resting, holy to the L–rd\" — Sabbath is relegated to the L–rd, and not to beth-din. And thus is it written (Ibid. 14) \"And you shall keep the Sabbath.\"",
                "(Exodus, Ibid. 16) \"And the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath to observe the Sabbath for their generations, etc.\" This is as R. Nathan says: Profane for him (one whose life is in danger) one Sabbath so that he will keep many Sabbaths.",

                "\"Between Me and the children of Israel it is a sign forever\": and not between Me and the peoples of the world.",
                "\"It is a sign forever\": We are hereby apprised that Sabbath will never go lost from Israel. And thus do you find, that all things Israel gave their lives for — such as Sabbath, circumcision, Torah study, and immersion — remain with them and never go lost. And all things that Israel did not give their lives for — such as the Temple, shemitah years, Jubilee years, and (the institution of) judges — did not remain with them.",
                "\"He rested and was restored\": From what did He rest (on Sabbath)? From labor or from judgment\"? It is, therefore, written \"and He was restored,\" (which connotes \"from labor\"). We are hereby apprised that judgment never departs from Him. And thus is it written (Psalms 89:15) \"Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; lovingkindness and truth precede Your countenance,\" and (Devarim 32:4) \"The rock — perfect is His work, for all of His ways are justice, etc.:"

From (Ibid. 25:8) \"and they shall make for Me a sanctuary,\" I might think both on a weekday and on the Sabbath. And how would I understand (Ibid. 31:14) \"Those who profane it shall be put to death\"? As referring to their labors, other than those for the sanctuary. (Or, even to the labors for the sanctuary.) And how would I understand \"And they shall make for Me a sanctuary\"? As referring to other days, other than the Sabbath. Or, even on the Sabbath, etc.",
                "And it would follow (that labors for the sanctuary would override the Sabbath, viz.:) If the sacrificial service, which comes only from the enablers, (i.e., the vessels, etc.) overrides the Sabbath, then the (fixing of) the enablers of the sacrificial service, which (service) comes only from them — how much more so should they (i.e., their fixing) override the Sabbath! So that if the horn of the altar were removed or if the (sacrificial) knife were damaged, I would think they could be repaired on the Sabbath. It is, therefore, written \"And Moses assembled, etc.\" (where the exhortation against working on the Sabbath (Ibid. 35:2-3) precedes their being charged with the work of the sanctuary — to teach that such work is to be done) on the weekday, and not on the Sabbath).",

I might think that just as he rests from the eve of shemitah to shemitah, so he rests from the eve of Sabbath to Sabbath.",

Yishmael asked: What is the intent of \"You shall not light a fire\"? — From (Devarim 21:21) \"And if there be in a man a sin whose judgment is death, then he shall be put to death,\" I would understand, both on a weekday or on the Sabbath.
