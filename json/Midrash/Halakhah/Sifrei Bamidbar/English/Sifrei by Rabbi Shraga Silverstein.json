            " (Bamidbar 5:1-2) \"And the L-rd spoke to Moses, saying: Command the children of Israel that they send out of the camp every leper (metzora) and everyone with a (genital discharge (zav), and everyone that is unclean by (contact with) a body (tamei meth).\" Why was this section stated? (For) from (Bamidbar 19:20) \"A man, if he becomes unclean and does not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the congregation, for he has defiled the sanctuary of the L-rd,\" we hear the punishment; but we have not heard the exhortation. It is, therefore, written \"Command the children of Israel that they send out of the camp … (3) and they shall not make unclean their camps in which I dwell.\" This (3) is the exhortation that the unclean not enter the sanctuary in a state of uncleanliness.",
            " \"Command\": The command is immediately, for present performance and for future generations. You say thus, but perhaps it is only for future performance! It is, therefore, (to negate this) written \"Command the children of Israel that they send … (Bamidbar 19:4) \"And the children of Israel did so, sending them outside the camp\" — whence we derive that the command is for immediate performance. And whence do we derive that it is (also) for future generations? From (Vayikra 24:2) \"Command the children of Israel that they take to you clear olive oil … (3) … an eternal statute for your generations.\" — But how do we derive (the same) for all the commands in the Torah? R. Yishmael says: Since we find unqualified commands in the Torah, and one of them was qualified as being for present performance and for future generations, we derive the same for all the mitzvoth in the Torah. R. Yehudah b. Bethira says: \"command\" in all places connotes impulsion (to the act), as it is written (Devarim 3:28) \"And command Joshua and strengthen him and fortify him\" — whence we learn \"We strengthen only the (internally) strengthened,\" and \"We impel only the (internally) impelled.\" R. Shimon b. Yochai says: \"Command\" in all places entails expense, as it is written (Vayikra 24:2) \"Command the children of Israel that they take to you pure olive oil,\" (Bamidbar 35:2) \"Command the children of Israel that they give to the Levites from the inheritance, etc.\" (Bamidbar 28:2) \"Command the children of Israel and say to them: My offering, My bread, for My fires\" — whence we see that \"command\" in all places entails expense. Except in one; and which is that? (Bamidbar 34:2) \"Command the children of Israel and say to them: When you come to the land of Canaan, etc.\" — where the intent is: Impel them to the division of the land. Rebbi says: \"Command\" in all places is exhortation, as it is written (Bereshit 2:16-17) \"And the L-rd G-d commanded (i.e., exhorted) the man, saying … but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat.\"",
            " (Bamidbar 5:2) \"that they send out of the camp\": I understand this to mean from the Levite camp alone. Whence do I derive that the Israelite camp is also meant? From (Bamidbar 5:3) \"Outside the camp shall you send them.\" (Bamidbar 5:3) \"and they shall not make unclean their camps in whose midst I dwell\": This is the camp of the Shechinah. — But even if this were not mentioned, I could derive it a fortiori, viz. If those with dead-body tumah are ejected from the less stringent camp, that of the Israelites, how much more so are they ejected from the more stringent camp, that of the Shechinah. If so, why is \"and they shall not make unclean their camps\" needed? To teach that we do not punish by an a fortiori argument. R. Yehudah says: There is no need (for the verse to teach that they are sent out of the camp of the Shechinah), for it follows a fortiori, viz.: If those with (dead-body) tumah are ejected from the less stringent camp, (that of) the ark (i.e., the camp of the Levites), how much more so are they ejected from the more stringent camp, (that of) the Shechinah, (R. Yehudah obviously holding that we do punish by an a fortiori argument). If so, why is it written \"and they shall not make unclean their camps?\" Because from \"they shall send out from the camp every leper and every zav and every tamei meth,\" I would understand that they are all sent to one place; it is, therefore, written in respect to a leper (Vayikra 13:46) \"Solitary shall he sit\" — that no other unclean ones sit with him. I might then think that zavim and the tamei meth are sent to one camp; it is, therefore, written \"and they shall not make unclean their camps\" — to assign a separate camp for each. These are the words of R. Yehudah. Rebbi says: There is no need (for the above). A leper was included in the general category (of the unclean), and left the category (for special mention) to teach concerning the category, viz.: Just as a leper, whose tumah is most stringent — his sending is more stringent than that of his neighbor, so, each one whose tumah is more stringent, his sending is more stringent than that of his neighbor.",
            " This is the source for the sages' gradations of partitions (mechitzoth). Wherever zav confers tumah, metzora (leper) confers tumah. metzora is of greater stringency (than zav) in that it confers tumah upon one who enters (a house afflicted with tzara'ath [viz. Vayikra 14:46] [— wherefore a metzora is sent out of all three camps]). Wherever tamei meth confers tumah, zav confers tumah. zav is of greater stringency (than tamei meth) in that it confers tumah under an even mesama (a stone beneath which there is a cavity [viz. Vayikra 15:9] [— wherefore a zav is sent out of two camps]). Wherever tvul yom (one who has immersed in the daytime [pending purification in the evening]) confers tumah, tamei meth confers tumah. tamei meth is of greater stringency (than tvul yom) in that it confers tumah upon a man (who touches him, viz. [Bamidbar 19:22] [— wherefore a tamei meth is sent out of one camp]). Wherever one's lacking atonement (through an offering) renders (him) unfit (for eating consecrated food) tvul yom renders (him) unfit. tvul yom is of greater stringency (than one's lacking atonement) in that he renders terumah unfit.",
            " \"that they send out of the camp\": Is this speaking of all men or only the Levites, the carriers of the ark? It is, therefore, written (Ibid. 3) \"From male until female shall you send out\" — Scripture speaks of all men. R. Yoshiyah says \"that they send out of the camp\" connotes both adults and minors. You say both adults and minors, but perhaps the criterion (for inclusion) should be punishment, viz.: Just as we find re sanctuary defilement that only adults are punished, viz. (Ibid. 19:20) \"And a man, if he becomes unclean and does not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off\" — here, too, only adults are intended. It is, therefore, written \"From male until female shall you send out,\" both adults and minors. R. Yochanan says: Why is it written \"From male until female shall you send out\"? Because it is written \"They shall send out of the camp,\" I might think, only these (viz. (Ibid. 2). Whence do I derive (the same for) all the other types of tumah? From \"From male until female — any (type of tumah) that affects male or female — shall you send out.\" This tells me only of male and female. Whence do we derive the same for one whose sex is unknown or a hermaphrodite? From (the redundant) \"Outside the camp shall you send them.\" This tells me only of one who can be sent away (i.e., of one who can walk). Whence do I derive (the same for) one who cannot be sent away (i.e., that he must be taken by another)? From \"Outside the camp shall you send them.\" This tells me only of men. Whence do I derive (the same for) appurtenances (that have become tamei)? From \"and they shall not make unclean their camps.\" R. Akiva says: \"Outside of the camp shall you send them\" connotes both men and appurtenances. R. Yishmael says: It is derived by induction, viz.: A man is subject to plague tumah and garments are subject to plague tumah. Just as a man is subject to being sent away, so, appurtenances. — No, this may be so for a man, who imparts tumah (to an object) by reclining (mishkav) or sitting (moshav [upon it]), for which reason he must be sent away — as opposed to appurtenances, which do not impart tumah in that manner! — No, this is refuted by (the instance of) stones from a leprous house, which, though they do not impart tumah through mishkav or moshav, require being sent away. Do not wonder, then, if appurtenances, though they do not impart tumah through mishkav and moshav are to be sent away. R. Yossi Haglili says \"From male until female shall you send them out\": Just as male and female are distinctive in being subject to becoming proto-tumah (av hatumah) require being sent away, so, all that are thus susceptible — to exclude earthenware vessels, which are not thus susceptible.",
            " (Vayikra 17:15) \"and every soul that eats neveilah (carcass) or treifah (what is \"torn\") … he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water …\" R. Yitzchak says: It is written (Ibid. 16) \"And if he does not wash (his clothes) and he does not bathe his flesh (and he eats kodshim or enters the sanctuary), he shall bear his sin.\" For not bathing his body Scripture makes him liable to kareth (\"cutting-off'). You say, it is for not bathing his body, but perhaps it is for not washing his clothes! — Can you say this? If for the more stringent tumath meth he is not punished (with kareth) for not washing his clothes, how much more so is he not punished for not washing his clothes for the less stringent eating of carcass! If so, what is the intent of \"And if he does not wash his clothes\"? To serve as an exhortation (against not washing them).",
            " \"Outside of the camp shall you send them\": What is the intent of this (after \"They shall send out of the camp\")? From \"They shall send out of the camp,\" I might think the intent is (only) that they not touch the ark or its bearers, but they should be assigned a place for themselves (inside the camp). It is, therefore, written \"Outside of the camp shall you send them\": \"and they shall not make unclean their camps\" — whence (i.e., from the three-fold repetition of \"camp\") they stated: There were three camps: the Israelite camp, the Levite camp, and the camp of the Shechinah. From the entrance to Jerusalem until the Temple mount — the Israelite camp. From the entrance to the Temple mount until the azarah (the Temple courtyard) — the Levite camp. From the entrance to the azarah and inwards — the camp of the Shechinah. (Ibid. 3) \"in whose midst I dwell\": Beloved are Israel, who, even when they are tamei, the Shechinah is among them, as it is written (Vayikra 16:16) \"who dwells with them in the midst of their uncleanliness,\" and (Bamidbar) 35:34) \"And you shall not defile the land which you inhabit, in which I dwell, for I, the L-rd, dwell in the midst of the children of Israel (even when they are unclean).\"",
            " (Ibid. 5:4) \"And the children of Israel did so, and they sent them outside the camp\": R. Yossi Haglili says: Come and see how great is the power of transgression. For before they stretched forth their hands to transgress (with the golden calf), there were no zavim or lepers among them, and after they did so, there were zavim and lepers among them. In the course (of our learning) we learned that these three things (zavim, lepers, and tamei meth) occurred on the same day (the day that they made the golden calf). R. Shimon b. Yochai says: Come and see how great is the power of transgression. For before they stretched forth their hands to transgress, what is written of them? (Shemot 24:17) \"and the sight of the glory of the L-rd was like a consuming fire on the top of the mountain in the eyes of the children of Israel\" — They did not fear and they did not tremble. After they stretched forth their hands to transgress, what is written of them? (Ibid. 34:30) \"And Aaron and all of Israel saw Moses, and, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to approach him.\" \"And the children of Israel did so\": This is to declare the praise of Israel, that just as Moses told them, thus did they do. What is the intent of (the additional) \"As the L-rd spoke to Moses, so did the children of Israel do\"? To teach that the unclean ones themselves, (who were sent out), did not protest."

            " (Bamidbar 5:5-6) \"And the L-rd spoke to Moses, saying: Speak to the children of Israel: A man or a woman, if they do of all the sins of man\": Why is this section mentioned? (i.e., it has already been mentioned elsewhere.) — It is written (Vayikra 5:20-22) \"If a soul sin and commit a profanation against the L-rd … or if he find a lost object and swear falsely, etc.\" But the stolen property of a proselyte is not mentioned. It is, therefore, written (here) \"Speak to the children of Israel: A man or a woman, if they do all of the sins of man.\" Scripture comes to teach us about the stolen property of a proselyte that if one swore to him falsely (that he did not steal it) and the proselyte died, he pays the principal and the fifth to the Cohanim and the guilt-offering to the altar, (a proselyte, halachically, not having any heirs). This is a rule in the Torah: Any section stated in one place in the Torah, missing one thing, and repeated in a different place is repeated only for the sake of the thing that is originated. R. Akiva says: Everything stated therein must be expounded. R. Yoshiyah (in explication of R. Akiva) says: Why is \"a man or a woman\" stated? From (Shemot 21:3) \"And if a man open a pit or if a man dig a pit,\" I would know only of a man. Whence would I derive (the same for) a woman? From \"a man or a woman,\" to liken a woman to a man in respect to all transgressions and damages in the Torah. R. Yonathan says: (The above derivation) is not needed, for it is already written (Ibid. 34) \"The owner (whether man or woman) of the pit shall pay,\" and (Ibid. 22:5) \"Pay shall pay the kindler (whether man or woman) of the fire.\" Why, then, is it stated \"a man or a woman\"? For its (own) teaching, (i.e., that the law of theft of the proselyte\" obtains both with men and with women.) \"if they do all of the sins of man to commit a profanation against the L-rd\": Why is this stated? (i.e., it is already written [Vayikra 5:21] \"If a soul sin and commit a profanation, etc.\") Because it is written \"If a soul sin and commit a profanation… (22) or find a lost object, etc.\", I might think that only one who lies in respect to what is mentioned therein is regarded as one who lies against the L-rd Himself. Whence do I derive (the same for) one who lies in respect to all other things? It is, therefore, written \"if they do all of the sins of man to commit a profanation against the L-rd.\" \"to commit a profanation\" (\"limol ma'al\"). \"me'ilah\" in all places is \"lying.\" And thus is it written (I Chronicles 5:25) \"Vayimalu ('and they lied') against the G-d of their fathers,\" and (Joshua 7:1) \"And the children of Israel yimalu ma'al ('falsified') in respect to the ban,\" and (I Chronicles 10:13) \"And Saul died because of his falsification ('bima'alo ma'al') against the L-rd.\" And, in respect to Uzziyahu (II Chronicles 26:18), \"Leave the sanctuary, for you have acted falsely (ma'alta'),\" and (Bamidbar 5:12) \"… and she be false (uma'ala) to him\" — whence we see that \"me'ilah\" is \"lying.\" (Ibid. 6) \"and that soul shall be guilty\": Why is this stated? (i.e., it seems redundant.) \"a man or a woman\" would seem to indicate specifically these. Whence would I derive (the same for) one whose sex is unknown or a hermaphrodite? From \"and that soul shall be guilty\" — All are included, even proselytes and servants. — But this would seem to include all, both the above and minors! — Would you say this? If a minor is exempt from (punishment for) the grave sin of idolatry, how much more so (is he exempt from punishment for) all the mitzvoth of the Torah! Whence is it derived that if one stole and swore (falsely) and went to bring the money (to repay) and the guilt-offering and could not manage to bring them before he died, that his heirs are exempt? From \"and that soul shall be guilty.\" — But perhaps just as they are exempt from the guilt-offering, so, they are exempt from the principal. — It is, therefore, written (Ibid. 7) \"and he shall give it (the principal) to the one to whom he is liable (for payment).\" \"and that soul shall be guilty\": Why is this stated? Whence do you derive that if one burned his neighbor's grain sack on the Sabbath that beth-din does not exact payment from him because he is liable to the death penalty? From \"and that soul shall be guilty\" (i.e., in the aforementioned instance, the life alone is taken.) (Ibid. 7) \"and they confess their sin which they have done\": This tells me that a sin-offering requires confession. Whence do I derive (the same for) a guilt-offering? From \"and that soul be guilty and they confess.\" R. Nathan says: This is a paradigm (binyan av) for all that are put to death that they require confession."

        [
            " (Bamidbar 5:7) \"and they confess their sins which they have done\": and not for what his father has done. So that if one says to him: Give me the pledge that I deposited with your father and he says: You did not deposit (any pledge), and the other says: I beswear you (to that effect), and he says \"Amen,\" I might think that (if he confesses) he is liable; it is, therefore, written (Vayikra 5:5) \"then he shall confess wherein he has sinned,\" and not for what his father has done. \"then he shall restore his guilt at its head\": Why is this stated? Because it is written (Ibid. 5:24) \"and he shall pay it at its head,\" I might think that this applies to monetary payment (of the principal). Whence is it derived that he may return the theft itself? From \"then he shall restore.\" (Bamidbar 5:7) \"and its fifth shall he add to it\": so that it and its fifth make five (equal parts). These are the words of R. Yoshiah. R. Yonathan says: a fifth of the principal. \"and he shall give it to the one to whom he is liable\": Why is this stated? Because it is written (Vayikra 5:24) \"To whom it belongs shall he give it on the day of (the acknowledgement of) his guilt,\" I might think that he must give it either to him or to his messenger. Whence do I derive (that he may also give it to) the messenger of beth-din or to the heir (of the one to whom he is liable)? From \"and he shall give it to the one to whom he is liable.\" R. Nathan says: If one stole a maneh from his neighbor, and he came to beth-din, and he did not manage to pay it before the debtor of the robbed one arrived — Whence is it derived that beth-din may take it from the robber and give it to the debtor? From \"and he shall give it to the one to whom he is liable\" — in any manner."

            " (Bamidbar 5:8) \"And if the man does not have a redeemer (to whom to return the debt\"): R. Yishmael says: Now is there a man in Israel who does not have a redeemer? Scripture (in this instance) is teaching about one who robs a proselyte and swears to him (falsely), after which the proselyte dies — that he pays the principal and the fifth to the Cohanim and the guilt-offering to the altar, (a proselyte, halachically, having no heirs.) R. Nathan says: \"And if the man does not have a redeemer\": This tells me only of a man. Whence do we derive (the same for) a woman? From \"to whom to return the debt,\" (connoting either man or woman). If so, why is it written \"the man\"? For a man, a search must be made to determine whether or not he has a redeemer. For a minor, a search need not be made, it being certain that he has no redeemer (i.e., sons who can inherit him). (\"And if the man does not have a redeemer\":) Abba Chanan says in the name of R. Eliezer. Scripture speaks of the one who was robbed. — But perhaps it speaks of the robber. — (This cannot be, for) \"to whom to return the debt\" proves that it speaks of the one who is robbed. \"the debt (ha'asham) which is returned\": Scripture here speaks of money (and not of the guilt-offering proper). — But perhaps it does speak of the guilt-offering proper! — (This cannot be, for) \"aside from the ram of atonement whereby atonement shall be made for him\" speaks of this. How, then, am I to understand \"ha'asham which is returned to the L-rd\"? As referring to money (i.e., the principal and the fifth). \"is the L-rd's to the Cohein\": The L-rd has acquired it and He has given it to the Cohanim of the officiating watch. — But perhaps he can give it to any Cohein he wishes! — It is, therefore, written \"aside from the ram of atonement whereby atonement shall be made for him.\" (He gives it) to those who make atonement for him by it — the men of the watch.",
            " If the thief (himself) were a Cohein, I might think that he acquires it. And this would follow a fortiori, viz.: If he acquires that of others, shall he not acquire what is his own! (That is, if others had stolen from the proselyte, who died without heirs, the Cohein acquires that theft. How much more so does he acquire the theft which he already possesses!) R. Nathan phrased it otherwise, viz.: If something which I do not acquire until it comes into my hand (i.e., ma'aser, and terumath ma'aser), another cannot acquire and take it from me, then something which I do acquire before it comes into my hand (i.e., what has been stolen from a proselyte without heirs), then when it does come into my hand, how much more so (does it follow) that another cannot acquire it and take it from me! — No, this may be true of something which he does not acquire until it comes into his hand, for just as he has no portion in it, so, others have no portion in it. But would you say the same for this (what has been stolen from a proselyte)? Just as he has a portion in it, so, others have a portion in it, and since this is so, it follows that it should be taken from his hand and be apportioned among the men of the officiating watch.",
            " Whence is it derived that if one steals from a proselyte and swears (falsely) to him and goes to bring the money and the guilt-offering and does not manage to bring them before the proselyte dies — (Whence is it derived that his heirs are exempt (from the guilt-offering)? From \"aside from the ram of atonement with which atonement shall be made for him.\" (And in the above situation, his death has atoned for him.) Thus did R. Akiva teach before he came from Zifron. When he came from Zifron he said: If he gave the money to the men of the watch and then the proselyte died, the heirs do not retrieve it from the Cohein, and I pronounce over him (the giver) (Ibid. 10) \"Whatever a man gives to the Cohein, to him (the Cohein) shall it be.\" The Cohein says to the heir: Bring a guilt-offering and it will be sacrificed, and he (the heir) says: \"whereby atonement shall be made for him\" — to exclude (from the guilt-offering) one who died, whose death has atoned for him.",
            " \"aside from the ram of atonement\": From \"Whatever a man gives to the Cohein, to him (the Cohein) shall it be,\" do you say that if he gave the money to (the watch of) Yehoyariv and (afterwards) the guilt-offering to (that of) Yedayah, he has fulfilled his obligation and I pronounce over him (the giver) \"Whatever a man gives to the Cohein, to him shall it be,\" or even if he gave the guilt-offering (first) to Yehoyariv, and (then) the money to Yedayah, he has fulfilled his obligation and I pronounce over him \"Whatever a man gives to the Cohein, to him shall it be\"? It is, therefore, written \"aside from the ram of atonement whereby atonement shall be made for him\" (and there is no atonement until the money has been returned.) But, (in the above instance), if the animal to be offered is still alive, it is sacrificed by (the watch of) Yedayah, and he (the giver) is told to offer another offering and give it to Yedayah (sic.

Yishmael says: Scripture comes to teach you that if one dedicates (to the Temple) his grain pile before he levels it off and then he redeems it, he must take terumah (from it). I might think (he must do so) even if he redeemed it after he leveled the pile; it is, therefore, written (of terumah, Devarim 18:4) \"the first of your corn (pile).\" R. Akiva says: \"and all terumah\": Scripture comes to teach you that if he wishes to make his entire granary terumah, he may do so, so long as he leaves some over. \"and all terumah of all the holy things\": Scripture hereby teaches us that the laws of terumah apply to all varieties (of produce, and not just to those specifically indicated). Issi b. Yehudah says: If the ma'aser — the less stringent — obtains with all produce, how much more so, terumah — the more stringent. Variantly: If ma'aser, which does not obtain in the third and sixth year (of shemitah), obtains with all produce, how much more so, terumah, which obtains in all years! Issi b. Menachem says: if ma'aser, which is brought only as an adjunct to learning and fear (viz. Devarim 14:23), obtains with all produce, how much more so, the more stringent, terumah! (Ibid. 5:9) \"which they offer to the Cohein, to him shall it be\": R. Yishmael says: Now is terumah offered to the Cohein? (Does he not rather come to receive it?) What, then, is the intent of \"which they offer to the Cohein\"? Because it is written (Shemot 23:19) \"The first of the first-fruits (bikkurim) of your land shall you bring to the house of the L-rd your G-d,\" but we are not told what is to be done with them; it is, therefore, written \"which they offer to the Cohein, to him shall it be.\" Scripture hereby teaches us that bikkurim, (which are presented as offerings), are to be given to the Cohanim."

Variantly: And a man, his holy things, to him shall they be\": From here you derive that to the Cohein who performs the sacrifice (even in a different watch), its service (i.e., its flesh) and its skin belong \"to him\" (the Cohein). Variantly: \"And a man, his holy things, to him shall they be\": What is the intent of this? From (Vayikra 19:24) \"And in the fourth year all of its fruit shall be holy in praise of the L-rd,\" (I would not know) \"holy\" to the owners or \"holy\" to the Cohanim? It is, therefore, written \"And a man, his holy things, to him shall they be.\" Scripture here speaks of neta revai, that it belongs to the owners. These are the words of R. Meir. R. Shimon says: \"holy\" to the owners. You say \"holy\" to the owners, but perhaps it is \"holy\" to the Cohanim! — You derive it thus: second-tithe is called \"holy\" (viz. Devarim 26:13) \"and neta revai is called \"holy.\" Just as second-tithe is \"holy\" to the owners, so, neta revai should belong to the owners. — (No,) this is refuted by terumah, which is called \"holy\" (viz.

If I learned that second-tithe belongs to the owners, neta revai should belong to the owners. — (No,) this is refuted by bikkurim, which, even though they require bringing to the place, belong to the Cohanim. — Would you say that? There is a difference. Second-tithe is called \"holy,\" and requires bringing to the place, and redemption. And neta revai is called \"holy,\" and requires bringing to the place, and redemption. And this is not to be refuted by terumah, which, even though it is called \"holy,\" does not require bringing to the place, nor by bikkurim, which, even though they require bringing to the place, do not require redemption. I will learn a thing from a thing, and I will reason out a thing from a thing. I will learn a thing of three facets from a thing that is similar in (these) three facets, and I will not learn a thing of three facets from a thing which is not similar in (these) three facets, but only in one or two. If I have learned, then, that second-tithe belongs to the owners, then neta revai, too, should belong to the owners. R. Yossi says \"holy\" to the owners. You say \"holy\" to the owners, but perhaps it is \"holy\" to the Cohanim! — It is, therefore, written (of neta revai, Vayikra 19:25) \"And in the fifth year you may eat its fruit to increase for you its produce.\" For whom is it increased? For him to whom it has already been given (in the fourth year, i.e., the owner.)",

It is, therefore, written \"And every man, his holy things, to him shall they be\" — He has the option of giving them to any Cohein he wishes. \"And a man, his holy things, to him shall they be\": If one measured out (terumah) for them (certain Cohanim) on the ground and others (later) joined them, I might think that I pronounce over him \"Whatever a man gives to the Cohein, (in this instance the Cohein for whom he measured it out), to him (that Cohein) shall it be\"; it is, therefore, written \"And every man, his holy things, to him (the man) shall they be\" (i.e., he retains the option of giving it to those who came later). I might then think that if he measured it out (for him) in a basket and others joined later, I still pronounce over him \"And every man, his holy things, to him (the man) shall they be\" (and he can give it to the later ones); it is, therefore, (for such a circumstance) written \"Whatever a man gives to the Cohein, (in this instance, the first Cohein), to him (that Cohein) shall it be.\" R.

From (Devarim 24:1) \"If a man take a woman and he cohabit with her, etc.\", we hear only that if he had two witnesses (to her adultery) and she had not been forewarned, that she leaves him by divorce. But if she were adulterous in the presence of only one witness or it is in doubt whether she had or had not been adulterous after having been secreted (with the one she had been forewarned against), we did not hear what is to be done with her. It is, therefore, written \"Speak to the children of Israel and say to them: \"A man, a man, if his wife go astray, etc.\", that (in the above instance) she must drink the bitter waters. This is the intent of this section. \"A man, a man\": to include the wife of a deaf mute, an imbecile, one who has gone abroad or been incarcerated, or a dullard — that beth-din forewarns her (if she is deporting herself immodestly) to the end of invalidating her kethubah (her marriage contract). I might think, even to the end of making her drink (the bitter waters); it is, therefore, written (to negate this) (Ibid. 11) \"Then the man shall bring his wife.\" R. Yossi b. Yehudah says: also to the end of making her drink when her husband is released from incarceration. Variantly: \"A man, a man\": to include a woman awaiting levirate marriage (yibum). \"if his wife go astray\": Scripture speaks of those who are fit to be \"wives\" — to exclude a widow married to a high-priest, a divorcée or a chalutzah (one who has performed the chaliztah ceremony to break a levirate connection), who are married to a regular priest, a mamzereth or a Nethinah (a descendent of the Geveonites) married to an Israelite, and a daughter of an Israelite married to a Nathin or a mamzer. And, according to Akavya b. Mehallalel, (to exclude) a woman who is a proselyte or a freed slave. They (the sages) said to him (Akavya): But there was a freed slave, Charkemis, in Jerusalem, and Shemaya and Avtalyon had her drink (the bitter waters)! He replied: They dissimulated their doing so — whereupon they excommunicated him and he died in his state of excommunication, and beth-din stoned his coffin. (\"if his wife go astray,) and she is guilty of ma'al against him\": (\"ma'al\") In the area of illicit relations or in the area of monetary (fraudulence)? (Ibid. 5:13) \"And a man lie with her a lying of seed\" indicates that ma'al here is in the area of illicit relations, and not in that of monetary (fraudulence). \"and she is guilty of ma'al against him\": \"me'ilah\" in all places is \"lying.\" And thus is it written (I Chronicles 5:25) \"Vayimalu ('and they lied') against the G-d of their fathers,\" and (Joshua 7:1) \"And the children of Israel yimalu ma'al ('falsified') in respect to the ban,\" and (I Chronicles 10:13) \"And Saul died because of his falsification ('bema'alo ma'al') against the L-rd.\" And, in respect to Uzziyahu, king of Judah, (II Chronicles 26:18) \"Leave the sanctuary, for you have acted falsely (ma'alta),\" and (Vayikra 5:21) \"and he (the denier) ma'ala ma'al against the L-rd\" — whence we see that \"me'ilah\" in all places is \"lying.\"",

It is, therefore, written (\"and a man lie) with her,\" and not with her sister. Abba Channan says in the name of R. Eliezer: \"with her\": and not (if he lay with) with his mother-in-law; \"with her\": and not with one of the illicit relations.

If you say this (the latter), she is permitted to her husband. The former, then, is the case and not the latter. There are no witnesses to defiling, but there are witnesses to secreting. \"and she had secreted herself\": We have not been apprised of the (minimum) time of secreting; it is, therefore, written \"and she had secreted herself and she be defiled\": the (minimum) time for defilement — for intercourse; for he'arah (the initial stage) — for circling a palm tree. These are the words of R. Yishmael. R. Eliezer says: the (minimum) time for pouring a cup. R. Yehoshua says: for drinking it. Ben Azzai says: for frying an egg. R. Akiva says: for swallowing it. R. Yehudah b. Betheira says: for swallowing three eggs, one after the other. \"and there be no witness in her\": Is Scripture speaking of two witnesses or of one? It is, therefore, written (Devarim 19:15) \"There shall not arise one witness against a man for every transgression and for every sin.\" Why (emphasize) one? To serve as a prototype (binyan av), viz.: Wherever \"witness\" (alone) is mentioned, two are understood, unless Scripture specifies \"one.\" \"and she were not seized\": to exclude one who was forced. For it would follow (otherwise), viz.: If in the instance of \"light\" tumah (e.g., a widow (cohabiting) with a high-priest, where there is only a lav (transgression of a negative commandment), forced is equated with consenting, how much more so, in an instance of grave tumah, such as ours, where the penalty is death, forced should be equated with consenting; it is, therefore, written \"and she were not seized.\" Or, I might think (that this halachah obtains both) with (the wife of) an Israelite or of a Cohein; it is, therefore, written \"and she (the wife of an Israelite) were not seized\" — to exclude (from being forbidden to her husband) the wife of a Cohein, (who is forbidden to him even if she were forced.) (Ibid. 14) \"And there pass over him a spirit of rancor and he warn his wife\": optional (i.e., \"he may warm his wife.\") These are the words of R. Yishmael. R. Akiva says: mandatory (i.e., \"he must warn his wife.\") R. Akiva says: Why is \"venitma'ah\" (\"and she be tamei\") written three times, (5:14, 5:27, 5:29)? tumah vis-à-vis her husband, and vis-à-vis her cohabitor, and vis-à-vis (her eating) terumah (if she is the daughter of a Cohein). R. Yishmael says: If a divorcée, the \"lighter,\" (in that she may return to her divorcer), is unfit (for marriage) to the priesthood, how much more so sotah, the \"graver,\" (who may not return to her husband; and no verse is needed for this.) (Ibid. 5:14) \"and she were defiled … and she were not defiled\": What is the intent of this? If she were (positively) defiled, why does she drink? And if she were (positively) not defiled, why does he make her drink? Scripture hereby (by this ambiguity) comes to teach us that she drinks only in a case of doubt (as to whether or not) she were defiled. And from here you rule (accordingly) in the instance of (the tumah of sheretz) [a creeping thing], viz.: If in an instance (that of sotah), where unwittingness is not equated with wittingness (to make her tamei) or forcing to consent, doubt is equated with certainty (to forbid her to her husband until she drinks and resolves the doubt), then in an instance where unwittingness (of contact) is equated with wittingness, and forcing with consent, how much more so should doubt be equated with certainty! And just as here (for tumah to obtain, the locus of the act is) a private domain, there, too, it must be a private domain. Just as here we are dealing with a subject (the woman) which has the intelligence to be questioned, there, too, (for tumah to obtain), we must be dealing with a subject (e.g., the carrier of the sheretz) which has the intelligence to be questioned — whence they ruled: In a case of doubt involving a subject which has the intelligence to be questioned — in the private domain, the ruling is tamei; in the public domain, the ruling is tahor (clean). (In a case of doubt involving a subject) which lacks the intelligence to be questioned, both in the public and in the private domain, the ruling is tahor."

But they said: He is given two Torah scholars (as chaperones) on the way so that he not live with her. R. Yossi says: Her husband is trusted with her, a fortiori, viz. If he is trusted (to be alone) with his wife when she is a niddah, though the punishment for cohabiting with her is kareth, how much more so is he to be trusted with her when she is a sotah, cohabitation with whom is not liable to kareth! They replied: How much more so (is he not to be trusted with her!) If he is not liable to kareth he will not be deterred! Variantly: (The instance of niddah is no refutation). He may be trusted (to be alone with her) when she is a niddah, for she is permitted to him afterwards, but not with a sotah, who may not be permitted to him afterwards. According to the Torah, the husband brings his wife, it being written \"and the man (i.e., her husband) brings his wife to the Cohein.\" \"and he shall bring her offering for her\": Every offering devolving upon her. These are the words of R. Yehudah. The sages say: Any offering that permits her to him, such as that of a zavah and that of a woman who has given birth, she brings of what is his and it is not deducted from her kethubah. And any offering that does not permit her to him, such as that for taking a Nazirite vow or desecrating the Sabbath, she brings of what is hers and he deducts it from her kethubah. \"one-tenth of an ephah of meal\": Why state (\"of meal\")? For it would follow, since the offering of a sinner comes for a sin and this comes for a sin, that since the first comes only of fine flour, this, too, is to be only of fine flour; it is, therefore, written \"meal.\" \"barley\": Why? For it would follow, since the offering of a sinner comes for a sin and this comes for a sin, then this, too, should come only from wheat; it is, therefore, written \"barley.\" R. Gamliel said: Scribes, allow me, and I will interpret it symbolically, viz.: Just as her deeds were those of a beast, so, her food shall be that of a beast.\" He shall not pour oil upon it\": If he does, he transgresses a negative commandment. Would you say, then, that just as he transgresses (a negative commandment) with his oil so, he transgresses with his frankincense? Would you say that? (I would say that) he transgresses with oil, for he cannot remove it, but not with frankincense, for he can remove it.\" It is, therefore, written \"He shall not pour oil upon it\" and \"He shall not place frankincense upon it\" — so that if he places either oil or frankincense upon it he transgresses a negative commandment. Why is that? \"For it is an offering of rancors.\" \"rancors\": two rancors: rancor against her and rancor against her husband (and) just as there is rancor below, there is rancor Above. \"an offering of memorial\": I hear (from this, a \"memorial\" [i.e., a \"reminder\"] both of) merit and of liability; it is, therefore, written (afterwards, to negate this) \"a reminder of sin.\" All of the \"memorials\" in the Torah are for the good, except for this one, which is for punishment. These are the words of R. Tarfon. R. Akiva says: This one, too, is for the good, as it is written (Ibid. 28) \"And if the woman had not been defiled (in this concealment), and she be clean, then she shall be absolved (of the blighting waters), and she will sow seed.\" This (verse) tells me only \"a reminder of sin.\" Whence do I derive (that it is also) a reminder of merit? From \"an offering of memorial\" — in any event. R. Yishmael says: \"an offering of memorial\" — general; \"a reminder of sin\" — specific. (This is an instance of \"general-specific,\" (where the resolution is) — \"There obtains in the general only what is stated in the specific,\" (i.e., that it is a memorial of sin and not of merit.) For, (if not for this principle) the \"contender\" could argue. Which attribute (of the L-rd) is stronger? That for good or that for punishment? Certainly, that for good (viz. Shemot 34:7) If the attribute of punishment diminished (that of good), it would be a reminder of sin, but since the attribute of good is stronger, it follows that it should be a reminder of merit. This is an attribute of the Torah: Whenever a \"general-specific\" (application) defeats an a fortiori (application [as in the above]) — If both can be satisfied, the a fortiori (application) is not to be defeated. How can both be satisfied (in our instance) without the a fortiori (application) being defeated? (As follows:) If she had been defiled, then punishment visits her immediately. And if she has a certain merit, that merit may suspend (the operation of the bitter waters) for three months so that the fetus is recognizable. These are the words of Abba Yossi b. Channan. R. Eliezer b. Yitzchak of Kfar Darom says: For nine months, as it is written (Ibid. 28) \"and if she is clean, then she will sow seed. Just as \"seed\" connotes nine months, so, merit (can suspend for) nine months. R. Yishmael says: Twelve months. And even though there is no proof for this, there is intimation of it in (Daniel 4:24-26) \"O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you … All this befell King Nevuchadnezzar. At the end of twelve months, etc.\" R. Shimon b. Yochai says: Merit does not suspend (the operation of) the blighting waters. For if you say that it does, you \"dilute\" the (deterrence of the) bitter waters before all women, and they will drink them; and you cast an evil name upon the clean ones who drank. For people will say: They were really defiled, but their merit suspended (the operation of the waters). Rebbi says: I can determine (whether or not she was clean). If she were clean, in the end, she will die, as all men do, and if she had been defiled, she will die as depicted by Scripture, viz. (Bamidbar 5:27) \"and her belly will swell and her thigh will fall.\" R. Shimon says: Who is going to inform all of the standersby that she will die and her belly will swell and her thigh will fall? But (if she were guilty), then as soon as she drank, her face would turn green and her eyes would bulge, and her veins would swell in her, and they would say: Hurry and take her out so that she not defile the azarah (the Temple court)!"

R. Yishmael said: From here (i.e., from the fact that he is to uncover her hair) we derive an exhortation for the daughters of Israel to cover their hair. And though there is no proof for this, there is an intimation of it in (II Samuel 13:19) \"And Tamar put earth upon her head … and she put her hand on her head.\" R. Yehudah says: If her top-knot were beautiful, he did not expose it, and if her hair were beautiful, he did not dishevel it. If she were dressed in white, she is dressed in black. If black were becoming to her, she is divested of it and clothed in ungainly garments.

How, then, am I to understand \"to swell the belly and to make fall the thigh\"? As referring to the adulterer, Scripture apprising us that just as punishment overtakes her, so, it overtakes him. Now does this not follow a fortiori, viz.: If re the attribute of punishment, the \"weaker\" attribute (of the Holy One Blessed be He), if one brings misfortune to his neighbor, he suffers likewise, then re the attribute of benefaction, (the stronger attribute, if one bring benefit to his neighbor,) how much more so (is he benefitted himself!) (Ibid. 22) \"and the woman shall say 'Amen,' 'Amen.'\": \"Amen\" that I have not become unclean; \"Amen\" that I will not become unclean, (in which instance the bitter waters operate retroactively). These are the words of R. Meir. And the sags do not agree, (but they say) \"Amen\" that I have not become unclean (i.e., acceptance of the oath) and (\"Amen\" that) if I have become unclean, they (the waters) should enter her (i.e., acceptance of the curse). \"Amen\" in respect to this man (the suspected adulterer); \"Amen\" in respect to any other man; \"Amen\" when betrothed — \"Amen\" when married; \"Amen\" when awaiting levirate marriage — \"Amen\" after levirate marriage. This is the rule: For a woman to be lived with and (thereby) to be forbidden (to her husband), the stipulated conditions must be those of that time (i.e., while she is still married to him [and not, e.g., before betrothal or after divorce]).",
            " Since oaths are mentioned in the Torah generically, and in one case (that of sotah) it is specifically indicated that the oath must be accompanied by a curse, I derive that the same must obtain with all oaths in the Torah. Since in one case (that of sotah) it is specifically indicated that the oath must be administered under the Name \"yod-keh,\" I derive the same for all oaths in the Torah. And since oaths are mentioned generically in the Torah, and of one of them (sotah), it was specified that it be (answered) with \"Amen,\" so, I derive that the same holds true for all oaths in the Torah. Abba Channan says in the name of R. Eliezer: (\"Amen\" is repeated here) to include the oath administered by the judges, that it be answered by \"Amen.\" For if it is not answered by \"Amen,\" it is rendered a \"vain oath\" (in the name of the L-rd.) Since oaths are mentioned generically in the Torah, and in one case (sotah) it is specifically indicated that a previous oath (i.e., an oath for a previous matter) can be \"rolled\" onto it (e.g., When she answers \"Amen\" to not having been defiled by this man, she also answers \"Amen\" to not having been defiled by another, etc.), I derive the same for all of the oaths in the Torah. Now does this not follow a fortiori, viz.: If in the instance of sotah, where no previous claim has been made against her, a previous oath is \"rolled\" onto her, then, in instances of thefts, where previous claims have been made, how much more so may previous oaths be \"rolled\" onto them!"

Wherever \"before the L-rd\" is written, the east is intended unless specified otherwise. \"and he shall wave the offering before the L-rd, and he shall present it at the (south-west corner of the) altar\" — whereby we are taught that the offering of the sotah requires waving and presentation. (Ibid. 26) \"And the Cohein shall take a fistful from the offering as its 'remembrance,' and he shall smoke it on the altar.\": This refers to the smoking of the fistful, which is called \"remembrance\" (viz.

From that limb whence the sin began, from that limb will the punishment begin! Similarly, (Bereshit 7:23) \"And He blotted out every being upon the face of the ground — from man until beast.\" He who began the sin, from him will the punishment begin! Similarly, (Ibid. 19:11) \"And the men at the entrance of the house they smote with blindness, from small to great.\" They who began the sin, from them the punishment began.

If there were witnesses, but she had not been forewarned, she is not liable to the death penalty. (I would think that) since she is not liable to the death penalty she is permitted to her husband; it is, therefore, written (Devarim 24:1) \"If a man take a woman (as a wife) and cohabit with her … having found in her a thing of nakedness … he shall write her a scroll of divorce, etc.\" — whence we learn that she is forbidden to her husband.

(i.e., the section of vows has already been stated!) — Because it is written (Ibid. 30:3) \"A man if he vow a vow to the L-rd, or if he take an oath to bind upon his soul, etc.\", whence if he vows (to forbid) something for one day it is forbidden for one day; for two days, it is forbidden for two days; (to forbid) a specific thing, that specific thing is forbidden — I would think that the same is true of Naziritism. It is, therefore, written (here) \"Speak to the children of Israel, etc.\" that if he vowed (Naziritism, to forbid something to himself) for one day or for one moment, it is forbidden to him for thirty days. And he is forbidden to drink wine and to render himself tamei for the dead and to cut his hair. This is the intent of this section. \"a man or a woman\": to equate women with men (in respect to Naziritism). For it would follow (otherwise), viz.: If, where minors are equated with adults, (i.e., in respect to Cohanim not rendering themselves tamei for the dead, viz. Vayikra 21:1), women are not equated with men, then here (in respect to Naziritism), where minors are not equated with adults, how much more so should women not be equated with men! It is, therefore, written \"a man or a woman,\" to equate women with men. \"a man\": and not a minor. For it would follow (otherwise), viz.: If, where women are not equated with men (see above), minors are equated with adults, then here, (in respect to Naziritism), where women are equated with men, how much more so should minors be equated with adults! It is, therefore, written \"a man,\" and not a minor. \"if he shall declare\": to include (Naziritism as obtaining with) one who knows how to declare (i.e., one who is cognizant of the import of what he is saying.) From here they ruled: The vows of a girl of eleven years and one day are examined (for such cognizance); of twelve years and one day — her vows stand. The vows of a boy of twelve years and one day are examined; of thirteen years and one day — his vows stand. \"if he declare\": willingly, and not under coercion. — But perhaps even under coercion! — It follows (that they must be willing), viz.: It is written here \"declare,\" and, in respect to vows and gifts (Vayikra 22:21) \"declare.\" Just as there, willingly; here, too, willingly. \"to vow a vow\": I might think that even if he vows to bring an offering he becomes a Nazirite; it is, therefore, written \"to make a Nazirite\" — he must make the vow of a Nazirite. I might think (from \"to make a Nazirite\") that he may make even others Nazirites. It is, therefore, written \"nazir,\" (which connotes that) he makes himself a Nazirite, and not others. If so, why is it written (lit.,) \"nazir, to make a nazir\"? To equate epithets of Naziritism with Naziritism and \"signals\" of Naziritism with Naziritism. This tells me only of Naziritism. Whence do I derive (the same for) vows? From \"the vow of a Nazirite,\" to equate vows with Naziritism and Naziritism with vows, viz.: Just as in Naziritism, epithets of Naziritism are equated with Naziritism, and signals of Naziritism are equated with Naziritism, so, with vows, epithets of vows are equated with vows, and signals of vows are equated with vows. And just as vows are subject to transgression of (Bamidbar 30:3) \"He shall not profane his word\" and (Devarim 23:22) \"You shall not delay to pay it,\" so, Naziritism. And just as with vows a father may void the vows of his daughter, and a husband, the vows of his wife, so, with Naziritism. R. Yehoshua says: \"to make a Nazirite\": (to make) even others (Nazirites, e.g., a father, vis-à-vis his son). \"to make a Nazirite to the L-rd\": It is a mitzvah to become a Nazirite to the L-rd. Shimon Hatzaddik said: I never ate the guilt-offering of a Nazirite who had become unclean (by contact with a dead body) but once. Once a Nazirite came to me from the south. His eyes were beautiful, he was very handsome, and his hair was wavy. I said to him: \"What prompted you to destroy this beautiful hair?\" (at the end of the Nazirite period). He answered: \"I was a shepherd for my father in my town. Once, while drawing water from the well, I gazed upon my reflection and my evil inclination seized hold of me and threatened to snatch me from the world — whereupon I said to it: 'Empty one, why do you vaunt yourself in a world that is not yours, where you are destined to be consigned to worms and maggots?

Ibid. 4). For (without this verse) it would follow that since a mourner is forbidden to drink wine (viz. Devarim 26:14) and a Nazirite is forbidden to drink wine, then since I have learned about a mourner that wine of mitzvah (i.e., second-tithe wine) was not equated with optional wine, (the first being forbidden, and the second, permitted), also, in the instance of a Nazirite, wine of mitzvah is not to be equated with optional wine, (i.e., the second, being forbidden, the first must be permitted, [wherefore the verse is needed to tell us that mitzvah wine, too, is forbidden to a Nazirite]). — No, this may be so in the instance of a mourner, where mitzvah eating was not equated with optional eating, (the first being forbidden, and the second, permitted,) wherefore mitzvah wine was not equated with optional wine. But in the instance of the Nazirite, we would say that just as mitzvah eating was equated with optional eating, so, mitzvah wine should be equated with optional wine, (and both should be forbidden. Why, then, is the verse needed to tell us this?). And, furthermore, it follows a fortiori (that mitzvah wine is forbidden to a Nazirite,) viz.: If in the instance of an officiating (Cohein in the Temple), where the rind was not equated with the fruit, nor eating with drinking, nor the eating of grapes with the drinking of wine, (only the last being forbidden), mitzvah wine was equated with optional wine, (both being forbidden, viz. [Vayikra 10:9]), then in the instance of the Nazirite, where the rind was equated with the fruit (both being forbidden), and eating with drinking, and the eating of grapes with the drinking of wine, how much more so, should mitzvah wine be equated with optional wine (and be forbidden!) Why, then, is the verse needed? — No, (i.e., it is needed.) This (i.e., what you have said), may be so with the officiating (Cohein), whose punishment (for drinking) is death, wherefore mitzvah wine was equated with optional wine, whereas in the instance of the Nazirite, whose punishment (for drinking) is not death, we would say that mitzvah wine was not to be equated with optional wine, (and should be permitted.) It must, therefore, be written \"From wine and strong drink he shall separate himself,\" to equate mitzvah wine with optional wine (as forbidden). R. Yossi Haglili says: What is the intent of \"From wine and strong drink he shall separate himself\"? Because it is written (Devarim 14:23) \"and you shall eat before the L-rd your G-d … the (second-) tithe of your grain and wine, etc.\", I might think that even Nazirites are included. And how would I satisfy \"From wine and strong drink he shall separate himself\"? With other wines, excluding mitzvah wines. Or even with mitzvah wines. And how would I satisfy \"and you shall eat, etc.\"? With other men, aside from Nazirites. Or even with Nazirites. It is, therefore, written \"From wine and strong drink he shall separate himself\" — to equate mitzvah wine with optional wine (as forbidden.) Abba Chanan says in the name of R. Eliezer: Why is it written \"From wine and strong drink he shall separate himself\"? For it would follow: Since he (a Nazirite) is forbidden to defile himself (for the dead) and he is forbidden (to drink) wine, then if I learn that (for a Nazirite) a meth-mitzvah [(one who, lacking kin, it is a mitzvah for everyone to bury)] is not equated with a non-meth-mitzvah, then mitzvah wine, likewise, should not be equated with optional wine (to be forbidden.) And, further, it would follow a fortiori, viz.: If (dead-body) tumah, which voids (one's elapsed period of Nazaritism) does not equate a meth-mitzvah with a non meth-mitzvah, (it being a mitzvah for a Nazirite to render himself tamei for the first, but forbidden to do so for the second), how much more so should mitzvah wine, which does not void (his lapsed Naziritism) not be equated with optional wine (to be forbidden)! It must, therefore, be written \"From wine and strong drink he shall separate himself\" to equate mitzvah wine with optional wine (as forbidden). \"From yayin (wine) and shechar he shall separate himself\": Now yayin is shechar, and shechar is yayin! — But the Torah (sometimes) speaks in two tongues (i.e., synonymously). Similarly: Shechitah (slaughtering) is zevichah, and zevichah is shechitah. Kemitzah (taking the fistful) is haramah, and haramah is kemitzah. Amuka (lowland) is shefelah, and shefelah is amukah. Oth (a sign) is mofeth, and mofeth is oth — but the Torah (sometimes) speaks in two tongues. Here, too — \"From yayin and shechar he shall separate himself\": Now yayin is shechar and shechar is yayin. But the Torah (sometimes) speaks in two tongues. R. Elazar Hakappar says: \"yayin\" is diluted; shechar is undiluted. You say this, but perhaps the reverse is the case! — From(Bamidbar 28:7) \"And its libation a fourth of a hin for the one lamb. On the holy place (i.e., the altar) shall it be poured (connoting \"undiluted\"), a pouring of shechar to the L-rd,\" you must deduce that \"yayin\" is diluted, and \"shechar,\" undiluted. \"From wine and strong drink yazir\": \"nezirah\" in all places connotes separation, viz. (Vayikra 22:2) \"and they shall separate (\"veyinazru\") from the holy things of the children of Israel,\" and (Ibid. 25:5) \"The after-growth of your harvest you shall not reap (in the sabbatical year), and the guarded (\"nezirecha,\" lit., \"separated\") grapes of your vine you shall not gather,\" and (Hoshea 9:10)) \"And they came to Baal-peor and 'separated themselves' ('vayinazru') to shame,\" and (Zechariah 7:3) \"Shall I weep in the fifth month (Tisha B'av), separating myself (\"hinazer\"), etc.\" We find, then, that in all places \"nezirah\" connotes separation. \"From wine and shechar he shall separate himself\": I might think, (even) from selling wine or healing (himself with it); it is, therefore, written \"he shall not drink,\" but he is permitted to sell it or to heal himself with it. \"Vinegar of wine and vinegar of shechar he shall not drink\": We are hereby taught that vinegar is equated with wine. For (without the verse) it would follow (otherwise), viz.: Since an officiating Cohein may not drink wine, then if I have learned that in his case vinegar is not equated with wine, then for a Nazirite, too, vinegar should not be equated with wine. And, furthermore, this should follow a fortiori, viz.: If (in the instance of) an officiating Cohein, whose punishment (for drinking wine) is death, vinegar is not equated with wine, then (in the instance of) a Nazirite, whose punishment is not death, how much more so should vinegar not be equated with wine! (The verse then is needed) to tell us that vinegar is equated with wine. And just as mitzvah wine is equated with optional wine, so, mitzvah vinegar (i.e., second-tithe vinegar) is equated with optional vinegar. What is the intent of \"and any steeping of grapes he shall not eat\"? We are hereby taught that if he steeped grapes in water, and the taste (of the grapes) was transmitted to the water, it is forbidden. And this serves as a paradigm for everything forbidden by the Torah, viz.: If (in the instance of) a Nazirite, whose prohibition (re wine) is not for all time, (but only for the period of his Naziritism), and whose prohibition does not extend to derivation of benefit (e.g., selling and healing), and whose prohibition is subject to release (by absolution of his Naziritism), the taste (of the forbidden substance) was regarded as the substance itself, then the other prohibitions in the Torah, whose prohibitions are for all time, and whose prohibition extends to derivation of benefit, and whose prohibition is not subject to release — how much more so should the taste (of the forbidden substance) be regarded as the substance itself! \"and grapes\": Why is this written? It follows (logically) even without being stated, viz.: If he is liable for what issues from the fruit (i.e., wine), should he not be liable for the fruit itself! Rather, what is the intent of \"wet\" grapes\"? To include (as forbidden) half-ripe grapes. You say \"to include half-ripe grapes. But perhaps its intent is to exclude dry grapes? (This cannot be) for \"and dry\" includes dry grapes. What, then, is the intent of \"wet\"? For (without the verse) it would follow (otherwise), viz.: He is liable for wine and he is liable for grapes. Just as wine is a finished fruit (i.e., product), so, grapes must be a finished product (and not half-ripe). It is, therefore, written \"wet\" to include half-ripe grapes (as forbidden). Issi b. Yehudah says: What is the intent of \"grapes wet and dry\"? To impose liability for each in itself (i.e., eating \"wet\" and \"dry\" grapes together is regarded as two separate transgressions though one kind of fruit is eaten). (And this serves as a paradigm for all prohibitions in the Torah.) Let it be written \"and dry grapes he shall not eat\" (i.e., \"wet\" is understood from \"grapes itself,\" and only \"dry\" need be written.) If it were stated thus, all dried fruits would be understood (to be forbidden). \"wet\" and \"dry\" (in this context) implies what issues from the vine wet and then dried up."

And this serves as a paradigm for all of the prohibitions of the Torah, viz.: If (in the instance of) a Nazirite, whose prohibition (re wine) is not for all time, (but only for the period of his Naziritism), and whose prohibition does not extend to the derivation of benefit, and whose prohibition is subject to release (by absolution of his Naziritism), separate elements (in an injunction) combine with each other to (form the forbidden) olive-size, then the other prohibitions of the Torah, whose prohibitions are for all time, and whose prohibition extends to derivation of benefit, and whose prohibition is not subject to release — how much more so do they combine with each other to (form the forbidden) olive-size! \"of all that is made from the grape-vine\": I might think that leaves and sprouts, too, (are included); it is, therefore, written \"from the kernels to the husk\": Just as the specific instance is of fruit (kernel) and residue of fruit (husk), so, only these are included (in the prohibition), to exclude leaves and sprouts, (which do not satisfy these parameters). R. Eliezer says: Leaves and sprouts are also subsumed in \"of all that is made from the grape-vine.\" \"from the chartzanim to the zag he shall not eat\": The minimum (amount for transgression) — two kernels, one husk. These are the words of R. Eliezer b. Azaryah. Which are the chartzanim and which are the zagim? \"chartzanim\" are the outer, and \"zagim\" are the inner. These are the words of R. Yehudah. R. Yossi says: So that you not err, (they are) like the bells (\"zugim\") of an animal: the outer (part) is the \"zag\"; the inner (the clapper) is the \"inbal.\" \"From the kernels to the husk he shall not eat\": We are hereby apprised that \"pained eating\" (as in eating kernels and husk) does not free him from liability. For it would follow (otherwise), viz.: If for the graver — Yom Kippur — one is not liable for \"pained eating,\" should this not be so for the lesser, Naziritism? It is, therefore, written \"From the kernels to the husk he shall not eat.\": Why is this written\" (i.e., it may be derived from the preceding verse, viz.:) \"of all that is made of the grape-vine … he shall not eat\" — general. \"From wine and strong drink he shall separate himself. Vinegar of wine and vinegar of strong drink he shall not drink\" — particular. (We have here an instance of) general-particular. (The rule is:) There is subsumed in the general only what is in the particular. Just as the particular is \"fruit (wine) and residue of fruit (vinegar),\" so, I derive (as forbidden) anything which is \"fruit and residue of fruit\" — including kernels and husk, which satisfy that parameter! (Why, then is \"from the kernels to the husk\" needed?) — Perhaps, just as the particular is an \"actual\" fruit, so, I may derive only an \"actual\" fruit. — (No!) Which \"actual\" fruit has not been mentioned? You must revert, then, to the original formulation, (and the question remains:) If I can derive it from the rule, why need \"from the kernels to the husk\" be stated? We are hereby taught that (in the instance of) a \"general\" which adds to the \"particular,\" what is to be derived is not (of necessity) to be of the same nature as the \"particular\" to remove it from the \"general\" (formulation) unless Scripture indicates it specifically, as it does in the instance of the Nazirite."

Whence do I derive that he also receives forty lashes for tearing, plucking, and trimming? From \"holy shall he be,\" in any event. These are the words of R. Yoshiyah. R. Yonathan says: Scripture speaks (only) of a blade. If he tore, plucked, or trimmed, he does not receive stripes. \"until the fulfillment of the days of his Naziritism to the L-rd\": Whence is it derived that if one vows to be a Nazirite without qualifying (for how long), he shaves on the thirty-first day, and if he shaved on the thirtieth day he has fulfilled his obligations? From \"until the fulfillment of the day of his Naziritism to the L-rd\" — and they have been fulfilled. I might think that even if he vowed a one hundred day Naziritism and he shaved on the thirty-first day he has fulfilled his obligation; it is, therefore, written \"until the fulfillment of his days,\" and he has not yet fulfilled them. This tells me (only) of one whose (period of) Naziritism is limited. Whence do I derive (the same for) one who vowed \"eternal\" Naziritism (i.e., that he must be a Nazirite all of his days)? From \"all the days of the vow of his Naziritism … holy shall he be.\" \"holy shall he be\": You say that this refers to holiness of (i.e., not shaving) the hair. But perhaps it refers to the holiness of the body (i.e., not to become defiled by the dead). (This is not so, for) (Ibid. 8) \"He is holy to the L-rd\" speaks of holiness of the body. How, then, am I to understand \"holy shall he be\"? As referring to holiness of the hair, \"holy shall he be\": What is the intent of this? Because it is written (Ibid. 18) \"And the Nazirite shall shave at the door of the tent of meeting,\" I would think that only the hair of one who shaves as prescribed is forbidden and imposes constraints. How would I know (that the same applies) if vandals shaved him? From \"holy shall he be\" — in any event. R. Yossi says: Why is it written \"holy shall he be\"? Because it is written \"he shall let grow the locks of the hair of his head,\" I might think (that Naziritism obtains only) with one who has hair. Whence do I derive (that it also obtains) with one who does not have hair? From \"holy shall he be\" — in any event. R. Yonathan says: It is not needed (for the above), for it is written (Ibid. 7) \"for the crown of his G-d is on his head\" — whether or not he has hair. What, then, is the intent of \"holy shall he be\"? As we stated above (in respect to \"eternal\" Naziritism). Unqualified Naziritism is thirty days, it being written \"holy shall he be (\"yiheyeh\"): The numerical equivalent of \"yiheyeh\" is thirty. \"he shall let grow the locks of the hair of his head.\" Why is this written? (i.e., it is already written \"a blade shall not pass over his head.\") It is written (of a leper, Vayikra 14:9) \"And it shall be on the seventh day that he shall shave all of his hair.\" This implies even a Nazirite (leper). And how would I understand \"he shall let grow the locks of the hair of his head\"? As applying to other Nazirites, excluding the leper. Or, perhaps, even a Nazirite (leper). It is, therefore, written \"he shall let grow the locks ('pera') of the hair of his head.\" From here you learn of the leper, of whom it is written (Vayikra 13:45) \"And his head shall be parua\" that \"parua\" means \"grown long.\" You say it means that, but perhaps it is to be taken literally (as meaning \"uncovered.\") You, therefore, reason as follows: It is written here (in respect to a leper) \"parua,\" and elsewhere, (in respect to a Nazirite) \"parua\" (i.e., \"pera,\" like \"parua\"). Just as there (re Nazirite), \"parua\" means growing the hair, so, \"parua\" here (re leper) means growing the hair. \"All the days of the vow of his Naziritism (a blade shall not pass over his head.\"): (A Nazirite who shaved his head at the end of his period of Naziritism [before he brought the offering, etc.] is liable,) it being written \"All the days of the vow of his Naziritism a blade shall not pass over his head\" — to include the days after the termination of his period of Naziritism before the bringing of his offering (as in the above-cited instance) as equivalent (for liability) to the days in the midst of his Naziritism. — But perhaps he is liable (for shaving his head) only if he does so before he completes his period of Naziritism! — (No,) it follows (that this is not so,) viz.: Since he is forbidden to drink wine and he is forbidden to shave, if I have learned about wine that the days after the termination of his period of Naziritism before the bringing of his offering were equated with the days in the midst of the period of his Naziritism, the same must be true of shaving. And, furthermore, this follows a fortiori, viz.: If re wine, the drinking of which does not void (the count of his preceding Nazirite days), the days after his Nazirite period before the bringing of his offering were equated (for liability) with the days in the midst of his Nazirite period, then re shaving, which does void (the Nazirite count), how much more so should this be true! — (No,) this may be true of the drinking of wine, where no act in its category (the drinking of wine by a Nazirite) was permitted — wherefore the days after his Nazirite period before the bringing of the offering were equated with the days in the midst of his Nazirite period — but would you say the same for shaving, where an act in its category (the shaving of a Nazirite leper on the seventh day) was permitted — wherefore we would say that the days after his Nazirite period before the bringing of the offering were not equated with the days in the midst of his Nazirite period! — (No!) This is refuted by the instance of tumah (a Nazir's defiling himself with a dead body), where though there is an act in its category which is permitted (i.e., a Nazir's defiling himself for a meth mitzvah [one who has no kin to bury him]), still the days after his Nazirite period before the bringing of the offering were equated with the days in the midst of his Nazirite period! And this would indicate about shaving, that even though there is an act in its category which is permitted, still, the days after the Nazirite period before the bringing of the offering are to be equated with the days in the midst of the Nazirite period. — No, this may be true of tumah, which voids the whole (previous) count, which is not so with shaving, which does not void the whole. I have not succeeded (in proving the equality) with my a fortiori argument. It is, therefore, written (Ibid. 20) \"and thereafter (i.e., after bringing the offering), the Nazirite may drink wine.\" Now may a Nazirite drink wine? But (the idea is that) it (the word \"Nazirite\") is \"extra\" to signal a gezeirah shavah (identity), viz.: it is written here (in respect to shaving [6:5]) \"nazir,\" and it is written elsewhere (20) \"nazir\" (in respect to the drinking of wine). Just as with (the \"extra\") \"nazir\" there, the days after his Nazirite period before the bringing of the offering are equated with the days in the midst of the Nazirite period, so, with shaving. (6:5) \"He shall let grow the locks of the hair of his head.\" Why is this written? (i.e., it is already written [Ibid.] \"a blade shall not pass over his head until the fulfillment of the days when he is a Nazirite to the L-rd.\") From \"until the fulfillment of the days,\" I would think that this (\"fulfillment\") is satisfied by a minimum of two days; it is, therefore, written \"He shall let grow the hair of the locks of his head.\" How long does this take? Not less than thirty days. But (if he said: I will be a Nazirite) a month and above — even a month and one day or a month and two days, (he is a Nazirite for any period superadded.)"

R. Yishmael says: This (proof) is not needed, for it is written \"he shall not come.\" Scripture is speaking of a (dead) soul that confers tumah by entry (into his tent, [i.e., the soul of a man, and not that of a beast]). (6:7) \"For his father and his mother … he shall not become tamei\" — but he does become tamei for a meth-mitzvah (one who has no one to bury him). Why need this be stated? It is understood a fortiori, viz.: If the high-priest, whose holiness is permanent, becomes tamei for a meth-mitzvah, how much more so, a Nazirite, whose holiness is temporary! — No, this may be true of a high-priest, who does not bring an offering for his uncleanliness — wherefore he becomes tamei for a meth-mitzvah, as opposed to a Nazirite, who does bring an offering for his uncleanliness — wherefore he should not become tamei for a meth-mitzvah! It must, therefore, be written \"For his father and his mother he shall not become tamei\" — but he does become tamei for a meth-mitzvah. — But perhaps the intent of the verse is: \"For his father and his mother … he shall not become tamei,\" but he does become for other dead! — Would you say such a thing? If an ordinary Cohein, who does become tamei for his kin, may not become tamei for other dead, how much more so a Nazirite, who may not become tamei for his kin! What, then, is the intent of \"For his father and his mother … he shall not become tamei? He does not become tamei for his father and his mother, but he does become tamei for a meth-mitzvah. — But even without this verse, I can derive it by reasoning, viz.: There is a general rule for a high-priest (Vayikra 21:11: \"And upon all souls of the dead he shall not come\"), and there is a general rule for a Nazirite (\"Upon the soul of a dead one he shall not come.\") Just as with the general rule for the high-priest, he may not become tamei for kin, so with the general rule for the Nazirite, he may not become tamei for kin. You derive it from the high-priest, but I can derive it from an ordinary priest, viz.: There is a general rule for an ordinary priest and there is a general rule for a Nazirite. Just as with the general rule for the ordinary priest he does become tamei for kin, so, with the general rule for the Nazirite, he should become tamei for kin. It must, therefore, be written \"For his father and his mother; for his brother and for his sister, he shall not become tamei, etc.\" R. Akiva says (on Vayikra 21:11): \"souls\" — these are the distant (i.e., non-kin); \"the dead\" — these are kin; \"for his (the high-priest's) father and his mother\" — For his father and his mother he does not become tamei, but he does become tamei for a meth-mitzvah. (Bamidbar 6:7) \"for his brother\": If he were a high-priest or a Nazirite, he may not become tamei, but he does become tamei for a meth-mitzvah. \"and for his sister\": What is the intent of this? If one (an ordinary Cohein) were going to slaughter his Paschal lamb or to circumcise his son, and he hears that one of his kin had died, I might think that he should become tamei for them; it is, therefore, written (Ibid.) \"he shall not become tamei.\" I might think that he should (also) not become tamei for a meth-mitzvah; it is, therefore, written \"and for his sister\" — He does not become tamei for his sister, but he does become tamei for a meth-mitzvah. But (a verse) is not needed for his (young) son and daughter; for minors cannot become Nazirites. \"he shall not become tamei for them in their death\": In their death he does not become tamei for them, but he does become tamei for them in their leprous or zivah (genital discharge) state. This tells me only of a Nazirite. Whence do I derive (the same for) a high-priest? It is written in respect to a high-priest (Vayikra 21:11) \"for his mother (he shall not) become tamei.\" This is superfluous, for I can derive it a fortiori, viz.: If in an instance where an ordinary Cohein may become tamei for his father's brother, a high-priest may not become tamei for his father, then in an instance where an ordinary Cohein may not become tamei for his father's brother, how much more so may a high-priest not become tamei for his father! If I can derive it, then, a fortiori, why is the verse \"for his mother, etc.\" needed in respect to a high-priest? It is \"extra,\" to the end of formulating an identity (gezeirah shavah ), viz.: It is written \"his mother\" here (in respect to a high-priest), and it is written \"his mother\" elsewhere (in respect to a Nazirite). Just as there he does become tamei (for them) in their leprous or zivah state, so, here. Variantly: \"He shall not become tamei for them in their death\": In their death he may not become tamei for them, but he may stand at their eulogy and in the mourner's row.

It is, therefore, written \"and the first days shall fall off\" — One who has first \"days\" (plural), voids, but this one does not have (them). \"because his Naziritism was tamei\": Tumah voids all, but shaving does not void all. For it would follow (otherwise), viz.: If tumah (i.e., making himself tamei) is forbidden and shaving is forbidden, if I have learned that tumah voids all, shaving, too, should void all. And, furthermore, it follows a fortiori, viz.: If tumah, where the defiler (i.e., one who makes a Nazirite tamei) is not equated (for liability) with the defiled (i.e., the Nazirite who makes himself tamei), (if tumah) voids all, then shaving, where the shaver (of a Nazirite) is equated (for liability) with the shaved (i.e., the Nazirite who shaves himself), how much more so should he void all! It is, therefore, written \"because his Naziritism was tamei\" — Tumah voids all, but shaving does not void all, (but just the first thirty days). This (6:11 \"and he shall hallow his head to that day\") tells me only that the days of his tumah are not counted towards his Naziritism. Whence do I derive (the same for) the days of his confirmation (as a leper)? (i.e., If the Nazirite were a leper, and the Cohein quarantined him, and the plague-spot spread, and he were confirmed as tamei — Whence do I derive that the days of his confirmation are not counted towards his Naziritism?) And it follows (that they should not be counted, viz.: Since the days of his (Nazirite) tumah require shaving and the bringing of an offering, as do the days of confirmation (as a leper), then if I have learned about the days of his tumah that they are not counted towards his Naziritism, so should I learn about the days of his confirmation (as a leper). — No, this may be true of the days of his tumah, which void the preceding days, wherefore they are not counted towards his Naziritism. But would you say the same for the days of his confirmation, which do not void the preceding days? — wherefore they should be counted! Would you say that? It follows a fortiori (that they should not be counted), viz.: If one who undertakes Naziritism in the cemetery, whose hair is susceptible of shaving (for new Naziritism after he leaves the cemetery) — If his preceding days are not counted towards his Naziritism, then the days of his (leprosy) confirmation, when his hair is not susceptible of the shaving for Naziritism, how much more so should they not be counted. And the same (i.e., that they are not counted towards his Naziritism) is true for the days of his counting (seven days outside of his tent, Vayikra 14:8).",
            " Or, (perhaps we should say): Just as the days of his confirmation are not counted, so, the days of his quarantine should not be counted. And this would follow, viz.: Just as the days of his confirmation are subject to the tumah of mishkav (the couch) and moshav (the seat [of the leper]), as are the days of his quarantine, then if I have learned about the days of his confirmation that they are not counted (towards his Naziritism), so, should I learn about the days of his quarantine. — No, this may be true of the days of his confirmation, which require shaving and an offering (for his leprosy), wherefore they are not counted (towards his Naziritism). But would you say (the same for) the days of his quarantine, which do not require shaving or an offering (for his leprosy)? — wherefore they should be counted. From here they ruled: The days of the confirmation of a leper and the (seven) days of his counting are not counted (towards his Naziritism), but the days of zav and zavah (a man and a woman with a genital discharge) and the days of quarantine of a leper are counted (towards his Naziritism).",

(i.e., If he undertook a thirty-day Naziritism and completed it but had not yet brought an offering, he may not become tamei for the dead until he does so.) Or, perhaps he is liable for tumah only until he completes his period of Naziritism, (even if he has not yet brought the offering.) You reason (as follows): Since a Nazirite is forbidden to drink wine and to become tamei, then if I have learned re wine that the days after his Naziritism are equated with the days in the midst of his Naziritism until he brings the offering, so, re tumah. And, furthermore, it follows a fortiori, viz.: If with wine, which does not void (the count), the days after the Naziritism are equated with the days in the midst of the Naziritism until he brings the offering, how much more so (should this obtain) with tumah, which does void the count! — No, this may be so with wine, where no act in its category (the drinking of wine) is permitted (to a Nazirite,) wherefore the days after the Naziritism are equated with the days in the midst of the Naziritism — as opposed to tumah, where an act in its category (i.e., meth-mitzvah) is permitted — wherefore the days after the Naziritism are not to be equated with the days in the midst of the Naziritism before the bringing of the offering. This is refuted by shaving (i.e., the shaving of a Nazirite leper on the seventh day), where an act in its category (the category of shaving) is permitted, in spite of which the days after the Naziritism are equated with the days in the midst of the Naziritism before the bringing of the offering. And, furthermore, it follows a fortiori, viz.: If with shaving, which does not void the whole (count), the days after the Naziritism are equated with the days in the midst of the Naziritism before the bringing of the offering, then with tumah, which does void the whole, how much more so! — No, this may be so with shaving, where the shaver was equated (for liability) with the shaved one (i.e., the Nazirite who shaves himself) — wherefore this equation was made, as opposed to tumah, where the defiler was not equated (for liability) with the defiled (i.e., the Nazirite who defiles himself) — wherefore the days after the Naziritism are not to be equated with the days before the Naziritism before the bringing of the offering. — This is refuted by (the instance of) wine, where one who causes the Nazirite to drink was not equated (for liability) with the drinker (i.e., the Nazirite himself), in spite of which the equation was made. And this would indicate re tumah, that even though the defiler is not equated with the defiled, the days after the Naziritism are to be equated with the days in the midst of the Naziritism before the bringing of the offering. —- And the argument goes round and round. It is, therefore, written (6:20) \"… and then (after the offering) the Nazirite may drink wine.\" Now may a Nazirite drink wine? Rather, the verse is \"extra\" to the end of formulating an identity (gezeirah shavah ), viz.: It is written here (12) (in respect to tumah) \"Nazirite,\" and there (20) (in respect to wine) \"Nazirite.\" Just as there, the days after the Naziritism are equated with the days in the midst of the Naziritism before the bringing of the offering, so, there, (in respect to tumah)."

R. Eliezer b. Shamua and R. Yochanan Hasandlar asked R. Shimon b.

If each shaved in order to grow hair, or if each shaved in order to remove hair, your question would be in place; but the leper shaves in order to grow hair (for he must shave a second time after his count (viz.

But the (confirmation) shaving of the leper is before the sprinkling of the blood, and that of the Nazirite, after the sprinkling of the blood.

Variantly: This is the peace of Torah, of which it is written (Psalms 29:11) \"The L-rd gives strength (Torah) to His people; the L-rd blesses His people with peace.\" Great is peace, the Holy One Blessed be He deviating from the truth for its sake in the instance of Sarah, who said \"I am old\" (see Bereshit 18:12-13). Great is peace, the angel deviating from the truth for its sake in the instance of Manoach for its sake (viz. Judges 13). Great is peace, the Name written in holiness being erased by the bitter waters (of the sotah) to make peace between a man and his wife. R.

Shimon b Chalafta says: Great is peace, it being the only vessel which contains all of the blessings, it being written \"The L-rd gives strength to His people; the L-rd blesses His people with peace.\" R.

(Ibid. 10:2) \"Their hearts are divided — Now they will be laid waste!\" How great is peace! — How abhorrent is contention! Great is peace, for even in time of war, peace is needed, viz. (Devarim 20:10) \"If you draw near a city to do battle with it, then you shall call out to it for peace,\" (Ibid. 2:26) \"And I sent messengers from the desert of Kedemoth to Sichon, king of Moav, (with) words of peace,\" (Judges 11:12) \"And Yiftach sent messengers …\" What did he (the king of Ammon) say? (13) \"And now, return them (the lands you took from us) in peace.\" Great is peace, for even the dead need peace, as it is written (Bereshit 15:13) \"And you will come to your fathers in peace,\" and (Jeremiah 34:5) \"In peace will you die, and as the burnings of your fathers, etc.\" Great is peace, which is given to the penitent, as it is written (Isaiah 57:19) \"(I will) create (for him [the penitent a new]) expression of the lips:\" Shalom Shalom! (And both will be alike, both) the far (i.e., one who had served the L-rd from his youth) and the near (i.e., one who had sinned and had just repented), etc.\" Great is peace, which was given in the portion of the righteous, as it is written (Ibid. 2) \"Let him (the righteous one) come in peace (to the grave). Let them (the men of lovingkindness) rest (peacefully) where they lie.\" Great is peace, which was not given in the portion of the wicked, viz.

(Ibid. 37:11) \"and the humble will inherit the land and rejoice in an abundance of peace.\" Great is peace, which was given to the learners of Torah, viz. (Isaiah 59:13) \"And all your children will be (as if) taught by the L-rd, and (there will be) an abundance of peace (among) your children.\" Great is peace, which is given to the doers of righteousness, viz. (Ibid. 32:7) \"And the reward of righteousness will be peace.\" Great is peace, for the name of the Holy One Blessed be He is \"Peace,\" viz.

Chanina, the adjutant high-priest says: Great is peace, which is over and against the entire creation, as it is written \"who makes peace … and creates all\" (viz. Isaiah 45:7). Great is peace, which is needed (even) by the celestial creations, viz. (Job 25:22) \"Governance and fear is with Him: He makes peace in His heights.\" Now does this not follow a fortiori, viz.: If in a place where there is no enmity, or rivalry, or hatred, or hostility, peace is needed — how much more so, in a place where all of these obtain!",

Before they were exiled from their land — \"Is there any number to His angelic hosts?\" After they were exiled from their land — \"A thousand thousands were serving Him.\" As it were, the celestial retinue was diminished. Rebbi says in the name of Abba b. Yossi: One verse states: \"Is there any number to His angelic hosts?\" and another, \"A thousand thousands were serving Him.\" How are these two verses to be reconciled? \"A thousand thousands were serving Him\" — this is one host. And how many hosts are there? — \"Is there any number to His angelic hosts?\" One verse states (Psalms 147:4) \"He counts the number of the stars, (which implies that He calls each by name), and another (Isaiah 40:26) \"Raise your eyes on high and see who created these. He brings forth their legions by number; he calls to all of them by name,\" (which implies that He calls all of them as one). (How is this to be understood?) When the Holy One Blessed be He calls, all answer, something impossible for flesh and blood, to call two names at the same time. Similarly, (Shemot 20:1) \"And G-d spoke all of these things (in one utterance) saying, etc.\", and (Psalms 62:12) \"One thing has G-d spoken; these two have I heard,\" and (Jeremiah 23:29) \"Is My word not like fire, says the L-rd, and like a hammer shattering rock?\" Rebbi says in the name of Abba Yossi b. Dostai: One verse states \"He brings forth their legions by number, etc.\", and another \"He counts the number of the stars.\" How are these two verses to be reconciled? We are hereby taught there is no changing of the (essential) name there. The name that it is called by now is not the name that it will be called by later, (but its \"name\" is simply a function of its embassy.) And thus is it written (Judges 12:18) \"And the angel of the L-rd said to him: Why do you ask my name? It is hidden.\" I do not know what \"name\" I will be converted to (in the future). One verse states (II Samuel 24:24) \"And David bought the threshing floor and the cattle for fifty silver shekels,\" and another (I Chronicles 21:25) \"And David gave Arnon for the place gold shekels weighing six hundred.\" How are these two verses to be reconciled? For the place of the threshing floor, six hundred; for the place of the altar, fifty. Rebbi says, in the name of Abba Yossi b. Dostai: One verse states \"And David bought the threshing floor, etc.\" and another verse states \"And David gave Arnon for the place gold shekels weighing six hundred.\" How are these two verses to be reconciled? There were twelve tribes, and he took from each fifty shekels, six hundred shekels in all. R. Elazar says \"And David bought the threshing floor,\" as explained elsewhere. Where? \"And David gave Arnon for the place, etc.\" But the cattle for the burnt-offering and the threshing sledges and the cattle gear for the wood for fifty shekalim. One verse states (I Kings 5:6) \"And Solomon had forty thousand stables of horses for his chariots,\" and another, (II Chronicles 9:28) \"four thousand stables of horses.\" How are these two verses to be reconciled? Four thousand stables for forty thousand (horses). One verse states (Ibid. 4:5) \"Its capacity was three thousand bath measures,\" and another (I Kings 7:26) \"Its capacity was two thousand bath measures.\" How are these two verses to be reconciled? Two thousand in wet measure, which are three thousand in dry measure — whence the sages ruled: Forty sa'ah in wet measure is equal to two kor in dry measure.",

R. Yossi b. R. Yehudah says: On the eighth day, too, he anointed it and dismantled it. And it is written (Shemot 40:17) \"And it was, in the first month (Nissan) in the second year, on the first day of the month that the mishkan was established — whence we derive that on the twenty-third of Adar Aaron and his sons began to anoint the mishkan and all of its vessels; on Rosh Chodesh (Nissan) it was established; on the second (of Nissan) the red heifer was burned; on the third, its waters were sprinkled (viz. Bamidbar 8:7). On that day (Rosh Chodesh Nissan), the Shechinah reposed in the house, as it is written (Shemot 40:35) \"And Moses could not enter the tent of meeting, etc.\" On that day the chiefs (of the tribes) sacrificed their offerings, as it is written (Bamidbar 7:12) \"And the one who presented his offering on the first day…\" Why (emphasize) \"the first day\"? It was the first of all the days of the year. On that day fire descended from heaven and consumed the offerings, as it is written (Vayikra 9:24) \"And a fire came forth from before the L-rd and consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fats.\" On that day the sons of Aaron presented a strange fire, as it is written (Vayikra 10:1) \"And Nadav and Avihu the sons of Aaron took, each his censer … (2) and they died before the L-rd.\" Their death was \"before the L-rd,\" and their falling was outside. How did they leave (the inner sanctum)? R. Yossi was wont to say: An angel propped them dead until they left and they fell in the azarah (the court), as it is written (Ibid. 4) \"Draw near and bear your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.\" It is not written \"from before the L-rd,\" but \"from before the sanctuary.\" R. Yishmael says: It is derived from the verse itself — \"and they died before the L-rd\" — that their death was within (the sanctuary) and their falling was within. How did they leave? They dragged them out with iron hooks.\" (Bamidbar 7:1) \"and he anointed it and consecrated it and all of its vessels\": I might think that they were anointed and consecrated one by one. It is, therefore, written (Ibid.) \"and he anointed them and consecrated them\" — he did not consecrate one of them until all of them had been anointed. \"and he anointed them\": from inside and from outside. R. Yoshiyah says: Wet-measure vessels were anointed inside and outside, and dry-measure vessels, on the inside only, but not on the outside. R. Yonathan says: Wet-measure vessels were anointed on the inside but not on the outside, and dry-measure vessels were anointed neither on the inside nor on the outside. Know this to be so, that they were not anointed, it being written (Vayikra 23:17) \"From your dwellings shall you bring two wave loaves. Two-tenths of fine flour shall they be … they shall be baked as firstlings to the L-rd.\" When are they \"to the L-rd\"? After they have been baked.

Yitzchak says: If they were the bearers of Joseph's casket, they could have cleansed themselves (in time to eat the Paschal offering), and if they were Mishael and Eltzafan, they could have cleansed themselves. Rather, they were men who had become unclean by contact with a meth-mitzvah (a body with none to bury it, but themselves), their seventh (and final) day of uncleanliness falling out on Pesach eve. \"And they drew near before Moses and before Aaron on that day\": Is it possible that Moses did not know (the halachah) and Aaron did know? — Invert the verse (i.e., \"they came before Aaron and Moses\") and expound it (i.e., they came before Aaron and he did not know and then they came before Moses.) These are the words of R. Yoshiyah. Abba Channan says in the name of R. Eliezer: They (Moses and Aaron) were sitting in the house of study, and they (the men) came and stood before them. We are hereby (by their asking) apprised that they were devout men, solicitous of the mitzvah. (Ibid. 7) \"and those men said to him\": Is it not already written (Ibid. 6) \"the men\"? What is the intent of \"those men\"? We are hereby apprised that only the one affected (by the question) makes the inquiry (and not his representative). \"Why should we be held back (not to offer the sacrifice of the L-rd in its appointed time\")? Moses: Offerings, (in this instance, the Pesach offering), are not offered in a state of tumah. They: This may be true of offerings which have a backup (i.e., which if not offered now may be offered later, but is it true of offerings (i.e., the Pesach offering) which have no backup (and which must be offered on the fourteenth of Nissan)? Moses: Offerings may not be eaten in a state of tumah. They: If so, let the blood (of the Pesach offering) be sprinkled on the unclean ones, and the flesh be eaten by the clean ones. And this would, indeed, follow. If a sin-offering, which is holy of holies — its blood is sprinkled on the unclean ones, and its flesh is eaten by the clean ones (the Cohanim), then the Paschal offering, a lower-order offering — how much more so should its blood be sprinkled on the unclean ones and its flesh be eaten by the clean ones! Moses; I have not heard (the halachah). (Ibid. 8) \"Stand, and I will hear (what the L-rd will command concerning you\") — as one would say: \"I will hear the thing from my teacher's mouth.\" Happy the woman's son who was so confident that whenever he wished He would speak with him! R. Chidka said: Shimon Hashikmoni was a colleague of mine of the disciples of R. Akiva, and he said: Moses knew that a tamei does not eat the Pesach offering. What was their dispute? As to whether the blood is sprinkled upon them or not. It were fitting that the section on the tamei'im be related (independently) by Moses. Why was it related through them? For merit is conveyed through the meritorious and liability through the liable."

Akiva says: It is written \"tamei by a dead body\" and \"distant way.\" Just as in the fist instance, he desired to observe but could not, so, in the second, he desired to observe but could not; and the sages delimited (\"distant way\" as applying to) anyone who at the time of the slaughtering of the Paschal lamb was at a distance from Modi'im (fifteen miles from Jerusalem) and beyond, along the entire circumference.

From the entrance of Jerusalem within. R. Yehudah says: \"distant way\" is stated in respect to Pesach, and \"distant way\" is stated in respect to the tithe.

(Ibid. 23) \"If you do this thing and G-d commands you\"? And why did they escape Moses? To credit the thing to Yithro. \"Chovav,\" because he loved (\"chivev\") the Torah. For we find no other proselyte who loved the Torah as Yithro did. And just as Yithro loved the Torah, so did his descendants love the Torah, viz. (I Chronicles 2:55) \"and the families of scribes who dwelt in Yabetz: Tirathim, Shimathim, Suchathim. (These were the Kenites, etc.\") \"Tirathim\" — because they heard the teruah from Mount Sinai. \"Tirathim\" — because they cried out (\"mathri'im) and fasted. \"Tirathim\" — because they did not shave themselves (\"ta'ar\" is a blade). \"Tirathim\" — because they sat in the gates (\"tara\" is a gate) of Jerusalem. \"Shimathim\" — because they did not anoint themselves with oil (because of their mourning over the destruction of the Temple). \"Suchathim\" — because they dwelt in succoth. \"who dwelt in Yabetz\": They left Yericho and went to Yabetz, to the desert of Judah in the south of Arad to learn Torah from him (Yabetz), viz. (Ibid. 4:10) \"And Yabetz called out to the G-d of Israel … and G-d granted him what he requested.\" They were chassidim, who entreated G-d for someone to learn from, and he was a chassid who entreated G-d for someone to teach. The chassidim came to learn from the chassid, as it is written (Judges 1:16) \"And the sons of the Keini, the father-in-law of Moses, etc.\", and (Jeremiah 25:12) \"Go to the house of the Rechavim and speak to them, and bring them to the house of the L-rd, etc.\", and (Ibid. 6) \"And they said: We will not drink wine for Yonadav the son of Rechav our father commanded us, saying … and a house you shall not build and seed you shall not sow … so that you may live many years on the land where you live\" — Since this house (the Temple) is destined to be destroyed, see it as if it is already destroyed. (Ibid. 8-10) \"And we heeded the vice of Yonadav ben Rechav our father … and we live in tents, for we heeded and did according to everything that Yonadav our father commanded us.\" And whence is it derived that the sons of Yonadav ben Rechav were of the sons of the sons of Yithro? For it is written (I Chronicles 2:55) \"These were the Keinites, who descended from Chammath, the father of the house of the Rechavim.\" And what was their reward for this? (Jeremiah 35:18) \"And to the Rechavim Jeremiah said: Thus said the L-rd of hosts, the G-d of Israel: Because you have heeded the command of Yonadav your father … (19) there will not be cut off from Yonadav ben Rechav one who stands before Me all of the days.\" R. Yehoshua says: Now may proselytes enter the sanctuary? Rather, they sat in the Sanhedrin and taught Torah. Others say: Some of their daughters were wed to Cohanim and their descendents entered the sanctuary. Now does this not follow a fortiori, viz.: If those, who drew near (to Israel), were thus drawn near by the L-rd, then Israelites who do the will of the L-rd, how much more so (will He draw them near!) And thus do you find with Rachav Hazonah. What is written (of her)? (I Chronicles 4:21) \"And the families of the house of the linen work, of the house of Ashbea\": \"the families\" — Rachav Hazonah (\"the feeder\"), who kept an inn to feed her family. \"the linen work\" — She hid the spies among the linens. \"the house of Ashbea\" — The spies swore (\"nisb'u\") to her (to spare her family). Eight prophets, issued from Rachav Hazonah: Yirmiyahu, Chilkiyahu, Serayah, Machseyah, Baruch, Neriah, Chanamel, and Shalom. R. Yehudah says: Chuldah the prophetess was also of the descendants of Rachav Hazonah, as it is written (II Kings 22:14) \"And Chilkiyahu the Cohein and Achikam and Achbor and Shafan and Asayah went to Chuldah the prophetess, the wife of Shalom the son of Tikvah, etc.\" And it is written (Joshua 2:18) \"behold, when we (the spies) come to the land, you (Rachav) shall bind this line (tikvah) of scarlet thread, etc.\" Now does this not follow a fortiori, viz.: If she, who came from a people of whom it is written (Devarim 20:16) \"You shall not spare any soul,\" because she drew near (to Israel), was thus drawn near by the L-rd, then Israelites, who do the will of the L-rd, how much more so (will He draw them near!) And thus do you find with the Giveonites. What is written of them? (I Chronicles 4:22) \"And Yokim and the men of Chezeva. \"And Yokim\" — Joshua fulfilled (\"kiyem\") for them his oath (to spare them). \"Chezeva\" — they deceived (\"kizvu\") Joshua, saying (Joshua 9:9) \"From a very distant land did your servants come,\" and not from Eretz Yisrael.\" Now does this not follow a fortiori, viz.: If these, who came from a people consigned to destruction, because they drew near (to Israel), were thus drawn near by the L-rd, then Israelites, who do the will of the L-rd, how much more so (will He draw them near)! And thus do you find with Ruth the Moavitess. What did she say to her mother-in-law (Ruth 1:16-17) \"Your people is my people, and your G-d is my G-d. Where you will die, I will die.\" The L-rd said to her: You have lost nothing. kingdom is yours in this world and in the world to come. What is written (of her)? (I Chronicles 4:22) \"and Yoash and Saraph, who had dominion in Moav.\" Yoash and Saraph are Machlon and Kilyon (viz. Ruth 1:2-6) \"Yoash\" — they despaired (nithya'ashu) of redemption. \"Saraph\" — they were liable to (the penalty of) burning, to the L-rd. \"who had dominion over Moav\" — they married Moavite women and left Eretz Yisrael and went and sojourned in the field of Moav. (I Chronicles, Ibid.) \"and Yashuvilechem\" — this is Ruth the Moavitess, who returned and dwelt in Beth Lechem. (Ibid.) \"And these are ancient things\" — each is discussed in its place. (Ibid. 23) \"These are 'the keepers'\" — the sons of Yonadav ben Rechav, who kept the oath of their father. \"and the dwellers among the plants\" — Solomon, who was like a (flourishing) plant in his kingdom. \"and gedeirah (\"the fence\") — Sanhedrin, who sit and delimit the \"fences\" of Torah. \"With the king in his work they sat there\" — Ruth the Moavitess did not die until she saw Solomon, the grandson of her grandson (Yishai) sitting on his throne of kingdom, as it is written (I Kings 2:19) \"And he (Solomon) sat on his throne, and he placed a seat for the mother of the king\" — the mother of kingdom (i.e., Ruth). \"and she sat at his right hand\": as he busied himself with the work of the Temple, viz.: (I Chronicles, Ibid.) \"with the king in his work they sat there. Now does this not follow a fortiori, viz.: If she, who was of the people of whom it is written (I Kings 11:2) \"You shall not come into them, and they shall not come into you,\" because she drew near (to Israel), she was drawn near by the L-rd, then Israelites, who do the will of the L-rd, how much more so! And if you would ask: But where do we see this (that the L-rd draws them near) with Israel? It is written (Shemot 1:15) \"And the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, the first of whom was named Shifrah; and the second, Puah\": Shifra is Yocheved (Moses' mother). Puah is Miriam (Moses' sister). \"Shifra\" — because she \"beautifies (meshapereth) the child. \"Puah\" — because she \"coos\" (poeh) to the child. Variantly: \"Shifra\" — because Israel was fruitful (paru) and multiplied in her days. \"Puah\" — because she moaned (poah) and wept over her brother, as it is written (Ibid. 2:4) \"And his sister stood from afar to know what would be done with him.\" (Ibid. 1:16) \"And he (Pharaoh) said: When you deliver the Hebrew women … (17) and the midwives feared G-d … (21) and He made for them (the midwives) houses\": I would not know what these \"houses\" were if not for (I Kings 9:10) \"And it was at the end of twenty years that Solomon built the two houses — the house of the L-rd and the house of the king.\" \"the house of the L-rd\" — the priesthood; \"the house of the king\" — royalty. Yocheved attained to priesthood, and Miriam, to royalty. As it is written (I Chronicles 4:4) \"These were the sons of Chur, the first-born of Efrathah, the father of Beth-lechem\": \"Efrathah\" — Miriam, who married Calev, viz.: (I Chronicles 2:19) \"And Calev took Efrath, and she bore to him Chur,\" and (Ibid. 50) \"These were the sons of Calev, the son of Chur, the first-born of Efrathah, the father of Beth-lechem. \"Efrathah\" — This is the (royal) house of David, as it is written (I Samuel 17:12) \"And David was the son of an Efrati man of Beth-lechem.\"",
            " (I Chronicles 4:5) \"And Ashchur, the father of Tekoa, had two wives, Chelah and Na'arah.\" Ashchur is Calev. Why was he called \"Ashchur\"? Because his face was \"blackened\" (hushcharu\") with fasting. \"the father\" — He was like a father to her (Miriam). \"Tekoa\" — He \"pegged\" (taka) his heart to his father in heaven. \"two wives\" — Miriam, who became to him like \"two wives.\" \"Chelah and Na'arah\": At first she was sick (cholah), and then she \"awakened\" (na'arah). (Ibid. 7) \"And the sons of Chelah were Tzereth, Tzochar, and Ethnan\": Tzereth — she became a \"vexation\" (tzarah) to her co-wife, (who envied her). Tzochar — Her face was resplendent as mid-day (tzoharayim). \"and Ethnan\" — Anyone who saw her brought an \"exchange\" (for cohabitation) to his wife. (Ibid. 8) \"And Kotz begot Anuv and Hatzovevah\": \"Kotz\" is Calev, who \"spurned\" (katzath) the counsel of the spies. \"Anuv\" — he generated good in the bringing of the grape cluster (viz. Bamidbar 13:23) for if not for Calev they would not have brought it. \"and Hatzovevah\" — he did the will (tzivyon) of the Holy One blessed be He. \"and the families of Acharchel the son of Charum. \"and the families of Acharchel\" — This is Miriam, viz. (Shemot 15:20) \"and all the women went out after (\"achar\") her (Miriam) with timbrels and dances.\" \"and the families\" — He (Calev) merited establishing families from her. \"the son of Charum\" — This is Yocheved, of whom (the Cohanim) it is written (Bamidbar 18:14) \"Every devoted thing (\"cherem\") in Israel shall be yours,\" (the Cohanim - Levites descending from Yocheved). Variantly: This (\"Charum\") is Miriam from whom there issued forth David, whose kingdom was exalted (\"romem\") by the Holy One Blessed be He, viz. (I Samuel 2:10) \"And He will give strength to His king and He will exalt the horn of His anointed one.\" We find, then, that David came from the descendants of Miriam — whence we derive \"One who draws near (to Israel) is drawn near by Heaven.\"",

Shimon b. Yochai says: Is it not already written (Devarim 4:22) \"For I shall not cross the Jordan\"? (To teach) that even his bones will not cross the Jordan. Why, then, did Moses include himself with them? He said: Now Israel will say: If he who took us out of Egypt and performed all the miracles and mighty acts for us does not enter, we, too, will not enter. Variantly: Why did Moses include himself with them? So that Yithro not say, If Moses does not enter, I, too, will not come. The sages say: Why did Moses include himself with them? He \"lost sight\" (of having been told that he would not enter) and he felt himself entering with them to Eretz Yisrael. \"to the place of which the L-rd said: It will I give to you\" — and proselytes have no portion in it. How, then, am I to satisfy (Ezekiel 47:23) \"And it shall be, with the tribe with which the proselyte dwells, there shall you give his portion\"? If it cannot speak of inheritance, understand it as speaking of atonement — that if he lived among the tribe of Judah, he was atoned for with (the communal offerings of) the tribe of Judah; (If he lived among) the tribe of Benjamin, he was atoned for with the tribe of Benjamin. Variantly: If it cannot speak of inheritance, understand it as speaking of burial — that proselytes are allotted burial in Eretz Yisrael. \"Come with us and we will do good with you\": Is there a member of a man's household for which good is not done? It follows a fortiori — If good is done for a member of a man's household, how much more so, for \"a member of the household\" (i.e., Yithro) of Him who spoke and brought the world into being! \"for the L-rd has spoken good for Israel\": Now did He not speak good for Israel until now? The L-rd always spoke good for Israel! (The intent is) rather, that the L-rd commanded Israel to do good for the proselytes and to deport themselves to them with humility."

Will I not battle with those who rise up against You? I have hated them to the heights of hatred. I have deemed them my (own) enemies.\" And thus is it written (Zechariah 2:12) \"Whoever touches you (Israel) touches the pupil of His eye\": It is not written \"the pupil of the eye,\" but \"the pupil of His eye\" — that of the L-rd, as it were, Scripture resorting to a euphemism (for \"the eye of the L-rd\"). Similarly, (Job 7:20) \"Why do You make me Your target for Yourself, and a burden to myself?\" — (\"myself\") a euphemism (for \"to You\"?)

Similarly, (Chabakkuk 1:12) \"Are You not of yore, O L-rd, my holy G-d, and we shall not die\" — a euphemism (for \"You\"). Similarly, (Psalms 106:20) \"They exchanged their glory for the image of a bull feeding on grass\" — a euphemism (for \"G-d\").

Similarly, (Ibid. 12:12) \"who comes out of his mother's womb, and half his flesh being consumed\" — a euphemism (for \"our\"). And if one helps the righteous, it is as if he is helping the L-rd, viz. (Judges 5:23) \"'Curse Meroz!' said the angel of the L-rd. 'Bitterly curse her dwellers. Because they do not come to the holy of the L-rd, to the help of the L-rd among the mighty.'\" R. Shimon b. Elazar says: There is nothing more \"beloved\" in a man's body than his eye. When a man is hit on his head, he closes only his eyes. And Israel is thus compared, viz. (Zechariah 2:12) \"Whoever touches you (Israel) touches the pupil of His eye.\" R. Yossi b. Elazar says: He (the \"toucher\") is regarded as one who sticks a finger into His eye and gouges it out. Pharaoh, who \"touched,\" what did I do to him?

Ibid. 1:14) \"And thus is it written (Isaiah 63:9) \"In all of their afflictions, He was afflicted.\" This tells me only of communal afflictions.

With him will I be in affliction.\" And it is written (Bereshit 39:20-21) \"And Joseph's master took him in and the L-rd was with Joseph.\" And thus is it written (II Samuel 7:23) \"… before your people whom You redeemed from Egypt — a nation and its G-d\" (together with them). R. Akiva says: If it were not explicitly written, it would be impossible to say it — Israel said before the L-rd: \"You have redeemed Yourself!\" You find that whenever they were exiled, the Shechinah was exiled with them, viz. (I Samuel 2:27) \"Was I not exiled to your father's house when they were in Egypt in the house of Pharaoh?\" When they were exiled to Bavel, the Shechinah was with them, viz. (Isaiah 43:14) \"For your sake I was sent to Bavel.\" When they were exiled to Edom, the Shechinah was with them, viz. (Ibid. 63:1) \"Who is this, coming from Edom, etc.?\" And when they return, the Shechinah will return with them, as it is written (Devarim 30:3) \"And the L-rd will return, etc.\" It is not written \"and the L-rd will return your captivity,\" but \"and the L-rd will return with your captivity.\" And it is written (Song of Songs 4:8) \"With Me, from Levanon, My bride, with Me from Levanon will you come.\"",

Scripture is telling us that when Israel traveled (by word of the L-rd) the pillar of cloud was folded and standing, and it did not move until Moses said \"Stand, O L-rd.\" And when they rested (by word of the L-rd), the pillar of cloud was folded and standing, and it did not spread out (over the encampment) until Moses said \"Rest, O L-rd,\" so that there are satisfied both \"By word of the L-rd they encamped and by word of the L-rd they traveled,\" and \"Moses said: Stand, O L-rd … Rest, O L-rd.\" And this is the intent of \"by the mouth of the L-rd, by the hand of Moses.\" (Ibid. 36) \"And when it came to rest, he said, etc.\": Scripture (here) states that Moses said: (I will not allow the Shechinah to rest) until Israel travels in thousands and rests in ten thousands, until Israel becomes thousands of ten thousands, like the stars of heaven. \"And when it rested, he said\": Scripture (here) states that the Shechinah rests on high only on two thousands and two ten thousands, as it is written (Psalms 68:18) \"the chariots of G-d are two ten thousands, two thousands.\" And just as the Shechinah does not rest on high except on two thousands and two ten thousands, so, it does not rest below except on two thousands and two ten thousands."

(Ibid. 3) \"And he called the name of that place 'Taveirah'\" (\"conflagration\"). As one would say: Leave that fire burning in its place. Thus did Moses say to Israel: Repent and the fire will subside; if not, it is still (burning) in its place. \"for the fire of the L-rd burned in them\": It was called thus because of the event, and not because that was its name in the past.

These are the converts that were \"added on\" (hanosafim [as in \"asafsuf\"]) to them — how much more so the common Jews (i.e., the rabble). R. Shimon b.

The intent is, rather, that it was converted for them to everything that is beaten in a mortar. I might think that it was converted only into these things alone. Whence is it derived that all the forty years that Israel was in the desert a woman had no need of spices, but was \"decorated\" (i.e., perfumed) by the manna? From \"or\" beat it.\" \"or cook it in a pot\": Now (did we not learn that) it never \"descended\" to a pot?

Whence do I derive (the same for) all the things gathered in a field? From \"and they would gather it.\" And it is written (Devarim 2:7) \"These forty years the L-rd has been with you. You have lacked nothing.\" As if a man would say I want to eat grapes, and they were given to him; I want to eat figs, and they were given to him. \"and its taste was like the 'sap' (leshad) of oil\": \"leshad\": an acronymic for three words: \"layish\" (dough), \"shemen\" (oil), and \"dvash\" (honey). As dough kneaded with oil and honey, such was the inherent taste of the manna, and thus (i.e., with intent for this taste) did the upright of Israel eat it. Variantly: \"and its taste was like the 'sap' (leshad) of oil\": Just as the breast (shad) is \"primary\" to an infant, and everything else, secondary. Variantly: Just as the breast, if an infant sucks it the whole day, it does not harm it, so, the manna; if Israel ate it a whole day, it would not harm them. Variantly: Just as the breast, which produces one kind, which changes into many kinds, so, the (taste of the) manna changed for Israel into any taste that they desired, except for that of the five kinds (viz. Ibid. 5). An analogy: (A doctor) tells a (nursing) woman: Do not eat garlic and onion for the sake of the infant. Variantly: Just as the breast, an infant suffers when it withdraws from it, so, Israel suffered when they withdrew from the manna, viz. (Joshua 5:12) \"And the manna ceased the following day, when they ate from the grain of the land.\" An analogy: A man is asked: Why are you eating barley bread? He answers: Because I don't have wheat bread. Why are you eating carobs? Because I don't have figs. Similarly, if Israel had that handful (of manna) that they took on the day of Moses' death, from which they ate all forty days, they would not desire to eat of the grain of the land of Canaan. (Bamidbar, Ibid. 9) \"And when the dew descended upon the camp at night, the manna descended upon it.\": We are hereby taught that it descended upon the thresholds and the doorposts. I might think that the manna was eaten sullied; it is, therefore, written (Shemot 16:14) \"and, behold, on the face of the desert it was spread thin.\" It (the dew) descended as a kind of hoarfrost and became a kind of layer upon the ground on which the manna descended. And from it Israel took and ate. This accounts for the lower level; but couldn't the reptiles and the flies infest it from above? It is, therefore, written (Ibid.) \"and the dew layer ascended,\" whence it follows that it was enclosed in a kind of casing. And they would recite the Shema and pray; and one would go out to the entrance of his house and take his share and that of his household, after which the sun would come out and melt it. Similarly, R. Shimon says: Why didn't the manna descend once a year? So that their hearts turn to their Father in heaven (for their food). An analogy: A king decreed that his son be fed once a year — and he visited his father only on the day of his stipend! Once he decreed that he be fed every day — and he visited him every day. So with Israel. If a man had five sons or five daughters, he would sit and worry, thinking: If the manna does not fall tomorrow, we will all die of hunger! — So that they all turned their hearts to their Father in heaven. R. Dostai b. R. Yannai said: If so, the son will say: Even if I visit my father only for the sake of my stipend it is sufficient for me! So that the visit becomes entirely opportunistic. Rather, (the manna fell every day) so that it could be eaten while it was still warm. Variantly: (It did not fall once for a long period of time) so that it would not be a burden on the road. Similarly, R. Dostai b. R. Yannai says: Why did the L-rd not create hot springs in Jerusalem as He did in Tiberias? So that one not say to his friend: Let us go up to the hot springs of Jerusalem.

Moses said to Him: Answer me as to whether or not You will appoint leaders (for them). And He did answer him, (Ibid. 18) \"Take for yourself Joshua the son of Nun.\" Similarly, (Devarim 3:23) \"And I implored the L-rd at that time to say.\" What is the intent of \"to say\"? He said to Him: Answer me as to whether or not I will enter the land. And He did answer him, (Ibid. 26) \"It is enough for you, etc.\" Here, too, let \"to say\" not be written. But, (the intent is that) he asked Him to answer whether or not He would heal her, and He answered \"Now if her father had spat in her face, etc.\" (Bamidbar, Ibid. 13) \"G-d, I pray You; heal her, I pray You\": Why did Moses not prolong his prayer? So that Israel not say \"His sister is in distress and he stretches out his prayer.\" Variantly: It is not that Moses prays and the L-rd hears his prayer, but (in the order of) (Iyyov 22:28) \"You (the tzaddik) will decree, and it will be fulfilled for you,\" (Isaiah 58:9) \"Then, when you (the tzaddik) call, the L-rd will answer.\" R. Eliezer was asked by his disciples: How long shall a man be in his prayer? He answered: Not longer than Moses, of whom it is written (Devarim 9:18) \"And I fell down before the L-rd (in prayer) as at first, forty days and forty nights.\" And how short should he be in prayer? He answered: Not shorter than Moses, of whom it is written \"G-d, I pray You; heal her, I pray You.\" There is a time to be short and a time to be long."

Yoshiyah said: There were \"two rebukes,\" viz.: If her father of flesh and blood had rebuked her, she would (sit) in shame (sequestered) for seven days, does it not follow that if (her Father) He who spoke and brought the world into being (rebuked her), (she should be sequestered) fourteen (days)! But \"it suffices that what is derived from an argument a fortiori be as that which it is derived from\" — Just as her father, seven; so, He who spoke and brought the world into being, seven. (Ibid.) \"Let her be sequestered seven days outside the camp, and then let her be gathered in.\": The Holy One Blessed be He sequestered her, and the Holy One Blessed be He declared her tamei and the Holy One Blessed be He declared her clean. (Ibid. 12:15) \"And the people did not journey until Miriam had been gathered in\": to teach that \"with the measure that a man measures, so is he measured.\" Miriam waited for Moses a short while, viz. (Shemot 2:4) \"And his sister stationed herself at a distance, etc.\"; therefore, the Shechinah, the ark, the Cohanim, the Levites, and the seven clouds of glory did not journey until Miriam had been gathered in. Joseph merited taking the bones of his father (for burial), and there were none among his brothers greater than he, viz. (Bereshit 50:7-9) \"And Joseph went up to bury his father … and there went up with him both chariots and riders.\" Who was greater among us than Joseph, only Moses meriting bringing him to burial. And there is none in Israel greater than he, viz. (Shemot 13:19) \"And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him.\" Who is greater among us than Moses, none but the Holy One Blessed be He bringing him to burial, viz. (Devarim 34:6) \"And He buried him in the valley of the land of Moav\": R. Yehudah says: If it (the above) were not an explicit verse, it would be impossible to say it. Where did Moses die? In the portion of Reuven, viz. (Ibid. 1) \"And Moses went up from the steppes of Moav to Mount Nevo.\" This is the territory of the sons of Reuven, viz. (Bamidbar 32:37-38) \"And the sons of Reuven built Cheshbon and Elalei and Kiryathayim and Nevo.\" And he was buried only in the territory of Gad, viz. (Devarim 33:20-21) \"And to Gad he said: Blessed be he who broadens Gad … and he saw the best for himself. For there the portion of the lawgiver (Moses) is hidden.\" From the portion of Reuven to that of Gad is four mils. Those four mils — Who carried him\"? We are hereby taught that Moses was (carried) in the \"hand\" of the Holy One Blessed be He the four mils from the portion of Reuven to that of Gad, while the ministering angels extolled him in song, (Ibid.) \"He wrought the righteousness of the L-rd and His judgments with Israel.\" And He thus gathers in not only Moses, but all of the righteous, as it is written (Isaiah 58:8) \"And your righteousness shall go before you, and the glory of G-d will gather you in.\" (Bamidbar, Ibid. 16) \"And afterwards the people journeyed from Chatzeiroth\": This journey was after Miriam was gathered in."

            " (Bamidbar 15:2) \"Speak to the children of Israel and say to them: When you come to the land of your settlings which I give to you, etc.\": Scripture comes to teach us that Israel were obligated to bring libations (with their offerings) only after inheritance and settlement (of the land [viz. Ibid. 15:5]). You say after inheritance and settlement, but perhaps immediately upon their entry to the land. It is, therefore, written (Devarim 17:14) \"When you come to the land that the L-rd your G-d gives to you, and you inherit it and you settle in it, etc.\" Since \"comings\" are mentioned in the Torah unqualified, and in one instance (above) it is specified, after inheritance and settlement, so all (\"comings\" are understood as) after inheritance and settlement, which teaches us that wherever \"settlings\" is written, after inheritance and settling is understood. These are the words of R. Yishmael. R. Akiva queried him: But in respect to Shabbath it is written \"settlings\" (viz. Vayikra 23:3), and it obtains both in Eretz Yisrael and outside of it! R. Yishmael replied: If \"lighter\" mitzvoth obtain both in the land and outside it, how much more so, Shabbath, the \"graver.\" And it (\"settlings\") comes to teach that in an individual altar (\"bamah\") there is no obligation to bring libations. R. Akiva says: Scripture comes to teach us that libations are to be offered on a bamah. Abba Channan says in the name of R. Eliezer: Why is this (\"When you come to the land\") written? For it would follow, since we find that the vessels of the Temple were more than those of the tent of meeting (viz. I Kings 7:27), so, the libations of the Temple were more than those of the tent of meeting; it is, therefore, written (Bamidbar 15:2) \"When you come … (3) and you shall offer, etc.\" to teach that even though there were more vessels in the Temple than in the tent of meeting, there were not more libations. (Ibid. 3) \"and you shall offer a fire-offering to the L-rd\": This implies that all that is offered for the fire requires libations, even a meal-offering. It is, therefore, written \"a burnt-offering.\" This tells me only of a burnt-offering (that it requires libations). Whence do I derive (the same for) peace-offerings? From \"a sacrifice.\" Whence do I derive (the same for) a thank-offering? From \"or a sacrifice.\" This would imply (that libations are required) for these as well as for first-born, tithe, Pesach and guilt-offering. It is, therefore, written \"for an expressed vow or as a guilt-offering.\" Scripture speaks only of offerings that are brought as vow and gift. — But this would imply that I exclude them (from libations) as well as mandatory festival offerings! — It is, therefore, written \"or in your festivals,\" to include these (as requiring libations). — But this would imply (that libations are required for) burnt-offerings and mandatory peace-offerings that are brought on festivals, and for a mandatory sin-offering that is brought on festivals! — It is, therefore, written (Ibid. 15;8) \"And if you offer a bullock as a burnt-offering or as a sacrifice.\" \"Bullock\" was included in the general category (of offerings) and departed from it (for specific mention) to teach about the category, viz.: Just as \"bullock,\" which is brought for vow or gift (requires libations, so, all (offerings) that are brought for vow or gift require libations) — to exclude sin-offerings and guilt-offerings, which are not brought for vow or gift.",
            " (Bamidbar 15:3) \"to present a sweet savor to the L-rd, of the herd or of the flock\": What is the intent of this? Because it is written \"and you shall offer a fire-offering to the L-rd, a burnt-offering or a sacrifice,\" I might think that a burnt-offering of fowl (also) requires libations; it is, therefore, written \"of the herd or of the flock\" — to exclude a burnt-offering of fowl as not requiring libations. These are the words of R. Yoshiyah. R. Yochanan says: This is not needed, for it is already written \"or a sacrifice.\" Just as \"a sacrifice\" is a beast, so, a burnt-offering. What is the intent, then, of \"to present a sweet savor to the L-rd, of the herd or of the flock\"? Because it is written (Vayikra 1:2) \"A man if he offers of you an offering to the L-rd … from the herd and from the flock,\" I might think that if he said: I take it upon myself to bring a burnt-offering he must bring one of each; it is, therefore, written (here) \"of the herd or of the flock,\" that he brings either one by itself. It is written in respect to the Pesach offering (Shemot 12:5) \"from the sheep and from the goats shall you take it.\" Either one by itself? Or, one of each? It is, therefore, written (Vayikra 1:10) \"And if of the flock is his offering, of the sheep or of the goats for a beast-offering.\" Now does this not follow a fortiori, viz.: If a burnt-offering, the \"graver\" may be brought from one kind, then Pesach, the \"lighter,\" how much more so may it be brought from one kind! What, then, is the intent of \"from the sheep and from the goats shall you take it\"? Either one by itself. Issi b. Akiva says: \"to present a sweet savor to the L-rd (of the herd or of the flock\"): either one by itself. You say either one by itself, but perhaps (the intent is that he brings) one of each. Would you say that? It follows a fortiori (otherwise), viz.: If the atzereth (Shavuoth) lambs, of which two must be brought (viz. Vayikra 23:19), may come of one kind, then a burnt-offering, two of which need not be brought, how much more so may it come of one kind! — No, this may be true of the two atzereth lambs, Scripture limiting their bringing (to atzereth), for which reason they may come of one kind, as opposed to a burnt-offering, Scripture \"expanding\" its bringing — wherefore it must be brought from two kinds! — This is refuted by the he-goats of Yom Kippur, Scripture \"expanding\" their bringing (to two) and yet being brought from one kind. (And they will refute \"burnt-offering\" — that even though Scripture \"expands\" its bringing, it may be brought of one kind.) — No, this may be true of the Yom Kippur he-goats, Scripture limiting their bringing, for they are not brought the whole year, wherefore they may be brought of one kind, as opposed to a burnt-offering, Scripture \"expanding\" its bringing in that it may be brought the entire year — wherefore it should be permitted only of two kinds. This is refuted by a sin-offering, which, even though Scripture \"expands\" its bringing to all the days of the year, may be brought of one kind — so that a burnt-offering, too, should be able to come from one kind. — No, this may be true of a sin-offering, Scripture limiting its bringing, in that it may not be brought as vow or gift, wherefore it is permitted to bring it of one kind, as opposed to burnt-offering, Scripture \"expanding\" its bringing in that it may be brought as vow or gift — wherefore it should be permitted to bring it only of two kinds. It must, therefore, be written (15:3) \"to present a sweet savor to the L-rd, of the herd or of the flock\" — either one by itself. (15:4) \"Then the offerer shall offer\": Because it is written (Vayikra 22:18) \"A man, a man … who offers, etc.\", this tells me only of a man. Whence do I derive (the same for) a woman? From \"Then the offerer shall offer\" — in any event. \"Then the offerer shall offer his offering to the L-rd, a meal-offering, an issaron of flour.\" R. Nathan says: This is a prototype for all who donate a meal-offering not to give less than an issaron. \"mixed with a revi'ith of a hin of oil. (5) And wine for libations, a revi'ith of a hin\": oil for mixing and wine for libations. \"shall you present with the burnt-offering or the sacrifice\": What is the intent of this? From (3) \"And you shall offer a fire-offering to the L-rd,\" I might think that if he said \"I vow to bring a burnt-offering; I vow to bring peace-offerings\" that he may bring one libation for both; it is, therefore, written \"the burnt-offering or the sacrifice (of peace-offerings)\" — he brings one for each in itself. I might think if he said (\"I vow) five lambs for a burnt-offering, five lambs for peace-offerings,\" that he brings one libation for all; it is, therefore, written \"with the burnt-offering or the sacrifice for each lamb\" — he brings for each in itself. Abba Channan says in the name of R. Eliezer: What is the intent of this (\"with the burnt-offering or the sacrifice\")? For I would think: If where the rule for an ox burnt-offering is the same as that for a lamb burnt-offering (i.e., that they are both burned), they are not similar in libations, (an ox requiring a half hin, and a lamb, a quarter hin,) then where the rule for a lamb burnt-offering is not the same as that of a lamb of peace-offerings, (the first being burned and the second eaten,) how much more so should they not be similar in libations! It is, therefore, written \"shall you present with the brunt-offering or the sacrifice\" — Even though the rule (for the offering) is not the same, the libations are. R. Nathan says: \"shall you present with the burnt-offering\": This is the burnt-offering of a leper (i.e., even though it is mandatory and not vow or gift, it requires libations). \"or the sacrifice\": This is his (the leper's) sin-offering. \"or the sacrifice\": This is his guilt-offering. \"for each lamb\": to include the burnt-offering of a woman after birth as requiring libations. \"for each lamb\": to include (as requiring libations) the eleventh (which one erroneously designated as the first-born beast-tithe (instead of the tenth). For we nowhere find in the entire Torah that the secondary (the eleventh in this instance, which requires libations,) is severer than the primary (the tenth, which does not). \"And if it is a ram, then you shall present as the meal-offering (two esronim of flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil\": Scripture here comes to differentiate between the libations for a lamb and those for a ram. For it would follow (otherwise), viz.: cattle require libations and sheep require libations. If Scripture did not differentiate between the libations for a calf, and those for an ox, so, it would not differentiate between those for a lamb and those for a ram. It is, therefore, written \"And if it is a ram, then you shall present as a meal-offering, etc.\" Scripture differentiates between the libations for a lamb, (\"a quarter of a hin\") and those of a ram (\"a third of a hin\"). Abba Channan says in the name of R. Eliezer: Why is this written? For it would follow (otherwise), viz.: If where libations (in general) were increased, no differentiation was made between a calf and an ox, then where libations (in general) were decreased, how much more so should no differentiation be made between a lamb and a ram! It is, therefore, written \"And if it is a ram, then you shall present as a meal-offering, etc.\" Scripture hereby apprises us that even though libations (in general) were decreased, a differentiation was made between a lamb and a ram. (Ibid.) \"mixed with oil, a third of a hin\": For it would follow (otherwise), viz.: Since the lamb of the omer requires two esronim (viz. Vayikra 23:13), and the ram of a burnt-offering requires two esronim, then just as I learned about the lamb of the omer that even though its esronim were doubled, its libations were not doubled (viz. Ibid.), so, the ram of the burnt-offering, even though its esronim were doubled, its libations should not be doubled; it is, therefore, written \"And if it is a ram, then you shall present as the meal-offering, etc., mixed with oil, etc.\" Scripture hereby apprises us that just as its esronim were doubled, so, its libations were doubled (i.e., increased). \"with oil a third of a hin and wine for libations\": oil for mixing; wine, for libations. \"shall you offer, a sweet savor to the L-rd\": It gives Me pleasure that I say, and My will is done. (Bamidbar, Ibid. 8) \"And if you offer a bullock as a burnt-offering or as a sacrifice for an expressed vow, etc.\": \"Bullock\" was included in the general category and it departed from that category (for special mention) to teach about the category that just as a bullock comes for a vow or a gift and requires libations, so, all that come for a vow or a gift require libations. (Ibid. 9) \"Then he shall present with the bullock a meal-offering\": What is the intent of this? Because it is written (Ibid. 3) \"And you shall offer a fire-offering to the L-rd,\" I might think that if he said \"I vow to bring a burnt-offering; I vow to bring peace-offerings,\" he brings one libation for both; it is, therefore, written \"or as a sacrifice (of peace-offerings),\" whereby we are taught that he brings one for each in itself. Or (I might think that) even if he said \"I vow to bring five oxen for a burnt-offering; five oxen for peace-offerings,\" I might think that he brings one libation for all; it is, therefore, written \"a burnt-offering or a sacrifice,\" whereby we are taught he brings one for each in itself. Abba Channan says in the name of R. Eliezer: What is the intent of \"or a sacrifice\"? For it would follow: If (even though) what transpires with a lamb burnt-offering is the same as that which transpires with an ox burnt-offering (i.e., that they are entirely burnt), still, they are not equivalent for libations, then, where what transpires with an ox burnt-offering is not the same as that which transpires with ox peace-offerings, (which are eaten), how much more so should they not be equivalent in libations; it is, therefore, written \"or as a sacrifice (of peace-offerings),\" to teach that even though they are not equivalent in what transpires with them, they are equivalent for libations. (Ibid. 10) \"And wine shall you offer for libations\": oil for mixing; wine, for libations — on bowls. You say \"on bowls,\" but perhaps (the intent is) on the fire. If you say this, you will put out the fire, and the Torah writes (Vayikra 6:6) \"A perpetual fire is to be kept burning on the altar, not to go out.\" How, then, am I to understand \"for libations\"? As meaning \"on bowls.\" \"a sweet savor to the L-rd\": It gives Me pleasure that I say, and My will is done.\" (Ibid. 11) \"Thus shall it be done for the one ox\": Scripture here tells us that the Torah did not differentiate between the libations for a calf and those for an ox. For it would follow (otherwise), viz.: Sheep require libations and cattle require libations. If I have learned that the Torah differentiates between libations for a lamb and those for a ram, then so should it differentiate between those for a calf and those for an ox. It is, therefore, written \"Thus shall it be done for the one ox,\" (big or small), the Torah not differentiating between the libations for a calf and those for an ox. Abba Channan says in the name of R. Eliezer: Why is this written? For it would follow otherwise, viz.: If where libations (in general) were decreased, a differentiation was made between a calf and an ox, then, where libations (in general) were increased, how much more so should a differentiation be made between a calf and an ox! It is, therefore, written \"Thus shall it be done for the one ox.\" Scripture hereby apprises us that even though libations (in general) were increased, no differentiation was made between a calf and an ox. (Ibid.) \"or for the one ram\": Why is this written? For it would follow otherwise, viz.: Since we find that the Torah differentiated between the libations of a one-year old (\"a lamb\") and the libations of a two-year old (\"a ram\"), so it should differentiate between the libations of a two-year old and those of a three-year old. Scripture hereby apprises us (by \"the one ram\") that no such differentiation was made. (Ibid.) \"or for the lamb among the sheep\": Why is this written? For it would follow otherwise, viz.: Since we find that the Torah differentiated between the libations for a sheep and those for a ram, so it should differentiate between the libations for a ewe (female)-lamb and those for a (ewe-) sheep. We are hereby apprised (by \"the [female] lamb [one year old] among the sheep [two years old]\") that no such differentiation was made. (Ibid.) \"or among the goats\": Why is this written? For it would follow otherwise, viz.: Since we find that the Torah differentiated between the libations for a lamb and those for a ram, so it should differentiate between those for a kid and those for a (full-grown) he-goat; it is, therefore, written \"or among the goats.\" The largest of the goats is hereby equated with the youngest of the lambs. Just as the latter, three logs (i.e., a quarter of a hin), so, the former, three logs. (Ibid. 12) \"Thus shall you do for (each) one\": This tells me only of these (i.e., the original sacrifices). Whence do I derive (the same for) their exchanges? From \"Thus shall you do for each one.\" (Ibid. \"According to the number (of animals) that you offer\": He may not decrease (the number of libations). — But perhaps if he wishes to increase (the number) he may do so. It is, therefore, (to negate this) written \"According (i.e., strictly according) to their number.\" These are the words of R. Yoshiyah. R. Yonah says: This (derivation) is not needed. For it is already written (Ibid. 15) \"All the native-born shall do (precisely) thus, these things\" — neither to decrease nor to increase. What, then, is the intent of \"According to the number that you offer\"? I might think that if he wishes to double (the original number as a gift) he may do so. It is, therefore, written \"Thus shall you offer (libations) for (each) one, according to their number.\" From here they ruled: It is permitted to intermix the libations for bullocks with those of rams; the libations of lambs with the libation of (other) lambs; the libations of individuals with those of the congregation; the libations of the day with those of the preceding evening (— their numbers being the same.) But it is not permitted to intermix the libations of lambs with those of bullocks and rams (— their numbers not being the same).",
            " (Ibid. 13) \"All the native-born shall thus do, etc.\": From here we learn that libations can be donated. How much? Three logs, (which suffice for a lamb). And whence is it derived that if he wishes to add he may do so? From \"shall do.\" I might think he can decrease; it is, therefore, written \"thus.\" From here it was derived: One is not to donate two or five, (which do not [exactly] suffice for anything), but he may donate three or four or six or above, (which do [exactly] suffice for something). Variantly: What is the intent of \"All the native-born, etc.\"? Because it is written (Vayikra 22:25) \"And from the hand of a gentile you shall not present (as a sacrifice) the bread of your G-d of all these (blemished animals)\" — These you do not accept (from gentiles), but you do accept unblemished animals. After we have learned that a gentile may bring a burnt-offering, I can now conclude: An Israelite brings a burnt-offering and a gentile brings a burnt-offering. Can I also conclude: Just as an Israelite brings libations, so, a gentile brings libations? It is, therefore, written \"All the native-born shall thus do these (libations)\" — An Israelite brings libations, but a gentile does not. I might, then, think that his burnt-offering does not require libations; it is, therefore, written \"shall thus do\" (to bring libations) — whence they ruled: If a gentile sent his burnt-offering from abroad and sent libations along with it, his own are used; and if not they are to be brought by the congregation."

From \"and who shall be in your midst throughout your generations.\" \"and he shall offer a fire-offering\": kinds of blood (i.e., animal sacrifices involving blood). You say sacrifices involving blood, but perhaps only a meal-offering (which is entirely burned)! — It is, therefore, written \"Thus shall he do.\" Just as you (in the desert offered) kinds of (sacrifices involving) blood, so, converts offer kinds of blood. — (In that case,) why should we not say: Just as Israel (in the desert offered) blood of a beast ([and not of a fowl] viz. Shemot 24:5), so, converts (are inducted only) through the blood of a beast. It is, therefore, written (Bamidbar, Ibid. 16) (\"One Torah and one judgment shall there be) for you (and for the stranger who sojourns with you\") — To you (in general, as requiring blood for induction into Israel) have I likened him and not to (the specifics [i.e., beast versus fowl] of) your offerings. Rebbi says: Just as Israel entered the covenant only with three things — circumcision, immersion, and acceptance of the offering — so, the proselytes, like them. — But perhaps just as Israel through peace-offerings, so, proselytes, through peace-offerings.

Only a fowl burnt-offering ([but in a beast burnt-offering, the skin reverts to the Cohanim]). I might think (that the induction of the proselyte can be satisfied) even with a meal-offering; it is, therefore, written (\"As you are) thus (shall the stranger be\"). To bring one bird (as a fowl burnt-offering) is impossible. For we do not find a single bird serving as an offering in the entire Torah — whence it was stated: All the bird couples in the Torah — half is a burnt-offering; half a sin-offering, except for that of a proselyte, which is entirely (relegated) to the fire. Variantly: \"As you do, thus shall he do\": What is the intent of this? For it would follow (otherwise), that since we find the Torah to have differentiated his offering, (Israel bringing [beast] burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and a proselyte, a fowl burnt-offering), it is, therefore, written \"Just as you do (with libations), thus shall he do\" — Just as you, six (logs) for a bullock, four for a ram, and three for a lamb, thus the proselytes.\""

For in all the other instances it is written \"And it shall be, when you come to the land\"; \"And it shall be when the L-rd shall bring you\" (all such expressions connoting permanent settlement), whereas here it is written \"upon your coming\" (connoting the moment of arrival), to teach that the mitzvah of challah (the Cohein's share of the dough) devolved upon them immediately upon their entering the land \"whither I bring you there\": From here you derive that produce grown outside the land which enters the land is subject to challah. It is from here (Eretz Yisrael) to there that R. Eliezer ruled it subject to challah, and R. Akiva exempts it. R. Yehudah says: Produce grown outside the land which entered the land — R.

Devarim 18:4]) — But perhaps it speaks of the challah offering! — (This cannot be, for) (Bamidbar, Ibid. 20) \"challah, you shall offer up an offering\" already speaks of challah. How, then, is \"you shall offer up an offering to the L-rd to be understood? As referring to the \"great terumah,\" (which is taken before the challah is separated). (Devarim 18:4) \"The first of your corn, your wine, and your oil … shall you give to him\" (the Cohein). This is mandatory. You say that it is mandatory, but perhaps it is optional (i.e., if you separate it, you must give it to him, but you need not separate it.) It is, therefore, written \"You shall separate terumah\" — It is mandatory and not optional. I might think that flours, too, are subject to challah; it is, therefore, written \"the first of your dough\" — when it has become dough. [From here they ruled: One may eat a chance meal of started dough of wheat before it has been rolled out, or of barley before it had been well kneaded, (after which it becomes subject to challah). If one ate of it — of wheat flour, after it had been rolled out, or of barley flour after it had been well kneaded, (without taking challah) — he is liable to the death penalty. Once she had added the water, she must remove her challah, so long as there not remain there (in the kneading-trough) five quarter-kavs or more of flour that had not been mixed with water, (for if there did, they are subject to challah.)] For challah is not taken from (unprocessed) flour. If one had not taken challah from the dough, I might think he may not take it from the bread; it is, therefore, written (Bamidbar, Ibid. 19) \"And it shall be when you eat of the bread of the land, you shall separate, etc.\" R. Akiva says: All (vis-à-vis the separation of challah) is contingent upon its forming a crust in the oven. (Ibid. 24) \"As terumah of the threshing floor, so shall you offer it\" (the challah). Just as with terumah, (the designated separation is) one (part) to a thousand, so, challah. And just as terumah of the threshing floor is \"raised\" (if it became intermixed) with one hundred and one times (its amount of non-terumah — which may then be eaten by non-Cohanim); and it creates a forbidden admixture for non-Cohanim if it fell into (only) a hundred of non-terumah; and it creates liability to the death penalty and to the one-fifth (chomesh) restitution penalty (viz. Vayikra 5:16) — so, with challah. These are the words of R. Yoshiyah. R. Yonathan \"whispered\" to him: You liken it to terumah of the threshing floor, (the percentage of) which is unspecified (in the Torah)? I will liken it to terumath ma'aser (Bamidbar 18:26), (the percentage of) which is explicit (in the Torah) — and one-tenth should be taken (as challah). He responded: It is written \"As the terumah of the threshing floor, so shall you offer it.\" It is likened to terumah of the threshing floor, and not to terumath ma'aser.",
            " (Bamidbar 15:21) \"Of the first of your dough\": Why is this written? (i.e., It is already written in the preceding verse.) From (the preceding verse) \"The first of your dough,\" I might understand it to mean the first of (all) your doughs. It is, therefore, written \"Of the first of your dough\" — part of it and not all of it. (Ibid. 20) \"The first of your dough\": To include leket (Vayikra 19:9), shikchah (Devarim 24:19), and peah (Vayikra 19:9) as subject to challah. For it would follow (otherwise), viz.: If other produce (i.e., rice and millet), which is subject to ma'aser, is exempt from challah, then leket, shikchah, and peah, which are not subject to ma'aser, how much more so should they be exempt from challah! It is, therefore, written \"the first of your dough,\" to include leket, shikchah, and peah as subject to challah. Or, let other produce be subject to challah, viz.: If leket, shikchah, and peah, which are exempt from ma'aser, are subject to challah, then other produce, which is subject to ma'aser, how much more so should it be subject to challah! It is, therefore, written (Devarim 16:3) \"bread.\" Just as \"bread\" there, is of the five species, so, \"bread\" here (which is subject to challah) is of the five species. (Bamidbar, Ibid.) \"The first of your dough\": I would understand this to include the dough of terumah and the dough of second-tithe. It is, therefore, written (Ibid.) \"challah shall you separate as an offering\": (The connotation is:) What is separated is holy and what remains is mundane, and not (as in the above instance) where both are holy. But they said: The dough of second-tithe in Jerusalem is subject to challah, (for second-tithe may be eaten by the owner in Jerusalem, so that it is not \"holy\" there). (Ibid. 21) \"shall you give to the L-rd as an offering\": What is the intent of this? Because it is written (20) \"challah shall you separate as an offering,\" but we have not been apprised of the amount of the challah, it is, therefore, written \"shall you give to the L-rd as an offering\" — so that it comprises a \"gift\" to the Cohein. From here we derive: The amount of challah for a private person — one (part) out of twenty-four; for a baker; one out of forty-eight. For the dough of a private person is little, and it (less than one twenty-fourth) does not constitute a \"gift\" to the Cohein, whereas the dough of a baker is (relatively) large and it (one forty-eighth) constitutes a \"gift\" to the Cohein. R. Yehudah says: This is not the reason; but a private person is generous with his dough and a baker is sparing of his dough, and when he minimizes, he should not minimize less than one forty-eighth. From here it was ruled: A private person who makes a feast for his sons — one twenty-fourth; and a woman who bakes and sells in the marketplace — one forty-eighth. If her dough became tamei unwittingly or under constraint — one forty-eighth. If it became tamei willfully (i.e., if she deliberately made it tamei in order to give less challah), she takes one twenty-fourth (even though the challah is to be burned), so that \"the sinner not profit.\" R. Shimon b. Yochai says: Even if it came out to one-sixtieth, it is valid, so long as there was no (original) intent (for that amount). (Ibid. 21) \"throughout your generations\": to include the aftergrowths of shevi'ith (the sabbatical year) as being subject to challah. For it would follow (otherwise), viz.: If other produce, which is subject to the tithe is exempt from challah, then the after-growths of shevi'ith, which are exempt from the tithe, how much more so should it be exempt from challah! — (No,) this is refuted by leket, shikchah, and peah, which, though exempt from the tithe are subject to challah. — No, this may be true of leket, shikchah, and peah, whose kind (i.e., other produce, which is not leket, etc.) is subject to the tithe — for which reason they are subject to challah, as opposed to the dough of shevi'ith, whose kind is exempt from the tithe, (ownerless produce [hefker] being exempt from the tithe) — wherefore it (the dough) should be exempt from challah. It is, therefore, written \"throughout your generations,\" to include the aftergrowths of shevi'ith as being subject to challah. From here they ruled: If one eats of the aftergrowths of shevi'ith before its challah has been taken, he is liable to the death penalty."

Meir says: If a tribe transgressed according to the (erroneous) ruling of its beth-din, I might think they bring (the offerings); it is, therefore, written \"and they (i.e., all of the tribes) have brought their offering.\" R.

From \"and they (connoting all of the tribes) have brought their offering, a fire-offering to the L-rd.\" For R. Yoshiyah says: A tribe that transgressed according to the (erroneous) ruling of beth-din is liable, and the other tribes are exempt. If a tribe transgressed according to the (erroneous) ruling of the great beth-din (i.e., the Sanhedrin), then that tribe brings a bullock, and the other tribes bring because of it. And what do they bring because of it? Twelve bullocks. R. Shimon b. Yochai says: If a tribe transgressed according to the (erroneous) ruling of beth-din, it is exempt. If it transgressed according to the ruling of the great beth-din, they bring two bullocks: one for the tribe and one for the beth-din. When is this so? With other mitzvoth; but with idolatry, they bring two bullocks and two he-goats: one bullock for a burnt-offering and a he-goat for a sin-offering for that tribe, and the same for the beth-din. The majority of the congregation is reckoned as all of the congregation. \"and they have brought their offering: a fire-offering to the L-rd\": this is the burnt-offering; \"and their sin-offering\": this is the sin-offering for idolatry; \"their error\": this is the bullock of \"concealment\" of the congregation (viz.

And, furthermore, it follows a fortiori, viz.: If (in the Yom Kippur service) where the congregation does not bring a bullock, the high-priest brings a bullock (viz.

And here (in respect to idolatry) Scripture removes them from their category, to have an individual, a Nassi, and the high-priest bring \"a she-goat of the first year as a sin-offering\" — for which reason this section was stated. You say that it speaks of idolatry, but perhaps it speaks of (any) one of all the mitzvoth written in the Torah! Would you say that? What is the subject under discussion? Idolatry! R. Yitzchak says: Scripture (here) speaks of idolatry. — But perhaps it speaks of (any) one of all the mitzvoth written in the Torah! — You reason as follows: The congregation was in the general category (of all of the mitzvoth, to bring a bullock), and (in respect to idolatry) its offerings were changed (to bring a bullock for a burnt-offering and a he-goat for a sin-offering.) And the individual was in the general category (of all the mitzvoth, etc.), and (in respect to idolatry) its offerings were changed, etc. Just as there (in respect to the congregation) Scripture speaks of idolatry; here, too, it is understood to be speaking of idolatry. \"And if one soul sin (the sin of idolatry) in error\": to exclude (from the offering) one who sins willfully (without witnesses or warning).

It is, therefore, written \"in error\" — to exclude willful (transgression). \"he shall bring a she-goat of the first year as a sin-offering.\" This is a prototype, viz.: Wherever \"goat\" is written, it must be of the first year. (Ibid. 28) \"And the Cohein shall make atonement for the soul that is unwitting in sinning\": It is the sins that he has done (willfully), which have caused him to err. \"unwitting in sinning\": to exclude unwittingness of (its being) idolatry, (e.g., mistaking a church for a synagogue and bowing down to it.) For it would follow (otherwise), viz.: If he is liable (to bring an offering) for unwitting transgression of other mitzvoth, how much more so for the \"grave\" transgression of idolatry! It is, therefore, written \"unwitting in sinning,\" but not unwitting as to (its being) idolatry. \"to atone for him\": to exclude an instance of doubt (as to whether or not he had sinned). For it would follow (otherwise), viz.: If he must bring an offering for an instance of possible transgression of \"light\" mitzvoth, how much more so for an instance of possible transgression of idolatry (e.g., if there is a possibility of his having bowed down to an asheirah [a tree devoted to idolatry])! It is, therefore, written \"And he shall atone\" (implying that there has been a sin), to exclude (an instance of) doubt (as to whether a sin has been committed.) \"and he shall be forgiven\": absolute forgiveness, as with all of the other \"forgivings\" in the Torah, (even though the sin of idolatry [though unwitting] has been committed). (Ibid. 15:29) \"The native-born among the children of Israel, etc.\" What is the intent of this? Because it is written (Vayikra 24:22) \"All of the native-born in Israel shall sit in succoth,\" I might think that only Israelites are intended. Whence do I derive the same for proselytes? It is, therefore, written \"the native-born among the children of Israel and for the stranger that sojourns among them.\" This is a prototype: wherever \"native-born\" is written, proselytes are also included. Variantly: What is the intent of \"the native-born among the children of Israel\"? For it would follow otherwise, viz.: Israelites are commanded against idolatry, and gentiles are commanded against idolatry. If I have learned that Israelites bring (an offering) for unwitting idolatry, so, gentiles should bring an offering for unwitting idolatry. It is, therefore, written \"the native-born among the children of Israel\": Israelites bring (an offering) for unwitting idolatry, but not gentiles.

Vayikra 20:3]), and unwitting transgression, by a sin-offering (viz.

Rebbi says: If a man does one mitzvah lishmah (for the sake of Heaven), let him rejoice not only in that mitzvah alone; for in the end, it will \"pull along\" many mitzvoth. And if a man commits one transgression, let him not despond over it alone, for in the end, it will pull along many transgressions. For mitzvah \"tows\" mitzvah, and transgression, transgression.

Azaryah says: As a man would say to his neighbor: \"You have scraped out the dish (of food) and 'scraped' ('megaref,' similar to 'megadef') the 'dish' itself.\" (i.e., this is the ultimate insult). Issi b. Akiva says: As one would say to his neighbor: \"You have scraped out the entire dish and left nothing in it.\" (Ibid.) \"and that soul will be cut off\": \"cutting-off\" connotes cessation (of the family line, i.e., he will be childless). \"that soul\": who acts deliberately. \"from the midst of its people\": but its people will remain at peace.

Variantly: \"For the word of the L-rd he has despised\": This is one who distorts the Torah. \"and His commandment he has broken\": This is one who breaks the covenant of the flesh (circumcision, i.e., one who does not circumcise his sons.) From here R. Elazar Hamodai said: One who desecrates the offerings, and cheapens the festivals, and breaks the covenant (of circumcision) of our father Abraham — even if he has performed many mitzvoth, it were best to \"thrust\" him from the world!

And even if he says: The entire Torah is from the mouth of the Holy One (except for) this thing that Moses said on his own — And even if he said: The entire Torah I accept, except for this inference, this kal vachomer (a fortiori argument) — this is \"For the word of the L-rd he has despised.\" Variantly: \"For the word of the L-rd he has despised\": This is one who learns, but does not teach others. R. Nechemiah says: This is one who is able to learn but does not. R. Nathan said: This is one who paid no heed at all to words of Torah. R. Yishmael says: The verse speaks of idolatry, as it is written \"For the word of the L-rd he has despised\" — the first commandment of the Omnipotent One — (Shemot 20:2-3) \"I am the L-rd your G-d … There shall be unto you no other gods before Me.\" (Bamidbar, Ibid.) \"cut off shall be cut off\": \"cut off\" — in this world; \"shall be cut off\" — in the world to come. These are the words of R. Akiva. R. Yishmael says: But is it not already written (Ibid. 30) \"It is the L-rd whom he blasphemes; and that soul shall be cut off'? Are there three worlds? Rather, \"and that soul shall be cut off\" — in this world. \"cut off\" — in the world to come. \"cut off shall be cut off\" — Torah speaks in the language of man. (Ibid. 31) \"its transgression is in it\": All who die are atoned for by death; but this one, \"its transgression is in it.\" As it is written (Ezekiel 32:27) \"And their transgressions shall be upon their bones.\" — Even if they have repented? — It is, therefore, written (when) \"its transgression is in it,\" and not when he has repented. Similarly, (Devarim 32:5) \"They have corrupted themselves — not His children — their blemish\" — When their blemish is in them, they are not His children. When their blemish is not in them, they are His children. R. Yishmael says: \"its transgression is in it\": What is the intent of this? Because it is written (Shemot 20:5) \"He visits the iniquity of the fathers upon sons,\" I might think that (the father's sin of) idolatry, too, is visited upon sons \"until the third and fourth generation\"; it is, therefore, written (here, in respect to idolatry) \"its transgression is in it\" — in it (the soul of the doer) the transgression inheres, and it is not visited upon the sons, and not on the third and on the fourth generation. R. Nathan says: This (\"its transgression is in it\") is a good sign for a man, (indicating) that his transgressions are exacted of him after his death, (so that he may merit life in the world to come.) If a dead one is not eulogized or buried, or if he is eaten by an animal, or if rain descended upon it — this is a good sign, (indicating that his transgressions are being exacted of him after his death.) And even though there is no (Scriptural) proof for this, it is intimated in (Jeremiah 8:1-2) \"At that time, says the L-rd, they will remove the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of its officers … And they will spread them out under the sun and the moon, etc.\" R. Shimon b. Elazar said: From here (\"its transgression is in it\") I have exposed (as false) the books of the Samaritans. For they say: The dead do not live — whereupon I said to them: But it is written \"That soul shall be cut off; its transgression is in it.\" Let this not be stated (i.e., What purpose does it serve?) — It indicates that it (the soul) is destined to give an accounting on the day of judgment."

You say that, but perhaps (the reference is to) a man himself, whose name was \"Mekoshesh,\" (who was carrying wood).

It is written here (32) \"desert,\" and elsewhere (27:23) (\"Our father died in the) desert.\" Just as there, Tzelafchad; here, too, Tzelafchad. These are the words of R. Akiva. R. Yehudah b.

And you are libeling that tzaddik! But who was it? It was one of \"the bold ones,\" viz. (Ibid. 14:44) \"And they made bold to go up to the top of the mountain.\" (Ibid. 15:32) \"And they found a man pulling up wood.\": We are hereby apprised that Moses appointed watchers (to this end), and they found him pulling up wood. (Ibid. 33) \"And they brought him near — those who found him pulling up wood.\": Why is this mentioned again? Is not already written \"And they found a man, etc.\"? We are hereby taught that they warned him (after finding him) and he continued doing so. R. Yitzchak says: This (repetition) is not necessary (to teach that prior warning is a prerequisite for the administration of the death penalty), viz.: If idolatry, the gravest (of all transgressions) is not liable (to the death penalty) without prior warning, how much more so does this hold for all the mitzvoth of the Torah. What is the intent, then, of \"those who found him\"? We are hereby apprised that they forewarned him, specifying the forbidden labor — whence it is derived that in the instance of all the proto-labors (avoth melachoth) in the Torah, there must be forewarning, specifying the forbidden labor. (Bamidbar, Ibid.) (\"And they brought him near to Moses and to Aaron and to the entire congregation\": If Moses did not know, would Aaron know? — Reverse the verse (i.e., \"they brought him near to Aaron [who did not know] and to Moses,\" and expound it. These are the words of R. Yoshiyah. R. Channan says in the name of R. Elazar: They (Moses and Aaron) were sitting in the house of study, and they came and stood before them."

            " (Bamidbar 15:34) \"And they placed him in ward\": We are hereby apprised that all who are liable to krithuth (\"cutting off\") are put in ward (pending judgment). \"for it was not made clear what should be done with him\": But is it not written (Shemot 31:14) \"He who profanes it shall be put to death\"? What, then, is the intent of \"For it was not made clear\"? He did not know with what specific type of death until it was told to Him by the Holy One. (Ibid. 35) \"And the L-rd said to Moses: Die, shall die the man\": (i.e., this is the judgment) for all the generations (and not just in this particular instance.) \"stone him with stones\": in this particular instance. \"the entire congregation\": in the presence of the entire congregation. You say this, but perhaps it is to be understood literally (i.e., that the entire congregation is to stone him.) It is, therefore, written (Devarim 17:7) \"The hand of the witnesses shall be against him first to put him to death.\" How, then, am I to understand \"the entire congregation\"? As in the presence of the entire congregation. (15:36) \"And the entire congregation took him outside the camp\": We are hereby taught that all those who are liable to the death penalty are put to death outside of beth-din. \"And they stoned him with stones\": One verse states \"with stones,\" and another, (Vayikra 24:23) \"with a stone.\" How are these two verses to be reconciled? The stoning site was two stories high. One of the witnesses pushes him on his thighs. If he turns over on his heart, he is turned over on his thighs. If he dies thereby, it is sufficient. If not, the second witness takes a stone and places it on his heart. If he dies thereby, it is sufficient. If not, all of Israel stone him with stones, in fulfillment of \"the hand of the witnesses shall be against him first to put him to death, and the hand of all the people thereafter.\" There are thus reconciled \"stone him with stones\" and \"and they stoned him with a stone.\" (Bamidbar, Ibid.) \"as the L-rd commanded Moses\": He said to them \"Stone him,\" and they stoned him; \"Hang him up,\" and they hung him up. But we have not (yet) heard that they were to hang him up (after he had been killed.) It is, therefore, written (Devarim 21:22) \"If there be in a man a sin punishable by death, then he is to be put to death and you shall (thereafter) hang him on a tree.\" These are the words of R. Eliezer. R. Chidka said: Shimon Hashikmoni was a friend of mine, of the disciples of R. Akiva, and he said: Moses knew that the mekoshesh was to be put to death, but he did not know with which specific kind of death. It were fitting that the section of the mekoshesh be stated (entirely) through Moses but the mekoshesh, being liable had it stated through him. For \"merit resolves itself through the meritorious, and liability through the liable.\""

            " (Bamidbar 15:37-38) \"And the L-rd spoke to Moses, saying … and they shall make for themselves tzitzith\": Women, too, are included (in the mitzvah of tzitzith.) R. Shimon exempts women from tzitzith, it being a time-based (only in the daytime) positive commandment, from which women are exempt, this being the principle: R. Shimon said: Women are exempt from all time-based positive commandments. R. Yehudah b. Bava said: Of a certainty, the sages exempted a woman's veil from tzitzith, and they are required in a wrap only because sometimes her husband covers himself with it. \"tzitzith\": \"tzitzith\" is something which \"protrudes\" (\"yotzeh\") somewhat. And the elders of Beth Shammai and those of Beth Hillel have already entered the upper chamber of Yonathan b. Betheira and declared: Tzitzith have no prescribed size. And they declared, similarly: A lulav has no prescribed size. \"and they shall make for themselves tzitzith.\" I might think that one string suffices; it is, therefore, written (Devarim 22:12) \"Fringes (shall you make for yourself.\") How many fringes? Not fewer than three. These are the words of Beth Hillel. Beth Shammai say: Three of wool and the fourth of tcheleth (blue linen). And the halachah is in accordance with Beth Shammai. When is this so (that a minimum size is required)? In the beginning (of its attachment). But for what is left over or lopped off any size (is sufficient). (Bamidbar, Ibid.) \"and they shall make for themselves tzitzith.\" I might think that all of it shall be tzitzith; it is, therefore, written \"fringes.\" If \"fringes,\" I might think all of it shall be fringes. It is, therefore, written \"tzitzith.\" How is this (to be implemented)? That its fringes protrude from the corner (of the garment), and tzitzith from the fringes. \"in the corners of their garments\": I might think, even garments that are three-cornered, five-cornered, six-cornered, seven-cornered, and eight-cornered; it is, therefore, written (Devarim, Ibid.) \"on the four corners of your garment,\" to exclude the aforementioned. And whence is it derived that pillows and covers are (also) excluded (from tzitzith)? From (Ibid.) \"wherewith you cover yourself.\" If from there, I would think that night-clothes are also included (as requiring tzitzith). It is, therefore, written (Bamidbar, Ibid. 39) \"and you shall see it\" — in the daytime and not at night. And if it were intended both for day and night, it requires tzitzith. I might think that this excludes both the above and the garment of a blind man; it is, therefore, written (Bamidbar, Ibid. 39) \"And it shall be for you for tzitzith\" — in any event (i.e., to include a blind man). (Ibid. 38) \"and they shall place on the tzitzith (on) the corner a strand of tcheleth\": spun and doubled. This tells me only of the tcheleth, that it is to be spun and doubled. Whence do I derive (the same for) the white (i.e., the wool)? You derive it by induction, viz.: Since the Torah said: \"place\" tcheleth and \"place\" white, just as tcheleth is spun and doubled, so, white is spun and doubled. \"and they shall place\": on the place of the weaving (i.e., the corner of the garment), and not on the place of the \"growing\" (i.e., the strands at the corner of the garment). If he did place it on the site of the \"growing,\" it is (nonetheless) kasher. R. Eliezer b. Yaakov includes it both on the \"growing\" and on the very edge of the garment, it being written \"on the corners of their garments.\" \"and they shall place on the tzitzith (on) the corner\": What is the intent of this? From \"and they shall make for themselves tzitzith, I might think that he should weave it (the tzitzith) together with it (the garment; it is, therefore, written \"and they shall place.\" How so? He ties it (the tzitzith) together with it (the garment). (Ibid. 39) \"And it shall be to you for tzitzith\": The four tzitzith are mutually inclusive (i.e., in the absence of one there is no mitzvah), the four being one mitzvah. R. Yishmael says: They are four mitzvoth. R. Elazar b. R. Shimon says: Why is it called \"tcheleth\"? Because the Egyptians were \"bereaved\" (\"nitkelu\" [like \"tcheleth\"]) of their first-born, viz. (Shemot 12:29) \"And it was in the middle of the night, that the L-rd smote every first-born, etc.\" Variantly: Because the Egyptians were \"destroyed\" (\"kalu\") in the Red Sea. Why is it called \"tzitzith\"? Because the L-rd \"looked\" (\"hetzith\") over our fathers' houses in Egypt, as it is written (Song of Songs 2:9) \"The voice of My Beloved, behold, it is coming … My Beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart … Behold, He stands behind our wall, looking through the windows, peering through the lattices.\" R. Chanina b. Antignos says: One who fulfills the mitzvah of tzitzith, what is said of him? (Zechariah 8:23) \"In these days it will happen that ten men, of all the languages of the nations will take hold of the corner (i.e., of the tzitzith) of a Jewish man, saying 'Let us go with you, for we have heard that G-d is with you!'\" And one who nullifies the mitzvah of \"the corner,\" what is said of him? (Iyyov 38:13) \"to take hold of the corners of the earth and to shake the wicked from it!\" R. Meir says: It is not written (Bamidbar, Ibid. 39) \"And you shall see them\" (the tzitzith), but \"And you shall see Him.\" Scripture hereby apprises us that if one fulfills the mitzvah of tzitzith, it is reckoned unto him as if he beheld the face of the Shechinah. For tcheleth is reminiscent of (the color of) the sea; the sea, of the firmament; and the firmament, of the Throne of Glory, as it is written (Ezekiel 1:26) \"And above the firmament that was over their heads … (28) the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the L-rd.\" (Bamidbar, Ibid.) \"and you shall see and you shall remember\": See this mitzvah and remember another mitzvah, (which is contingent upon it.) Which is that? The recitation of the Shema — But perhaps (the reference is to) one of all the other mitzvoth of the Torah. It is, therefore, written (in the section of tzitzith, Ibid. 41) \"I am the L-rd your G-d,\" which you find to be written only in (the section of) the recitation of the Shema. \"and you shall remember\": Remember (i.e., recite) the section with your mouth. I might think that the section \"vehaya im shamoa\" (Devarim 11:13-21) should precede all of the sections. — Would you say that? The section of Shema (Devarim 6:4-9), which contains acceptance of the yoke of the kingdom of Heaven should precede \"vehaya im shamoa,\" which contains acceptance of the yoke of mitzvoth, and \"vehaya im shamoa,\" which obtains both in the daytime and at night, should precede the section of tzitzith (\"vayomer\" [Bamidbar 15:37-41]), which obtains only in the daytime. And perhaps he should recite three (sections) in the evening as he does in the daytime. It is, therefore, written (of tzitzith [Bamidbar 15:39]) \"and you shall see it\" — in the daytime and not at night. R. Shimon b. Yochai says: The section of Shema, which contains (the mitzvah of) learning (Torah), should precede \"vehaya im shamoa,\" which speaks only of teaching. And \"vehaya im shamoa\" should precede the section of tzitzith, which is only to do (i.e., the final stage). For thus was Torah given: to learn and to teach, to keep and to do: \"And you shall see it, and you shall remember (all the mitzvoth of the L-rd, and you shall do them.\"): Now does this not follow a fortiori, viz.: If one who fulfills the mitzvah of tzitzith, (which is only a sign and a remembrance towards the doing of mitzvoth,) is accounted as one who has fulfilled all of the mitzvoth, how much more so (is this true of) one who (actively) performs (any one of) all the mitzvoth of the Torah! \"And you shall not go astray after your hearts\": This is heresy, as it is written (Koheleth 7:26) \"And I find more bitter than death 'the woman' (heresy), whose heart is snares and nets. Her hands are bonds. The good before G-d shall escape her.\" \"and after your eyes\": This is harlotry, as it is written (Judges 14:3) \"Take her for me, for she is just in my eyes.\" \"after which you go astray\": This is idolatry, as it is written (Ibid. 8:33) \"and they went astray after the ba'alim.\" R. Nathan says: that one not \"drink\" in this \"cup\" (i.e., his own wife), and cast his gaze at the \"cup\" of another. Variantly: \"And you shall not go astray after your hearts and after your eyes\": This teaches us that the eyes follow the heart. — But perhaps the heart follows the eyes! Would you say that? Are there not blind men who commit all the abominations in the world? What, then, is the intent of \"And you shall not go astray after your hearts, etc.\"? That the eyes follow the heart. R. Yishmael says: \"And you shall not go astray after your hearts\": What is the intent of this? From (Koheleth 11:9) \"Rejoice young man in your youth (… and walk in the ways of your heart\"), (I would not know whether) in a way that is straight or in (any) way that you like; it is, therefore, written \"And you shall not go astray after your hearts.\" (Ibid. 40) \"So that you remember and you do (all of My mitzvoth): This equates remembering with doing. \"and you shall be holy to your G-d\": This refers to the holiness of all of the mitzvoth. You say the holiness of (all the) mitzvoth, but perhaps the holiness of tzitzith (is intended). — Would you say that? What is the (general) context? The holiness of all the mitzvoth. Rebbi says: The reference is to the holiness of tzitzith. You say the holiness of tzitzith, but perhaps the holiness of all the mitzvoth is intended. — (Vayikra 19:2) \"Holy shall you be\" already refers to the holiness of all the mitzvoth. How, then, am I to understand \"and you shall be holy to your G-d\"? As referring to the holiness of tzitzith — whence it is seen that tzitzith add holiness to Israel. (Ibid. 41) \"I am the L-rd your G-d, who took you out of the land of Egypt.\": Why is this mentioned here? So that one not say: I will take imitation-dyed threads (and attach them to my garment) as tcheleth, and who will know the difference? If (within the framework of) the measure of punishment, the lesser measure (of the L-rd) — if one sins in secret, He exposes him in public, (as He did in Egypt), then, (within the framework of) the measure of good, the greater measure (of the L-rd) — how much more so (does this hold true)! Variantly: Why is the exodus from Egypt mentioned in connection with every mitzvah? An analogy: The son of a king's loved one was taken captive. When he (the king) redeems him, he redeems him not as a son, but as a servant, so that if he (the son) does not accept his decree, he can say to him \"You are my servant!\" When they enter the province, he (the king) says to him: Put on my sandals and carry my things before me to the bath-house. The son begins to object, whereupon the king presents him with his writ (of servitude) and says to him: \"You are my servant!\" Thus, when the Holy One Blessed be He redeemed the seed of His loved one, He did not redeem them as \"sons,\" but as servants, so that if they reject His decree He says to them: \"You are My servants!\" When they went to the desert, He began to decree upon them some \"light\" mitzvoth and some formidable ones, such as Shabbath, illicit relations, tzitzith, and tefillin, and Israel began to object — whereupon He said to them: \"You are My servants! On that condition I redeemed you; on condition that I decree and you fulfill!\" \"I am the L-rd your G-d\": Why is this stated again? Is it not already written (Shemot 20:2) \"I am the L-rd your G-d who took you out of the land of Egypt\"? Why state it again? So that Israel not say: Why did the L-rd command us (to do mitzvoth)? Is it not so that we do them and receive reward? We shall not do them and we shall not receive reward! As Israel said (Ezekiel 20:1) \"There came to me (Ezekiel) men of the elders of Israel to make inquiry of the L-rd, and they sat before me.\" They said to him: A servant whose Master has sold him, does he not leave His domain? Ezekiel: Yes. They: Since the L-rd has sold us to the nations, we have left His domain. Ezekiel: A servant whose Master has sold him in order to return, does he leave His domain? (Ibid. 32-33) \"And what enters your minds, it shall not be, your saying: We will be like the nations, like the families of the lands, to serve wood and stone. As I live, says the L-rd G-d. I swear to you that I will rule over you with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm and with outpoured wrath!\" \"with a strong hand\": pestilence, as it is written (in that regard, Shemot 9:3) \"Behold, the hand of the L-rd is in your cattle, etc.\" \"with an outstretched arm\": the sword, as it is written (I Chronicles 21:16) \"with his (the angel's) sword drawn in his hand, stretched over Jerusalem.\" \"and with outpoured wrath\": famine. After I bring these three calamities upon you, one after the other, I will rule over you perforce!",
            " R. Nathan said: There is no mitzvah in the Torah whose reward is not \"at its side.\" Go and learn this from the mitzvah of tzitzith. There was once a certain man who was particularly diligent in the mitzvah of tzitzith. Once, hearing of a (\"famed\") harlot in the cities of the sea, who took four hundred gold coins as her hire, he sent her that sum, and she set a time for him. When the appointed time came, he went there and sat at the door of her house. Her maid-servant went in and said to her: That man whom you appointed a time for is sitting at the door of the house. The harlot: Let him come in. When he came in, she spread seven beds for him, six of silver and one of gold, and she was on the uppermost. Between each one was a silver ladder, and the uppermost, of gold. When he came to the act, his four tzitzith came and struck him across his face. They seemed to him like four men. He immediately left off and sat upon the ground. She, too, left off and sat upon the ground. She said to him \"'Gapa of Rome' (an idolatrous oath), I shall not let you go until you tell me what blemish you have seen in me!\" He: I swear, I have seen no blemish in you. There is no beauty like yours in all the world, but there is one mitzvah (tzitzith) concerning which it is written two times (Bamidbar 15:41) \"I am the L-rd your G-d.\" \"I am the L-rd your G-d\" — I am destined to reward; \"I am the L-rd your G-d\" — I am destined to punish. And now they appeared to me as four witnesses (testifying to the above). At this, she said: I swear that I will not let you go until you write for me your name, the name of your city, and the name of the place where you study Torah. He wrote for her his name, the name of his city, the name of his master, and the name of the place where he studied Torah — whereupon she arose and divided all of her wealth: a third to the authorities (for permission to convert), a third to the poor, and a third which she took with her, in addition to those spreads. When she came to R. Meir's house of study, she said to him: My master, convert me. R. Meir: Is it possible that you have \"cast your eyes\" upon one of my disciples! At this, she took out the note that she had with her, and he said to her: \"Go and claim your purchase!\" Those spreads which she had spread for him unlawfully, she now spread for him lawfully, This was her reward in this world. As to the world to come, I do not know how much."

            " (Bamidbar 18:1) \"And the L-rd said to Aaron: You and your sons and the house of your father shall bear the sin of the sanctuary.\": R. Yishmael says: Because the thing (i.e., what follows) is relegated to Aaron, it is he that is exhorted. R. Yoshiyah says: Whence is it derived that if he (a Cohein) sprinkled the blood without knowing in whose name he is doing so or smoked the fat without knowing in whose name he is doing so, that the Cohanim bear the sin for this? From \"You and your sons and the house of your father shall bear the sin of the sanctuary.\" R. Yonathan says: Whence is it derived that if he took the flesh (of a sin-offering or a burnt-offering) before the blood was sprinkled (viz. Vayikra 7:7), or the breast and the shoulder before the smoking of the fats (viz. Ibid. 7:31), that the Cohanim bear the sin for this? From (Bamidbar, Ibid.) \"And you and your sons with you shall bear the sin of your priesthood.\" And thus do we find that the decree of Eli was sealed only because they (the Cohanim) abused the offerings, as it is written (I Samuel 2:15) \"Even before they would burn the fat … (16) And the man would say: Let them first burn the fat today (upon the altar) … (17) And the sin of the youths (the attendants of the Cohanim was very great, etc.\" And similarly we find that the decree of the men of Jerusalem was decreed only because they abused the offerings, viz. (Ezekiel 22:8) \"You abused My offerings.\" (Bamidbar, Ibid.) \"And you and your sons with you shall bear the sin of your priesthood.\": This refers to a sin (in the area of) what is relegated to the Cohanim (i.e., to keep zarim [non-priests] from entering the sanctuary). You say this, but perhaps it refers to a sin (in the area of) what is relegated to beth-din, (it being their duty to exhort the Cohanim in this regard.) (This is not so, for [Ibid. 7]) \"You and your sons, with you shall guard your priesthood for every thing of the altar\" already speaks of what is relegated to beth-din. How, then, am I to understand \"you shall bear the sin of your priesthood\"? As referring to a sin (in the area of) what is relegated to the priesthood. (Ibid. 1) \"And you and your sons with you\": and not Israelites (i.e., they are not to guard the sanctuary.) You say that Israelites do not bear the sin of the Cohanim, but perhaps Levites, (who also guard the sanctuary) do bear the sin of the Cohanim, (who are remiss in this regard.) It is, therefore, written (Ibid. 23) \"And they (the Levites) shall bear their (own) sin\" (of remissness), but not the sin of the Cohanim. (Ibid. 2) \"And also your brothers\": I might think that this also includes Israelites. It is, therefore, written \"the tribe of Levi.\" I might think that the women, too, are included. It is, therefore, written \"your brothers\" — to exclude the women. \"draw near with you\": R. Akiva says: It is written here \"with you,\" and elsewhere, (Ibid. 7) \"with you.\" Just as here, the Levites are being referred to, so, there, the Levites are being referred to — to exhort the Levites (against defect) in the song at their stand. (Ibid. 2) \"and they shall be joined to you and they shall serve you\": through their service. Treasurers and trustees are to be appointed from among them. You say this, but perhaps the intent is that they shall serve you (the Cohanim) in your (priestly) service. It is, therefore, (to negate this) written (Ibid. 3) \"And they shall keep your charge and the charge of all the tent.\" — But perhaps (both are intended, i.e.,) they shall serve you in your (priestly) service and they shall serve you through their service. It is, therefore, written (Ibid. 6) \"And I, behold, I have taken your brothers, the Levites, from the midst of the children of Israel, for you as a gift, given to the L-rd.\" To the L-rd are they given, and not to the Cohanim — whereby we derive that it is not to be construed in the second way (i.e., \"for your [priestly] service\"), but in the first way, i.e., their being appointed as treasurers and trustees. \"and you and your sons with you, before the tent of Testimony\": the Cohanim within, (in the court of the sanctuary,) and the Levites outside (the court). You say this, but perhaps the intent is both, within. It is, therefore, written (Ibid. 4) \"And they (the Levites) will join you, and they will keep (the watch of) the watch (by the Cohanim within) of the tent of meeting.\" How, then, am I to understand \"and you and your sons with you, before the tent of Testimony\"? The Cohanim within, and the Levites outside. (Ibid. 3) \"And they shall keep your charge and the charge of all the tent\": As stated above: They will serve you through their service, and appoint from among them treasurers and trustees. \"But to the vessels of the kodesh they shall not come near.\" This \"hakodesh\" (\"the holy\") refers to the ark, as it is written (Ibid. 4:20) \"And they (the Levites) shall not come to see (the vessels) when the kodesh is being covered and they (the Levites) die.\" \"and to the altar\": This refers to the (sacrificial) service of the altar. \"they shall not come near\": the exhortation. \"and they shall not die\": the punishment. This tells me only of the Levites, that they are punished and exhorted for (appropriating) the service of the Cohanim. Whence do I derive (the same for) Cohanim (appropriating) the service (i.e., singing) of the Levites? From (\"so that they not die,) both they (the Levites) and you\" (the Cohanim.) And it once happened that R. Yehoshua b. Chanania sought to assist R. Yochanan b. Gogada, when he (R. Yehoshua) said to him: Get back, for you are close to forfeiting your life! For I am of the gatekeepers and you are of the singers. Rebbi says that this (\"both they and you\") is not needed (for the above learning). For it is already written (Bamidbar 4:18-19) \"Do not cut off the tribe of the families of the Kehathi … but do this for them and they will live,\" (the implication being that otherwise they will die.) This tells me only of the sons of Kehath. Whence do I derive (the same for) the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari? From (Ibid. 19) \"Aaron and his sons shall come and set them (the sons of Levi), each man to his service and to his burden.\" This tells me only that the Levites are punished for (appropriating) the service of the Cohanim. Whence do I derive (the same for) the Cohanim (appropriating) the service of the Levites? From (Bamidbar 1:51) \"And when the mishkan travels, the Levites (and not the Cohanim) shall dismantle it. And the stranger (a non-Levite) that draws near (to this service) shall be put to death.\" Whence do I derive (the same for) one who goes from his (assigned) service to another? From (Ibid. 3:38) \"And those who encamped before the mishkan, in front, before the tent of meeting on the east\" (i.e., only these being assigned to the aforementioned service) … and the stranger (to that service, [even a Levite]) that draws near shall be put to death.\" What, then, is the need for \"so that they not die both they and you\"? Because Korach came and contested Aaron's prerogative, Scripture reiterated the entire exhortation (on demarcation of bounds). Variantly: \"both they and you\": Just as you (the Cohanim, are thus forewarned) vis-à-vis the altar service, so, they (the Levites, are thus forewarned). R. Nathan says: Levitical singing is hereby intimated in the Torah, but it (i.e., its nature) was explicated by Ezra. Chanania, the son of the brother of R. Yehoshua says: This (intimation) is not needed, for it is already written (Shemot 19:19) \"and G-d answered him (Moses, the Levite) by voice\" — relative to the mitzvah of the voice, whence (the mitzvah of Levitical) singing is intimated in the Torah. (Bamidbar 18:4) \"And they shall join you\": As we have stated, the Cohanim (keep guard) on the inside, and the Levites, on the outside. (Ibid.) \"and a stranger shall not draw near to you\": Why is this written? (i.e., it has already been mentioned.) — \"and the stranger that draws near shall be put to death\" tells us (only of) the punishment. Whence do we derive the exhortation? From \"and a stranger shall not draw near to you.\" (Ibid. 5) \"And you shall keep the charge of the sanctuary and the charge of the altar.\": This is an exhortation to a beth-din of Israelites to exhort the Cohanim towards the proper performance of the (sacrificial) service, which (service), when properly performed, fends off calamity from the world. (Ibid.) \"so that there be no more wrath.\" Why \"no more\"? For He has already vented His wrath (viz. 17:11). Similarly, (Bereshit 9:11) \"and no more shall there be a flood.\" Why \"no more\"? For it has already happened. Similarly, (Vayikra 18:7) \"And they shall no more offer their sacrifices to the goat-demons.\" Why \"no more\"? Because it already happened (in Egypt, viz. Ezekiel 20:7). Similarly, (Bamidbar 18:22) \"And the children of Israel shall no more draw near to the tent of meeting.\" Why \"no more\"? Because they had already done so (in the time of Korach, viz. Ibid. 16:35). Here, too, (Ibid. 18:5) \"so that there be no more wrath.\" Why \"no more\"? For He had already vented His wrath, as it is written (Ibid. 17:11) \"for the wrath has gone forth, etc.\"",
            " (Ibid. 6) \"And I, behold, I have taken your brothers, the Levites, from the midst of the children of Israel, for you as a gift, given to the L-rd.\" They are given to the L-rd (for His service) and not to the Cohanim. (Ibid. 7) \"And you and your sons with you shall guard your priesthood for every thing of the altar\": From here, R. Eliezer Hakappar berebbi was wont to say: Whatever pertains to the altar should be only to you and your sons. \"and within the parocheth (the curtain)\" — whence they stated: There was a place behind the inside of the holy of holies, where the genealogy of the priests was ascertained. \"and you shall serve\": I might think, in concert; it is, therefore, written \"a service of matanah.\" Just as \"matanah\" (the application of the blood of the sacrifices) is by lottery, so, all of the (other) services is by lottery. \"As a service of gift have I given your priesthood (to you)\": This equates the eating of kodshim (i.e., terumah, etc.) in the provinces (i.e., outside of the Temple) with the service of the Temple in the Temple. And it once happened that R. Tarfon (a Cohein) was late in coming to the house of study, whereupon R. Gamliel asked him: Why are you late? And he responded: I was serving (as a Cohein). R. Gamliel: All of your words are a puzzle. Is there (Temple) service now (that the Temple has been destroyed)? R. Tarfon: It is written \"As a service of gift have I given your priesthood (to you).\" This equates the eating of kodshim in the provinces with the service of the Temple in the Temple. Rebbi says: \"This equates the eating of kodshim in the provinces with the service of the Temple in the Temple\" — Just as with the service of the Temple in the Temple, he first washes his hands and then serves, so, with the eating of kodshim in the provinces — he first washes his hands and then eats. — But perhaps just as there, he washes both his hands and his feet, so, here! — Would you say that? In a place (the Temple) where he must wash his hands and his feet (in that he is standing on holy ground), he does so; but in a place where he needs to wash only his hands, that is what he does. We hereby learn the washing of the hands to be scripturally prescribed. \"and the stranger (i.e., the non-priest) that draws near shall be put to death\": (\"that draws near\") to (do) the (priestly) service. You say, to the service, but perhaps (the same obtains) to the service or not to the service, (but merely for entering). Would you say that? Now if one (a Cohein) who is blemished, who is only under an exhortation (and not subject to the death penalty), was exhorted only for performing a service, then a stranger, who is subject to the death penalty, how much more so is he to be punished only for a service! What, then, is the intent of \"and the stranger that draws near is to be put to death? (\"who draws near\") to the service. \"and the stranger that draws near shall be put to death\": even if he serves in (a state of) purity. — But perhaps (the intent is) if the serves in a state of tumah. — Would you say that? If one who (only) enters in (a state of) tumah, not for a service, is liable (to the death penalty [viz. Bamidbar 19:13]), how much more so one who serves (in a state of tumah)! What, then, is the intent of \"and the stranger that draws near shall be put to death\"? Even if he serves in (a state of) purity. R. Yishmael says: It is written here \"he shall be put to death,\" and, elsewhere, (Ibid. 17:28) \"Whoever draws near, who draws near to the mishkan of the L-rd, shall die.\" Just as there, at the hands of Heaven; here, too, at the hands of Heaven. R. Akiva says: It is written here \"he shall be put to death,\" and, elsewhere, (Devarim 13:6) \"And that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death.\" Just as there, by strangulation, here, too, by strangulation. \"and the stranger that draws near shall be put to death.\" We have heard the punishment, but not the exhortation. It is, therefore, written (Devarim 18:4) \"and a stranger shall not draw near to you.\""

            " (Bamidbar 18:8) \"And the L-rd spoke to Aaron\": I would think (the intent is) that the speaking was to Aaron; it is, therefore, written (Ibid. 17:5) \"A sign for the children of Israel … as the L-rd spoke to Moses about him\" (Aaron, viz., that only he and his sons are to be Cohanim), whereby we are apprised that the speaking was to Moses, to tell to Aaron. (Bamidbar, Ibid.) \"And I, behold, (I have given to you\") with joy, (the twenty-four priestly gifts.) These are the words of R. Yishmael — whereupon his disciples said to him: But master, it is written (Bereshit 6:17) \"And I, behold, shall bring a flood of water, etc.\" Are we, then to assume that this was a joy to Him? He answered: When His angerers go lost from the world, it is a joy to Him. And thus is it written (Proverbs 11:10) \"When the righteous prosper, the city exults, and when the wicked perish there is rejoicing.\" And (Psalms 3:9-10) \"You have broken the teeth of the wicked. Deliverance is the L-rd's. Upon Your people are Your blessings, selah.\" And (Ibid. 10:16) \"The L-rd is King for ever and ever. Nations have gone lost from His land.\" And (Ibid. 104:35) \"Sinners will end from the earth, and the wicked will be no more. Bless the L-rd, O my soul, Hallelukah!\" R. Nathan said to him: I will add to your words: \"And I\" — willingly; \"behold\" — with joy.

            " (Bamidbar, Ibid.) \"For all the hallowed things of the children of Israel, etc.\": Scripture forged a covenant with Aaron with the holy of holies (viz. Ibid. 19) to declare a law to make a covenant with them. And why was this necessary? For Korach arose against Aaron and contested the priesthood. An analogy: A king of flesh and blood had a retainer to whom he gave a field of holding as a gift, without writing or sealing (the transaction) and without recording it, whereupon someone came and contested his (the retainer's) ownership of the field. At this, the king said to him: Let anyone who wishes come and contest it. Come (now) and I will write, seal, and record it. Korach came and contested his (Aaron's) claim to the priesthood, at which the L-rd said to him: Let anyone who wishes come and contest it. I am (now) writing and sealing and recording it — wherefore this section is juxtaposed with (the episode of) Korach. (Bamidbar, Ibid.) \"to you have I given them (the gifts)\": in your merit \"lemashchah\": \"meshichah\" connotes greatness, as in (Vayikra 7:35) \"This is mishchath Aaron and mishchath his sons, etc.\" R. Yitzchak says \"mishchah\" (here) connotes anointment, as in (Psalms 133:2) \"the goodly oil upon the head, running down the beard, the beard of Aaron.\" (Bamidbar, Ibid.) \"and to your sons\": in the merit of your sons. \"as an everlasting statute\": the covenant obtaining for all of the succeeding generations. (Ibid. 9) \"This shall be for you from the holy of holies from the fire\": I would not know of what this speaks. Go out and see: What remains (for the Cohanim) of the holy of holies, all of which is consigned to the fire? You find this as obtaining only with a beast burnt-offering, (the hide of which reverts to the Cohanim.) \"all of their offerings\": the two loaves and the show-bread. \"all of their meal-offerings\": the sinner's meal-offering and the donative meal-offering. \"all of their sin-offerings\": the sin-offering of the individual and the communal sin-offering (viz. Vayikra 6:18), the bird sin-offering and the beast sin-offering. \"all of their guilt-offerings\": the \"certain\" guilt-offering, the \"suspended\" guilt-offering, the guilt-offering of the Nazirite and the guilt-offering of the leper. \"which they shall return to Me\": This refers to the theft of a proselyte, (which reverts to the Cohanim [viz. Ibid. 5:8]). \"holy of holies\": This refers to the leper's log of oil. \"to you and to your sons\": in your merit and in the merit of your sons. (Ibid. 10) \"In the holy of holies shall you eat it\": Scripture forged a covenant with Aaron with the holy of holies that they are to be eaten only in a holy place, within the curtains (i.e., in the azarah [the Temple court]). R. Yehudah said: Whence is it derived that if gentiles surrounded the azarah, they may be eaten (even) in the sanctuary? From \"In the holy of holies shall you eat it.\" (Ibid.) \"Every male shall eat it\": Scripture forged a covenant with Aaron with the holy of holies that they are to be eaten by males of the priesthood. \"Holy shall it be to you\": What is the intent of this? I might think that only something fit for eating should be eaten in holiness. Whence do I derive (the same for) something which is not fit for eating? From \"Holy shall it be to you.\" (Ibid. 11) \"And this is for you the terumah of (i.e., what is set apart from) their gift-offerings\": Scripture hereby apprises us that just as Scripture included holy of holies to decree a law to make a covenant with them, so, did it include lower-order offerings. \"From all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel\": This thing requires waving. \"To you have I given them, and to your sons and to your daughters with you, as an everlasting statute\": the covenant obtaining for all of the succeeding generations. \"Every clean one in your house shall eat it\": Scripture forged a covenant with lower-order offerings that they are to be eaten only by those who are clean. \"All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine and of the wheat\": Scripture hereby apprises us that just as Scripture included the offerings of the sanctuary to decree a law to make a covenant with them, so, did it include the border offerings (i.e., those outside the sanctuary) to decree a law to make a covenant with them. \"All the best of the oil\": This is terumah gedolah (Devarim 18:4). \"and all the best, etc.\": This is terumath ma'aser (Bamidbar 18:26). \"the first of them\": the first of the shearing (Devarim 18:4). \"which they shall give\": shoulder, cheeks and maw (Ibid. 3). \"to the L-rd\": challah (Bamidbar 15:20). (Ibid. 18:13) \"the first-fruits of all that is in their land\": Scripture here comes to teach us about the bikkurim that holiness \"takes\" upon them while they are yet attached to the ground. For it would follow (otherwise, viz.:) Since holiness \"takes\" on bikkurim and holiness \"takes\" on terumah, then, if I have learned about terumah that holiness does not \"take\" on it while it is yet on the ground, so, with bikkurim. It is, therefore, written \"the first-fruits of all that is in their land,\" to teach us otherwise. (Bamidbar 18:12) \"To you have I given them\": Scripture comes to teach that it is given to the Cohein. (Bamidbar, Ibid. 13) \"Every clean one of your household shall eat it\": Why is this stated? Is it not already written (Ibid. 11) \"Every clean one in your house shall eat it (terumah)\"? Why repeat it? To include the daughter of an Israelite betrothed to a Cohein as eating terumah. Does this include one who is betrothed? Perhaps it speaks only of one who is married! — (This is not so, for) \"Every clean one in your house shall eat it\" already speaks of one who is married. How, then, am I to understand \"Every clean one of your household\"? As including the daughter of an Israelite betrothed to a Cohein, as eating terumah. This would seem to include (as eating terumah) a betrothed one and a toshav (a ger toshav [sojourner]) and a sachir (a hired non-Jew). How, then, am I to understand (Shemot 12:45) \"a toshav … shall not eat of it\"? A toshav who is not in your domain; but one who is in your domain may eat of it. Or even a toshav who is in your domain (may eat of it). And how am I to understand \"Every clean one of your household may eat of it\"? As excluding a toshav and a sachir. Or perhaps, including a toshav and a sachir! It is, therefore, written (Vayikra 22:10) \"and a sachir shall not eat the holy thing\" (terumah): whether or not he is in your domain. And it happened that R. Yochanan b. Bag Bag sent to R. Yehudah in Netzivim: I heard about you that you said that the daughter of an Israelite betrothed to a Cohein eats terumah. He sent back: And I held you to be expert in the recesses of Torah when you cannot even expound a kal vachomer (a fortiori, viz.:) If a Canaanite maidservant, whose intercourse (with her master) does not acquire her (or him) for (purposes of) eating terumah, her money (i.e., the money by which he acquired her [viz. Vayikra 22:11]) causes her to eat terumah — then the daughter of an Israelite, whose intercourse (with her husband) acquires her (to him) for (purposes of) eating terumah, how much more so should her money (by which he betroths her) acquire her for (purposes of) eating terumah! But what can I do? The sages said: The daughter of an Israelite betrothed (to a Cohein) does not eat terumah until she enters the chuppah (the marriage canopy). Once she enters the chuppah, even if there were no intercourse, she eats terumah, and if she dies, her husband inherits her.",
            " (Bamidbar 18:14) \"Every devoted thing (i.e., a thing dedicated to the Temple) in Israel shall be yours (the Cohein's)\": This tells me only of the devoted objects of Israelites. Whence do I derive (the same for) the devoted objects of gentiles, women, and bondsmen? From \"Every devoted thing in Israel.\" R. Yossi Haglili says: Unqualified \"devotions\" revert to the Cohanim, it being written (Vayikra 27:21) \"As a devoted field, to the Cohein shall be his holding.\" Even if he specified \"for Temple maintenance\"? It is, therefore, (to negate this) written (Ibid. 28) \"Every devoted thing (specified as) holy of holies reverts to the L-rd.\" R. Yehudah b. Betheirah says: All unqualified \"devotions\" revert to Temple maintenance, it being written \"Every (unqualified) \"devotion\" is holy of holies to the L-rd.\" Even if he specified \"to the Cohanim\"?

Shimon says: All unqualified \"devotions\" revert to Heaven, it being written \"holy of holies to the L-rd.\" — Even if he specified \"to the Cohein\"?

            " (Bamidbar 18:15) \"All that opens the womb of all flesh\": I would think an animal, too, is included (in redemption of the first-born); it is, therefore, written \"which they offer to the L-rd\" (as a sacrifice) — to exclude an animal (as opposed to a beast, which is not offered). This (\"which they offer\") implies that both an animal and a blemished (beast) are excluded (from redemption); it is, therefore, written (\"in man) and in beast\" — to include a blemished (beast) in redemption, (as a blemished man is included). \"in man and in beast\"; What obtains with the man (i.e., redemption) obtains with his beast\" — to exclude Levites: Redemption not obtaining with them, it does not obtain with their (unclean) beast (i.e., an ass). And the first-born of a man is likened to the first-born of a beast, and the first-born of a best to the first-born of a man. Just as with the first-born of a beast, a miscarriage is exempt from the mitzvah of the first-born, so, with the first-born of a man. Just as the (redemption money) for a man is given to a Cohein in whichever place he (the man) wishes, so, he may give the first-born of a beast to a Cohein in whichever place he wishes. For I would think that since it is written (Devarim 12:6) \"And you shall bring there (to the Temple) your burnt-offerings and your sacrifices,\" then even if he were distant from it, he must exert himself and bring it (the first-born beast) to the Temple; it is, therefore, written \"in man and in beast.\" Just as the redemption money for a man may be given to a Cohein in whichever place he wishes, so, he may give the first-born of a beast to a Cohein in whichever place he wishes. And just as the first-born of a man must be cared for for thirty days (before redemption [viz. Bamidbar 18:16]), so, the first-born of a beast. (Ibid. 15) \"but redeem shall you redeem\": This is what was asked in Kerem Beyavneh before the sages: If a first-born (beast) dies, is it to be redeemed and fed to the dogs? R. Tarfon expounded, \"but redeem shall you redeem, etc.\" You redeem the unclean (beast, i.e., an ass), and you do not redeem the clean, neither alive nor dead. \"and the first-born of the unclean beast shall you redeem\": I would think that this applied to all the unclean beasts; it is, therefore, written (Shemot 13:13) \"And every first-born of an ass you shall redeem with a sheep\" — You redeem an ass, but you do not redeem the first-born of any other unclean beast. I might think that the first-born of an ass is redeemed with a sheep, and the first-born of all other unclean beasts, with clothing and vessels; it is, therefore, written again (Shemot 34:20) \"And the first-born of an ass you shall redeem with a sheep.\" The first-born of an ass you redeem with a sheep, but the first-born of all other unclean beasts you do not redeem at all. If so, what is the intent of (Bamidbar 18:15) \"the first-born of the unclean beast you shall redeem\"? If it does not apply to the first-born, understand it as applying to dedication to Temple maintenance, an unclean beast being dedicated to Temple maintenance, whence it is then redeemed (viz. Vayikra 27:27). (Bamidbar 18:15) (\"And the first-born of the unclean beast) shall you redeem\": immediately. You say, immediately, but perhaps the intent is after some time (i.e., after thirty days). It is, therefore, (to negate this) written (Ibid. 16) \"And his redemption (that of a human first-born), from one month shall you redeem.\" The first-born of a man is redeemed with five shekalim and is redeemed after (one month's) time; but the first-born of an ass is redeemed immediately or at any time (thereafter). \"And his redemption, from one month shall you redeem\": \"money, five shekalim\" tells me only of money. Whence do I derive (the same for something that has) the value of money? From \"And his redemption, etc.\" I might think, (his redemption) with anything. It is, therefore, written \"And his redemption\" — general; \"money, five shekalim\" — particular. \"general-particular.\" (The rule is) there is in the general only what is in the particular (i.e., \"money,\" literally). \"you shall redeem\" — again general. — But perhaps it (the particular) reverts to the first \"general\" (viz. Shemot 13:13) \"And every first-born of man among your sons you shall redeem,\" (so that we have an instance of general particular.) Would you say that? (i.e., This is unlikely because the particular is too far removed from that \"general.\") We have, then, an instance of general-particular-general (as stated above). And (the rule is:) We follow the nature of the particular, viz.: Just as the particular is movable property, worth money, so, the general is of that nature — whence they ruled: The first-born of a man may be redeemed with all things, except with bondsmen, writs, and land. Rebbi says: The first-born of a man may be redeemed with all things, except with writs. (Bamidbar, Ibid.) \"It is twenty gerah\": What is the intent of this? (i.e., it is already written [Vayikra 27:25] \"Twenty gerah shall the shekel be.\") Whence is it derived that if he wishes to increase (the amount) he may do so? From \"it shall be.\" I might think that if he wishes to decrease, he may do so. It is, therefore, written \"shall be.\" (Bamidbar, Ibid.) \"But the first-born of an ox\": It must look like an ox. \"a sheep\": It must look like a sheep. \"a goat\": It must look like a goat — to exclude a hybrid or a nidmeh (superficially similar). \"you shall not redeem\": I might think that if he redeemed it, it remains redeemed; it is, therefore, written \"They are consecrated.\" R. Yoshiyah says: Why is this (\"they are consecrated\") written? (i.e., it is already written [Shemot 13:2] \"Consecrate unto Me every first-born\") To include a (beast-) tithe and the Paschal lamb as requiring one spilling (of blood on the altar), something which was not spelled out in all of the Torah. R. Yitzchak says: This (derivation) is not needed. For it is already written (Devarim 12:27) \"and the blood of your sacrifices shall be spilled out\" — to include the tithe and the Pesach as requiring one spilling. What, then, is the intent of \"They are consecrated\"? To include the tithe and the Pesach as requiring smoking of the fats, something which was not spelled out in all of the Torah. Abba Channan says in the name of R. Eliezer: This (derivation) is not needed. For it follows a fortiori, viz.: If other offerings, which are not similar in their applications of blood, are similar in their smoking of fats, then the tithe and the Pesach, which are similar (in a first-born) in their application of blood, how much more so should they be similar in their smoking of fats! What, then, is the intent of \"They are consecrated\"? What we have mentioned heretofore (i.e., to include tithe and Pesach as requiring one spilling of blood). \"Their blood shall you sprinkle upon the altar\": one application. You say one application, but perhaps (the intent is) two applications that are four (i.e., one on the north-east corner and one on the south-west corner.) — Would you say that? If in a place (i.e., with other offerings), where fats are increased (viz. Vayikra 3:2), blood is decreased (i.e., only two applications that are four), then here (with first-born, tithe and Pesach), where fats are decreased, how much more so should blood be decreased (to only one application)! Or, conversely, if in a place (first-born, tithe, and Pesach), where fats are decreased, blood is increased (to two applications that are four), then in a place (i.e., with other offerings), where fats are increased, how much more so should blood be increased (to more than two applications that are four)! It is, therefore, written (of the other offerings) (Vayikra 1:11) \"And the Cohanim\" shall sprinkle … roundabout\" — two applications that are four. I have reasoned a fortiori and adduced the converse. The converse has been rejected and I return to the original a fortiori argument, viz.: If in a place where fats are increased, blood is decreased, then here, where fats are decreased, how much more so should blood be decreased (to only one application)! What, then, is the intent of \"Their blood shall you sprinkle\"? One application. (Bamidbar, Ibid.) \"and their fats shall you smoke\": Does Scripture speak of an (even) layer of fat (covered with) a membrane and (easily) peeled, or also with the fats of the rib cage? — Would you say that? If in a place (i.e., with other offerings), where blood is increased, fats are decreased, (the rib-cage fats, not being smoked) — then here, (vis-à-vis the first-born, where blood is decreased, how much more so should fats be decreased! How, then, am I to understand \"and their fats shall you smoke\"? As referring to an (even) layer of fat (covered with) a membrane and (easily) peeled. \"a fire-offering\": Even though you consign it to the wood pile, it is not acceptable until it is consumed by the fire. \"a sweet savor to the L-rd\": It is My pleasure that I have spoken and My will has been done. (Ibid. 18) \"And their flesh shall be for you as the wave-breast\": Scripture came and likened first-born to breast and shoulder of peace-offerings. Just as breast and shoulder of peace-offerings are eaten for two days and one night, so, first-born is eaten for two days and one night. This question was asked before the sages in Kerem Beyavneh: For how long is first-born eaten? R. Tarfon answered and said: For two days and one night. There was a certain disciple there, who had come to serve in the house of study first, R. Yossi Haglili by name. He asked him: My master, how do you know this? R. Tarfon: First-born is kodshim (consecrated) and peace-offerings are kodshim. Just as peace-offerings are eaten for two days and one night, so, first-born. R. Yossi: My master, a sin-offering is a gift to the Cohein, and a first-born is a gift to the Cohein. Just as a sin-offering is eaten for one day and one night, so, a first-born. R. Tarfon: My son, I will learn a thing from a thing, and I will derive a thing from a thing. I will learn a thing that is a lower-order offering (first-born) from a thing which is a lower-order offering (peace-offerings), and I will not learn a thing which is a lower-order offering from a thing which is holy of holies (a sin-offering). R. Yossi: My master, I will learn a thing from a thing and I will derive a thing from a thing. I will learn a thing which is a gift to the Cohein (first-born) from a thing which is a gift to the Cohein (sin-offering), and I will not learn a thing which is a gift to the Cohein from a thing which is not a gift to the Cohein (peace-offerings). R. Tarfon kept quiet and R. Akiva jumped up and said to him: My son, this is how I expound it; \"and its flesh shall be for you as the wave-breast.\" Scripture came and likened first-born to breast and shoulder of peace-offerings. Just as breast and shoulder of peace-offerings are eaten for two days and one night, so first-born. R. Yossi: You liken it to breast and shoulder of peace-offerings, and I liken it to breast and shoulder of thank-offerings. Just as these are eaten for one day and one night, (viz. Vayikra 7:16) so, first-born. R. Akiva: My son, this is how I expound it: \"And their flesh shall be for you as wave-breast.\" There is no need to add (Ibid.) \"for you shall it be.\" It (\"for you shall it be') is adding another \"being\" (of one day), that it (first-born) be eaten for two days and one night (— like peace-offerings, and not like thank-offerings). R. Yishmael said: Now where is thank-offering derived from (i.e., that breast and shoulder be given to the Cohanim)? Is it not from (its being likened to) peace-offerings? And something (i.e., first-born), which is derived from something else (i.e., peace-offerings), you (R. Yossi) would come and liken it (first-born) to something else (i.e., thank-offerings, that it [first-born] be eaten for one day and one night as thank-offerings are)? Would you learn something (i.e., that first-born be eaten for one day and one night) from something (thank-offering), which is itself learned from something else (i.e., peace-offerings)? (In sum,) you are not to learn as per the latter version (that of R. Yossi), but as per the former version, viz.: \"And their flesh (that of first-born) shall be for you, etc.\" Scripture hereby comes to liken first-born to breast and shoulder of peace-offerings — Just as breast and shoulder of peace-offerings are eaten for two days and one night, so, first-born is eaten for two days and one night. What, then, is the intent of (the redundant) \"for you shall it be\"? To include a blemished first-born as reverting to the Cohein, something which was not spelled out in the all of the Torah. R. Elazar says: (A first-born may be eaten) for two days and one night. You say for two days and one night, but perhaps it is for a day and a night? It is, therefore, written (Devarim 15:20) \"Before the L-rd your G-d shall you eat it (the first-born), year in year,\" which implies that it may be eaten for two days and one night (i.e., the last day of the preceding year and the first day of the next year and the intervening night). (Bamidbar, Ibid. 19) \"All the terumah of the holy things, which the children of Israel will separate\": There are sections which generalize in the beginning and specify at the end; (others) which specify in the beginning and generalize at the end; and this one generalizes in the beginning (18:8) and generalizes at the end, (here, 18:19), and specifies in the middle. \"have I given to you and to your sons and to your daughters with you as an everlasting statute\": that it continue for all the succeeding generations. \"It is a covenant of salt forever before the L-rd\": Scripture forged a covenant with Aaron with something (salt), which preserves, and which, furthermore, preserves other things."

Because it is written (Bamidbar 26:53) \"To these shall the land be apportioned,\" I would think that all are included — Cohanim, Levites, Israelites, proselytes, women, bondsmen, tumtum (those of uncertain sex) and androgynous (hermaphrodites); it is, therefore, written: \"And the L-rd said to Aaron: In their land you will not inherit\" — This excludes (from inheritance) Cohanim.\" (Ibid. 23) \"And in the midst of the children of Israel, they (the Levites) shall not inherit an inheritance\" — This excludes Levites. (Ibid. 26:55) \"By the names of the tribes of their fathers shall they inherit\" — This excludes bondsmen and proselytes (Ibid. 54) \"A man, according to his numbers shall his inheritance be given\" — This excludes tumtum and androgynous. (Ibid. 18:20) \"And the L-rd said to Aaron: In their land you will not inherit\" — in the division of the land. \"and you will not have a portion in their midst\" — (\"a portion\") of the spoils. \"I am your portion and your inheritance\" — At My table (i.e., from the sacrifices) you eat and at My table you drink. An analogy: A king gave gifts to (all of) his sons except one, saying to him: My son, I gave you a gift. At My table you eat and at My table you drink. And thus is it written (Vayikra 6:10) \"Their portion have I given to them from My fire-offerings.\" (Devarim 18:1) \"The fire-offering of the L-rd and His inheritance shall they eat.\" Twenty-four priestly gifts were given to the Cohanim, twelve in the sanctuary and twelve in the borders (i.e., outside of Jerusalem.) Twelve in the sanctuary: sin-offering, guilt-offering, the remnant of the log of oil of the leper, the remnant of the omer, the two loaves, the show-bread, the remnant of meal-offerings, the terumah of the thank-offering (viz. Vayikra 7:14), the terumah of breast and thigh, the shoulder of the ram of the Nazirite.",
            " Twelve in the borders: Terumah, terumath ma'aser, challah, bikkurim, the first of the shearing, the gifts (shoulder, cheeks, and maw), the first-born of man and the first-born of a clean beast, the firstling of an ass, charamim (renunciation of one's property), an (unredeemed) field of holding, and the theft of (i.e., what is stolen from) a proselyte (viz. Bamidbar 5:8). All these twenty-four gifts were given to the Cohanim, aside from terumah-related debts. The day when a covenant was forged with Aaron with the twenty-four gifts was a day of great joy to him. R. Yishmael says: As per the folk-proverb \"My cow's leg was broken for my good.\" For Aaron's good did Korach come and contest the priesthood. An analogy: A king had a retainer to whom he gave a field as a gift, without recording, sealing and registering (the transaction [see above]) — wherefore, this section is juxtaposed with that of Korach. R. Elazar Hakappar says: Whence is it derived that the Holy One Blessed be He showed our father Yaakov the Temple built and sacrifices being offered, and Cohanim officiating, and the Shechinah reposing (there)? From (Bereshit 28:12) \"And he (Yaakov) dreamed, and, behold, a ladder standing on the earth, and its top reaching to heaven, and, behold, angels of G-d ascending and descending upon it.\" There is no dream without a portent: \"And he dreamed, and, behold, a ladder standing on the earth\" — the Temple. \"and its top reaching to heaven\" — the offered sacrifices, their scent reaching to heaven. \"and, behold, angels of G-d,\" — the Cohanim ministering, ascending and descending on the ramp. (13) \"And, behold, the L-rd standing on it\" — (Amos 9:1) \"I (Amos) saw the L-rd standing on the altar.\" Beloved are Israel, who, when epitomized, are epitomized as \"Cohanim,\" viz. (Isaiah 61:6) \"And you, Cohanim of the L-rd shall be called; 'ministers of G-d' shall they say of you. The wealth of nations shall you eat, and in their glory shall you vaunt yourselves.\" Beloved are Cohanim, who are epitomized as ministering angels, viz. (Malachi 2:7) \"For the lips of the Cohein shall guard knowledge, and Torah shall they seek from his mouth, for an angel of the L-rd of hosts is he.\" If Torah goes forth from his mouth, he is like the ministering angels. If not, he is like an animal or a beast, which does not recognize its Creator. Beloved is Torah. When David king of Israel asked (a boon of the L-rd), he asked only for Torah, viz. (Psalms 118:68) \"You are good and do good — teach me Your statutes.\" Your goodness engulfs all who enter the world. Let Your goodness engulf me and teach me Your statutes. And it is written (Psalms, Ibid. 117) \"Support me and I will be saved (and I will dwell in Your statutes always\"): That I not learn Torah and forget it, that I not learn and the evil inclination not allow me to review it, that I not rule unclean what is clean or clean what is unclean and come to share in the world to come, that the nations of the land and the families of the earth ask me and I not know how to respond and be shamed before them. And thus is it written (Ibid. 46) \"And I will speak of Your testimonies before kings and I will not be ashamed.\" And (Ibid. 54) \"Songs have Your statutes been to me.\" I might think, in repose. It, therefore, follows \"in the house of my fears, in caves and in entrapments, as in (Ibid. 56:1) \"… when he fled from Saul in the cave.\" And (Ibid. 109:119) \"My soul was always in my hand, and I did not forget Your Torah.\"",
            " But when David learned Torah and grew great (in it), what did he say? (Psalms 139:17) \"And to me, how precious are Your loved ones (i.e., Torah scholars), O G-d! How mighty is their sum!\" And (Ibid. 119:72) \"Better to me is the Torah of Your mouth than thousands of gold and silver.\" For gold and silver take a man out of this world and the next, but Torah brings a man to life in the world to come.",
            " (II Samuel 7:19) \"This is the Torah of man\": We find that there are three crowns: the crown of Torah, the crown of priesthood and the crown of kingdom. The crown of priesthood was merited by Aaron and he took it. The crown of kingdom was merited by David and he took it. The crown of Torah is left (vacant), so that those who enter the world be given no pretext to say: If the crown of kingdom and the crown of priesthood were left (vacant), I would merit them and take them. The crown of Torah is left (vacant) for all who enter the world. For whoever merits it, I account it to him as if all three were left (vacant) to him and he merits all of them. And whoever does not merit it, I account it to him as if all three were left (vacant) for him and he did not merit any one of them. And if you would ask: Which is the greatest of all? R. Shimon b. Elazar was wont to say: Who is greater, the crowner or the king? Certainly, the crowner. The maker of officers or the officers? Certainly, the maker of officers. All that inheres in these two crowns, comes through the power of Torah. And thus is it written (Proverbs 8:15-16) \"Through me (Torah) do kings reign … Through me do princes rule.\" And, (in reversion to \"This is the Torah of man\"), (Koheleth 12:13) \"The end of the matter, all has been heard. Fear G-d and do His mitzvoth. For this (Torah) is all of man.\"",
            " Greater is the covenant forged with Aaron than that forged with David. Aaron merited (priesthood) for his sons — whether righteous or wicked, and David merited (kingdom only) for the righteous, but not for the wicked, viz. (Psalms 132:12) \"If your children will keep My covenant … (they will sit on the throne for you.\") (Bamidbar 18:19) \"It is a covenant of salt … (21) and to the sons of Levi.\" Scripture hereby apprises us that just as the covenant is forged with the priesthood, so, is it forged with the Levites. And just as the mitzvah of the priesthood was stated at Mount Sinai, so, that of the Levites. And just as the mitzvah of the priesthood was stated with joy, so, that of the Levites, as it is written \"and to the sons of Levi, behold, I have given, etc.\" \"Behold\" connotes joy, as in (Shemot 5:14) \"And, behold, he goes out to meet you, and when he sees you, he will rejoice in his heart.\" (Bamidbar, Ibid.) \"in exchange for their service\": All the mitzvoth of the priesthood (i.e., the twenty-four priestly gifts) were acquired by the L-rd and given to the Cohanim; and these (the mitzvoth of the Levites), \"in exchange for their services of the tent of meeting.\" These are the words of R. Yoshiyah. R. Yonathan says: This, too, was acquired by the land and given to the Levites, as it is written (Vayikra 27:30) \"And all the tithe of the land … is the L-rd's; it is holy to the L-rd.\" \"And to the sons of Levi I have given all the tithe of Israel as an inheritance\": Just as an inheritance does not change from its place, so, first tithe, (which is given to the Levite), does not change from its place, (unlike second tithe, which in the third and sixth years converts to poor-tithe.) \"in exchange for the service which they perform\": If he serves, he takes (the tithe); if not, he does not. (Ibid. 22) \"And the children of Israel shall no more draw near\": the exhortation. \"to bear sin, to die\": the punishment (at the hands of Heaven.). (Ibid. 23) \"And the Levite shall serve — he\": Why is this written? From \"in exchange for their service\" I might understand, if he wishes, he serves, and if he does not wish, he does not serve; it is, therefore, written \"And the Levite shall serve — he\" — perforce. Variantly: Why is this written? From \"And to the sons of Levi, behold, I have given every tithe in Israel (in exchange for their service, etc.\") This tells me only (that they must serve) only in the years that the tithes obtain. Whence do I derive (that they must also serve) on shemitoth and yovloth, (when the tithes do not obtain)? From \"And the Levite shall serve — he\" (in any event). R. Nathan says: If no Levite were there, I might think that a Cohein may serve. And this would follow a fortiori, viz.: If in a place (i.e., the priestly service), where Levites are not kasher, Cohanim are kasher, then, in a place (i.e., the Levitical service), where Levites are kasher, how much more so should Cohanim be kasher! It is, therefore, written \"And the Levite shall serve — he.\" \"and they (the Levites) will bear their sin (of not guarding property)\": And others (the Israelites, who, [being unguarded, enter the sanctuary]) will not bear their (the Levites') sin. This is to say that Israelites do not bear the sin of the Levites, but the Cohanim, (who enter where they should not), do bear their (the Levites') sin. It is, therefore, written \"and they (the Levites) will bear their sin (of improper guarding),\" and not the Israelites or the Cohanim (who, as a result, enter where they should not.) \"a statute forever for your generations\": It obtains for all succeeding generations. And in the midst of the children of Israel, they shall not inherit an inheritance\": Why is this written? For, since it is written (Ibid. 26:53) \"To these shall the land be apportioned,\" I would think that the Levites, too, are included; it is, therefore, written \"And in the midst of the children of Israel, they shall not inherit an inheritance.\" (Ibid. 24) \"For the tithe of the children of Israel which they set apart for the L-rd as terumah\": Scripture refers to it as terumah until he separates terumath ma'aser from it, whereby it teaches that if he wishes to make it terumah for other (untithed) produce, he may do so. \"have I given to the Levites as an inheritance\": Why is this written? Because it is written \"And to the sons of Levi, behold, I have given every tithe in Israel in exchange for the service, etc.\", I would think (that first-tithe is given to the Levites) only when the Temple, (in which service is performed), exists. Whence do I derive (that it is given) even when the Temple does not exist? From \"as an inheritance.\" Just as \"inheritance\" obtains whether or not the Temple exists, so, first-tithe. \"Therefore, I have said to them that in the midst of the children of Israel they shall not inherit an inheritance\": Why is this written? Is it not already written (23) \"And in the midst of the children of Israel they shall not inherit an inheritance\"? I might think that this applies only at the time of the apportionment of the land; but after the apportionment each tribe sets aside from its portion (a parcel of land for Levi). It is, therefore, written \"Therefore, I have said, etc.\" Variantly: \"Therefore, I have said\": Why is this written? Because it is written (Devarim 7:1) \"And He will cast out many nations from before you, the Chitti, the Girgashi, etc.\", but Keini, Kenizi, and Kadmoni are not mentioned, (so that we might think that when they are conquered, Levi can have inheritance in their land); it is, therefore, written \"Therefore, I have said, etc.\" — forever (are they not to have inheritance). Variantly: (It is written) to exhort beth-din to this end (of their not receiving inheritance)."

To teach that (Ibid. 21) \"And to the sons of Levi, behold, I have given every tithe\" speaks of (one-tenth of) the produce (of the land, and not of [one-tenth of] the land itself.) You say, the produce, but perhaps (the reference is to) the land (itself)!

            " (Bamidbar 18:27) \"And your terumah will be accounted for you as corn from the threshing floor and as the fullness of the pit\": R. Yishmael says: When is your terumah accounted for you as corn from the threshing floor? When you have taken it as prescribed (i.e., a kind for its kind, new for new, etc. [see above]). If you have not taken it as prescribed, it is not thus accounted for you. Variantly: \"And your (the Levites') terumah (terumath ma'aser) will be accounted for you as corn from the threshing floor\" (terumah gedolah). Now what do we learn from terumah (gedolah) to terumath ma'aser? It (terumah gedolah) comes (apparently) to teach (something), and it ends up being learned (i.e.,) Just as terumath ma'aser is obligatory, so, terumah (gedolah) is obligatory. Abba Eliezer b. Gomel says: Scripture comes to teach you that just as terumah (gedolah) may be taken by estimate and by thought (i.e., without actually handling it), so, terumath ma'aser may be taken by estimate and by thought. \"as corn from the threshing floor and as the fullness of the pit\": Why is this stated? From (26) \"then you shall separate from it,\" I might think that he could take ears (of grain as terumah) for grain; grapes, for wine; and olives, for oil; it is, therefore, written \"as corn from the threshing floor,\" i.e., (he may take) from what is processed — whence they ruled; (He may take terumah:) from grain, from the time that it (i.e., its pile) has been evened; from wine, from the time that it is skimmed; from oil, from the time that it has dripped down into the trough. (Ibid. 28) \"Thus shall you, too, separate the terumah of the L-rd\": Why is this written? From (26) \"And to the Levites shall you speak, and you shall say to them: When you take from the children of Israel, etc.\", (I would say:) The children of Israel give ma'aser to the Levites, but the Cohanim do not give ma'aser to the Levites. And since they do not give ma'aser to the Levites, I might think that they could eat it (the produce) tevel (i.e., untithed); it is, therefore, written: \"thus shall you separate, you (the Cohanim), too, the terumah of the L-rd.\" (i.e., the Cohanim separate terumah, and ma'aser, and terumath ma'aser which reverts to them.) R. Yishmael says: This (derivation) is not needed, for if challah, which does not obtain with all produce (i.e., with all the varieties of grain), obtains with the produce of Cohanim, then ma'aser, which does obtain with all produce, how much more so should it obtain with all the produce of Cohanim! What, then, is the intent of \"Thus shall you separate, you, too\"? I might think that only the ma'aser of an Israelite (is subject to terumath ma'aser). Whence do I derive the (same for) their (the Levites') own tithe (i.e., the tithe that they separate from what is theirs)? It is, therefore, written \"Thus shall you separate, you, (the Levites,) too.\" (Ibid. 29) \"From all of your gifts, etc.\" Scripture hereby teaches that ma'aser obtains with all (produce [see above]) — whence you rule to terumah (i.e., terumath ma'aser), viz.: If ma'aser, the \"lighter,\" (not being subject to the death penalty), obtains with all produce), then terumah, the \"graver,\" (being subject to the death penalty, [viz. Vayikra 22:9]), how much more so does it obtain with all (produce [of first tithe])! Variantly: If ma'aser (second tithe), which does not obtain in the third and sixth year (of shemitah, [being replaced by poor-tithe]), obtains with all (produce), then terumah, the graver, how much more so should it obtain with all (produce [of second tithe])! Issi b. Menachem says: If ma'aser (second tithe), which comes only as an incentive to fear and to learning (viz. Devarim 14:23), obtains with all (produce), how much more so does it obtain with the \"graver,\" terumah! (Bamidbar, Ibid.) \"And you shall give of it the terumah of the L-rd to Aaron the Cohein\": Just as Aaron was a chaver (a Torah scholar, so the (other) Cohanim (to receive the priestly gifts, should be chaverim) — whence it was ruled: Priestly gifts should be given only to a chaver. (Ibid. 29) \"From all of your gifts shall you separate all the terumah of the L-rd. From all of its best (shall you separate) its hallowed part from it.\" Is Scripture here speaking of terumah gedolah or of terumath ma'aser? \"from all of your tithes\" (28) speaks of terumath ma'aser. How, then, is \"From all of your gifts shall you separate all the terumah of the L-rd\" to be understood? As referring to terumath gedolah. (Devarim 18:4) \"The first of your corn, your wine, and your oil … shall you give to him\": This is obligatory. You say it is obligatory, but perhaps it is optional! It is, therefore, written (Bamidbar 11:29) \"shall you separate all the terumah of the L-rd\" — It is obligatory and not optional. These are the words of R. Yonathan. \"from all of its best, its hallowed part from it.\": So that if it (terumath ma'aser) fell (back) into it (what it was taken from), it \"hallows\" it — whence they ruled: Terumah is \"neutralized\" (from its hallowed state) if it fell into one hundred parts of non-terumah when (it is) one to (that) one hundred. This tells me only of terumah that is (ritually) clean. Whence do I derive (the same for) terumah that is tamei, (that if it fell into a hundred of clean terumah, it is neutralized in such a mixture?)

(i.e., it is already written [Ibid. 27]) Because it is written (27) \"And your terumah will be accounted for you, etc.\", I might think that since Scripture refers to it (first tithe) as \"terumah,\" (viz. Ibid. 24), it retains its holiness forever; it is, therefore, written \"then it shall be reckoned to the Levites as produce of the threshing floor and as produce of the wine press\" — Just as with the produce of the threshing floor, one separates terumah, and what remains is chullin (non-terumah), so, with first tithe, he separates terumah (i.e., terumath ma'aser) and what remains is chullin. (Ibid. 31) \"And you may eat it in every place\": even in a cemetery.

It follows otherwise, viz.: If she (a Cohein's wife) eats the \"graver\" — terumah, how much more so should (a Levite's wife) eat the \"lighter\" — ma'aser! It must mean, then, that an Israelite woman (married to a Levite) is permitted to be deputed to take terumah. (Ibid. 31) \"For it is payment to you, in exchange for your service in the tent of meeting.\": If he serves, he takes; if he does not serve, he does not take — whence it was ruled: If a Levite took upon himself every Levitical service except one, he has no portion in the Leviate.

(The rule is:) There exists in the general only what is found in the particular. R. Eliezer says: It is written here \"statute\" and (relative to the Yom Kippur service, Vayikra 16:34) \"statute.\" Just as there, (the Cohein ministers) in the white vestments; here, too, in the white vestments. R. Yochanan b. Zakkai was asked by his disciples: In which vestments was the red heifer processed? He: In the golden vestments. They: But did our master not teach us (that it was processed) in the white vestments? He: If I have forgotten what my eyes have seen and what my hands have ministered, how much more so, what I have taught! And why all this? To strengthen the disciples (in application to their learning). Others say: It was Hillel the Elder, but (not being a Cohein), he could not have said \"what my hands have ministered.\" \"and let them take\": from the Temple treasury. \"unto you\": that you be appointed over it. And just as Moses was appointed over it, so, was Aaron. Similarly, in respect to the oil for lighting, (Shemot 21:20) \"and let them take unto you\" — that you be appointed over it. \"a red heifer (parah)\": R. Eliezer says: \"eglah\" signifies of the first year; \"parah\" signifies of the second year. The sages say: \"eglah\" — of the second year; \"parah\" — of the third or fourth year. R. Meir says: One of the fifth year, too, is valid. An old one is valid, but it is not waited for lest it sprout black hairs and become unfit. \"parah\": I understand black or white; it is, therefore, written \"red.\" \"whole\": in redness or in (absence of) blemishes? \"which does not have a blemish\" accounts for blemishes. How, then, am I to understand \"whole\"? That it be \"whole\" in redness. \"which does not have a blemish\": Why need this be stated? Even if it were not stated, I would know it a fortiori, viz.: If offerings, which are not invalidated by work (having been done with them), are invalidated by a blemish, then the heifer, which is invalidated by work, how much more so should it be invalidated by a blemish! — No, this may be true of offerings, which must be processed (by the Cohein) in a state of cleanliness, wherefore a blemish invalidates them, as opposed to the heifer, which may be processed in a state of tumah (i.e., when the Cohein is a tvul yom), wherefore a blemish would not invalidate it. (So that the verse is needed to tell us otherwise.) — (No,) this is refuted by (the instance of) the Paschal lamb, which though it may be processed in a state of tumah, a blemish invalidates it, and this would indicate of the heifer that even though it is processed in tumah, a blemish invalidates it. (Why, then, is a verse needed to tell us this?) — No, this may be true of the Paschal lamb, which must be sacrificed at a fixed time, wherefore it is invalidated by a blemish, as opposed to the heifer, which, not having a fixed time (for its processing), should not be invalidated by a blemish. It must, therefore, (to tell us otherwise) be written \"which does not have a blemish.\" Issi b. Akiva says: \"which does not have a blemish\": Why need this be stated? Even if it were not stated, I would know it a fortiori, viz.: If offerings, which are not invalidated by black or white (hairs), are invalidated by a blemish, then the heifer, which is invalidated by black or white, how much more so should it be invalidated by a blemish\"! If I know this a fortiori, why need it be stated \"which does not have a blemish\"? To exclude (from invalidation by a blemish) the heifer of the broken neck (eglah arufah [viz. Devarim 21:4]). For it would follow (if not for this verse) that blemishes should invalidate the eglah arufah, viz.: If offerings, which are not invalidated by work, are invalidated by a blemish, then eglah arufah, which is invalidated by work, how much more so should it be invalidated by a blemish! It is, therefore, written (in respect to the red heifer), \"which does not have a blemish\" — It (the red heifer) is invalidated by a blemish, but the eglah arufah is not invalidated by a blemish. R. Yehudah b. Betheira says: If the sin-offering of a bird, whose offerers must be tahor, is not invalidated by a blemish, then the red heifer, whose processors may be tamei (tvul yom), how much more so should it not be invalidated by a blemish! (The verse, then, is needed to tell us that it is invalidated by a blemish.) — No, this may be true of the sin-offering of a bird, which is valid if either male or female, as opposed to a heifer, (where only a female is valid.) Why, then, need it be stated \"which does not have a blemish\"? (lit., \"when there is no blemish in it\") When the blemish is in it (it is invalid), but when it has passed, it is valid. R. Yoshiyah Numithi asked before R. Yehudah b. Betheira: What is a blemish which has passed, in which instance it is valid? And he showed me between his two fingers — when(flesh) protrudes or when it has two tails. \"upon which a yoke has not come\": Scripture speaks of a yoke not in (the time of its) working. And if you would say, a yoke in (the time of its working), would you say that? It follows a fortiori, viz.: If eglah arufah, which is not invalidated by a blemish, is invalidated by a yoke (in its time of working), then the red heifer, which is invalidated by a blemish, how much more so should it be invalidated by a yoke (in the time of its working!) — (No,) this is refuted by the offerings, which are invalidated by a blemish, but not by a yoke (in the time of working), and they would indicate about the red heifer that even though it is invalidated by a blemish, it should not be invalidated by a yoke (in the time of its working). — No, this may be true of offerings, which are not invalidated by black and white hairs, wherefore a yoke does not invalidate them, as opposed to the red heifer, which is invalidated by black and white, wherefore a yoke (in the time of its working) should invalidate them. What, then, is the intent of \"upon which a yoke has not come\"? A yoke not in the time of its working. Whence is it derived that other labors are equated with a yoke (to invalidate the red heifer)? It follows a fortiori, viz.: If (in the instance of) eglah arufah, which is not invalidated by a blemish, other labors are equated with a yoke, (viz. Devarim 21:3 \"which has never been worked, which has never pulled under a yoke\"), then (in the instance of) the red heifer, which is invalidated by a blemish, how much more so should other labors be equated with a yoke! — But perhaps it should be transposed, viz.: If (in the instance of) the red heifer, which is invalidated by a blemish, other labors were not equated with a yoke, then (in the instance of) eglah arufah, which is not invalidated by a blemish, how much more so should other labors not be equated with a yoke! It is, therefore, written \"which has never been worked.\" I have reasoned a fortiori and I have transposed. The transposition has been refuted and I have emerged with the original a fortiori argument, viz.: If (in the instance of) the eglah arufah, which is not invalidated by a blemish, other labors are equated with a yoke, then (in the instance of) the red heifer, which is invalidated by a blemish, how much more so should other labors be equated with a yoke!",
            " (Bamidbar 19:3) \"And you shall give it (the red heifer) to Elazar the Cohein\": Scripture comes to teach us about the red heifer that it is processed by the adjutant high-priest. Know this to be so, (that it is processed by the adjutant high-priest), for Aaron was alive and Elazar burned the heifer. \"and you shall give it\": This one was processed by Elazar, and others (after this) were processed by the high-priest. These are the words of R. Meir. R. Yossi, R. Yehudah, R. Shimon, and R. Elazer b. Yaakov say: This one was processed by Elazar, and others, either by the high-priest or by a regular Cohein. \"and he shall take it (outside the encampment\"): And another (heifer) should not be taken out with it — whence they ruled: If it balked at being taken out, a black one (i.e., one with black hairs) should not be taken out with it (as an incentive for it to leave), so that they not say it was the black one that they slaughtered and not the red one, (or) that both of them were slaughtered. R. Yossi says: This is not the reason, but (it is) because it is written \"and he shall take it out\" — alone. \"outside the encampment\": to the mount of anointment (i.e., the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem, so that its blood be sprinkled opposite the door of the tent of the sanctuary.) \"and he shall slaughter it\": We are hereby apprised that if it became carrion in being slaughtered, it is unfit (to serve as a red heifer). \"and he shall slaughter it\": — whence they ruled: Two heifers are not to be slaughtered together (with a long knife). \"and he shall slaughter it before him\": that another slaughters and Elazar looks on. (And) Scripture apprises us about the heifer that (preoccupation with some other) work invalidates its slaughtering. \"and Elazar the Cohein shall take\": Why is this written? Is it not already written \"And you shall give it to Elazar the Cohein\"? Why repeat it? (To stress) the Cohein in his priesthood (i.e., in his priestly vestments.) \"shall take of its blood with his finger\": Its mitzvah is a mitzvah of the hand (i.e., he takes its blood in his hand and he sprinkles with his finger), and it is not a mitzvah of the (sprinkling) vessel. And this would follow, viz.: Since the log of the oil effects kashruth (for the leper to be cleansed for the eating of sanctified food), and the blood of the red heifer effects kashruth (for the ashes of the red heifer to cleanse), then if I have learned that the log of oil effects kashruth only via the hand, (viz. Vayikra 14:15), only via the hand (and not via a sprinkling vessel), then it follows that the blood of the red heifer, too, should effect kashruth only via the hand. You derive it from the log of oil, and I derive it from the blood of the burnt-offering (of the leper). — Would you say that? There is a difference (between your derivation and mine.) The log of oil requires seven sprinklings and the red heifer requires seven sprinklings. If you learn about the log of oil that it is kasher only with the hand, then the blood of the red heifer should be kasher only with the hand. But, where you are coming from, if there (vis-à-vis the guilt-offering) it is kasher only (by spilling the blood) from a vessel to the hand, then here, too, (it should be kasher only) from a vessel to the hand. It is, therefore, written \"from its blood with his finger.\" Its mitzvah is a mitzvah of the hand, and it is not a mitzvah of the (sprinkling) vessel. \"with his finger\": the right finger (i.e., the index finger) of his right hand. You say the index finger of his right hand, but perhaps all of the fingers are valid. It is, therefore, written (Vayikra 14:16) \"Then the Cohein shall dip his right finger, etc.\" Since \"fingers\" are written in the Torah unqualified, and in one instance Scripture specifies that it is only the \"yemanith\" of the \"yemanith,\" so, all \"fingers\" of the Torah are \"yemanith\" — the most skillful (\"meyumeneth\") of the right hand (i.e., the index finger), which is more adapted for sprinkling than all of the other fingers. \"and he shall sprinkle of its blood opposite the tent of meeting\": that he direct his gaze to the door of the sanctuary when he sprinkles the blood. \"and he shall sprinkle … opposite the tent of meeting\": If the sanctuary were not set up or if the wind had furled the curtains the red heifer was not processed. \"and he shall sprinkle of its blood opposite the tent of meeting\": Why is this repeated? Is it not already written (Ibid.) \"of its blood with his finger\"? From (Ibid.) \"seven times,\" I might understand seven sprinklings from one dipping. It is, therefore, written \"of its blood seven times\" — he returns to the blood seven times. \"seven times\": They (the sprinklings) are mutually inclusive (i.e., in the absence of one, the others are invalid.) For it would follow: Since \"sprinklings\" are written within (the sanctuary, on Yom Kippur), and \"sprinklings\" are written (re the red heifer), then just as I have learned of the inner sprinklings that they are mutually inclusive, so, the outer sprinklings should be mutually inclusive. — No, this may be true of the inner sprinklings, which effect atonement, wherefore they are mutually inclusive, as opposed to the outer sprinklings, which do not effect atonement, wherefore they should not be mutually inclusive. It is, therefore, written (here) \"seven times,\" and there (of the inner sprinklings) \"seven times before the L-rd.\" Just as there, they are mutually inclusive, here, too, they are mutually inclusive."

            " (Bamidbar 19:5) \"And he shall burn the heifer before his eyes\": Scripture apprises us about the heifer that preoccupation with some other) work invalidates its burning. — But even without this being stated, I know it a fortiori, viz.: If it (preoccupation) invalidates its slaughtering (see above), should it not invalidate its burning! If I know this a fortiori, what need is there for a verse? Rather, Scripture apprises us that (preoccupation with some other) work invalidates it from the time of slaughtering until it becomes ashes. \"And he shall burn the heifer before his eyes, and not the bullocks (that of Yom Kippur, etc.) that are burnt (\"outside the camp\"). For it would follow (otherwise), viz.: If with the red heifer, which is not processed within (the sanctuary), work invalidates its burning, then the bullocks, which are processed within, how much more so should work invalidate their burning! — No, this may be true of the red heifer, whose slaughtering is invalidated by work, wherefore it invalidates its burning, as opposed to the bullocks that are burnt, whose slaughtering is not invalidated by work, wherefore it should not invalidate their burning! — But let it (i.e., work) invalidate their slaughtering! And this would, indeed, follow, viz.: If bullocks, which are not processed within, work invalidates their slaughtering, then the bullocks that are burnt, which are processed within, how much more so should work invalidate their slaughtering! It is, therefore, written \"then he shall burn the heifer (before his eyes\") and (Ibid. 3) \"and he shall slaughter it before him,\" and not the bullocks that are burned. \"And he shall burn the heifer before his (Elazar's) eyes\": Another burns and Elazar looks on. \"Its skin, and its flesh, and its blood together with its dung\": Just as the dung (remains) in its place, (i.e., it is not removed from the bowels,) so, all (of the others remain) in their place — whence they ruled: Any blood (remaining in his hand) should be returned to its place (i.e., the shechitah site), and if it is not returned, the heifer is invalidated. What does he do? He wipes his hand on the body of the heifer. \"And he shall burn the heifer\": to include bits (leaping from the fire) — whence they ruled: Any amount of flesh must be returned (to the fire); if he does not return it, it (the heifer) is invalidated. Any amount of bone must be returned; if he does not return it, it is not invalidated, (\"bone\" not being mentioned in the verse). If an olive-size (leapt out of the fire), he must return it (to the fire). (And if he returned it, even if a minute amount remained behind, he must return it.) If he does not return it, (the heifer) is invalidated. \"he shall burn\": (We have here an instance of) amplification (\"he shall burn\") after amplification (\"And he shall burn\") in which instance the rule is \"diminution\" — If most of it (and not necessarily all of it) has been consumed, (it is valid). These are the words of R. Yishmael. R. Yehudah says: (The intent of \"he shall burn\" is that) he shall not diminish the wood (supply). He adds to it bundles of hyssop and bundles of Grecian hyssop in order to increase the (amount of) ashes. (Ibid. 6) \"And the Cohein shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet\": It is written here \"taking,\" and, elsewhere, (Ibid. 18) \"taking.\" Just as \"taking\" here is three (species), so, \"taking\" there, (although only \"hyssop\" is mentioned there.) \"wood\": This implies any kind of wood. It is, therefore, written \"cedar\": This (alone) implies even a branch. It is, therefore, written \"wood.\" How so? A chip of cedar wood. \"hyssop\": Not \"Grecian\" or \"Kochalith\" or \"Desert\" or \"Roman\" (hyssop) or any other hyssop which has an epithet. \"ushni tola'ath\": i.e., whose variant (\"shniyatho\" [something called by a \"variant\" name]) is tola'ath (scarlet). \"and he shall cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer\": I might think (that he casts it in) when the heifer has already been reduced to ashes; it is, therefore, written \"the heifer\" (i.e., when it is still recognizable as a heifer.) If \"the heifer,\" I might think (that he casts it in) even when it has not been burned. It is, therefore, written \"into the midst of the burning.\" How is this to be reconciled? (He casts it in) when the flames have caught on to most of it. R. Akiva says: \"the burning\": I might think (that he casts it in) when the heifer has already been reduced to ashes; it is, therefore, written \"the heifer.\" If \"the heifer,\" I might think if he splits it open and places it into its midst; it is, therefore, written \"and he shall cast it into the burning of the heifer.\" How is this to be reconciled? (He casts it in) when it has split open (of itself because of the fire.) \"And the Cohein shall wash his garments, and he shall bathe his flesh in water\": Scripture hereby apprises us of the caster of the hyssop that he imparts tumah to garments. \"and then he shall come to the encampment\": Just as here, he (the caster of the hyssop) is forbidden to come to the encampment (before he cleanses himself), so, there, he (the burner and the gatherer of the ashes) is forbidden to come to the encampment. \"and the Cohein shall be unclean until the evening\": Just as here (he is unclean) until the evening, so, there, he (the burner of the bullock and the he-goat of Yom Kippur, [viz. Vayikra 16:26]), (he is unclean) until the evening. (Ibid. 8) \"And he who burns it shall wash his garments\": Scripture hereby apprises us of the burner of the heifer that he imparts tumah to garments. Even without the verse, I can derive it a fortiori, viz.: If the caster of the hyssop imparts tumah to his garments, how much more so the burner of the heifer! Why, then, do I need the verse? Scripture hereby apprises us of those who occupy themselves with the heifer from beginning to end that they require the washing of garments and bathing of the body and the going down of the sun (to be cleansed). \"And he who burns it shall wash his garments\": and not plague-garments (i.e., the garments of the one who burns the clothes of the leper or of one afflicted with plague do not become unclean.) For it would follow otherwise, viz.: If the heifer, which does not impart tumah by contact, its burning imparts tumah to garments, then plague-garments, which do impart tumah by contact, how much more so should their burner impart tumah to garments! It is, therefore, written \"And he who burns it shall wash his garments,\" and not plague-garments. \"he shall wash his garments with water and he shall bathe his flesh in water\": \"in water\" — twice. What is the intent of this? For it would follow: Since a man requires immersion and vessels require immersion, then just as a man immerses in (an amount of water) that is sufficient for him, i.e., forty sa'ah), so vessels are immersed in a (smaller amount of water) sufficient for them. It is, therefore, written \"in water\" twice. Where man is immersed (i.e., forty sa'ah), there hands (for ritual purposes) and vessels are immersed. (Ibid. 9) \"And a man who is clean shall gather the ashes\": Because we find that all of the processing of the heifer is by a Cohein, I might think that the gathering of the ashes, too, is by a Cohein; it is, therefore, written \"And a man who is clean\" — whence we are apprised that the gathering of the ashes is kasher through any man. \"And a man who is clean\" — to exclude a minor. (\"a man\" then) implies that both a minor and a woman are excluded; it is, therefore, written \"who is clean\" — to include (as kasher) a woman. These are the words of R. Yishmael. R. Akiva says: \"And a man who is clean\" — to include a zar (a non-Cohein). \"clean\" — to validate a woman. (\"clean\" then) implies that both a woman and a minor are included; it is, therefore, written (Ibid.) \"and he shall place it outside the encampment\": Scripture speaks only of someone who has the \"mind\" to \"place\" (with intent, excluding a minor, who does not have the mind to do so.) \"a man who is clean\": clean vis-à-vis ma'aser, and tamei vis-à-vis terumah. And elsewhere (Ibid. 18) it is written \"And a clean man shall take hyssop and dip it in the water.\" R. Akiva asks: Why is this (\"clean man\") written? Even if it were not written, I would know it a fortiori, viz.: If the gatherer (of the ashes) must be clean, how much more so the sprinkler! What, then, is the intent of \"a clean man\"? One who has left the category of \"tumah.\" And who is that? One who immersed in the daytime (and whose cleanliness is consummated in the evening). And it is written elsewhere (Ibid. 19) \"clean.\" Just as there, tamei for terumah and \"clean\" for ma'aser, so \"clean\" here (Ibid. 9), tamei for terumah and clean for ma'aser. \"the ashes of the heifer\": and not the brands — whence they ruled: A brand which has ash is crushed and one which does not have ash is discarded. A bone, in any event, will be crushed. \"outside the encampment\": in the Mount of Olives — whence they ruled: It is divided into three parts: one for the chel (a place within the fortification of the Temple); one for the Mount of Olives; one to be divided among all the priestly watches. \"in a clean place\": its surroundings must be clean — whence R. Elazar Hakapper said: A vessel containing the cleansing (ashes of the red heifer), with an air-tight lid in the tent of a dead man is tamei, it being written \"in a clean place.\" And this is not a clean place. \"And it shall be for the congregation of the children of Israel in keeping for waters of sprinkling.\" What is the intent of this? I might think that \"work\" (see above) is invalidated only vis-à-vis the heifer. Whence do I derive (the same for) the water (that is added to the ashes)? From \"And it shall be … in keeping for waters of sprinkling\" (which implies that \"work\" is to be abstained from only when they are being made waters of sprinkling.) — But perhaps (the stricture against \"work\" obtains even after they have been sanctified as waters of sprinkling. — It is, therefore, written \"for (i.e., to make them) waters of sprinkling.\" And they are already waters of sprinkling. If a cow drank of the cleansing waters, its flesh is tamei (if it drank) within twenty-four hours (of being slaughtered). R. Yehudah says it (the water) is nullified in its intestines, it being written \"And it shall be for the congregation of the children of Israel in keeping\" (i.e., once it is no longer \"in keeping,\" it does not confer tumah upon what comes in contact with it.) This question (\"tahor or tamei\"?) was asked before thirty-two elders and they ruled its flesh \"tahor.\" This is one of the things that R. Yossi Haglili discussed with R. Akiva, (R. Yossi holding \"tahor,\" and R. Akiva, \"tamei\"), and R. Akiva dismissed him, (R. Yossi being unable to substantiate his view.) Afterwards, R. Yossi found substantiation for his view, and asked R. Akiva: May I return? R. Akiva: Shall I allow everyone to return, and not you because your name is \"Yossi Haglili\"? R. Yossi (presenting his substantiation): It is written \"And it shall be for the congregation of the children of Israel in keeping.\" It is only when they are \"in keeping\" that they are considered sprinkling waters (and confer tumah [see above].) R. Tarfon said (on Daniel 8:4) \"I saw the ram butting westward, northward, and southward. And no beast could withstand him, and there was none to deliver from his power. He did as he willed and grew great.\" This (\"the ram\") is R. Akiva. (Ibid. 5) \"As I looked on, a he-goat came from the west, passing over the entire earth without touching the ground. And the goat had a beetling horn between its eyes\": This is R. Yossi Haglili and his response. (6) \"And he came up to the two-horned ram that I saw standing before the water course, and he charged at him full force. (7) And I saw him reach the ram and rage at him, and he struck the ram and broke his two horns\" — R. Akiva and Shimon b. Naness — \"and the ram\" — R. Akiva — \"was powerless to withstand him. And he\" — R. Yossi Haglili — \"cast him to the ground and trampled him. And there were none\" — the thirty-two elders — \"to rescue him from his hand.\"",

Variantly: \"It is a sin-offering\": We are hereby apprised that if it is not slaughtered to its specific end, it is unfit. Variantly: \"It is a sin-offering\": We are hereby apprised that it (like a sin-offering) is not burned at night as it is in the daytime. If \"it is a sin-offering,\" I might think that it is voided by being kept overnight; it is, therefore, written \"And it shall be for the congregation of the children of Israel in keeping.\" We are hereby apprised that it \"keeps\" day after day and year after year.

            " (Bamidbar 19:11) \"One who touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean for seven days.\" Scripture hereby teaches about a dead body that it confers tumah by contact. — But even without a verse it follows a fortiori, viz.: If it confers tumah in a tent, how much more so by contact! Why, then, is the verse needed? To include an eight-month birth (who died). This would include both an eight-month birth and his blood; it is, therefore, written (lit.,) \"the soul (i.e., the body) of a man\" — to exclude his blood (as conferring tumah). These are the words of R. Yishmael. R. Akiva says: (It is written) \"all the soul of a man\" — to include his blood. \"then he shall be tamei for seven days\": Scripture hereby apprises us that a dead body confers tumah for seven days (unlike other instances of contact tumah, which obtain for one day only). (Ibid. 12) \"He shall be cleansed with it\": Why \"with it\"? (i.e., \"it\" seems superfluous). (The thrust of \"it\" is) with ashes that were processed as prescribed. \"on the third day and on the seventh day\": Scripture hereby apprises us that one who is tamei by a dead body must be sprinkled on, on the third day and the seventh day. You say this, but perhaps (the meaning is) that if he is sprinkled on, on the third day, he is clean on the seventh day, and if not, he is not clean on the seventh day. It is, therefore, written \"And if he is not cleansed on the third day, he shall not be clean on the seventh day.\" — But still, perhaps the meaning is: Why is he not clean on the seventh day, because he was not besprinkled on the seventh day, but if he were besprinkled on the third day, then he is clean on the seventh day! It is, therefore, written (Ibid. 19) \"and he shall cleanse him on the seventh day.\" Scripture repeats it to void it (otherwise). \"And if he is not cleansed on the third day, then he shall not be clean on the seventh day\": Why is this written? (i.e., it follows from what precedes.) Because it is written (Ibid. 20) \"And a man if he become tamei and he has not been sprinkled upon, etc.\", does Scripture make him liable to kareth because of the defiling of the sanctuary and its holy things or because he has not been sprinkled upon? It is, therefore, written \"And if he is not cleansed on the third day, then he shall not be clean on the seventh day.\" His punishment is not being clean, and not kareth. (Ibid. 13) \"Everyone who touches a dead body in the soul of a man\": As heretofore stated, to exclude an eight-month birth. \"that shall die\": Scripture hereby apprises us that he does not confer tumah until he dies. From here, you reason to sheretz (a creeping thing), viz.: If the \"graver,\" a dead body, does not confer tumah until the man (actually) dies, then the \"lighter,\" a sheretz, how much more so should it not confer tumah until it (actually) dies! Or, transpose it, viz.: If sheretz, the \"lighter,\" confers tumah while convulsing, then a man, the \"graver\" how much more so should he confer tumah even while convulsing (and not actually dead)! It is, therefore, written \"Everyone who touches a dead body in the soul of a man that shall die.\" Why need \"that shall die\" be written? Why is it written? To apprise us that he does not confer tumah until he (actually) dies. I have reasoned a fortiori and I have transposed. The transposition has been nullified and the original a fortiori argument remains, viz.: If the \"graver,\" a dead body, does not confer tumah until the man actually dies, then the \"lighter,\" a sheretz, how much more so should it not confer tumah until it (actually) dies! \"and he not be cleansed\": Rebbi says: and he not be cleansed by blood (i.e., if he has not brought his required offering, and enters the sanctuary, e.g., in the instance of a zav or a leper, who require an offering for their purification). You say, if he has not been cleansed by blood, but perhaps (the meaning is that) he has not been cleansed by the waters (of the red heifer)! (This is not so, for) \"the waters of sprinkling have not been sprinkled upon him\" already speaks of the waters. How, then, am I to understand \"and he not be cleansed\"? (As) he will not be cleansed by blood,\" to include one lacking atonement, (as in the above instance). \"and that soul shall be cut off': Why is this written (here)? Is it not written below? (viz. Ibid. 20). But because it is written (there) \"The sanctuary (\"mikdash,\" [i.e., the Temple]) of the L-rd he has defiled,\" this tells me only of the mikdash. Whence do I derive (the same for) the mishkan (i.e., the tabernacle of the desert)? From (Ibid. 13) \"The tabernacle (\"mishkan\") of the L-rd he has defiled.\" \"and that soul shall be cut off\": And elsewhere (in the same connection [Vayikra 15:31]) \"that they not die in their tumah.\" Why the difference (in terminology)? To teach that \"kareth\" and \"death\" (in this regard) are one and the same. \"tamei shall he be\": to include other varieties of tumah (e.g., sheretz and zav). These are the words of R. Yoshiyah. R. Yonathan says: It (the verse) is not needed (for this teaching.) It is already written (Vayikra, Ibid.) \"And you shall separate the children of Israel from their tumah, that they not die in their tumah by making tamei My mishkan which is in their midst.\" Tumah through a dead body was in the category (of all the varieties of tumah), and Scripture isolated it (here for special mention), and made it liable to death and to the bringing of an offering (for unwitting transgression), to teach about the other varieties of tumah (in this connection) that they are liable to death and to the bringing of an offering. How, then, am I to understand \"tamei shall he be\"? Because it is written \"for the waters of sprinkling have not been sprinkled upon him,\" I might think (that the intent is) if they had not been sprinkled upon him at all. Whence do I derive the same for (an instance where) he sprinkled (on the third day), but did not repeat (on the seventh day)? From \"tamei shall he be.\" Whence do I derive the same for (an instance where) he sprinkled and he repeated, but he did not immerse? From \"His tumah is upon him.\" Whence do I derive the same for (an instance where) he sprinkled and he immersed, but did not wait for \"his sun to set\"? From \"His tumah is yet upon him.\""

Whence do we derive that (the same obtains if he died) outside the tent (and were brought into it)? From \"This is the Torah\" (i.e., there is one law for both.) These are the words of Issi b. Akavya. R. Yishmael said (This derivation) is not needed. If when he had not been tamei (before), he effects tent-uncleanliness, how much more so, when he had been tamei (before, i.e., when he died outside the tent.) Whence do we derive that all things which \"tent\" are considered a tent (for purposes of tent-uncleanliness, and not only a flaxen tent)? R. Yitzchak said: If vis-à-vis a leper, the \"lighter\" (form of tumah), all things that \"tent\" (and not only flax) are considered tents, then vis-à-vis a dead man, the \"graver\" (form of tumah), how much more so should all things that \"tent\" be considered tents. \"all that enter the tent\": partially. \"and all that is in the tent\": entirely. Why need this be said? If one that enters partially is tamei, how much more so one who is in it entirely. R. Achi phrases it otherwise, viz.: If one who enters the tent is tamei, how much more so one who is already in it! What, then, is the intent of \"all that is in the tent\"? To render the floor of the house until the depths like the house itself (i.e., all that is in that space is tamei.) Everyone who enters the tent from its entrance becomes tamei, but it does not impart tumah from its sides if they are open (i.e., if a man or vessels touch the tent from the outside when it is open, they do not become tamei for seven days.) From here you can reason a fortiori to a grave, viz.: If a tent, which is susceptible of tumah, does not impart tumah from all of its sides when it is open, then a grave, which is not susceptible of tumah, (being soil per se,) how much more so does it not impart tumah from all of its sides when it is open. — But perhaps the reverse is the case, viz.: If a grave, which is not susceptible of tumah, imparts tumah from all of its sides when it is open, then a tent, which is susceptible of tumah, how much more so should it impart tumah from all of its sides when it is open! It is, therefore, written \"all that enter the tent\" — It is only through its entrance that it imparts tumah, but not from all of its sides when it is open. I have reasoned a fortiori and I have transposed (the reasoning). The transposition has been nullified and I return to the original a fortiori argument, viz.: If a tent, which is susceptible of tumah, does not impart tumah from all of its sides when it is open, then a grave, which is not susceptible of tumah, how much more so should it not impart tumah from all of its sides when it is open! — But (in that case) it should not (even) impart \"evening tumah\" (viz. Ibid. 22) — Would you say that? It follows a fortiori (that it does impart evening tumah), viz.: If one at a third remove from a dead body (as in Ibid. 22) is tamei, how much more so, one (as in our case) who is at a second remove! \"and all that is in the tent shall be tamei\": From this I understand that even straw and twigs and pieces of wood and stones are included; it is, therefore, written (Ibid. 18) \"And a clean man shall take hyssop and dip it in the water and he shall sprinkle it upon the tent and upon all the vessels.\" — But I still would understand to be included vessels of ordure and vessels of earth and vessels of soil. It is, therefore, written (Bamidbar 31:20) \"And every garment, and every vessel of skin, and every work of goats and every vessel of wood shall you cleanse.\" We learn, then, of four (types of) vessels (that are affected. Whence do we derive (the same for) metal vessels? From (Ibid. 22) \"But the silver and the gold, etc.\" We learn, then, of four types of vessels and of metal vessels. Whence do we derive (the same for) earthen vessels? From (Ibid. 19:15) \"And every open (i.e., earthen) vessel, etc.\" We learn, then, of four types of vessels, of metal vessels, and of earthen vessels. — But perhaps the intent is that these (those mentioned in 30:20) and those mentioned here (19:18 \"and upon all the vessels\") are subject to cleansing, and the others (straw and twigs) are subject to tumah in a tent, (but not to cleansing.) It is, therefore, written (Ibid. 11) \"he shall be tamei for seven days. (12) He shall be cleansed with it.\" Whatever is subject to cleansing is subject to tumah; whatever is not subject to cleansing is not subject to tumah. (Ibid. 15) \"And every open vessel whose cover is not fastened upon it is tamei.\" Scripture speaks of an earthen vessel. — But perhaps it speaks of all vessels! (This is not so,) for you reason as follows: Four vessels are mentioned vis-à-vis a sheretz (a creeping thing, viz. Vayikra 11:33), and one (type of) vessel was excluded for both attenuation and exacerbation (re tumah). And four vessels are mentioned in respect to a dead body, and one was excluded for both attenuation and exacerbation. Just as there, Scripture speaks of an earthen vessel (viz. Ibid.), so, here, Scripture speaks of an earthen vessel. These are the words of R. Yoshiyah. R. Yonathan says: Is Scripture (here) speaking of an earthen vessel or of all vessels? It is, therefore, written \"an open vessel\" — a vessel that is subject to tumah at (the atmosphere of) its opening (and not at its outer surface). R. Eliezer says; Is Scripture speaking of an earthen vessel or of all vessels? It is unclean\" — forever, there being no cleansing for its tumah. And what is the intent of \"open\"? Any amount. Abba Channan says in the name of R. Eliezer: From \"there is no tight covering upon it,\" I would understand upon all of it. It is, therefore, written \"upon\" — upon its opening and not upon all of it. \"tight covering\" (\"tzamid pathil\") \"tzamid\": This is the stopper (plugging the inside). \"pathil\": This is the lid. And though there is no proof for this, there is an allusion to it in (Ibid. 25:3) \"And Israel adhered (\"vayitzamed\") to Ba'al Peor.\" \"And every open vessel whose cover is not fastened upon it is unclean\": Vessels are protected (against tumah) in the tent of the dead with a tzamid pathil, but in (plague-spot) tents, with a covering. \"a tzamid pathil upon it\": and not a vessel upon a tzamid pathil — whence they ruled: A jug which he turned on its mouth and smeared with clay from the sides is susceptible of tumah, it being written \"a tzamid pathil upon it,\" and not \"it upon a tzamid pathil.\" These are the words of R. Eliezer. \"And every open vessel\": This tells me only of an earthen vessel. Whence do I derive (the same for) vessels of ordure, vessels of stones, and vessels of soil? It follows a fortiori, viz.: If earthen vessels, which are subject to tumah, protect (what is in them against tumah) by a tzamid pathil, in the tent of the dead, then vessels of ordure, of stones, and of soil, which are not subject to tumah, how much more should they protect (against tumah) by a tzamid pathil in the tent of the dead! \"It is tamei\" (without a tzamid pathil). Why (the stress on) \"it\"? What protects (against tumah) by a tzamid pathil in the tent of the dead, protects itself by a tzamid pathil (from tumah) through contact with a sheretz."

From (Bamidbar 31:24) \"And you shall wash your garments on the seventh day and you shall be clean,\" (garments being \"implements\"), \"one slain by the sword or a dead body\": A dead body is in the category of \"one slain,\" and Scripture removed it from that category (for special mention) to equate what separates from him (i.e., an olive-size of flesh) with the body itself. These are the words of R. Yoshiyah. R. Yonathan says: \"dead body\" is not in the category of \"one slain,\" for we find each being mentioned by itself. Whence, then is it derived that what separates from it is equated with the body itself? It is derived a fortiori, viz.: If neveilah, of lesser stringency, Scripture equated what separates from it with neveilah itself, then a dead body, of greater stringency, how much more so should what separates from it be equated with the body itself.— No, this may be so with neveilah, which confers \"(until) evening\" tumah, the preponderant (type of tumah), as opposed to a dead body, which confers seven-day tumah, the rarer type. — Would you say that? Where is the tumah itself more stringent? Is it not in a dead body, which confers tumah for seven days, whereas neveilah confers only (until) \"evening tumah\"? Whence is it derived that it (a dead body) confers tumah by being carried? It follows a fortiori, viz. If neveilah, of lesser stringency confers tumah by being carried, how much more so, a dead body, of greater stringency! — But in that case, why do we not say: Just as there (neveilah), the tumah is (only until) evening, then here (dead body), too, the tumah should be (only until) evening? Would you say that? Where touching confers seven-day tumah (i.e., with a dead body), carrying confers seven-day tumah. Where touching confers (until) evening tumah, (i.e., with neveilah), carrying confers (until) evening tumah. R. Meir says: This is not needed (for the derivation). It is written (Bamidbar 31:19) \"Whoever has killed a man, etc.\" Is Scripture speaking of (one who kills him with) something which is susceptible of uncleanliness or even of one who shot him with an arrow and killed him?

That kinG-dom was proud and haughty, though they had only four provinces worthy of the name — Asia, Alexandria, Carthaginia, and Antiochia, while these (Sichon and Og) had sixty cities, all worthy of \"kingdom,\" viz. (Devarim 3:4) \"… sixty cities, the entire province of the palace, the kingdom of Og in the Bashan.\" Israel came and waged war against them and they fell into their (Israel's) hands. But when Israel was surfeited with the spoils, they began \"spoiling\" the spoils — they tore apart garments and cast them away and tore apart beasts and cast them away — for they sought only vessels of silver and gold, viz. (Devarim 3:7) \"and every beast and the spoil of the cities we 'spoiled' unto ourselves.\" \"They came and sat in Shittim,\" in the place of sitoth. At that time Ammonim and Moavim arose and built markets for themselves from Beth Hayeshimoth until Har Hashaleg, where they installed harlots, old ones outside and young ones within, who sold flaxen garments. When an Israelite would eat and drink and make merry and go out to promenade and to buy something from the old one, she would offer it to him at cost, whereupon the young one would call out to him from within, saying \"Come and buy it for less,\" and he did so. The same, the next day and the day after. The third day she would say to him \"Come inside and pick for yourself — you're like one of the family.\" He obliged. The pitcher near her was full of Ammoni wine, the wine of idolators having not yet been forbidden to Israelites.

I am only asking that you bare yourself before him.\" (The sages ruled that baring oneself to Peor is its mode of worship.) The wine burned in him and he said \"Consent to me.\" She: \"If you want me to consent to you, 'veer off' from the Torah of Moses.\" And he did so, as it is written (Hoshea 10:10) \"They veered off to shame (i.e., to idolatry); and they became detestable (to Me) in loving (the daughters of Moav).\" In the end, they reverted to (their practice of) making idolatrous banquets for them to which they invited them, as it is written (Bamidbar 25:2) \"And they (the Moavite women) called the people to the sacrifices of their gods, etc.\" R. Elazar b. Shamua says: Just as a nail cannot be removed from a door without wood (attached), so, an Israel cannot leave Peor without souls (i.e., without adhesions thereof). Once, Pinchas from the district of Ariach was rolling (wine-) jars, when the spirit of Peor assaulted him, whereupon he brandished the spit against it and it fled. It returned to him the second night, saying \"Why did you curse me.\" Pinchas: \"I won't do it again.\" Once, Sabbatia of Ullas hired out his donkey to a gentile woman. When she came to the outskirts of the province, she said to him: \"Wait until I bare myself in its temple.\" After she left, he said to her \"Wait for me until I go in and do as you did.\" She: \"But you are a Jew!\" He: \"What difference does it make to you?\" He went in, (did his \"devotions,\") and wiped himself on the nose of Peor — whereupon the gentiles praised him, saying \"No one ever equaled you in this (worship).\" Once, a governor came from abroad to bow down to Peor. When he said to them \"Bring a bullock or a ram, which we sacrifice to it,\" they said to him \"We don't worship him in that manner.

And, what is more, I am greater than he, (Shimon) being second (of the womb of Leah), while he (Levi) is (only) third,\" saying which he seized her and stood her in the midst of all of Israel, viz.

Where are the lions?\" (Bereshit 48:9) \"A lion's whelp is Judah,\" (Devarim 33:32) \"Dan is a lion's whelp\" — whereupon he began to shout. Seeing that all remained silent, he arose from his sanhedrin, took out his spear and placed it (i.e., the blade) in his (hollow) belt, supported himself on its haft, and left. (Seeing him about to enter her tent,) they called out to him \"Pinchas, where are you going?\" He replied: \"Is Levi always to be greater than Shimon?\" (\"Zimri can do it, so can I,\") — at which they said \"Let him go in\" — whereupon the perushim (the \"devout\" among them) permitted the thing. Once he entered, the L-rd performed six miracles: the first: Normally they would have separated (upon his entrance), but the angel kept them joined. The second: The angel sealed their mouths so that they could not cry out. The third: He transfixed them (with the spear) in their (conjoined) genitals, for the \"benefit\" of the skeptics, so that they not deny their cohabitation and maintain that he had gone in for the same purpose. The fourth: They did not slide off from the spear but remained in their places. The fifth: The angel lifted the lintel so that they both could appear to all slung from his shoulders. The sixth: When he left, the men of his (Zimri's) tribe, rose up to kill him, and the angel fought them off. When Pinchas saw that too much havoc was being wrought by the angel, he cast them to the ground and stood up and intervened, viz. (Psalms 106:30-31) \"And Pinchas arose and intervened, and the plague ceased, and it was reckoned to his merit.\" And six more miracles were performed for him: The seventh: The blade of the spear was lengthened until it transfixed both bodies and projected upwards. The eighth: The arm of Pinchas was strengthened (to support such a burden). The ninth: The haft did not break. The tenth: Their blood did not descend on Pinchas so that he not become tamei. The eleventh: The Holy One Blessed be He kept them alive so that they not die and cause Pinchas to become tamei. The twelfth: The uppermost (to be thrust through) is the lower on the spear (when it is lifted), but in this instance, Zimri was overturned upon Kozbi, as in the act, so that all of Israel could see that their death was ordained.",

The mercies of flesh and blood are greater for males than for females. Not so the mercies of He who spoke and brought the world into being. His mercies are for males and females (equally). His mercies are for all!

For all whose deeds and the deeds of whose fathers are veiled and who Scripture traces (to their forbears) for praise are righteous ones the seed of righteous ones; and all whose deeds and the deeds of whose fathers are veiled and who Scripture traces (to their forbears) for denigration are evildoers the seed of evildoers.

To apprise us of the greatness of a tzaddik, who grew up in the lap of an evildoer but did not emulate his deeds, and how great the wickedness of an evildoer, who grew up between two righteous ones and did not emulate their deeds. Esav (Edom) grew up between two righteous ones, Isaac and Rivka, and did not emulate their deeds. Ovadiah grew up between two wicked ones, Achan and Izevel, and did not emulate their deeds.

Whence do we derive (the same for) future generations? From \"And to the children of Israel shall you speak, saying: A man, if he die, and he have no son, then you shall pass his inheritance to his daughter.\" Rebbi says: In all instances (of inheritance) the term \"giving\" is used, but in this instance \"passing\" is the term employed. For only a daughter can \"pass\" an inheritance (from one tribe to another), her son and her husband inheriting her (i.e., what she has inherited from her father, who may be of a different tribe.) Whence is it derived that the father (of the deceased) precedes his brothers (i.e., the brothers of the deceased) in the inheritance? R. Yishmael was wont to say: It is written \"then you shall pass over his inheritance to his daughter.\" Because of a daughter you pass over an inheritance from the father, and not because of the brothers. And whence is it derived that a father inherits (his son)? It follows, a fortiori, viz.: If the father's brothers who come (to inherit) only by power of the father, inherit him, then the father (himself), whose brothers come (to inherit) only by his power, how much more so should he inherit (his son)? And whence is it derived that the son's daughter stands in place of the son? It follows a fortiori, viz.: If the daughters of Tzelafchad, who inherited only for a particular time (i.e., an exception was made in their case, for the land was apportioned only to those who had left Egypt and had died), how much more so (is this to obtain) for the succeeding generations! Whence is it derived that females stand in the place of males (in all the \"inheritances\" of the Torah)? It follows (inductively), viz.: Since sons inherit and the brothers of the (deceased) father inherit, then just as with sons, females are equated with males, so, with all inheritors, females are equated with males. And just as with sons, males take precedence to females, so, with all inheritors, males take precedence to females. And just as with redeemers (of land) sons are equated with their fathers, (viz. Vayikra 25:49), so, with all inheritors, sons are equated with their fathers. And whence is it derived that a daughter inherits (her mother's possessions)? It is written (Bamidbar 36:8) \"And every daughter who receives an inheritance from the tribes of the children of Israel, etc.\" This tells me only of a daughter. Whence do I derive (the same for) a son? It follows a fortiori, viz.: If a daughter, whose power (of inheritance) is attenuated where there is a son, inherits (her mother), how much more so, a son! And whence is it derived that a man inherits his wife? From (Ibid. 27:11) \"… and he shall inherit (lit.,) her.\" These are the words of R. Akiva. R. Yishmael says: This (derivation) is not needed. For it is already written (Ibid. 36:8) \"And every daughter who receives an inheritance from the tribes of the children of Israel, etc.\", and (Ibid. 7) \"And an inheritance of the children of Israel shall not go around from tribe to tribe,\" and (Joshua 24:33) \"And Elazar the son of Aaron died, and they buried him on the hill of Pinchas, his son … in the mountain of Ephraim.\" Now whence did Pinchas have (land) in the mountain of Ephraim? It must be that he married a woman from the children of Ephraim, who died and whom he inherited. Similarly, (I Chronicles 2:22) \"And Seguv begot Yair, and he had twenty-three cities in the land of Gilad.\" Now whence did Yair have (land) in the land of Gilad? It must be that he married a woman from the children of Menasheh, who died and whom he inherited.",

It is, therefore, written (Ibid. 1:2) \"by their families, by their fathers' house\" — the families are according to the fathers. \"and he shall inherit her\": (as above). \"and it shall be to the children of Israel a statute of judgment.\" The Torah hereby authorizes the sages to adjudicate the matter (i.e., to decide who is the \"nearest.\") \"then you shall give his inheritance to his flesh who is near to him of his family\": Whoever is closest in \"flesh\" takes precedence in inheritance.",

Vows are like vowing by the life of the king. Oaths, (in that they must be in the name of the L-rd) are like swearing by the King Himself.

It is, therefore, written (to negate this, Ibid. 11) \"and if in the house of her husband, etc.\" This tells me only of a woman who married an Israelite. Whence do I derive (the same for) a widow who married a high-priest or a divorcée or a chalutzah (one who had received release from levirate marriage), who married an ordinary Cohein? From \"And if in the house of her husband\" — in any event. \"And if in the house of her husband she vowed\": This refers to a married woman. — But perhaps it refers only to a betrothed woman?

From (Ibid. 9) \"and he annul the vow which is upon her,\" I might think, whether or not it involves affliction. It is, therefore, written \"Every vow and every oath of binding to afflict the soul, her husband shall confirm it and her husband shall annul it.\" Scripture speaks only of vows involving affliction. Whence do I derive (the same [i.e., that he may annul them]) for vows affecting relations between him and her? From (Ibid. 17) \"These are the statutes which the L-rd commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter\" — whether or not they entail affliction. And just as this vow (i.e., a vow involving affliction) is a vow which is not absolved by others (i.e., sages [but annulled by the husband]), so, all vows (i.e., those between husband and wife) which are not absolved by others (are annulled by the husband.) These are the words of R. Yoshiyah. R. Yonathan says: We find vows which are absolved by others and which may be annulled by the husband. How so? If she said: \"I forbid the fruits of the world to myself,\" he may annul it. (If she said:) \"I forbid the fruits of the province to myself,\" he can bring them from a different province. (If she said:) \"I forbid the fruits of this shopkeeper to me,\" the husband cannot annul it. And if his livelihood came only from him, he can annul it. We find, then, that only a husband can annul only vows between him and her and vows entailing affliction. Whence do we derive the same for a father (vis-à-vis his daughter)? It follows (by induction), viz. Since a father can annul and a husband can annul, then just as a husband can annul only vows between him and her and vows involving affliction, so, a father. — But perhaps the reverse is true, viz.: Since a father can annul and a husband can annul, then just as a father can annul any vow, so, a husband can annul any vow. How, then, am I to understand \"Every vow and every oath of binding to afflict the soul, her husband shall confirm it, etc.\"? As referring to the days of her maturity (bagruth), but in the days of her maidenhood (na'aruth), he may annul all of her vows. It is, therefore, written (Ibid. 17) \"in her maidenhood in her father's house.\" (i.e., This distinction between 'na'aruth and bagruth) applies only in her father's house, but not in her husband's house. I have reasoned and reversed. The reversal was refuted, and I have \"merited\" returning to the original formulation, viz.: Since a husband can annul and a father can annul, then just as a husband can annul only vows between him and her and vows of affliction, so, a father. And, furthermore, it follows a fortiori, viz.: If a husband, who can annul in her maturity, can annul only vows between him and her and vows of affliction, how much more so a father! — No, this may be true of a husband, who does not have exclusive authority (in the annulment of vows) — wherefore he can annul only vows between him and her and vows of affliction, as opposed to a father, who does have such authority — wherefore he can annul all vows. I have not succeeded in deriving it by reasoning; it is, therefore, written \"These are the statutes, etc.\" likening the father to the husband, viz.: Just as the husband can annul only vows between him and her and vows of affliction, so the father. \"her husband shall confirm it and her husband shall annul it\": If she vowed not to eat figs and grapes, and he confirmed it for figs, it is all confirmed. If he annulled it for figs, it is not annulled until he annulled it also for grapes. These are the words of R. Yishmael. R. Akiva says: If he confirmed it for figs but not for grapes, it is all confirmed. If he annulled it for figs, but not for grapes, it is all annulled, it being written \"her husband shall confirm it and her husband shall annul it.\" Just as \"shall confirm it\" (connotes even) \"part of it,\" so, \"shall annul it\" (connotes even) \"part of it.\" If she vowed not to eat figs and grapes, and a sage was consulted (for absolution) and he (explicitly) permitted it for dates, but not for grapes, or for grapes, but not for figs, it is all permitted. If he forbade it for figs but not for grapes, or for grapes but not for figs, it is all forbidden. If he forbade it for figs, but not for grapes, or for grapes, but not for figs, it is forbidden. If her husband annulled it for figs but not for grapes, or for grapes but not for figs, it is all annulled. If he confirmed it for figs but not for grapes, or for grapes but not for figs, it is all confirmed. When is this so? When it is all one vow. But if she said: I vow not to eat figs, and, in addition, I vow not to eat grapes, and a sage were consulted, and he permitted it for figs, but not for grapes, or for grapes but not for figs — or if her husband annulled it for figs but not for grapes, or for grapes but not for figs, or if he confirmed it for figs but not for grapes or for grapes but not for figs — (then only) what was (specifically) confirmed is confirmed, and what was (specifically) annulled is annulled."

It is, therefore, written \"And if with an iron implement he kill him, he is a murderer.\" — But (even) without this I can derive it a fortiori, viz.: If he is liable for killing him with stone or wood, how much more so with iron! — But if so, I would say: Just as a stone must fill the hand (thus \"hand-stone\"), so, iron. It is, therefore, written with an implement of iron, (of any size). It is revealed before the Holy One Blessed be He that iron of any size can kill, wherefore \"hand\" is not written (in that connection) — even a needle or a pin sufficing. This tells me only of his killing him with iron. Whence do I derive the same for his throwing at him metal balls or lumps? From (16) \"He is a murderer; die shall die the murderer\" — in any event. (17) \"And if with a hand-stone, whereby he can die, he strike him and he die, he is a murderer. Die shall die the murderer.\": What is the intent of this? From (Shemot 21:18) \"And if men quarrel and a man strike his neighbor, etc.\" I might think (that this obtains) whether he strikes him with something which is or which is not lethal. It is, therefore, written \"And if with a hand-stone (i.e., one which fills the hand), whereby he can die, he strike him.\" Scripture hereby apprises us that he is not liable unless he strikes him with something which is potentially lethal. I might think, even (if he strike him) on a (body) site (a blow to) which is not mortal. It is, therefore, written (Devarim 19:11) \"And if a man hate his neighbor … and he strike him mortally\" — whereby we are apprised that he is not liable unless he strikes him with something which is potentially lethal and on a (body) site, injury to which may result in his death. This (\"And if with a hand-stone\") tells me that he is liable only if he kills him with a stone. Whence do I derive (the same for) his rolling rocks or pillars over him? From (17) \"he is a murderer — die shall die the murderer\" — in any event.",
            " (Bamidbar 35:18) \"Or if with a wooden hand-implement, whereby he can die, he strike him, and he die, he is a murderer.\" What is the intent of this? From (Shemot 21:20) \"And if a man strike his (Canaanite) man-servant or maid-servant with a rod, and he die under his hand, vengeance (by the sword) shall be taken,\" I might think, whether or not it is of killing potential. It is, therefore, written \"Or if with a wooden hand-implement, whereby he can die, he strike him, etc.\" — only if it is of killing potential. I might think, even on a (body) site injury to which does not result in death. It is, therefore, written (Devarim 19:11) \"And if a man hate his neighbor and lie in wait for him, and he rise up against him and he strike him mortally,\" Scripture hereby apprising us that he is not liable unless he strikes him on a (body) site injury to which may result in death. This (\"Or, if with a wooden implement\") tells me that he is liable only if he struck him with wood. Whence do I derive (the same for) his throwing beams or poles at him? From \"he is a murderer — die shall die the murderer\" — in any event.",
            " (Bamidbar 35:19) \"the avenger, he shall kill the murderer\": The mitzvah is the avenger's. Whence is it derived that if he has no avenger, beth-din designates one for him? From \"The avenger, he shall kill the murderer when he comes upon him\" — in any event.",
            " (Bamidbar 35:20) \"And if in hatred he thrust him\": What is the intent of this? From \"And if with an iron implement,\" \"And if with a hand-stone,\" \"Or if with a wooden hand-implement,\" I might think that he is liable only if he killed him with these. Whence do I derive (the same for) other things? It follows by induction from all three, viz.: Stone is not like wood; wood is not like stone; and both are not like iron. And iron is not like both. What is common to all three is that they are potentially lethal, and if one killed (by them), it is a mitzvah for the avenger to kill him. This tells me only of his killing with these. Whence do I derive that he is likewise liable if he pushed him off the top of a roof and he fell and died? From \"And if in hatred he thrust him\" — in any event. — But perhaps even if he pushed him into water or fire or incited a dog or a snake against him? It follows (that this is not so) by induction from all three, viz.: Stone is not like wood and wood is not like stone and both are not like iron and iron is not like both. What is common to all three is that they are potentially lethal and he killed (by wielding them), in which instance he is liable — to exclude his thrusting him into fire or water or inciting a snare against him, in which instance his (the victim's) judgment is relegated to \"Heaven.\" \"or if he hurl aught at him in prey\": (i.e.,) if he \"hunted\" him with intent to kill.",
            " (Bamidbar 35:21) \"Or if in hatred he strike him with his hand\": What is the intent of this? From \"And if with an iron implement,\" \"And if with a hand-stone,\" \"Or if with a wooden implement,\" I would think that he is liable only with these. Whence do I derive (that he is likewise liable) if he crushed, strangled, kicked, or trampled him? From \"with his hand\" — in any manner. \"The avenger shall kill the murderer\": What is the intent of this? Is it not already written (19) \"The avenger, he shall kill the murderer\"? I might think that (this obtains) only with one who has an avenger. Whence do I derive (the same for) one who does not have an avenger? From \"The avenger\" — in any event.",
            " (Bamidbar 35:22) \"And if of a sudden, without hatred, he thrust him\": to exclude (his killing) unwittingly. \"or he cast upon him some instrument, but not in prey\": without \"hunting\" or intent to kill. (22) \"Or with any stone, whereby one can die,\" \"without seeing\": to include (for exile) a blind man and one who throws (a stone) at night. R. Yehudah says: \"without seeing\": to exclude a blind man. \"and he not be his foe\": Issi b. Akiva says: We find his stringency to be his lenity, and his lenity, his stringency, viz.: You cannot make him liable for the death penalty — Perhaps he killed him unwittingly. And you cannot make him liable for exile — Perhaps he killed him wittingly. \"and he not be his foe\" (juxtaposed with [24] \"Then the congregation shall judge\"): to exclude haters from sitting in judgment. This tells me of haters. Whence do we derive the same for kin? From (24) \"between the slayer and the avenger\" (with no other \"relationship\" intervening). Whence do I derive the same for witnesses? It follows, viz.: The Torah states: Kill through (the agency of) judges, kill through witnesses. Just as judges who are (their) haters or kin are unfit (to judge in their case), so, witnesses (who are haters or kin). Furthermore, it follows a fortiori, viz.: If judges — who do not decide (the facts of the case) — haters and kin are unfit to serve (as judges), then witnesses — who decide (the facts of the case) — how much more so are haters and kin unfit to serve (as witnesses)! This tells me only of (the instance of a murderer). Whence do I derive (the same for) all other instances of the death penalty? From [the superfluous] (Ibid.) \"according to these judgments.\" This tells me only of Israelites. Whence do I derive the same for proselytes? From (Vayikra 24:22) \"for proselytes and native-born (Israelites) alike.\" This tells me only of capital cases. Whence do I derive (the same for) monetary cases? From (Ibid.) \"One (standard of) judgment shall there be for you,\" — But perhaps just as capital cases (are adjudicated) by twenty-three, so, monetary cases? It is, therefore, written (here) \"according to these (capital) judgments.\" These are (adjudicated) by twenty-three, and not monetary judgments, of which it is written (Shemot 22:8) \"Until elohim (counting three judges) shall come the dispute of both.\" And whence is it derived that capital cases (are adjudicated) by twenty-three? From (Bamidbar 35:24) \"And the congregation (ten) shall judge\" (25) And the congregation (ten) shall rescue\" — twenty all together. And whence is it derived that three are added? From (Shemot 23:2) \"Do not be after the many to do evil,\" I understand that I should be with them to do good. If so, what is the intent of (Ibid.) \"After the many (i.e., the majority to incline\" (judgment)? Let your judgment for good (i.e., acquittal) not be like your judgment for evil (i.e., incrimination). I still would not know how many, (but the Torah states: Kill by witnesses; kill by the inclination of the judges. Just as witnesses are two, so, the inclination of the judges (i.e., acquittal, is with a majority of one, and incrimination by a majority of two); and since the verdict of beth-din cannot be evenly balanced, three most be added to them (the twenty). The expounders of metaphor stated: The three \"eduyoth\" (\"congregants\") written in this section (one in [24] and two in [27]) signal that capital cases are adjudicated by thirty.",
            " (Bamidbar 35:25) \"And the congregation shall return him\": From here you learn that those who kill, either unwittingly or wittingly, repair to the cities of refuge, and beth-din send and bring them from there. One who is found liable for the death penalty is killed. One who is not found liable is let go. One who is found liable for exile is returned to his place, as it is written \"and the congregation shall return him to his city of refuge.\" \"and he shall dwell there until the death of the high-priest\": R. Meir says: A murderer shortens a man's days, and the high-priest lengthens a man's days. It is not fitting that the \"shortener\" should stand before the \"lengthener.\" Rebbi says: A murderer defiles the land and removes the Shechinah, and the high-priest causes the Shechinah to repose on the land. It is not fitting that he who defiles the land should stand before him who causes the Shechinah to repose upon the land.",
            " (Bamidbar 35:26) \"And if the murderer go beyond the border of the city of refuge … (27) the avenger may slay the murderer\": R. Elazar b. Azaryah said: If under the measure of punishment, the lesser (of the two measures), one who steps one step (beyond the permitted limits) is liable for his soul, then under the measure of reward, the greater, how much more so (is his soul ennobled by an \"extra step\" for a mitzvah)! (37) \"And the avenger find him\": any man (i.e., not only the literal \"blood-avenger,\" his kin). (38) \"For in the city of his refuge shall he dwell\": whence it is derived: If one killed in that city (to which he had been exiled), he is exiled from one neighborhood (in that city) to another. And a Levite (who lives in a city of refuge) is exiled from that city to another. \"and after the death of the high-priest, the slayer shall return to the land of his holding\": but not to his (previous high) position. These are the words of R Yehudah. R. Meir says: even to his position."

            " (Bamidbar 35:29) \"And these shall be for you a statute of judgment\": to obtain throughout the generations\": in Eretz Yisrael and outside of it. (30) \"Whoever would kill a soul, by the testimony of witnesses shall he kill the slayer\": What is the intent of this? From (19) \"The avenger, he shall kill him,\" I might think that he may kill him in beth-din without witnesses. It is, therefore, written \"Whoever would kill a soul, by the testimony of witnesses, etc.\" He kills him only in beth-din and by witnesses. \"and one witness shall not testify against a soul to have him put to death\": (but) he can testify towards acquittal. And one witness can testify towards (imposing) an oath. \"and one witness\": This is a prototype, viz.: Wherever \"witness\" is written, two are understood, unless \"one\" is specified. (31) \"And you shall not take ransom for the soul of a murderer\": What is the intent of this? From (Shemot 21:30) \"When ransom is set for him\" (one whose ox killed a man), I might think that just as \"redemption\" is given for those subject to death at the hands of Heaven, so, is it given for those liable to death by man (i.e., beth-din). It is, therefore, written \"And you shall not take ransom.\" R. Yoshiyah says: If one were taken out to be executed and he injured others, he is liable. If others injured him, they are not liable for (injuring) his person, (for he is considered \"dead\"), but they are liable for (damage to) his property. Whence is this derived? From \"And you shall not take ransom,\" (indicating that he is regarded as \"dead.\") — But perhaps this obtains even if his verdict has not yet been consummated? It is, therefore, written \"who is liable to die.\" Until his verdict has been consummated, he (i.e., one who injures him) is liable. Once his verdict has been consummated, he is not liable. R. Yonathan says: If one were being taken out to be executed, and another came forward and killed him, he is not liable. Even if his verdict has not yet been consummated? It is, therefore, written \"until he is liable to die.\" Until his verdict has been consummated, he (i.e., one who kills him) is liable. Once his verdict has been consummated, he is not liable.",
            " (Bamidbar 35:32) \"And you shall not take ransom for one who fled to the city of his refuge, etc.\": If one killed unwittingly, I might think that if he gave money (i.e., \"ransom\"), he would not be exiled. It is, therefore, written \"And you shall not take ransom for one who has fled, etc.\"",
            " (Bamidbar 35:33) \"Velo tachanifu the land\": This is an exhortation against flatterers (\"chanafim\"). Variantly: Do not cause the land to \"flatter\" you (i.e., not to produce fruit). \"ki hadam hu yachanif eth ha'aretz\": Rabbi Yoshiyah interpreted this acronymically, viz.: \"ki hadam hu yachon af ba'aretz\" (\"for the blood will repose wrath upon the land.\" \"and the land will not have atonement.\" What is the intent of this? Because it is written (Devarim 21:4) \"and they shall break there the neck of the heifer in the river-bed,\" I might think that if its neck were broken and afterwards the murderer were found, it would effect atonement. It is, therefore, written \"and the land will not have atonement.\" We are hereby taught that the spilling of blood defiles the land and removes the Shechinah. And because of the spilling of blood the Temple was destroyed.",
            " Once, the Cohanim of equal station were running up the ramp (to perform the sacrifice), when one of them caught up with the other in his four ells, took his knife, and thrust it into his heart. R. Tzaddok ascended the steps of the Temple hall and said: It is written (Devarim 21:1) \"If there be found a slain one on the earth, etc.\" Come and let us measure for whom it is incumbent to bring the heifer (of the broken neck) — the Temple or the azarah (the Temple court) — whereupon all of the people burst into tears. After that the father of the young Cohein came and said to them: \"My brothers, let him be your atonement. My son is still palpitating and the (sacrificial) knife has not become unclean\" — whereby we are taught that the defilement of knives was of more moment to them than the spilling of blood. And thus is it written (II Kings 21:16) \"And Menasheh also shed very much innocent blood until it filled Jerusalem from mouth to mouth.\"",
            "        (Bamidbar 35:34) \"in whose midst I dwell\": Beloved are Israel, for even when they are tamei the Shechinah reposes among them — (Vayikra 16:16) \"who dwells with them in the midst of their uncleanliness,\" and (Ibid. 15:31) \"… when they defile My sanctuary which is in their midst,\" and (Bamidbar 5:3) \"and they shall not make unclean their camps in whose midst I dwell.\" (Ibid. 35:34) \"for I the L-rd dwell in the midst of the children of Israel.\" R. Nathan says: Beloved are Israel, for wherever they are exiled the Shechinah is with them. They were exiled to Egypt — the Shechinah was with them, viz. (I Samuel 2:27) \"Did I not reveal Myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt (enslaved to) the house of Pharaoh?\" They were exiled to Bavel — the Shechinah was with them, viz. (Isaiah 43:14) \"Because of you I was sent to Bavel.\" They were sent to Eilam — the Shechinah was with them, viz. (Jeremiah 49:38) \"I placed My throne in Eilam, and banished from there king and officers.\" They were exiled to Edom — the Shechinah was with them, viz. (Isaiah 63:1) \"Who is  This, who comes from Edom, with sullied vestments, from Batzrah?\" And when they return, the Shechinah will be with them, viz. (Devarim 30:3) \"Then the L-rd your G-d will return with your captivity and He will have mercy upon you.\" It is not written \"and He will return to you,\" but \"and He will return with you!\" And it is written (Song of Songs 4:8) \"With Me from the Levanon, My bride — with Me from the Levanon shall you come. You will look from the top of Amanah, from the top of Senir and Chermon, from the dens of lions, from the mountains of leopards.\"  Rebbi says: An analogy: A king says to his servant: Why do you search for me? I am with my son. Whenever you need me, I am with my son. \"For I, the L-rd dwell in the midst of the children of Israel.\""
