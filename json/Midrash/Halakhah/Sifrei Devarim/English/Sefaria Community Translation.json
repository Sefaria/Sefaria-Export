            "1. Eleven days from Horev via Mt. Seir to Kadesh Barnea - and is it really an eleven-day journey to Kivrot Hataavah, and from Kivrot Hataavah to Hatzerot? It is no more than a three-day journey, as it says (Numbers 10:33), \"They went from the mountain of the Lord three days' journey\"! Rabbi Yehudah says: \"And did Israel walk an eleven-day journey in three days? It is in fact a forty-day journey, as it says regarding Elijah (1 Kings 19:8) 'He arose and ate and drank; and with the strength from that meal he walked forty days and forty nights as far as the mountain of God at Horev'! After he said it was impossible, go back to the first matter.\""

            "\"<i>The LORD will dislodge</i>\" - The LORD dislodges and no one of flesh and blood can dislodge. \"<i>All [] nations</i>\" Shall I understand it according to its meaning!? Read \"<i>These.</i>\" I only have [proof for] \"These nations\", from where [can it be proven] to include their allies? Read \"<i>These.</i>\" [The <i>heh</i> in <i>ha'eleh</i> is the proof.] \"<i>Before you.</i>\" - You will be gradually growing, and they will be gradually shrinking. So it says (Exodus 23:30) \"<i>I will drive them out before you little by little . . .\", \"I will not drive them out before you in a single year.\"</i> The Words of Rabbi Yitzhak.",
            "Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah said, since Israel are righteous, why are they afraid of the wild animals? Was it not already said (Job 5:23) \"<i>For you will have a pact with the rocks in the field, And the beasts of the field will be your allies.</i>\" If you say, why did Joshua toil so much? Rather it was because Israel sinned that it was decreed upon them, \"<i>I will drive them out before you little by little.</i>\"",
            "\"<i>You will dispossess nations greater and more numerous than you.</i>\" - Greater in height, and more numerous in strength. \"<i>Than you.</i>\" - Even you are great and numerous, but they are greater [in height] than you. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says, a parable to a person who says, \"Joe Shmoe is strong.\" But [the speaker] is himself strong. [What did he mean when he said] this one is strong? That this one is stronger than him.",
            "Another explanation of \"<i>Than you.</i>\" - Why is it said again? Wasn't it already said, \"<i>Seven [nations] greater and more numerous than you.</i>\" What is the text teaching with \"<i>Than you</i>\"? It teaches that the Amorites, one of the seven nations, was great and strong enough to match all of Israel. So it says (Amos 2:9)\"<i>Yet I Destroyed the Amorite before them, Whose stature was like the cedar’s. And who was stout as the oak.</i>\""
