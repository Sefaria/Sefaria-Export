                    "\"Based on the verse, 'You shall not touch any holy thing' (Leviticus 12:4), one might think this prohibition even applies to tithes. The verse clarifies, 'And you shall not come into the sanctuary.' Just as the sanctuary is entered only after sunset, so too holy things are only approached after sunset. I might think this applies even to the 'most holy' items, but the text says, 'You shall not touch any holy thing.' I argue, just as the sanctuary is only entered after sunset, so too holy items are only approached after sunset. Or, just as the sanctuary does not admit those lacking atonement, so too holy items do not admit them. These are the holy items of the sanctuary. I also include the holy items of the border areas, which are only approached after sunset. Why exclude tithes? Because they can be consumed by someone who immersed that day but hasn't yet seen sunset. The implication of 'You shall not touch any holy thing' only applies to a woman who has given birth. When the verse says, 'And the LORD spoke to Moses saying,' it adds [implications]. I argue, just as a woman who gives birth becomes impure by touch and by carrying, so too I include all those who become impure by touch and by carrying, similar to her, as it says 'Command the children of Israel' to include those impure by touch but not by carrying. The implication is only for someone who became impure outside, they should not enter inside. But someone who became impure inside should not exit outside. You said, 'Command the children of Israel and they shall send out of the camp.' 'And they shall send' implies a positive command, but where is the negative command? You said, 'And they shall not defile their camps.' And from where do we know that if they unintentionally do so, they bring a sin offering? You said, 'Or when a person touches any unclean thing... and he brings his guilt offering to the LORD for his sin...' (Leviticus 5:6). One might think that even someone who contracts light impurity in the market must bring a sin offering. And where is the positive and negative command concerning someone who becomes impure and enters the sanctuary unintentionally? And from where do we know that if they do so intentionally, they are liable to karet (divine punishment)? You said, 'And the man who shall be unclean...' (Numbers 19:20). The implication is only for someone who was not sprinkled at all, but I include someone who was sprinkled but did not wait the required time, or was sprinkled and waited but did not immerse, or further, was sprinkled, waited, immersed, but did not wait for sunset, or further still, was sprinkled, waited, immersed, waited for sunset, but did not bring his atonement offering. All of them are liable under positive and negative commands, liable to bring a sin offering, and liable to karet. 'And they shall send' - an impure person should be sent away, an impure corpse from the place of someone who immersed that day, or from the place of those lacking atonement. 'And they shall send' - a discharge should be sent away from the place of an impure corpse. 'And they shall send' - a leper should be sent away from the place of discharge. One might think all of them should be sent outside of one camp, but you said, 'Command the children of Israel and they shall send out of the camp,' which adds a camp here. 'Outside the camp you shall send them,' adding two camps here. 'And they shall not defile their camps,' adding three camps here. One might think all of them should be sent outside of three camps, but it's possible they are divided, this one to this place, and this one to that place. The most severe of all of them is sent outside of three camps, which is the leper. Discharge outside of two camps, and an impure corpse outside of one camp. From here, the sages instituted barriers and said there are ten levels of sanctity. The land of Israel is holier than all other lands. And what is its sanctity? From it we bring the omer offering, the two loaves, and the first fruits, which we don't bring from all other lands. The land of Canaan is holier than the land across the Jordan, as the land of Canaan is fit for the Divine Presence and the land across the Jordan is not. Walled cities are holier than the rest of the land because lepers can go everywhere in the land but cannot enter walled cities. Jerusalem is holier than walled cities because lesser holy items and the second tithe can be eaten in Jerusalem but not in walled cities. The Temple Mount is holier than Jerusalem because those with genital discharges can enter Jerusalem but not the Temple Mount. The Women's Courtyard is holier than the Temple Mount because someone who immersed that day can enter the Temple Mount but not the Women's Courtyard. The Israelites' Courtyard is holier than the Women's Courtyard because those lacking atonement can enter the Women's Courtyard but not the Israelites' Courtyard. Israelites who have waited for sunset can enter the Priests' Courtyard on a width of eleven cubits and a length of 135, but they cannot stand on the platform. And the Levites stood on the platform but did not enter further from here. And priests with blemishes, with unkempt hair, and who drank wine would enter further from here, but they did not enter between the vestibule and the altar, and not to the vestibule, and not to the hall, and not around the altar by four cubits. And the rest of the priests entered the vestibule, the hall, and around the altar by four cubits. But they did not enter the Holy of Holies. And the high priest entered the Holy of Holies four times on Yom Kippur. Rabbi Yosi says in five things, between the vestibule and the altar is equivalent to the hall because one with unkempt hair, or who drank wine, or who did not wash their hands and feet, cannot enter there. And just as they withdraw from the hall during the incense offering, so too they withdrew from between the vestibule and the altar during the incense offering. Abba Shaul says the attic was holier than all of them because they only went up there if they had a need. Rabbi Judah says the roof was holier than the attic because they only went up there once every three years to fix it.",
                    "All are crows: lepers, this is a definite leper, all lepers, this is an uncertain leper, discharge, this is a definite discharge, all discharge, this includes a discharge that saw two sightings, and all discharge, this includes a discharge that saw one sighting.",
                    "All lepers and all discharge and all impure to a corpse, one might think that I only have this sending away applied to a person who can be sent away, but when it says 'impure,' this includes vessels that touch a corpse. All impure, this includes vessels that touch a creeping creature. And all impure, this includes all other impurities that will see before the festival.",
                    "Speak to the children of Israel, this includes walled cities.

And if they ate, they are exempt.",

Regarding the sin itself, one confesses when the sin offering is still available and not after it has been slaughtered. The implication is that an individual's confession is only for entering the Temple. But how do we include other commandments? It says, 'Speak and they shall confess.' And how do we include even death penalties and karets (cutting off)? It says, 'Their sin offering, their sin.' Every sin offering, this includes a negative commandment; when they do, this includes a positive commandment. The implication is that confession is only for an individual. How do we include even for the community? It says, 'Speak and they shall confess.'",

Can it be even those executed based on conspiring witnesses? It says, 'And that soul.'"

                    "And all the heave offerings of all the holy things of the children of Israel\" — this includes other unspecified holy items that are not explicitly mentioned in this context. And which do I include? The challah (a portion of dough set aside), the devoted things, the skins, the firstborns, the redemption of the firstborn son, and the redemption of the firstborn donkey. And from where do you say that a person is permitted to give his holy things to one specific priest? It says, \"Which they will present to the priest, it shall be his.\" Rabban Gamliel made a logical deduction before Rabbi Akiva: \"And if in a matter in which I have no portion, if you give it to me, it is mine; in a matter in which I have a portion, if you give it to me, won't it be mine?\" Rabbi Akiva said to him, \"No, if you say in a matter in which you have no portion, if you give it to me, it is mine, since no one else has a portion with you in it. Will you say in a matter in which you have a portion, if you give it to me, it is mine, since someone else does have a portion with you in it?\" Rabban Gamliel said, \"And if in a woman in which I have no portion, if I betroth her to me, she is mine. I have the right to annul her vows, and no one else can prohibit her [from marrying another] on my behalf.\" Rabbi Akiva said to him, \"No, if you say in a woman in which you have no portion, if you betroth her to you, she is yours, and you have the right to annul her vows, and no one else can prohibit her on your behalf, since no one else has a portion with you in her. Will you say in a matter in which you have a portion, if you give it to me, it is mine, since someone else does have a portion with you in it?\" It says, \"Whatever man gives to the priest, it shall be his."

The verse says, \"Whatever man gives to the priest, it shall be his.\" Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Shimon said, \"This was the teaching of Rabbi Akiva until Mazifrin came. Once Mazifrin came, he said to me whether Yehoyariv takes the money or Yedayah takes the money. For instance, one who gave money to Yehoyariv and did not manage to bring the ram before Yedayah took over; you might think he can take the money from Yehoyariv and return it to Yedayah.

They are not valid if done through non-Jews or through residents (non-Israelite inhabitants of the land). \"Or children of Israel\" — this excludes converts. But you said, \"Any man\" to include converts. \"And his brother's wife has gone astray from her husband\" — after her husband's death, he becomes jealous because of a positive commandment. And from where do we know this is the case for negative commandments? Because it was said, \"And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying.\" But this still implies only his wife, who is married to him, for jealousy. From where do we extend this to include his betrothed or his brother's wife, or any woman associated with him for marriage? Because it was said, \"saying\" and \"And say unto them.\" Since it was said, \"And the man shall bring his wife to the priest,\" a man makes her drink, but a court doesn't make her drink, or a man becomes jealous, but a court doesn't become jealous. It was said, \"Israel\" and \"becomes jealous\" to include a court that they may become jealous. From here they said: The court acts on behalf of those whose husband became deaf, insane, is in another country, or is imprisoned. Not to make her drink, but rather to disqualify her from her marriage contract. \"The man and becomes jealous\" — to include his neighbor, that he may become jealous for him.",

What is taught by the prohibition that he imposes on her? If she has relations with any man prohibited to her, she immediately becomes prohibited to her husband. You might think this also applies to the prohibition she imposes on him. If he has relations with any woman prohibited to him, his wife should become prohibited and not permitted to him. The verse teaches, \"his wife\" — only his wife becomes prohibited to him, not her close relatives. [I would exclude her close relatives, but wouldn't exclude her maidservant or sister.

You mentioned \"a man's emission,\" implying the time it takes for a man's emission. How much is concealment? The time required for impurity. How much is impurity? The time required for intercourse. How much is intercourse? The time it takes for a palm tree to return to its upright position, according to Rabbi Ishmael. Rabbi Eliezer says the time it takes to mix a cup. Rabbi Joshua says the time it takes to drink it. Ben Azzai says the time it takes to roast an egg. Rabbi Akiva says the time it takes to swallow it. Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says the time it takes to swallow three eggs consecutively. Rabbi Elazar ben Pinchas says the time it takes to tie a thread to a spindle. Plimo says the time it takes to stretch out her hand and take a loaf from the basket.

                    "\"And a witness\" — who is qualified to testify. And from where do we know even a witness who is not qualified to testify? The verse says \"witness\" and \"witness.\" From here they said: If one witness says, \"I saw her become impure,\" she would not drink [the bitter water], and furthermore, even a slave or a maidservant, these are believed to disqualify her from her marriage contract, she does not drink, and she becomes forever forbidden to her husband.",
                    "\"And she became defiled\" — Rabbi Akiva says, why does the verse mention \"defiled\" three times? [It teaches] she is defiled to her husband, defiled to her lover, and defiled for eating terumah (priestly gift)."

Just as the \"reminder\" mentioned below is for salvation and benefit, so too the \"reminder\" mentioned here is for salvation and benefit. You might think that even if she did not sin [this applies].

One might argue that a priest shouldn't have the right to initiate the procedure. For example, if a woman was taken captive (and therefore might have been defiled), she is temporarily forbidden to an Israelite, but she is perpetually forbidden to an ordinary priest. Similarly, a woman deemed mentally unstable (shoteh) is temporarily forbidden to an Israelite. So, shouldn't she be perpetually forbidden to a priest? The Torah uses the terms \"man\" or \"a man\" to include a priest and a eunuch, emphasizing that they too can initiate the Sotah procedure.",

The Torah states, \"And the priest shall do unto her according to this entire law\", emphasizing that these actions alone are sufficient for the procedure."

From where do we derive that the woman too bears the responsibility for the sin? It is stated, \"And that woman shall bear her iniquity.\" Rabbi Yehuda says: If she drank and was found to be impure, her husband need not be concerned that she might have secretly sinned another time and became impure without his knowledge. As it's written, \"But the man will be free from guilt.\" - Rabbi Chalfta says: If a woman drank the water and had merits on her side, these merits will protect her temporarily. But from where do we derive that eventually, she will be examined after some time? It is stated, \"And that woman shall bear her iniquity.\" Rabbi Shimon says: There was a desecration of God's name in this matter because if the water did not examine her immediately, when she would leave the Temple, she might say to her friends, \"Do not refrain from sinning. I already drank, and the waters did not harm me,\" giving the impression that the waters are ineffective. Therefore, it is stated, \"And that woman shall bear her iniquity\" — immediately."

                    "Verse from the Torah: \"ויהי העם\" (And the people were) Midrash commentary: \"The word 'ויהי' (And it was) indicates something that they did not have initially. It teaches that they were accustomed to being corrupted and returned to their initial corruption. Similarly, it is said, 'And there was that man, Job, great' (Job 1:3). 'ויהי' (And it was) indicates something that they did not have initially, namely, good deeds. Likewise, it is said, 'And there was a certain man from Ramathaim Zophim' (1 Samuel 1:1). 'ויהי' (And it was) indicates something that they did not have initially, and here also it indicates something that they did not have initially, as it teaches that they were accustomed to being corrupted and returned to their initial corruption. 'העם' (The people) indicates wicked individuals, as it is stated, 'I have seen this People, and indeed, they are a stiff-necked people' (Exodus 32:9). But when it says 'My people,' 'עמי' (My people) refers to the righteous, as it is stated, 'Send forth My people, and they shall serve Me' (Exodus 7:16).                                                    'Met'ananinim' (murmuring) refers to those who seek trouble. How can one separate from the Divine presence? It is said about Jehoram the son of Ahab, 'Only know and see that trouble has come from the Lord' (2 Kings 6:33). Likewise, it is said about Samson, 'For he sought an occasion against the Philistines' (Judges 14:4)             Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says that 'met'ananinim' (murmuring) refers to those who mock, as it is stated, 'The words of a mocker are like playful blows' (Proverbs 26:22). But a knife descended from heaven and cleaved their bellies, as it is stated, 'And they fell out of the belly' (Jonah 1:15)                                                                                    Rabbi Shimon says that 'met'ananinim' (murmuring) refers to those who complain, as it is stated, 'I have not eaten from it in my mourning' (Deuteronomy 26:14). 'Like met'ananinim' (like complainers) indicates something evil. 'Ra' (evil) refers to idol worship, as it is stated, 'When you do what is evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke Him through the work of your hands' (Deuteronomy 31:29).\"",
                    "Verse from the Torah: \"באזני יי\" (In the ears of the Lord) Midrash commentary: It teaches that they intended to make their words heard by God. A parable can illustrate this. It is similar to someone who stands in the marketplace and curses the king. When the king passes by, he tells him to be silent so that the king doesn't hear. The person says to him, \"Who told you that I intended only to make him hear?\" Similarly, the Israelites intended to make their voices heard by God. And the Lord heard, and His anger was kindled. His wrath was aroused against them, and fire descended from heaven and consumed them with the fire of one hand, and it went back and forth among them. There was nothing between the living and the dead, as it is stated, 'And he stood between the dead and the living' (Numbers 17:13).\"",

As it says, \"And the fire of the Lord burned among them.\" From here you learn that anyone who speaks ill of their fellow in secret has no remedy, as it is stated, \"You slander your own kin; you smear your brother's reputation. These things you have done and I have been silent; you thought that I was one just like yourself. But now I rebuke you and lay the charge before you\" (Psalm 50:20-21). Fire descended from heaven twelve times: six were for praise, and these are the first one on the eighth day, the second one for Gideon, the third one for Manoah, the fourth one in the days of David, as it says, \"He called upon the Lord, and He answered him with fire from heaven\" (1 Chronicles 21:26), the fifth one in the days of Solomon, as it says, \"And fire came down from heaven\" (2 Chronicles 7:3), the sixth one on Mount Carmel, and six for disgrace, and these are the first one for Nadab and Abihu, the second one for those who spoke derogatorily, the third one for Korah, the fourth one in the days of Job, as it says, \"And fire of God fell from heaven\" (Job 1:16), the fifth and sixth ones in the days of Elijah when messengers of Ahaziah came to him.",
