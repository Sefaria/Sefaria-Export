            "God gathered the dust [of the first human] from the four corners of the world - red, black, white and green. Red is the blood, black is the inards and green for the body. Why from the four corners of the earth? So that if one comes from the east to the west and arrives arrives at the end of his life as he nears departing from the world, it will not be said to him, \"This land is not the dust of your body, it's of mine. Go back to where you were created.\" Rather, every place that a person walks, from there he was created and from there he will return.\" "
