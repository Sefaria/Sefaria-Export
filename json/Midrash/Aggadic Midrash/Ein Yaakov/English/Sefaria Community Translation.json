And I saw two crevices in the ground from which smoke issued. I took a piece of wool, wetted it with water, put it on my spear, placed it in the crevice, and when 1 took it out it was singed. And the merchant said to me: 'Listen! what do you hear?' And I heard them saying : 'Moses and his Torah are true, and we are liars.' The merchant said to me : 'Each thirtieth day of the month, Gehenna turns them over here, as flesh is turned over in the pot. and they say Moses and his Torah are true, and we are liars.' \" "
