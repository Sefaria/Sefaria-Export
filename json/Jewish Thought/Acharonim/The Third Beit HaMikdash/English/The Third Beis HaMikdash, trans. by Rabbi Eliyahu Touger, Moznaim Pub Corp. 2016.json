        "Introduction": [
            "God told the prophet Yechez­kel:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yechezkel</i> 43:10-11.</i>",
            "You, son of man, describe the House to the House of Israel so that they be ashamed of their sins; let them measure its outline. If they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the design of the House, and its form, its exits, its entrances, its entire design, and all its ordinances, and all its shapes, and all its laws; and write it before their eyes so that they will preserve its entire design and all its ordinances, and carry them out.",
            "God commanded the prophet to tell the Jewish people to measure out the entire plan and reckoning for the building of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> so that they would remember its design in their hearts lest <i>Mashiach</i> come on this day and there will be no one to build it – no one aware of the dimensions and details of how to build the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>. <i>Rashi</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Rashi</i>, <i>ibid.:</i>11.</i> interprets the charge in the same manner, commenting on the words, “they will preserve”: “They should study the details of the measures so they will know how to apply them in the Ultimate Future.”",
            "The verse repeats the phrase, וכל צורתיו, “its entire design.” The second time that phrase is mentioned, <i>Rashi</i> writes, “this is not explained.” It is possible that the intent is to refer to a design of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> that could actually be pictured, and from which a blueprint could be drawn according to its dimensions. Such a picture would be a preface to understanding the subject matter.",
            "Similarly, Rav Yitzchak Abarbanel<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Abarbanel, ibid.:</i>11.</i> appears to say that the prophet was commanded to make a clearly apparent design. Abarbanel explaines that the verse relates that the prophet was commanded to describe four aspects of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>: “the design of the House, and its form, its exits, and its entrances.” These four features parallel four ways that all concepts can be understood. The first approach he mentions is to understand the subject matter in a manner that is almost tangible. This mode of understanding it alluded to with the words, “the design of the House.” Abarbanel also explains that the phrase, “its entire design,” is stated twice to reflect two different ways of understanding. The first time the phrase is used refers to comprehension in an apparent manner, and the second time refers to the basic understanding of the material. Both are forms that are easily comprehensible without deep analysis. From his words as a whole, it can be understood that the prophet was commanded to explain the <i>Beis HaMikdash’s</i> layout in a way that can be visualized.",
            "<i>Radak</i> offers a similar explanation on the words “the design of the House,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Radak, ibid.:10</i>.</i> stating: “They should measure the design of the form of the House, preparing it as a sign, for it will be constructed in this manner in the Ultimate Future at the time of the coming of the Redeemer<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Mashiach.</i></i> and the Resurrection of the Dead. It should be prepared as a sign, for those who visualize this design will live in this House in the Ultimate Future.” And in his commentary on the words,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Radak, Yechezkel</i> 43:11.</i> “and carry them out,” <i>Radak</i> writes that this vision is “a great proof of the Resurrection of the Dead.”",
            "This promise was not only given to Yechez­kel’s generation. After all, why should we of the future generations be denied? Rather, it is a promise of a general nature to anyone who preserves and measures the design as detailed, and who does not live to see the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> rebuilt, that he will merit to be resurrected and to apply his studies in practice in the Ultimate Future. For even though the prophets’ promises were addressed to the people of their time, their messages were also intended for all the future generations who would follow them and who would continue to relate the message until the final generation. This prophecy was stated in the present tense, to promise God’s goodness at an earlier time, thus hastening its realization were the people to merit. Moreover, that tense is appropriate because it is as if God’s words and His promise were already realized and applied from the time they were uttered. <i>Rashi</i> explains this in several places,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Rashi, Shmos</i> 15:1, <i>Yirmeyahu</i> 6:19.</i> when commenting on the fact that prophets often use the past tense rather than the future when relating their prophecies.",
            "Similarly, the <i>Midrash Yilamdeinu</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Another name for <i>Midrash Tanchuma.</i> A teaching similar to that cited above is found in <i>Midrash Tanchuma, Parshas Tzav,</i> sec. 14 and also in <i>Yalkut Shimoni, Yechezkel,</i> sec. 382.</i> comments on the verse, “Son of man, describe the House to the House of Israel,” saying: When the Holy One, blessed be He, revealed the vision to Yechez­kel and showed him the design of the House, its form, and its exits, He commanded him to relate this vision to the House of Israel.",
            "Yechez­kel protested, saying: “My Master, can they build it now as [implied by] Your words, ‘They will preserve its entire design… and carry them out’?”",
            "God answered him, “No, [they cannot build it at present]. Nevertheless, even though they do not build it now, let them study the design of the House and I will consider it as if they were occupied in its construction.”",
            "And the <i>Pesikta</i> states:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Pesikta Rabesi,</i> sec. 16.</i> “Shmuel<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One of the leading Sages of the Talmud.</i> comments on the verse: ‘If they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the design of the House’: Is there a design of the House at present? The intent is that the Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘since you are involved in the study of its construction, it is as if you are involved in its construction.’ ”",
            "The expression, “you are involved in its construction,” warrants an explanation. God did not say, “You are building it,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Significantly, the standard published text of the <i>Pesikta</i> states, “you are building it.” Nevertheless, the word cited by the <i>Tosafos Yom Tov</i> is found in <i>Yalkut Shimoni, loc. cit.</i> See <i>Likkutei Sichos,</i> Vol. 18, pp. 412, 419 which discusses this point.</i> because that would imply building the structure in its entirety. “Involved in its construction,” by contrast, implies building a portion of it, for there are aspects of this building that are enigmatic, and not explicitly explained. Thus <i>Radak,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Radak, Yechezkel</i> 40:13.</i> when describing the measure of the cells around the gate and the chambers of the Sanctuary, quotes our Sages’ statement, “Certain aspects of this prophecy will be interpreted by the prophet Eliyahu in the future,” implying that we are unable to interpret these details at present.",
            "It is true that this quote was stated in the Talmud<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Menachos</i> 45a.</i> regarding the sacrifices mentioned in Yechez­kel’s prophecies, and was not made regarding the structure of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>. Nevertheless, <i>Radak</i> associated this statement with other enigmatic passages in Yechez­kel’s prophecies because they too are not explicit and could be interpreted in several ways. We are thus forced to say that Eliyahu will also explain these passages in the future.",
            "Similarly, <i>Rambam</i> in the first chapter of his <i>Hilchos Beis HaBechirah</i> writes:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Mishhneh Torah, Hilchos Beis HaBechirah</i> 1:4.</i> “[The design of] the building that will be constructed in the Future, though mentioned in <i>Yechez­kel</i>, is not explicit or explained.” Based on these ideas, in the passage cited above Shmuel used the expression, “are involved in its construction,” i.e., building parts of the structure, for it is impossible to understand the entire design. However, by studying Yechez­kel’s prophecy, and understanding those aspects of the structure of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> that are clear, it will be considered as if the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> was constructed in its entirety.",
            "Even if one would dispute this interpretation and say that Shmuel used the expression, “are involved in its construction,” because it parallels the initial clause in his statement, “involved in the study of its construction,” the concept stated is true. If it were not said, it would be worthy to say it, for it is a logical conclusion: Only when one understands the structure can it be considered as if it was built, for how can one build if one does not understand? Therefore, I based this concept on the wording of the <i>Midrash.</i>",
            "It can be derived from the above discussion that our study of the design of the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> must involve thorough and precise understanding. If not, it would be sufficient to merely read about it. Were that the case, one could read Yechez­kel’s description in its entirety, even those portions that are not understood. Why then would it not be considered as if one built the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> in its entirety? Instead, the concept is as explained above.",
            "This can also be understood from the term, “involved in its study,” used in the <i>Pesikta</i> cited above. Shmuel does not say that his listeners should “read about it,” i.e. peruse Yechez­kel’s prophecy regarding the structure of the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>. Rather, Shmuel states that his listeners should be “involved in its study,” implying that they should make a laborious effort to understand the details of the Future structure. This same message is implied by the wording of the blessing recited before Torah study.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Bach, Orach Chayim</i> 47:3.</i> Such precise understanding is also implied by the prophet’s words, who speaks of “measuring.”",
            "After these words of truth I, who am young of years, and who laps up the words of the wise, after reading the call which God sounded in the ears of the prophet to “describe the House to the House of Israel so that they be ashamed of their sins [and] let them measure its outline” took this call to heart. Perhaps I have the potential to understand some aspect of the vision. Conscious that “the task is not ours to complete, nor may we neglect it,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Avos</i> 2:16.</i> and after reviewing twice and a third time, the words of <i>Rashi,</i> the most prominent of commentators, I realized that it would be very valuable to make a design with an encompassing picture, that would be “a remembrance between my eyes,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Shmos</i> 13:9.</i> as we were commanded, as explained above. When some of my noble contemporaries saw my picture, they implored me to engrave it with a pen of iron and lead<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Iyov</i> 19:24; i.e., to commit the work to print.</i> so that it will endure for an extended time,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Yirmeyahu</i> 32:14.</i> until the end of time, acquiring for me the merit of the many. For when ten enter the House of Study, none turn to Yechez­kel’s vision of the House, because of the difficulty of understanding his prophecies.",
            "I said to myself, I will not withhold good from its owners.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Mishlei</i> 3:27.</i> Nor have I entered beyond my limits and positioned myself among the great,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Devarim Rabbah</i> 2:7.</i> for I have not taken upon myself to develop new concepts. I have only attempted to explain the words of the commentaries, since their intent was not to obscure, but to explain. My intent was to communicate their interpretation in a manner that is easy to comprehend. Thus no one can protest that I have sought a place to buttress<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Chulin</i> 7a. This expression is often used in Rabbinic works to imply the development of a <i>chidush,</i> a novel insight.</i> beyond my capacity.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The literal meaning of the words is “the finger of one [who could do such a task] is thicker than my loins” (cf. <i>I Melachim</i> 12:10).</i> Everything is clearly open before you. I know that there is no necessity for what I have done here, my handiwork was only for the youth of the Jewish people. No reader should think that I [undertook this project] for my honor or for the honor of my father’s house.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Taanis</i> 20a.</i> I only undertook this project in response to the sincere requests of the friends who listen<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Shir HaShirim</i> 8:13.</i> to the reader’s voice asking to accept the truth from the one who utters it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Rambam, Shemoneh Perakim,</i> Commentary on the <i>Mishnah,</i> Introduction to Tractate <i>Avos.</i></i>",
            "With the above words, I have fulfilled my obligations to remove any complaints and to reply by showing the reader my work, and revealing what I have done. I have already faithfully acknowledged that I will structure my commentary according to that of <i>Rashi,</i> the most prominent of the commentators, for his commentary reflects the teachings of the <i>Mishnah</i> that describe the building of the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>.",
            "We have found in the works of our Sages three instances where Yechez­kel’s vision was preserved:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Tosafos Yom Tov</i>, Introduction to Tractate <i>Middos.</i></i> the wicket entrances at the sides of the Gate of the Sanctuary,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Middos</i> 4:2; <i>Tamid</i> 3:7.</i> the measurements of the Altar,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Middos</i> 3:1.</i> and the unroofed courtyards.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i> 2:5.</i> We find a similar concept in the works of <i>Radak,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Radak, Yechezkel</i> 40:5.</i> with regard to the eastern wall of the Courtyard of the <i>Beis HaMikdash,</i> as we will explain in our description of that structure, with God’s help.",
            "Similarly, <i>Rambam</i> writes in the first chapter of <i>Hilchos Beis HaBechirah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Hilchos Beis HaBechirah</i> 1:4.</i> that the people who built the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> built it “like the structure of Shlomoh and similar to what was explicit in Yechez­kel’s vision.” They did not build the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> entirely according to Yechez­kel’s vision, because – based on prophetic vision – they knew that this was not the time for that structure to be built. Similar concepts are found in <i>Rashi’s</i> commentary:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Rashi, Yechezkel</i> 43:11.</i> It was intended that the second entry into <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> led by Ezra resemble the first entry led by Yehoshua. The Jews should have come with power and with miracles, as our Sages commented<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Berachos</i> 4a.</i> on the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shmos</i> 15:16.</i> “Until Your nation crosses over.” Yechez­kel’s structure was destined for them when they ascended from the exile and their redemption was intended to be eternal, except that sin had an effect. Their repentance was not befitting.",
            "Thus, God intended for the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> to be built according to Yechez­kel’s vision, and for the Jews’ redemption to be eternal, were they to have merited this. When they did not merit this, they were not granted any license to construct the building in Yechez­kel’s vision, because the building in Yechez­kel’s vision is designated and structured for an eternal redemption. When the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> will be built according to this structure, God’s glory will dwell there forever.",
            "Accordingly, in his description of the structure of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, Yechez­kel relates the prophecy,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yechezkel</i> 43:9.</i> “I will dwell among them forever.” And when the Jewish people did not merit having the Divine presence dwell among them during the era of the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, they did not have the license to build it entirely according to Yechez­kel’s vision. Nevertheless, they included certain aspects of Yechez­kel’s vision in the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, since his vision could have been actualized at that time. Furthermore, this enabled them to prepare somewhat for the entire building to be realized, were they to merit to turn to God in proper <i>teshuvah</i>.",
            "For this reason, our Sages mentioned three instances in which the building of the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> reflected <i>Yechez­kel’s</i> vision. Significantly, these three instances were each in a separate section of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>: the Outer Courtyard,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This area was known as the <i>Ezras Nashim</i> in the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>.</i> the Inner Courtyard, and the building of the Sanctuary. These three areas parallel three sections of the Spiritual Cosmos: what is below the sphere of the moon, the <i>galgalim</i> (the heavenly spheres), and the chariot of the Throne of His Glory. The Final <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> will seamlessly connect our world with the spiritual realms so that “one will draw close to another and no [foreign and impure] spirit will pass between them.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The wording is borrowed from <i>Iyov</i> 41:8. The bracketed words “foreign and impure” are additions not found in that verse.</i> This is not the place to elaborate on this concept. Nevertheless, we see that when they built the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, they incorporated one element that resembles the ultimate and eternal <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> into each of its sections.",
            "In the Outer Courtyard, they built unroofed chambers. In the Inner Courtyard, they built the Altar, and in the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> itself, they built the wicket entrances to the gates. All of this was done to forge a connection – and to prepare for –the structure that they would build in the Future. True, other portions of the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> were also built according to Yechez­kel’s vision of the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash,</i> as will be mentioned below. Nevertheless, our Sages singled out these three items to allude to the fact that every area of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> contained one element that resembled the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>.",
            "We have focused on <i>Rashi’s</i> commentary because it reconciles the text in <i>Yechez­kel</i> with the <i>Mishnah’s</i> description of the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> to the greatest degree possible. For the [fundamental] difficulty in understanding Yechezkel's description of the structure does not stem from the structure itself, but from the fact that the prophet skips from one matter to another. Therefore, in my description, I go from gate to gate, from corner to corner, and from concept to concept according to the structure of the building. This will allow the verses to be easily understood. To cite a parallel, in his commentary to the <i>parshah, VeAtah Tetzaveh,</i> in his explanation of the charge,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shmos</i> 28:6.</i> “And they shall make the <i>ephod,” Rashi</i> writes: “Were I to explain the manner in which the <i>ephod</i> and the <i>choshen</i> were fashioned according to the order of the verses, the explanation would be fragmented…. Therefore, I will describe the manner in which they were fashioned in a way that a reader can proceed quickly, and afterwards, I will explain the verses in the order they appear in the text.”",
            "Since the order of the verses is explained in <i>Rashi’s</i> commentary, there is no need to repeat those explanations. Everything will be understood from our explanations. Nevertheless, I recorded the sources in parentheses to indicate the chapter in Scripture to which my explanations refer.",
            "I structured this text with alphanumerical markers in order.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Hebrew, each of the letters has a numerical value. The sections of the text composed by <i>Tosafos Yom Tov</i> correspond to these markers.</i> Those markers appear in the illustration of the entire structure that we composed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tosafos Yom Tov</i> made a drawing of the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> with the numbers he mentioned here. As mentioned, that design was not published in the original text of <i>Tzuras HaBayis</i>, but rather printed separately and included as an insert to the book. It is reproduced as a foldout at the end of the bookץ</i> Thus, the explanations after the section marker <i>alef</i> in this text will correspond to the marker <i>alef</i> in the illustration. The same is true with regard to the other letters.",
            "I have also recorded whatever corrections have to be made regarding the errors in <i>Rashi’s</i> commentary. I have also shifted from the description of the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> to the clarification of certain errors found in the description of the buildings constructed by King Shlomoh. For I have seen elements in the building of the House of the Forest of Lebanon<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>I Melachim</i> 7:2 and commentaries there, which discuss this building which was constructed by King Shlomoh.</i> and the bases<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.:</i>27.</i> which are difficult to understand, I will write their explanations in short.",

The literal meaning of the words in the verse is “that I raised My hand,” i.e., raised My hand in an oath.</i> Rav Yitzchak Abarbanel explains that this verse is teaching that the tribes should not complain that the land is being divided in a different manner from how it was divided originally. With the words, “as I swore to give it to their fathers,” Yechezkel is explaining that God did not swear to give the land to those who originally inherited it. Rather, God swore to give the land to the “fathers,” i.e., the Patriarchs, Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov. Hence, all the tribes have an equal share in their heritage, and all the tribes will receive an equal share in the Land.",

            "“He measured the width of the structure,” i.e., the thickness of the wall. “It was one measuring rod and its height was one measuring rod.” Thus, this was a low wall, as the <i>Mishnah</i> states with regard to the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Middos</i> 2:4.</i> “All the walls that were there were tall with the exception of the eastern wall [to enable] the <i>kohen</i> who would burn the red heifer standing on the Mount of Olives to see the entrance to the Sanctuary.” <i>Rashi</i> also interprets the above verse in this manner. True, from the simple meaning of the above verse, it is possible to understand that the wall around the entire Temple Mount was low, not only the eastern wall. Nevertheless, since the builders of the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> built their structure to correspond – at least partially – to this Future Building, as we explained at length in the introduction, it is possible to say that this verse refers only to the eastern wall. Therefore, when explaining the above verse, <i>Rashi</i> quotes this <i>mishnah</i> without making a distinction between one structure and another since it is possible to interpret the verse as corresponding to the building of the Second Temple. And indeed, the angel describing the structure to Yechezkel was standing in the east, as can be derived from the context.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yechezkel</i> 40:6 describes the angel ascending through the Eastern Gate. Thus, he would be describing the eastern wall.</i>",
            "<i>Radak</i> interprets the verse in the same manner, stating:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Radak, Yechezkel</i> 40:5.</i> The <i>mishnah</i>’s statement, “with the exception of the eastern wall,” refers to the wall around the Temple Mount. Those who ascended from exile built the structure like the vision of the structure that will be built in the Future and that was shown to Yechezkel in certain ways. True, the simple meaning of the verse is that the entire wall was low, for it did not specifically mention the eastern wall, but said simply “Its height was one measuring rod.”",
            "Rav Yitzchak Abarbanel, by contrast, maintains that the entire surrounding wall was low, stating:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Yitzchak Abarbanel, <i>Yechezkel, loc. cit.</i></i> “This was for beauty and for attractiveness so that from the outside one could see the entire building without being blocked by that wall.” It is also possible to explain this interpretation based on the rationale given by the <i>Mishnah</i> that the reason the eastern wall was low in the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> was so that the <i>kohen</i> who burnt the red heifer could see that entrance to the Sanctuary. This rationale is not relevant in the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>. To explain: Regarding the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash,</i> the <i>Mishnah</i> states:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Middos</i> 2:3.</i> “There were 12 steps leading to the Women’s Courtyard,” and the height of each of the steps was half a cubit. Thus, the Women’s Courtyard was 6 cubits higher than the entrance to the Temple Mount. There were 15 cubits to the Courtyard of the Israelites, which was above the Women’s Courtyard. Thus the Courtyard of the Israelites was 7 1/2 cubits above the Women’s Courtyard, and 13½ cubits higher than the entrance to the Temple Mount. The <i>Duchan</i> was 2½ cubits higher than the Courtyard of the Israelites. Thus, the <i>Duchan</i> was 16 cubits above the entrance to the Temple Mount. There were 12 steps from the Temple Courtyard to the <i>Ulam.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Entrance Hall to the Sanctuary.</i> Thus the <i>Ulam</i> was 6 cubits higher than the <i>Duchan</i> and 22 cubits higher than the entrance to the Temple Mount. Now, the gates to the Temple Mount were only 20 cubits high, and there was a rampart built above them. As mentioned above, the entrance to the Sanctuary was 22 cubits higher than the entrance to the Temple Mount. Thus, it was impossible to see the entrance to the <i>Ulam</i> from the east because it was blocked by the ramparts on top of the gate to the Temple Mount. Therefore the builders of the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> made the eastern wall lower.",
            "The Future <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> will have 8 steps leading to the Courtyard of the Israelites instead of 15 steps. This means that the Courtyard of the Israelites will only be 10 cubits above the Temple Mount, and the <i>Ulam</i> will only be 18 1/2 cubits above the Temple Mount. Thus, the entire structure will be 3 1/2 cubits lower, making it unnecessary to reduce the height of the eastern wall of the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Kohen Gadol</i> would burn the red heifer on the Mount of Olives (see the accompanying diagram). He is required to see the entrance to the Sanctuary when doing so. <i>Tosafos Yom Tov</i> is discussing whether it is necessary to lower the wall around the Outer Courtyard to enable him to do so.</i> Hence, we can posit that the wall around the Temple Mount was not low to enable the <i>kohen</i> burning the red heifer to see the entrance to the Sanctuary, but for another reason, as explained by Rav Yitzchak Abarbanel. According to this approach, there is no difference between the eastern wall and the walls on the other sides.",
            "Nevertheless, this interpretation has certain drawbacks. Firstly, the Altar was positioned entirely before the Sanctuary as will be explained in sec. 43. The Altar was – and will be – 9 cubits high without its horns. As we mentioned above, the <i>Ulam</i> was 6 cubits higher than the <i>Duchan</i>. Thus, the Altar will be 3 cubits higher than the steps of the <i>Ulam,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Zevachim</i> 54a.</i> and will be 21 ½ cubits above the ground at the base of the Temple Mount.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, the Altar will prevent the <i>kohen</i> from seeing the entrance to the Sanctuary.</i> Furthermore, the description of Yechezkel’s vision does not describe how many steps there were leading to the Women’s Courtyard and the <i>Ulam.</i> It is possible that the reduction of the height of the stairs to the Courtyard of the Israelites was made up by an increase in the height of the stairs to the Women’s Courtyard and the <i>Ulam</i> respectively<i>.</i> Thus the rationale mentioned by the <i>Mishnah</i> could also apply, as stated above. Therefore, the opinion of <i>Rashi</i> and <i>Radak</i> – that the verse agrees with the <i>Mishnah</i> – remains the most desirable.",

The angel would have to mark the place where the measure ended so that he could place the measuring rod there, and measure it again, repeating the process several times. Measuring the structures with the cord avoided this repetitive process. True, an angel was speaking to Yechezkel, and Yechezkel was witnessing a vision from above; there was no actual physical measuring done. Nevertheless, it can be assumed that the vision reflected the most practical way of measuring the structures. Therefore the cord was very long so that it could be used to measure even the highest structures at one time.

The walls are included in our calculation of the space between the edges of the roofs, because the roof did not cover the wall.

For this reason, <i>Kaftor VaFerach</i> maintains that there was also a gate on the western side for the Levites guarding outside that wall. According to his logic, the <i>mishnah</i> does not mention this gate in its reckoning, because it was not used as a doorway, since, as the <i>mishnah</i> states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Middos</i> 2:1.</i> little use was made of the western area of the Temple Mount.

For this reason, the Greek kings broke through this barrier when they entered the <i>Beis HaMikdash:</i> because its purpose was to create a separation, distancing them from the area with greater sanctity.

Firstly, it appears that non-Jews were given this place on the Temple Mount with the consent of the Jews and their Sages, not against their will. Moreover, at a time when non-Jews exercised authority over the Temple Mount, who would stop them and prevent them from proceeding further than the Women’s Courtyard? Indeed, this is not what Rav Yitzchak Abarbanel meant. He merely mentioned that non-Jews had a special place on the Temple Mount, which was mentioned by their wise men.

The <i>Mishnah</i> in Tractate <i>Middos</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Middos</i> 5:1-2.</i> delineates the 135 cubits of the width of the Courtyard as follows: “The Altar and the ramp occupied 62 cubits. There were 8 cubits between the Altar and the rings (used for slaughter), the area of the rings comprised 24 cubits. There were 4 cubits between the rings and the tables and 4 cubits between the tables and the pillars.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Tosafos Yom Tov</i> to this <i>mishnah,</i> which explains different interpretations regarding the space the tables themselves comprised, and why that space was not included in this calculation.</i> There were 8 cubits between the pillars and the [northern] wall of the Courtyard. The remainder comprised the space between the ramp and the [southern] wall and the space of the pillars.” Now when the remainder, 25 cubits, is divided in 2 – which is logical, even though it is not explicitly stated – there will be 12 ½ cubits for the pillars and 12 ½ cubits between the southern wall and the ramp. Thus, the space from the southern wall until the end of the Altar will be 74 ½ cubits – 62 cubits for the ramp and the Altar and 12 ½ cubits between the southern wall and the ramp. Now, the southern half of the Courtyard only measured 67 ½ cubits (i.e., 135 ½ cubits divided by 2). Thus, <i>Tosafos</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Zevachim</i> 59b, <i>s.v. sheyihe.</i></i> states that one must carefully interpret the <i>mishnah</i> in <i>Middos</i> so that it will not present a difficulty to Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov, who maintains that the entire Altar was located in the southern portion of the Courtyard, for in Tractate <i>Yoma,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yoma</i> 16a.</i> our Sages explain that the <i>mishnah</i> in <i>Middos</i> follows Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov’s approach.",

Thus the entire Altar was situated in the southern portion of the Courtyard, which measured 67 ½ cubits. The Altar marked the end of that area. Thus, there were 5 ½ cubits between the ramp and the southern wall. The remainder of the 25 cubits alluded to by the <i>mishnah</i> in <i>Middos</i> were allocated to the pillars. Thus, these 25 cubits were not divided equally.",

Thus, according to <i>Rambam,</i> there were only 60 ½ cubits from the northern wall of the Courtyard until the Altar. It cannot be argued that the opinion presented in this <i>mishnah</i> in <i>Middos</i> presents a fourth opinion, differing with Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov and differing with the other Sages mentioned above, following the conclusion of <i>Rashi</i> in <i>Yoma.</i> For even were one to say that the <i>mishnah</i> in <i>Middos</i> presents another opinion, <i>Rambam’s</i> rulings reflect a contradiction: In <i>Hilchos Beis HaBechirah, Rambam</i> follows the opinion of the <i>mishnah</i> in <i>Middos.</i> However, in <i>Hilchos Avodas Yom HaKippurim,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Hilchos Avodas Yom Kippurim</i> 3:2.</i> <i>Rambam</i> rules according to Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov, quoting the <i>mishnah,</i> which states, “to the north of the Altar,” as <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains in his gloss to the latter teaching.",
                "For this reason, <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> maintains that an emendation should be made to <i>Rambam’s</i> text in ch. 4 of <i>Hilchos Avodas Yom HaKippurim,</i> which states:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i> 4:1.</i> “His bull would stand between the <i>Ulam</i> and the Altar,” maintaining the text should read, “would stand opposite the place of the <i>Ulam</i> and the Altar,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the bull would be standing in the northern part of the Courtyard.

True, the <i>Talmud</i> makes such a deduction from an analysis of the wording of the <i>Mishnah.</i> Nevertheless, different principles apply when analyzing the words of the <i>halachists</i> from those which apply when analyzing the wording of the <i>Mishnah.</i> Instead, it can be assumed that <i>Rambam</i> was simply quoting the wording of the <i>mishnah.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tosafos Yom Tov</i> began the latter portion of this section in an attempt to explain the perspective of Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov with regard to the position of the Altar in the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>.

Rav Ovadiah of Bartenura arrives at this figure because the <i>Ulam’s</i> walls were 5 cubits thick, and the <i>Ulam</i> itself measured 10 cubits. The same calculation applies on the south side.",
                "The text, <i>Kaftor VeFerach,</i> ch. 6, follows <i>Rambam’s</i> approach, stating: The <i>Ulam</i> was the wall for the gateway for the Sanctuary. Its length was 100 cubits. In its center, there was a gateway 40 cubits high and 20 cubits wide. There were 11 cubits between it and the wall of the Sanctuary. Similarly, at the end of those 100 cubits on all sides, from the <i>Ulam</i> until the western wall of the Sanctuary<i>,</i> there was a space of 10 cubits. This space was called <i>Beis HaChalifos.</i> The thickness of the <i>Ulam’s</i> wall on all three sides was 5 cubits, for the <i>Ulam</i> surrounded the Sanctuary on three sides until the western wall.",
                "<i>Kaftor VeFerach</i> also states: One who enters inside the gateway can go around the Sanctuary only from three sides, its entire eastern side, and its entire southern and northern sides. This area, <i>Beis</i> <i>HaChalifos</i> did not exist on the western side at all. For the end of the walls of <i>Beis</i> <i>HaChalifos</i> on the west [side] stand opposite the western wall of the Sanctuary and do not pass beyond it.",
                "<i>Ra’avad,</i> however, takes issue with <i>Rambam,</i> stating in his <i>Hasagos:</i> Avraham states: “All of this is emptiness and fantasy. For the <i>Ulam</i> did not have a wall at all [on those sides]. This is a great error, for the <i>Ulam</i> only had an eastern wall in front of Sanctuary. Therefore, [our Sages] said: “The Sanctuary was narrow at its rear and broad in its front.” The width of the <i>Ulam</i> is counted in the width of the Sanctuary.",
                "In his <i>Kessef Mishneh,</i> Rav Yosef Caro defends <i>Rambam’s</i> approach, stating: The entire reason <i>Ra’avad</i> ascribes an error to <i>Rambam</i> stems from the <i>mishnah’s</i> statement that the Sanctuary was narrow its rear and broad in its front, like a lion. This seemingly conflicts with the statement that it [the Sanctuary] was 100 cubits by 100 cubits. Nevertheless, <i>Rambam</i> already clarified that issue in his Commentary to the <i>Mishnah,</i> stating: “The entire Sanctuary was 100 [cubits] by 100 [cubits], but the structure would taper inward, narrowing on its western side. As it proceeded to the east, it would broaden, like a lion whose front is broad, but whose rear is narrow.” If so, there is no conflict with the subject under discussion here.",
                "Now, it is true that <i>Rambam</i> does not interpret this <i>mishnah</i> as referring to <i>Beis HaChalifos,</i> but rather explains that in its rear, the walls of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> would taper inward, and would become broader toward the front of the building. Nevertheless, an explanation is still required, because <i>Rambam’s</i> statements appear to contradict each other. On one hand, <i>Rambam</i> states that the building measured 100 cubits by 100 cubits, seemingly implying that it was of equal dimensions on all sides. Nevertheless, he also states that the wall would taper inward.",
                "For this reason Rav Ovadiah of Bartenura, who follows <i>Rambam’s</i> approach regarding the <i>Ulam</i> and the broadening of the building of the <i>Beis HaMikdash,</i> concludes his discussion of the issue by saying:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Ovadiah of Bartenura, <i>Middos</i> 4:7.</i> “It has not been explained to me how it is possible for [the building] to be an even 100 cubits on all sides.”",

Support for this interpretation can be drawn from the description of the foundation in the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yechezkel</i> 41:8.</i> “Its size was 6 cubits.” In his interpretation of that verse, <i>Rashi</i> states that the foundation was 6 cubits high, including the portion embedded in the ground.

However, they maintain that this <i>mishnah</i> and this verse are referring to a structure outside the wall of the winding stairwell. On the outside of that wall, there were three balconies, one on top of the other.

When the structure reached the surface above the middle story, which served as the floor of the third story, the thickness of the wall would be further reduced. At that point the wall was indented another cubit, so the ends of the beams could be placed on it. This progressive indentation is alluded to by the phrase, “for he made recesses.”",
                "We are thus forced to say that the empty space inside the wall of the winding stairwell was very narrow.

Nevertheless, <i>Rambam</i> understands that the recesses were only made in the wall outside the winding stairwell. Thus, they do not relate to the widening of the side-chambers. Moreover, reducing the thickness of one wall by 2 cubits is feasible because one could also reduce the thickness of the wall on the other side. If, however, one is reducing the wall on both sides by 2 cubits, initially the wall would have to be very thick. This would mean that the inner space on the bottom level would be very narrow.",
                "True, it is possible to explain that the intent when saying that the recesses were one cubit is that they were one cubit in total, i.e., half a cubit on each side, as <i>Ri</i> explains, quoted in <i>Tosafos</i> to Tractate <i>Yoma</i>. Nevertheless, since according to <i>Rambam,</i> these recesses are not related to the side-chambers, but rather are features of the outside of the wall, it is not necessary to employ any of these forced explanations. Instead, the word וְרָחֲבָה can be interpreted as meaning that the width of the side-chambers expanded the same amount as the walls of the structure were narrowed, without defining it to a specific figure.",
                "A related understanding is reflected in <i>Targum Yonason,</i> which understands the words וְרָחֲבָה וְנָסְבָה as a single concept. According to this explanation, the <i>vav</i> in וְנָסְבָה is extraneous. This is similar to the <i>vav</i> in the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Daniel</i> 8:13. Although there is a <i>vav</i> before וקֹדֶשׁ, “the holy one,” it appears superfluous, since that word does not seem to be connected to the preceding word, the verbתת .</i> תֵּת וְקֹדֶשׁ וְצָבָא מִרְמָס “enabling the holy place<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The translation follows <i>Rashi’s</i> commentary. <i>Metzudos</i> understands וקדש as referring to “the holy nation,” i.e., Israel.</i> and the host to be crushed,” where the <i>vav</i> in the word וקדש seems to be unnecessary. Similarly, in the verse, נִרְדָּם וְרֶכֶב וָסוּס,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tehilim</i> 76:7. In this verse as well, although there is a <i>vav</i> before וְרֶכֶב, that word is not connected to the preceding word, the verb נרדם.</i> “the chariot and the horse slumbered,” the <i>vav</i> in the word ורכב seems to be unnecessary, as <i>Rashi</i> explains in his commentary to those verses. Thus, <i>Targum Yonason</i> translates the verse as, “The spiral stairwell became wider and ascended upward.”",
                "According to this interpretation, this phrase is not referring to the later phrases in the verse, and does not mean that the side-chambers became wider, as <i>Rashi</i> explains. Instead, the verse is teaching us that the spiral stairwell became wider as it ascended. As <i>Targum Yonason</i> continues: “The structure [of the steps] was a spiral, [enabling one] to ascend very high, going round and round the structure.” Therefore, it was wider because of its height. <i>Targum Yonason</i> adds the word לסלקא, “[enabling one] to ascend,” to indicate that the phrase refers to the widening of the stairwell and not to the side-chambers.",
                "Nevertheless, the following phrase, עַל כֵּן רֹחַב לַבַּיִת לְמָעְלָה, must be interpreted as referring to the structure of the side-chambers. It should be interpreted – as <i>Rashi</i> does – as meaning “therefore, the widest level of the structure was the highest.” This phrase teaches us that the side-chambers became wider from level to level. The middle level was wider than the lowest level and the highest level was wider than the middle level. The word therefore refers to the phrase,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yechezkel</i> 41:6.</i> לִהְיוֹת אֲחוּזִים, “to be held fast,” in the preceding verse.",
                "<i>Radak</i> offers a similar interpretation, stating: “ ‘Therefore’ refers to what was stated previously. Since they were ‘held fast by the walls of the House,’ ‘the widest level of the structure was the highest,’ i.e., the highest tier of the side-chambers was wider than all the others.” There was, however, no fixed measure for the widening of the side-chambers. Instead, the width of the side-chambers expanded according to the extent that the walls of the structure were narrowed, as explained above.",
                "The height of the side-chambers is not explicitly mentioned in Yechezkel’s prophecy. They were evenly divided and each side-chamber and its roof comprised one-third of the height of the Sanctuary. Scripture did not desire to reveal the height of the Sanctuary in the Future<i>,</i> and were it to have informed us of the height of the side-chambers, one would have been able to deduce the height of the Sanctuary. Therefore, their height was not mentioned.",
                "<i>Rashi</i> equates the side-chambers described here with the balconies that existed in the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> built by King Shlomoh, as will be explained below. Concerning the balconies, it is written:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>I Melachim</i> 6:10.</i> “And he built the balcony… it was five cubits high.” Similarly, <i>Rashi</i> comments on the term הגזרה,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yechezkel</i> 41:12.</i> “<i>Targum Yonason</i> translates it as בְּצוּרְתָא, ‘the tall structure.’ I say that this term refers to the tall edifice of the structure.

                "I do not see the verses as problematic. The phrase, “The building that was on the outer side of the edifice,” refers to the side-chambers built on the outer side of the main structure of the <i>Beis HaMikdash.</i> Similarly, the phrase, “the width of the outer side of the House,” refers to everything that was built on the outer side of the House, even though it does not specifically say, “and the building,” i.e., the side-chambers.",

Afterwards, the verse mentions the גזרה, i.e., the main edifice of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>. It is as if the verse stated that the angel measured what was on the outer side of the House and the House itself, i.e., he measured the width of the side-chambers and the width of the main edifice.",
                "The first verse did not specifically mention the measurement of the width of the House separately because in that verse the angel is narrating as he is standing in the west, and the side-chamber runs across the entire width of the west side of the House. Hence, the angel measured the House and the side-chamber as a single unit. In the second verse, the angel is narrating as he is standing in the east, in front of the House. There were no side-chambers there. Hence, the main edifice is singled out.",
                "As a stylistic technique, the verse varied the terms, using both the term “House” and the term “גזרה”, saying, “the outer side of the House and the גזרה,” instead of saying, “the outer side of the House and the House,” or “the outer side of the גזרה and the גזרה.”",
                "“On its western side, the width [of the building] was 70 cubits.” The <i>Mishnah</i> states:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Middos</i> 4:7.</i> There were 70 cubits from the north to the south.

The Holy Sanctuary will be situated in the center, and the width of the entire expanse will be 70 cubits.",
                "In general, the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> and the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> will parallel each other. In particular, however, the width of the side-chambers in the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> will not be the same as the width of the cells – or the other structures – in the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>. Thus, it is written:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yechezkel</i> 41:5.</i> “The width of the side-chamber was 4 cubits, surrounding the House all around.” This verse is referring to the side-chamber on the west, saying that it was 4 cubits wide, and that this side-chamber would extend on the north and south sides of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> as well. Thus, in the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, the side-chambers which the <i>mishnah</i> refers to as cells, will be 4 cubits wide. This conception is followed by Rav Yitzchak Abarbanel, who comments on the above verse: “Every side-chamber was 4 cubits wide. The side-chambers were connected on the outer side of the three walls of the Sanctuary, [i.e.,] on the west, the north, and the south. This is reflected by the phrase, ‘surrounding the House all around.’ ” Similarly, the alternate interpretation presented by <i>Rashi</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Rashi, Yechezkel</i> 41:9 with regard to the <i>munach</i>.</i> supports Rav Abarbanel’s interpretation, even though it is not entirely germane to this subject.",
                "The difference between the width of the side-chambers in Yechezkel’s vision and that of the cells in the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> on the northern and southern sides, was 2 cubits, as the <i>mishnah</i> states: “The cell, six” (for, as mentioned above, the cells in Yechezkel’s vision were only 4 cubits wide). Therefore, these 2 cubits must be added to the other elements of the structure on the northern and southern sides, to produce the width of 70 cubits mentioned in Yechezkel’s prophecy. As will be explained shortly, <i>Rashi</i> compensated for the reduction on the western side by adding to the width of the foundation of its wall. We will follow the same approach and add one cubit to the foundation of the wall of the cell and one cubit to the foundation of the wall of the winding stairwell on the northern and southern sides.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is no difficulty in adding a cubit to the foundation of the winding stairwell and to the wall of the chamber for water to descend, because they are outer walls and the foundation can protrude beyond the building’s walls. It is, however, difficult to understand how the foundation of the wall of the cell can be expanded without disturbing the layout of the entire structure.</i>",
                "True, the implication of the verse is that the wall of the winding stairwell will be only 5 cubits wide, as the <i>mishnah</i> states, for it is written:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yechez­kel</i> 41:12.</i> “The wall of the building was five cubits wide all around.” The implication is that the outer wall of the building, i.e. the wall of the winding stairwell, will be 5 cubits wide “all around,” i.e., on the north and the south. The rationale is that the wall of the winding stairwell is a continuation of the outer wall of the building on the western side, which was also 5 cubits wide, as it is written:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.:</i>9.</i> “The width of the outer wall of the side-chamber was five cubits.” Nevertheless, the verse can be interpreted as referring to the portion above the foundation. The foundation, by contrast, was 6 cubits wide.",
                "Similarly, with regard to the western wall, the narrative explicitly states that the foundation was 6 cubits wide, as it is written:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.:</i>8.</i> “The foundations of the side-chambers were a full measuring rod wide, a space of six cubits.” <i>Rashi</i> explains that this verse is referring to the foundation of the outer wall of the side-chambers, as explained in sec. 63. It is also explained later in this section that the phrase, “Its length was ninety cubits,” includes the 6 cubits of the foundation as part of the length of the House.",
                "Similarly, it can be said that the foundation of the northern and southern walls – which extended from this wall –was 6 cubits wide, and was included in the width of 70 cubits. Indeed, this is indicated by the wording of the narrative, which refers to “the foundations of the side-chambers.” Were that phrase only to be referring to the foundation of the western side-chamber, the verse would have used the singular “side-chamber” instead of the plural “side-chambers.”",
                "Moreover, it appears that using a singular form in that verse would have been appropriate even if it was referring not only to the western wall, but to the entire outer wall, i.e., the wall of the winding stairwell on the north and the corresponding wall on the south, in addition to the western wall. Indeed, the narrative already referred to the entire outer wall – including the western, northern, and southern walls – in the singular in the phrase, “the wall of the building was five cubits wide all around.” Therefore, it can be said that the phrase, “the foundations of the side-chambers,” is written in plural because it includes the foundation of the wall of the cell which was also “a full measuring rod wide.” Thus, we have clear support for our thesis that the cubits that will be reduced from the width of the cell will be added to the width of the foundation of the wall of the winding stairwell and to the foundation of the cell. Just like the width of the foundation of the outer, western wall of the cell is counted in the reckoning of the 100 cubits of the length of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, so too, the width of these two foundations mentioned above are included in the reckoning of the 70 cubits of the width of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>.",
                "“Its length was 90 cubits. He measured the House as 100 cubits in length.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.:</i>12-13.</i> Although the narrative mentions two different measures of length, they are not contradictory. As <i>Rashi</i> states in his commentary to the verse, the measure of 100 cubits refers to the entire building, as detailed by the <i>mishnah</i> in Tractate <i>Middos:</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Middos</i> 4:7.</i>",
                "It was 100 cubits from the east to the west: The wall of the <i>Ulam</i> was 5 cubits, [the <i>Ulam</i> was] 11 cubits wide. The wall of the Sanctuary was six, its length 40. There was the <i>amah traksin</i> (one cubit)<i>,</i> the chamber of the Holy of Holies was 20 cubits, a wall - six, the cell - six, and the wall of the cell - five.",
                "<i>Rashi</i> continues: “Above [i.e., in the narrative in <i>Yechezkel</i>], all of these measures are explicitly stated with the exception of the <i>amah traksin.</i>” As we explained in sec. 58, in the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, the <i>amah traksin</i> will be replaced by a wall that will be 2 cubits thick. Compensation for the additional cubit will be made by reducing the width of the cell by one cubit. This can be derived from the <i>mishnah,</i> which states that the cell will be 6 cubits wide and its wall - 5, while in the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, the side-chamber will be 4 cubits wide and its wall - 6, as reflected by the verse, “The foundations of the side-chambers were a full measuring rod wide,” as explained in sec. 63. The width of the foundation is included in the calculation.",
                "The reckoning of 90 cubits only includes the space until <i>Beis HaChalifos</i> – the Chamber of the Knives – which was to the east, and encompassed 10 cubits. In total, the span was 100 cubits, as explained in sec. 50. The verse mentions the two separately, because they were of different width. The main edifice of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> (which was 90 cubits long) was only 70 cubits wide. <i>Beis HaChalifos</i>, which was 10 cubits long,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We have assumed that the term וְהָעֲזרָה is a printing error and the intent is העשרה, “the ten.”</i> was 100 cubits wide. This is also the intent of the <i>mishnah’s</i> statement that “the Sanctuary was narrow at its rear and broad in its front.” This was discussed sufficiently in sec. 50.",
                "In the edifice that was 90 cubits long, the 5 cubits at the end closest to <i>Beis HaChalifos</i> were left empty. There was space between the side-chambers and <i>Beis HaChalifos,</i> to which the cells opened. This space is alluded to by the phrase,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yechezkel</i> 41:9.</i> “[There was] an [open space] that was <i>munach</i> [before] the structure of the side-chambers of the House.” <i>Targum Yonason</i> also speaks of, “space that was left,” i.e., space that was without a structure, which was the same width as the side-chambers, which was left in the corners of the edifice. Thus, it is written:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.:</i>11.</i> “The width of the place left open (<i>munach</i>) was five cubits all around.” <i>Rashi</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Rashi, Yechezkel</i> 41:9.</i> explains that, “the phrase ‘all around’ stated with regard to the <i>munach</i> should not be interpreted according to its simple meaning, at all four corners. Instead, it means ‘at either side,’ on the south and on the north, i.e., at the southeast corner and at the northeast corner.”",
                "<i>Rashi</i> also writes regarding the phrase, “an [open space] that was left”: There was an open space left at the southeast corner and at the northeast corner, for the side-chambers would not surround the entire House. The entrances to the side-chambers were in those empty spaces in the eastern corner, as it is written: “The entrance to the side-chamber was from the <i>munach</i>. There was one entrance on the north and one on the south.” For the side-chambers did not have entrances to either the Courtyard or to the Sanctuary. Only those in the northeast and southeast corner had an entrance in the wall. They opened up to this empty space and [the <i>kohanim</i>] would enter this side-chamber through this entrance. From this side-chamber, they would enter the second one, and the third, surrounding [the Sanctuary]. Thus, the <i>mishnah</i> teaches in Tractate <i>Middos:</i> “Each of the cells had three openings: one to the cell on the right, one to the cell on the left, and one to the cell above it. Similarly, the <i>Targum Yonason</i> renders the words וַאֲשֶׁר מֻנָּח, “a place was left.”",
                "Similarly, Rabbeinu Shemayah, <i>Rashi’s</i> student, writes in his commentary to Tractate <i>Middos:</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Middos</i> 4:3.</i> “Also in the building described by Yechezkel, there were 5 cubits left open before the final cell whose space was positioned opposite the thickness of the wall of the Sanctuary, according to the reckoning.” With God’s help, his words will be cited below at length.",
                "<i>Rashi’s</i> statement cited above – that the side-chambers did not open up to the Sanctuary – should not be understood as meaning that none of the side-chambers opened up to the Sanctuary. Rather, <i>Rashi’s</i> intent appears to be that the opening of the side-chamber to the Sanctuary was not used to enter and exit the side-chambers, for the reason to be explained below. Therefore, it was necessary that there be an entrance to the <i>munach</i> that could be used to enter and exit the side-chambers.",
                "What compelled me to such an interpretation is that the <i>mishnah</i> states:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Rabbeinu Shemayah's commentary on <i>Middos</i> 4:2.</i> “[The cell] in the northeast corner had five openings: one to the cell on its right, one to the cell above it, one to the winding stairwell, one towards the wicket,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See sec. 52 above.</i> and one to the Sanctuary.” <i>Rambam</i> in his <i>Hilchos Beis HaBechirah,</i> explains:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Hilchos Beis HaBechirah</i> 4:11.</i> “The cell<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned previously, <i>Rambam</i> interprets the five cells, not as being positioned from the east to the west, but from the north to the south, each one parallel to the entire length of the Sanctuary.</i> in the northeast corner on the second level<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned previously in this section, there were three levels of cells.</i> had five entrances: one to the cell on its right,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Rambam</i> uses the expressions right and left assuming one is facing the Holy of Holies, i.e., north and south respectively.</i> one to the cell above it, one to the winding stairwell, one towards the cell with the wicket, and one to the Sanctuary.”",
                "<i>Rambam</i>’s intent can be understood based on his commentary to the above <i>mishnah:</i> “This cell was on the middle level of the cells. It was above the winding stairwell.” Thus, it had five openings: a) one to the cell on its right, which was the wall of the winding stairwell<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned previously, in his commentary to this <i>mishnah</i>, <i>Rambam</i> understands the term “the wall of the winding stairwell” as being the name of one of the cells.</i> which had empty space in its midst that was called a cell, b) one to the cell above it, because it was on the second level and there was a third level above it, c) one to the winding stairwell below it that enabled one to ascend to it, and d) one to the cell that has the wicket entrance.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tosafos Yom Tov</i> will explain the fifth opening to the cell below.</i> With regard to the latter opening, in his commentary to the above <i>mishnah, Rambam</i> writes: “The intent is [to refer] to the cell within which was located the northern wicket through which one would enter the Sanctuary. This is the opening that existed on the northern side of the cell that had five openings.”",
                "To explain <i>Rambam’s</i> words: <i>Rambam</i> confronted a conceptual difficulty because the wicket entrance was near the Sanctuary, i.e., in the wall of the Sanctuary itself. According to <i>Rambam,</i> who understands the cells as being positioned from north to south, a question arises: How is it possible that the cell above the winding stairwell will have an opening to the wicket entrance? There are two other cells – named “the cell” and “the wall of the cell” – between this cell and the wicket entrance. Therefore, <i>Rambam</i> explains that the <i>mishnah’s</i> words, “one to the wicket entrance,” do not mean to the wicket entrance itself, but to the cell that was next to the wicket entrance, i.e., to the cell that was named “the cell.” It appears to me that the words, “in the northern side of the cell,” in <i>Rambam’s</i> commentary are an error, and the text should read, “to the southern side.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Indeed, Rav Kapach’s translation of <i>Rambam’s</i> Commentary to the <i>Mishnah</i> states: “to the cell on the left,” which, when facing the Holy of Holies, refers to the south.</i>",
                "The <i>mishnah’s</i> statement that the fifth opening was “to the Sanctuary” does not mean to the Sanctuary itself, but rather “to the wicket that led to the Sanctuary,” for these openings were positioned facing each other. Hence, this opening was also referred to as an opening of the cell over the winding stairwell, even though in truth this cell did not have an opening to the wicket, and certainly not to the Sanctuary, but rather to the open spaces, i.e., the cells, between the wicket and the Sanctuary. This is the explanation of <i>Rambam’s</i> words. If they are not, I pray that I be able to understand their interpretation.",
                "Nevertheless, it appears to me that the <i>mishnah</i> should be interpreted differently. The <i>mishnah</i> is referring to the lowest level of cells and the cell referred to as “the cell.” The cell referred to as “the cell” had five openings. The <i>mishnah</i> mentions the northeast corner, i.e., in contrast to the southeast corner, for regarding the wicket on the southeast, it is written:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yechezkel</i> 44:2.</i> “This gate shall be closed. It will not be opened.” Hence, it is not appropriate to mention the opening to the wicket and the opening to the Sanctuary from that side. This interpretation also fits according to <i>Rambam.</i> The statement in the <i>mishnah</i> can thus be interpreted: “one to the cell on the right,” i.e., to the cell in the wall of this cell, “one to the cell above it, one to the winding stairwell,” i.e., via its wall, “one to the cell that has the wicket,” i.e., to the cell in the wall of the Sanctuary, “and one to the Sanctuary,” i.e., via this wicket.",
                "This interpretation is based on the concept that these two cells – the wall of the cell and the wall of the Sanctuary – are called “walls,” although they are empty spaces. These cells are called “walls” because they were not constructed for their own sake, i.e., because there was a need for cells. Instead, there was a need for walls and, by the way, as it were, the wall was made hollow and, as a result, a cell was made. Accordingly, if there is an entrance that opens from the cell that is unique in that it is called “the cell”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., it was given that name because it was made to serve this purpose.</i> to the Sanctuary or to the winding stairwell, the entrance is identified with the cell called “the cell,” even though it passes through these hollow walls. True, these walls were hollow and are called cells. Nevertheless, they are identified with the walls, as evidenced by their names, “the wall of the cell,” and, “the wall of the Sanctuary,” as explained.",
                "For this reason, the <i>mishnah</i> does not mention that this cell had an opening to the empty space in the wall of the winding stairwell. The winding stairwell is a unique and significant entity.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In contrast to the cells named “the wall of….”</i> Even if the opening from the winding stairwell to the hollow in its wall<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the fifth cell was called “the wall of the winding stairwell.” In this instance as well, the empty space was not a significant entity; what was important was the wall.</i> was positioned opposite the opening leading from “the cell” to the winding stairwell, the opening from the winding stairwell to the cell in its wall would not be identified with “the cell” – i.e., the sixth opening to “the wall of the winding stairwell” would not be mentioned – because the opening is from the winding stairwell and is identified with the winding stairwell (since the winding stairwell is a significant entity). The <i>mishnah</i> does, however, discuss openings from “the cell” to the winding stairwell that is on its side, and to the Sanctuary, even though there are two spaces – “the wall of the cell” and “the wall of the Sanctuary” between “the cell” and the Sanctuary. The rationale is that these two empty spaces were not given an independent name. Therefore, the two openings mentioned above were not identified with them but with the cell given the name “the cell.” The <i>mishnah</i> did, nevertheless, count the openings from “the cell” to the empty spaces between the walls because these cavities are referred to as a cell, and there are openings from them to “the cell.” This appears to be how the <i>mishnah</i> should be understood<i>.</i>",
                "According to <i>Rambam’s</i> interpretation, by contrast, an explanation is required as to why these openings are identified with this cell, for the explanation given above cannot be employed according to <i>Rambam’s</i> understanding. Furthermore, it is necessary to understand why <i>Rambam</i> does not count the opening to the “wall of the cell” – i.e., the empty space within the walls – as he counts the opening to “the wall of the winding stairwell,” for it appears that the phrase “the opening to the cell on its right” mentioned by the <i>mishnah</i> refers to the “wall of the cell.” One might posit that the phrase “the cell on its right” means the cell on the left side when facing the Holy of Holies, which can be called on its right because it is south of “the cell.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In general, the south is identified with the right.</i> In that instance, one can ask the opposite: Why isn’t the opening to the wall of the winding stairwell mentioned? A labored explanation can be given that the <i>mishnah</i> cites the opening to the cell called “the wall of the cell” because it focuses on the openings leading to the Sanctuary. Nevertheless, this explanation is not satisfactory in my eyes.",
                "Whatever the explanation is, it is obvious that it is possible to go from the Sanctuary to the cells, for the cells have openings to the Sanctuary. What compelled me to interpret <i>Rashi’s</i> statement that they did not open to the Sanctuary as meaning “they did not have an opening used for entering and departing” is that it would be very denigrating if one would not walk to the cells directly, but instead passed through the Sanctuary of the King, blessed be He, using the Sanctuary as a shortcut.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Yevamos</i> 6b.</i> Furthermore, one who enters the Sanctuary while not performing an act of service is deserving of lashes, as stated in Tractate <i>Menachos.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Menachos</i> 27b. Entering the Sanctuary while not involved in the service of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> violates the prohibition (<i>Vayikra</i> 16:2): “Do not enter into the holy place at all times.”</i> Indeed, <i>Sefer Mitzvos Gadol</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Sefer Mitzvos Gadol,</i> negative commandment 303.</i> states that this applies even when one enters to prostrate himself<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is noteworthy since prostration is an act of homage permitted to the <i>kohanim.</i></i> at a time other than after completing an act of sacrificial service.",

Nevertheless, through this discussion, other issues were clarified.",
                "The <i>mishnah</i> does not mention if there was a parallel to the <i>munach,</i> the empty space, in the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> and the commentaries do not discuss this point.

The total width on the eastern side was 100 cubits. Even though the width of the western side was 70 cubits, the width of the eastern side was 100, because the <i>Ulam,</i> the vestibule, extended an additional 15 cubits on each side.

                "Based on these explanations, the 30 side-chambers were divided, with 15 on the north side of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> and 15 on the south side of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>. The 15 side-chambers on the north side were built as follows: The wall of the Sanctuary measured 6 cubits, and was hollow, containing a cell. On its (northern) side was the cell called “the cell,” which was 4 cubits wide. Next to the cell was the cell called “the wall of the cell.” Its foundation was 6 cubits wide, but it was only 5 cubits wide above the ground, i.e., the wall and the cell it contained were 5 cubits wide.

                "Thus, only the easternmost 10 cubits in the length of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> were 100 cubits wide. The portion of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> that was 90 cubits long was only 70 cubits wide. Within this 90-cubit area, there was 5 cubits of open space, which did not have any structure built on it.

The opening to “the cell” was within this space. From it, one would enter the other cells adjoining “the cell” and above “the cell”.

                "<i>Rashi,</i> in his commentary to <i>Yechezkel</i> and, hence, in his understanding of the <i>mishnah,</i> follows a different conception. <i>Rashi</i> comments on the term, <i>hatzlaos,</i> “the side-chambers”:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Rashi, Yechezkel</i> 41:6. The Hebrew word <i>tzelaos,</i> translated as “side-chambers,” literally means “ribs.” These chambers resembled ribs, because they surrounded the Sanctuary the same way the ribs surround the chest. Occasionally, the side-chambers are referred to as תאים, “cells.”</i> I say that the cells in the north and the south were arranged in the following manner: Each one was 12 cubits long. Thus the five cells comprised 60 cubits. There were five walls, each 5 cubits thick, bringing the total to 85 [cubits]. Together with the 5 cubits of the <i>munach,</i> the 90 cubits of the northern wall have thus been encompassed. The same applies to the south. On the west, there was one cell on top of another, and a third on top of it. They were 20 cubits long, parallel to the Holy of Holies. Thus, there were eleven [cells] in each row. Similarly, <i>Targum Yonason</i> speaks of there being “eleven in a row.”",
                "Thus, <i>Rashi</i> understands that the five cells ran along the length of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, one after the other. There is a severe difficulty in <i>Rashi’s</i> interpretation. <i>Rashi</i> states that the five cells have five walls. However, for five spaces to be enclosed on both sides, six walls are necessary. According to <i>Rashi’s</i> explanation, we would have to say that the outer cell was entirely open on one side. This would be a forced and unnecessary interpretation. After all, why should one wall be removed in order to increase the length of the cells? This question is particularly relevant since it is architectural practice to strengthen the outer part of a structure.",
                "It is difficult to say that in the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> the last cell in the row, i.e., the southwest and the northwest cells, was closed because it was flush with the wall of the courtyard, for we know that in the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, there were 11 cubits of open space between the Holy of Holies and the wall of the courtyard of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Middos</i> 5:1.</i> Furthermore, it is difficult to conceive that in the Third <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, this space will be eliminated. Moreover, the cell in the west has an outer wall, for that wall is included in the calculation of the 100 cubits that make up the length of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>. Thus, if the wall of the courtyard will be flush with the building of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, there would be two walls, one after the other. That is not logical.",
                "The interpretation of Rabbenu Shemayah, <i>Rashi’s</i> student, does not present such difficulties. He states:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Rabbeinu Shemayah, Middos</i> 4:3.</i> The width of the cell is explicitly stated, “the cell, six.” A measure for its length, by contrast, was not stated, neither by the <i>mishnah,</i> nor by Scripture. According to the reckoning in the prophet’s words,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the narrative in <i>Yechezkel.</i></i> our revered teacher of blessed memory must allocate 16 cubits for the combined length of each cell and its wall. According to Scripture, there are only 33 cells. One on the west, across the entire span of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, and five on the north and the south. <i>Targum Yonason</i> thus states that there will be “eleven [side-chambers] in a row.” There were another eleven [side-chambers] on top of them, and eleven [more] on top of them. My teacher also edited [his commentary] in this manner.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This change is not, however, found in the standard editions of <i>Rashi’s</i> commentary.</i>",
                "Thus, one can count 5 cubits for the wall of each cell, and 11 cubits for the length of each cell. Five times sixteen equals 80. There were an additional 5 cubits for the <i>munach,</i> and 5 cubits for the sixth wall of the cell, bringing the total to 90 cubits, which is the length of the building of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> until <i>Beis HaChalifos.</i> Rabbeinu Shemayah did not specifically mention that wall, just as he did not specifically mention the <i>munach,</i> because his intent was only to mention the length of each cell. He then mentioned the wall of the cell parenthetically, including the cell and its wall in the same figure. He included the wall of the cell together with the cell, because the wall between each cell was not mentioned in the <i>mishnah.</i> When the <i>mishnah</i> mentions the wall of the cell, and when the Scripture mentions the wall of the side-chamber, they only refer to the outer wall. Accordingly, Rabbeinu Shemayah did not mention the sixth wall of the cells because it was an extension of the outer wall of the cell on the west. Thus, the sixth wall of the cells is included in the outer wall of the cell on the west.",
                "According to these Rabbis,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., <i>Rashi</i> and Rabbeinu Shemayah.</i> the wall of the Sanctuary was actually six cubits thick and the wall of the cell, five cubits.

Thus, the width of the open space in the lowest cell was 5 cubits. “The middle story was 6 cubits wide and the upper story, 7 cubits wide.” [The side-chambers in Yechezkel’s vision] also followed this pattern.",
                "By saying “they were not attached inside the walls of the House,” the verse implies that the beams would not penetrate the walls of the Sanctuary like the ends of other low beams, for which holes are made in the walls and the ends of the beams are inserted in the hole.",

                "According to <i>Rashi’s</i> conception, the wall of the Sanctuary was 6 cubits thick. Hence, even if the wall’s thickness was reduced by 2 cubits because of the indents, it would remain substantial. We did not want to offer such an interpretation according to <i>Rambam’s</i> understanding, because his conception is that the wall is hollow. Hence, we explained these verses differently above.",

To compensate, the winding stairwell and [the chamber for water] to descend were expanded [a total of] 4 cubits to fill the 70 cubits of the width of the Sanctuary at its rear. Our teacher<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., <i>Rashi.</i></i> resolved [the matter] in this way to me and my colleagues.",
                "We, however, calculated a width of 70 cubits by proving from the narrative that the foundation of the wall of the cell and the foundation of the wall of the winding stairwell were each 6 cubits thick.

To explain: Above, in sec. 70, it was stated that the chambers began 5 cubits from <i>Beis HaChalifos.</i> The wall of the Inner Courtyard was built at the end of those 5 cubits on the east side. This wall separated between the Inner Courtyard and the Outer Courtyard, and was 6 cubits thick. Five of those cubits were opposite the 5 cubits mentioned immediately beforehand, and there was an additional cubit.

The verse explains the reason: It was הָאַתִּיקִים, “<b>the pillars,</b>” that reduced their space. The word מֵהֵנָה, “<b>of these,</b>” refers to the middle and lower stories. The word בִּנְיָן, “<b>the structure,</b>” is the object of the verb “<b>reduced,</b>” i.e., the pillars reduced the floor space of the structure. The verse also explains why the reduction was made: Because “<b>they had three stories,</b>” and thus, they were high. “<b>They did not have pillars</b>” to support the upper stories “<b>like the pillars of the courtyards,</b>” which projected outward and did not take up any floor space inside. Instead, these pillars took up space both inside and outside. “<b>Therefore, the lower and the middle stories had their floor space reduced.</b>” There were no pillars for the third story, because its roof did not require support.

                "Rav Yitzchak Abarbanel offers a different explanation of this passage, stating that the term עליונות refers to the highest story, i.e., the third story.

Therefore, when the narrative states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.:</i>5.</i> “The upper chambers were narrowed,” it is indicating that the highest story was the narrowest of the three. This is the direct opposite of the side-chambers built around the Sanctuary. In that instance, the upper chambers were wider than the lower ones. In this instance, by contrast, the upper ones were narrower than the lower ones. The narrative gives the reason for this, כִּי יוֹכְלוּ אַתִּיקִים מֵהֵנָּה מֵהַתַּחְתֹּנוֹת. Rav Yitzchak Abarbanel interprets this as meaning that the inner space of the lower and middle stories took up more of the structure because it was wider below. The narrative gives a further rationale: “<b>For they had three stories; they did not have pillars.</b>”",
                "The narrative states “of these” and specifies that it is referring to the lower and middle stories. Like <i>Rashi,</i> Rav Yitzchak Abarbanel explains that in the word יוֹכְלוּ, the first <i>vav</i> takes the place of an <i>alef,</i> and the intent is, “to take up space,” as found in the words of our Sages,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bava Basra</i> 14a.</i> “How much space did the Tablets take up (אוכלות) in the Ark? Six [handbreadths]. Rav Yitzchak Abarbanel continues: <i>Radak</i> states that he is unable to understand the structure of these chambers, how the lower stories will be wider than the upper ones. Similarly, neither <i>Rashi</i> nor <i>[Targum] Yonason</i> explained anything about it. Concerning this, <i>Radak</i> states, the prophet Eliyahu will explain this passage.",
                "It is possible to explain that the upper side-chambers [built around the Sanctuary] mentioned earlier, were wider than the lower ones because the wall that supported them was wide at its bottom and narrow at its top. Therefore, the upper chambers took up more space than the lower ones, because the wall was not as thick at that height as it was below. They were also supported by pillars. Therefore, the upper stories could be as wide as possible. There was no fear that they would fall because they were supported by pillars. These chambers, by contrast, were built in three stories, one on top of the other, and thus the wall on one side was not narrower than on the other side, and they did not have pillars. Therefore, it was necessary that the upper chamber be narrower than the lower [ones] out of fear that the upper stories would fall if they would be as wide as the lower stories. No such fear existed with regard to the lower stories, because they were supported by the earth or were close to it.

Similarly, it is written:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i> 43:13.</i> “And he said to me, ‘The chambers on the north and the chambers on the south facing the edifice, they are the holy chambers where the <i>kohanim</i> who draw close to God will eat the sacrifices of the most sacred order… the meal-offerings, the sin-offerings, and the guilt-offerings, because the place is holy.’”",

The afflicted person is forbidden to enter the Courtyard of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>. Nevertheless, it is forbidden to take the blood of the guilt-offering out of the Courtyard. Hence, the afflicted person must stand outside the Courtyard at the gate and insert his head, hand, and foot, one at a time for the <i>kohen</i> to place the blood and the oil on these limbs.</i> This immersion was required even though one afflicted by <i>tzaraas</i> had immersed himself on the previous evening, for everyone who entered the Courtyard of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> was required to immerse himself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Yoma</i> 30a.

Now, the obligation for the <i>Kohen Gadol</i> to immerse himself only applied in the Courtyard of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, where the sacrificial service took place. So too, the obligation for an ordinary person to immerse himself did not apply until he entered that courtyard.",
                "Rabbi Yehudah offers a different rationale for why a person must immerse himself before entering “the Courtyard.” Rabbi Yehudah explains that this immersion is, “an extension of [the obligation to] immerse,” i.e., it is not a Scriptural obligation, but a Rabbinic safeguard so that, if necessary, a person would recall a long-forgotten impurity and purify himself. Such a safeguard is only necessary in a place where a ritually impure person is forbidden to enter according to Scriptural Law, i.e., from the Courtyard of the Israelites and further inward, as the Talmud states in another source:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Zevachim</i> 55b.</i> “Shmuel stated: ‘One is liable for [entering the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> in a state of] ritual impurity only in the area that is 187 cubits long and 135 cubits wide,” i.e., the enclosure of the Courtyard of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> in the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>. If so, the obligation to immerse applies only when one enters this place.",
                "It is not appropriate to say that since there is a Rabbinic decree forbidding a person who is ritually impure because of contact with a human corpse from entering the Women’s Courtyard, our Sages required everyone to immerse before entering this courtyard. Among the explanations for this: Firstly, there is a Talmudic principle:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Shavous</i> 41a.</i> A Rabbinic safeguard<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., this immersion, which is only a Rabbinic safeguard.</i> is not instituted to protect a Rabbinic safeguard.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The original Rabbinic safeguard is the prohibition against one who incurred ritual impurity because of contact with a corpse from entering this courtyard.</i> Furthermore, if there was a need to institute such a safeguard, it should have also been instituted for the <i>chayl,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the end of sec. 12 for a discussion of the <i>chayl.</i></i> the area outside the Women’s Courtyard, for a person who contracted the impurity stemming from a human corpse is forbidden to enter there, as stated in Tractate <i>Keilim.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Keilim</i> 1:8.</i> Even were one to postulate that this chamber was not consecrated so that a person could immerse himself there before entering an area sanctified by Rabbinic decree, he would still be unable to enter this chamber, for he would have to pass through the <i>chayl!</i> Therefore, it would be necessary to say that the path to this chamber from the <i>chayl</i> was also not consecrated according to Rabbinic Law.",
                "Furthermore, according to Rabbeinu Shemayah’s understanding, why does the <i>mishnah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yoma</i> 30a.</i> state, “one who enters the Courtyard”? Seemingly, a person who has not immersed himself should also refrain from entering the <i>chayl.</i> In that place as well, this would be desirable so that he might recall any impurity of Rabbinic origin that he contracted, and purify himself from it. One might say that the <i>mishnah</i> does not mention such an immersion because it follows ben Zoma’s reasoning. If so, and ben Zoma’s reasoning is the opinion mentioned by Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi in the <i>mishnah</i> without associating it with his name, that is a sign that it is accepted as <i>halachah.</i> Why then does the <i>halachah</i> follow the other approach?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Rambam, Hilchos Avodas Yom HaKippurim</i> 2:3.</i>",
                "Instead, it is preferable to explain that even Rabbi Yehudah would not maintain that this chamber is not sanctified for the reason posited by ben Zoma. Rather, Rabbi Yehudah also maintains that it is not necessary to immerse unless one is entering a place that is consecrated by Scriptural Law. Therefore, all four of these chambers possess all the sanctity associated with the Women’s Courtyard. Nevertheless, a person who had been afflicted with <i>tzaraas</i> may immerse there as others may, since he already immersed on the previous evening, as Rabbeinu She­mayah himself said.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., Rabbeinu Shemayah himself agrees that a person who had been afflicted by <i>tzaraas</i> should immerse on the preceding night.</i> Perhaps because of Rabbeinu Shemayah’s opinion that this chamber was not sanctified, the illustration of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> that accompanied the Manitoba edition of the <i>Mishnah</i> placed these chambers outside the courtyard. This is not correct, as demonstrated above.",
                "Similarly, <i>Tosafos</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yoma</i> 30b, <i>s.v. e lo tavil.</i></i> object to diminishing the status of this courtyard, stating: “In Tractate <i>Keilim,</i> it is stated:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Keilim</i> 1:8.</i> ‘The Women’s Courtyard was holier than it, as evidenced by the fact that a person who had immersed that day may not enter there.’ Now, the Chamber of those Afflicted by <i>Tzaraas</i> was located in the Women’s Courtyard.” The status of this chamber will, however, only be that of the Outer Courtyard. Even though this chamber will be positioned opposite the Sanctuary in the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, it will not be consecrated with the holiness of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> itself. This is reflected in its name, “the Outer Courtyard.”",
                "There remains a matter that requires analysis: Since all the space included in the Outer Courtyard will not be consecrated with the holiness of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> itself, how will the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> contain a consecrated space measuring 187 cubits by 135 cubits, the area of the consecrated space in the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus there will be a portion of the Courtyard of the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> that will, on the surface, lack the holiness it had in the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>.

However, the Outer Courtyard’s width will, in some places, be less than 135 cubits.",
                "There is no difficulty regarding the area opposite the building of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> on either side. As explicitly stated,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Yechezkel</i> 42:3.</i> there were 20 cubits between the building of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> and the chambers on the complex’s north and the south.

This adds up to a total of 210 cubits. Thus it is wider than the 135 cubits of the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>.

                "If so, these concepts appear to support the approach of <i>Ra’avad,</i> who objects to <i>Rambam’s</i> ruling that the holiness of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> and Jerusalem remain in the present age and indeed, will continue in the Ultimate Future.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchos Beis HaBechirah</i> 6:14.</i> <i>Ra’avad</i> continues: Furthermore, I maintain that even the statement of Rabbi Yossi, “The second consecration<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ra'avad</i> is referring to the consecration at the time of Ezra, when the Jews returned from Babylon.</i> sanctified it for the Ultimate Future,” applies only to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> as a whole, but not to Jerusalem and the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>. For Ezra knew that [the dimensions of] the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> and Jerusalem would change in the Ultimate Future, and [would] be sanctified again for all time…. This was revealed to me [as] the secrets of God are revealed to those who fear Him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Tehillim</i> 25:14.</i> Therefore, one who enters the site of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> at present is not liable for <i>kerais.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It must be emphasized that although <i>Ra'avad’s</i> opinion is respected, it is not accepted as <i>halachah.</i> Hence, no leniency may be taken to ascend the Mount of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> in our present state of ritual impurity. Indeed, even <i>Ra'avad</i> did not say that it is permitted to ascend the Mount, only that one is not liable for <i>kereis</i> for doing so. <i>Tosafos Yom Tov</i> is stating that the fact that the Inner Courtyard will not encompass the full 135 cubits of width of the Courtyard in the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> appears to support <i>Ra'avad’s</i> assertion that the boundaries of the sacred portions of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> will be redefined in the Ultimate Future.</i>",
                "It appears that the difficulty with <i>Rambam’s</i> approach can be resolved as follows: In the Ultimate Future, the cells located near the Southern Gate of the Inner Courtyard<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See sections 19-21 for a description of the cells and the structures near them.</i> will be consecrated with the holiness of the Inner Courtyard. When the 6 cubits of the thickness of the wall of the courtyard, the 6 cubits of the cell, and the 5 cubits of the cell on both the northern and southern sides of the courtyard are added together, a total of 34 cubits will be reached.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., on each side of the Courtyard, there was 6+6+5 cubits, a total of 17. When the total of the two sides are added, the sum of 34 is reached.</i> When we add these 34 cubits to the 100 cubits occupied by the structure of the <i>Beis HaMikdash,</i> there is only one cubit lacking from the 135 mentioned above. This one cubit distance will be made up – and indeed, exceeded – in the following manner: The <i>halachah</i> follows Rabbi Meir, who states:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Keilim</i> 17:10.</i> “All of the cubits [mentioned in the measurements] of the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> were [cubits of] average size.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It appears that <i>Tosafos Yom Tov</i> is understanding that <i>mishnah</i> as implying that these cubits were 5 handbreadths in measure. Others (Rav Ovadiah of Bartenura, <i>et al.</i> to <i>Keilim, loc. cit.</i>) interpret those cubits as also equaling 6 handbreadths.</i> In the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, by contrast, the measurements will be made with the angel’s measuring rod, and will thus be oversized cubits, a handbreadth larger than the average-sized cubits.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the Introduction at the beginning of the text, which explains that ordinary cubits equal 5 handbreadths and these oversized cubits will equal 6 handbreadths.</i> Thus, there will be 134 extra handbreadths for the 134 cubits in the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>. This equals 26 ordinary cubits and 4 handbreadths.",
                "Indeed, according to this reckoning, it would not have been necessary to include the entire area of the cells and their walls in the holiness of the Inner Courtyard. To explain: The Inner Courtyard was itself 100 cubits. In the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash,</i> this area will be measured with oversized cubits. Thus, the Inner Courtyard will measure 600 handbreadths. When that figure is calculated in ordinary 5-handbreadth cubits, it equals 120 cubits. Thus only 15 cubits are missing from the 135 cubits of the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>. When they are divided in half, that measure will extend only a cubit and a half into the cells.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tosafos Yom Tov</i> deducted the width of the cell walls, which was 6 cubits each.</i> Nevertheless, there is an advantage to the previous explanation, because it provides a clear line of demarcation for the end of the consecrated portion. Therefore, we did not desire to exclude even the walls of the cells. To clarify the reason for that: At the end of the cells on the western flank of the gate, there is a four-and-a-half cubit length of wall without cells, as we explained in sec. 21. This area is included in 187 cubits of the courtyard’s length. Thus, there is another cubit and a half that the consecrated portion of the Courtyard encompassed. Without including the cells, there would be no clear demarcation for the end of the consecrated portion. Therefore, we stated that the consecrated portion would also include the walls of the cells. Thus, the consecrated area has a clearly marked border, i.e. the outer edge of the walls of the cells. Even though we have added a large portion, there is no difficulty. Indeed, additions have been made in the length and in the width of the area opposite the Sanctuary. This is possible because it is permitted to add to the dimensions of the courtyard,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">However, it is not permitted to subtract from the courtyard's dimensions.</i> as stated in Tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Sanhedrin</i> 2a.</i> and Tractate <i>Shevuos.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Shevuos</i> 14a.</i>",
                "Nevertheless, Rabbi Yehudah differs with Rabbi Meir in Tractate <i>Keilim,</i> and maintains that even in the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> all of the cubits were equal to six handbreadths. Thus according to Rabbi Yehudah, the lack of a cubit in the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> presents a question. It is possible to say that Rabbi Yehudah follows the perspective of Rabbi Eliezer,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Shevuos</i> 16a.</i> who maintains that when Ezra consecrated the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> he did not intend to include the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>.

                "According to this logic, it is possible to say that even according to Rabbi Meir it is not necessary to add further areas to the consecrated portion of the Courtyard, and there would be marking posts in the cells and outside, in the area where there were no cells.

This is the meaning of the phrase, “a passageway 10 cubits wide.” From that point on, there was a twenty-cubit space between the chambers and the side-chambers adjacent to the Sanctuary. Why was this passageway described as 10 cubits wide? Seemingly, it would have been more proper to say, “ten cubits long.” Nevertheless, the term “wide” was used because the passageway ran from east to west, adjacent to <i>Beis HaChalifos. Beis HaChalifos</i> measured 15 cubits from north to south. Since the distance from north to south was longer than the distance from east to west, the 10 cubits that <i>Beis HaChalifos</i> ran from east to west is described as its width. Similarly, the distance 15-cubit distance from north to south is described as the length because it is a larger distance. This is <i>Rashi’s</i> understanding of the verse.",

Moreover, it is not appropriate that these chambers serve as shortcuts providing access to the Twenty Cubit Space. For these chambers should be closed rooms, that are entered only at specific times. In contrast, the Twenty Cubit Space is open space like the remainder of the courtyard.

                "This interpretation of the phrase, “the edifice and the building,” is preferable to <i>Rashi’s</i> because elsewhere, that phrase is used only to refer to the building of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> and the cells. Also, the term “edifice” is not appropriate for the structures in the courtyard. Furthermore, those structures should be described with one term, either “edifice” or “building,” but not with both terms, because there was only one type of structure in the courtyard.",
                "The above also enables one to understand the phrase,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i> 42:12.</i> “There was an entrance at the beginning of the pathway, the pathway before the platform of the musicians.” <i>Rashi</i> interprets this phrase as meaning that these chambers had an entrance at the beginning of the pathway before the <i>Duchan,</i> the musicians’ platform. The place where the chambers begin is at the place where the cells end. This place is parallel to a point 4½ cubits from the beginning of the Inner Courtyard, as will be explained in sec. 74. The entrance leading from the chamber to the Inner Courtyard opens up at, “the pathway before the platform of the musicians,” i.e., the <i>Duchan.</i> The entire area through which the Israelites were allowed to enter leads to the <i>Duchan,</i> which is positioned beyond this area. As explained in sec. 26, there were 17 cubits from the entrance to the Inner Courtyard until the <i>Duchan.</i> Thus, the entrance that was within the first 4½ cubits was, “at the beginning of the pathway” leading to the <i>Duchan.</i>",
                "Nevertheless, there is a difficulty regarding <i>Rashi’s</i> interpretation of the phrase: “<b>Resembling the entrances to the chambers to the south</b>” – [These] were the entrances to the chambers on the east. For in the south[west] as well, there were chambers… near the side-chambers, as explained above.",
                "Why did Scripture describe the entrance to these chambers by comparing them to the chambers on south[west], which, unlike those in the north[west], were not discussed previously in the narrative? Indeed, in sec. 71, it was necessary to bring proofs that there were such chambers in the south[west].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See pp. 235-236.</i> Moreover, even when describing these lower chambers, the narrative refers to the northern chambers, stating,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yechezkel</i> 42:9.</i> “Lower [on the mountain] than these chambers.” The southern chambers were not mentioned or even alluded to until this verse. Only in the following verse<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i> 42:13.</i> does the narrative mention these chambers, speaking of “the northern chambers and the southern chambers.” Moreover, the fact that there is a courtyard 50 cubits long in front of this chamber is derived from the fact that there was such a space in the north, as the verse states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i> 42:11.</i> “There was a passageway before them whose appearance was resembled that of the chambers on the north.” Why, then, weren’t the entrances also associated with those of the northern chambers?",
                "Therefore, it appears that the verse should be understood according to <i>Targum Yonason’s</i> interpretation:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid,</i> 42:12.</i> “<b>Resembling the gates of the chambers that opened to the pathway on the south.</b>” The words “<b>on the south</b>” do not refer to the chambers but to the entrances. The intent is that the chamber’s entrances open to the south. Therefore, the chamber to which reference is being made is the northern chamber. It has entrances leading to the Twenty Cubit Space between it and the cells which are to its south, as explained in sec. 71. Similarly, the verse is teaching that the lower chambers also opened to the south. In that direction, they had “<b>an entrance at the beginning of the pathway</b>,” leading to the Inner Courtyard. Therefore, the previous mention of the entrances in the narrative is not sufficient, for the phrase in this verse is teaching that the chamber had an additional entrance at the beginning of the pathway. Thus, the verse is teaching that just as the upper northern chambers had an entrance to the south leading to the Twenty Cubit Space, as we explained, so too, the lower chambers had an entrance to the south. In addition, the lower chambers had another entrance “<b>at the beginning of the pathway</b>.”",
                "The narrative begins by stating “Resembling the gates of the chambers that opened to the pathway on the south.” These chambers also have an opening to that direction. Moreover, they have another entrance “at the beginning of the pathway.” Alternatively, perhaps this is the only entrance these chambers had. Since this entrance also opened to the south, it could be the entrance referred to by the verse’s first clause. It is, however, more likely that there were two entrances, both opening to the south - one leading to the Inner Courtyard and one leading to the Outer Courtyard.",
                "It is possible to explain <i>Rashi’s</i> reasoning as follows: The entrance of the upper northern chamber to the south opened to the Twenty Cubit Space. Since the opening of the lower northern chamber<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This explanation follows the conception that there were two openings to the lower chamber.</i> led to a far more spacious area, it is not comparable to the upper northern chamber. Therefore, <i>Rashi</i> compared it to the southern chambers, for their opening on the south also led to a more spacious area – in contrast to their opening to the north which led to the Twenty Cubit Space. Nevertheless, the interpretation of <i>Targum Yonason</i> seems more accurate."

Tractate <i>Middos</i> states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Middos</i> 5:1.</i> “There were 11 cubits behind the Holy of Holies.” It is possible to say that these 11 cubits correspond to the 11 cubits of the Courtyard of the Israelites, since according to <i>Rambam,</i> Israelites were also permitted to proceed behind the Holy of Holies.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The source in <i>Rambam’s</i> work has not been located. See <i>Yoma</i> 21a.</i> Following that logic, one can postulate that in the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, there will be 17 cubits of empty space behind the Holy of Holies. This will correspond to the 17 cubits of space where Israelites will be allowed to proceed in the future structure’s Courtyard, as explained in sec. 26. It is true that the area behind the Holy of Holies in the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> will be much longer than the corresponding area in the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., in the second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, the courtyard was 135 cubits wide, while in the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, it will be 312 cubits wide.</i> The rationale is because the area behind the future structure’s Holy of Holies will extend across the entire length of the Outer Courtyard. Nevertheless, that is not problematic, because the part of this area that is on the northern and southern sides of the Outer Courtyard will be set off, and is thus not included when calculating the area where Israelites will be able to walk.",
                "Even so, it seems that the dimensions of the past and the future complexes will be the same and, in the Ultimate Future, there will only be an 11 cubit space behind the Holy of Holies. The rationale for this statement is that in the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, the area behind the Holy of Holies is part of the Inner Courtyard which encircled the building of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> on its north and south, and behind it. Therefore, it is appropriate that the area behind the Holy of Holies where the Israelites could walk be equivalent to the area where they could walk at the beginning of this courtyard. In the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash,</i> by contrast, as can be seen in the diagram that we drew,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A copy of that diagram is included as a foldout at the end of this volume.</i> the area behind the Holy of Holies will be part of the Outer Courtyard. It is not crucial whether or not the area behind the Holy of Holies will be sanctified with the holiness of the Courtyard, for the Twenty-Cubit Space and the chambers will be sanctified.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, providing an ample amount of space for the functions necessary to be performed there.</i> Thus, even without consecrating the area behind the Holy of Holies, there will be more than the 187 cubits of consecrated space that existed in the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash,</i> as explained in sec. 71. Thus, it can be concluded that the area behind the Holy of Holies is part of the outer portion of the Courtyard. If so, it is fitting that there be only 11 cubits behind the Holy of Holies to correspond to the 11 cubits that existed in the former structure. These 11 cubits will parallel the 11 cubits left at the end of the lower chambers in the eastern portion of the Outer Courtyard, as explained at the beginning of the previous section.",
                "As stated previously, the Outer Courtyard in front of the eastern wall of the Inner Courtyard was 100 cubits long. The lower chambers were also 100 cubits long. They were set back along the northern and southern walls of the Inner Courtyard, until the end of the cells on the flanks of the gates. After the end of the cells, there is 4 ½ cubits of empty space before the end of the wall. That figure is derived as follows: As explained in sec. 21, the cells on either side of the gate and the gate, take up 91 cubits. The Courtyard measured 100 cubits by 100 cubits. Thus there are 9 cubits of empty space along the walls. Since the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> was built symmetrically, the 9 cubits half should be divided in half, leaving 4 ½ cubits on the west and the same amount on the east. As mentioned previously, the Inner Courtyard’s wall was 6 cubits thick. If we add these 6 cubits to the 4 1/2 cubits of extra space, the chambers will be built 10 ½ cubits west of the beginning of the Outer Courtyard. Thus, there will be 10 ½ cubits of empty space between the end of the chambers and the wall of the Outer Courtyard.",
                "Since the builders of the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> left 11 cubits of open space behind the Holy of Holies, it is appropriate to say that an equivalent space will be left there in the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>. Accordingly, there should also be an equivalent space left at the beginning of the Outer Courtyard. That measure can be achieved by having half a cubit of the last cell’s wall enter the wall of the chamber. Thus the chamber will be set back 11 cubits from the wall of the Inner Courtyard and there will be an equal amount of space left open at the beginning of the Outer Courtyard. Thus the beginning and end of the Outer Courtyard of the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> will be symmetric. In the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, it was the beginning and end of the Inner Courtyard that resembled each other. In the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, this pattern will be followed in the Outer Courtyard.",
                "Based on the above, it is possible to explain the calculation made in sec. 1, that the length of the Outer Courtyard from east to west is 317 cubits. Thus the end of my description of the Future <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> will focus on the same subject as its beginning. To follow is the reckoning of that measure: There are 100 cubits in front of the beginning of the eastern wall of the Inner Courtyard, as explained in sec. 22. That wall is 6 cubits thick, as explained in sec. 23. The Inner Courtyard itself is 100 cubits 1ong, as stated in sec. 36. The building of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> was 100 cubits long, as stated in sec. 64. And then, there were these 11 cubits.

To explain: Our Sages teach<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Shabbos</i> 31a.</i> that the Orders of the <i>Mishnah</i> follow the pattern alluded to in the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yeshayahu</i> 33:6.</i> “The faith of your times will provide the strength of your salvation….” In this verse, the phrase “your times” refers to the Order of <i>Moed,</i> and the word, “salvation,” refers to the Order of <i>Nezikin.</i> Since the phrase, “your times,” precedes the word, “salvation,” we know that the Order of <i>Moed</i> precedes the Order of <i>Nezikin</i>. Support for the concept that <i>Rashi</i> relied on his commentary to <i>Sukkah</i> when composing his commentary to <i>Sanhedrin</i> can be drawn from the fact that, in <i>Sanhedrin,</i> he did not cite the verses he cited in <i>Sukkah</i> as prooftexts in <i>Sanhedrin,</i> when explaining that there are righteous men who abide near the Divine presence. Rather than repeating himself, <i>Rashi</i> relied on his previous statements. Similarly, in <i>Sanhedrin,</i> he only mentioned the idea that the verse refers to the Jerusalem Above. Obviously, however, <i>Rashi</i> accepts the general principle that a verse should never be taken entirely beyond its simple meaning.",
                "Moreover, it is possible to say that in <i>Sanhedrin,</i> it is not necessary for <i>Rashi</i> to explain that the verse should be understood according to its simple meaning, as well as according to its <i>Aggadic</i> interpretation<i>,</i> because Ravva’s words themselves indicate that the verse should be understood literally.",
                "To explain: The fact that Ravva mentions 18,000 <i>parsaos</i> represents a difficulty, for the verse uses measuring rods as a measure of length, not <i>parsaos.</i> Therefore, Ravva should have mentioned measuring rods, not <i>parsaos.</i> This discrepancy can be resolved by explaining that the wording of the verse alludes to its twofold meaning: According to its literal meaning, the verse is discussing the city’s perimeter, stating that it will measure 18,000 measuring rods. Nevertheless, the verse does not explicitly mention measuring rods, enabling its meaning to be expanded to include its <i>Aggadic</i> interpretation: that the city will have a parallel in the spiritual realms, where the 18,000 rows of righteous men surround the Divine presence. These rows are measured in <i>parsaos,</i> and not in measuring rods, for in the spiritual realms, measurements are taken in <i>parsaos,</i> as is obvious from <i>Sefer Heichalos.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Sefer Heichalos,</i> ch. 12. <i>Sefer Heichalos</i> is an early Kabbalistic text, dating from the Mishnaic period.</i> Measurements are taken in <i>parsaos</i> in the spiritual realms because they are the largest measure of length referred to in Talmudic literature. Thus, when the liturgical hymn for <i>Parshas Shekalim</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tosafos Yom Tov</i> is referring to <i>Az Rayisi,</i> a hymn composed by Rav Elazar HaKalir.</i> mentions the different measures of length, it begins with <i>parsaos,</i> for they are the largest measure.",
                "On this basis, it can be said that Ravva’s statement itself indicates that a distinction can be made between the verse’s simple meaning and its <i>Aggadic</i> interpretation, for the verse mentions measuring rods and Ravva mentions <i>parsaos.</i> Therefore, it is not necessary for <i>Rashi</i> to highlight this point. Tractate <i>Sukkah,</i> by contrast, does not quote Ravva as discussing <i>parsaos.</i> The rationale is that, in contrast to the passage in <i>Sanhedrin,</i> the passage in <i>Sukkah</i> is not a collection of <i>Aggadic</i> teachings. Ravva’s teaching is only cited there as a basis for a question concerning the lesson preceding it. True, in <i>Sanhedrin,</i> Ravva’s statement is also cited as a basis for a question. Nevertheless, that entire passage is of an <i>Aggadic</i> nature, and so the author brought the <i>Aggadic</i> text in full. Since <i>parsaos</i> are not mentioned in Tractate <i>Sukkah,</i> there <i>Rashi</i> felt it necessary to elaborate and explain that the verse’s <i>Aggadic</i> interpretation does not contradict its simple meaning.",
                "On this basis, <i>Tosafos’</i> commentary to the passage in <i>Sukkah</i> should be discussed. <i>Tosafos</i> emphasizes that <i>parsaos</i> should not be mentioned in Ravva’s teaching, since <i>parsaos</i> are not mentioned in the verse. It would appear that <i>Tosafos’</i> intent is that the term <i>parsaos</i> should not be mentioned in <i>San­hedrin</i> either. <i>Tosafos</i> does not mention this point in <i>Sanhedrin.</i> However, this is not unusual, because there are few glosses from <i>Tosafos</i> for that chapter in <i>Sanhedrin.</i> According to our understanding, however, <i>parsaos</i> should be mentioned in Ravva’s teaching even though the verse mentions measuring rods. For Ravva is interpreting the verse in an <i>Aggadic</i> sense, as referring to the rows of the righteous surrounding the Divine presence. As such, we should follow the guidance in Tractate <i>Shevuos,</i> which instructs us to,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shevuos</i> 31a.</i> “Derive insight from one source and apply it in another context.” In our context, the insight from the verse can be applied to the rows of angels, where the wording <i>parsaos</i> is appropriate. In Tractate <i>Sukkah,</i> the term <i>parsaos</i> is not appropriate. Accordingly, it is not mentioned there. However, the term <i>parsaos</i> is mentioned in Tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i>, because that tractate is of an <i>Aggadic</i> nature.",
                "According to our first explanation of why <i>Rashi</i> did not mention the simple meaning of the verse in his commentary to <i>Sanhedrin,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., that <i>Rashi</i> relied on his commentary to the passage in <i>Sukkah.</i></i> it seems that the text in <i>Sukkah</i> should also mention <i>parsaos.</i> The rationale is that measurements in the spiritual realms are made in <i>parsaos</i>, as mentioned above. The reason this version is not found in the text of the Talmud, is that the scribe who composed the standard version saw <i>Tosafos’</i> statements and therefore omitted the word <i>parsaos.</i> In <i>Sanhedrin,</i> by contrast, there is no commentary by <i>Tosafos</i> on this passage. Hence, the word was not omitted. In truth, as <i>Tosafos</i> mentioned, the word <i>par­saos</i> was originally found in both passages, and – according to our understanding – belongs in both.",
                "With the above interpretations, we have merited to explain that one should not err when studying <i>Rashi’s</i> words, as did some who wished to claim that Yechezkel’s prophecy should not be interpreted according to its simple meaning and sought to support their assertion by citing <i>Rashi’s</i> commentary in <i>Sanhedrin,</i> as stated by Rav Yitzchak Abarbanel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Abarbanel, Yechezkel</i> 45:1.</i> Rav Yitzchak Abarbanel, however, refutes their claim, citing <i>Rashi’s</i> commentary to <i>Sukkah.</i> We elaborated, and also explained <i>Rashi’s</i> use of the term <i>parsaos,</i> and the difference between his commentary in <i>Sanhedrin</i> and in <i>Sukkah.</i> Nevertheless, fundamentally, we both shared the same intent: to emphasize that Yechezkel’s prophecy should be interpreted according to its simple meaning, as we explained in great detail. As a reader can see, the verse can be understood according to our interpretation, which is based on the words of the commentaries.",
                "I do not assert that it is necessary to accept my entire explanation. Who knows whether I am correct? I am not a prophet, nor the son of a prophet. My words do not emanate from wisdom or from a special spirit; they are nothing more than what the God of heaven revealed to me in the understanding of the words of the classic commentaries and, in particularly, the words of <i>Rashi,</i> the foremost among them. Perhaps someone with a discerning heart will understand, comprehend, and conceptualize these ideas better than I do, and offer a different interpretation that will fit the meaning of the words more closely. After all, the three commentaries on whose work our work is based (i.e. <i>Rashi, Radak</i>, and Rav Yitzchak Abarbanel) do not always agree regarding every matter.",
                "Nevertheless, since the commentary given does enable us to understand Yechezkel’s prophecy according to its simple meaning, there is no reason to reject it. It is possible that it is true. If, however, someone else will offer a different explanation of the verses that presents their simple meaning more effectively, I will happily bow my head in acceptance of it. However, it is impossible to say that the verses can be understood only in an abstract, metaphoric sense, when there is a way to understand them according to their simple meaning.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From the words of Rav Yitzchak Abarbanel (in his commentary to <i>Yechezkel</i> 45:1, portions of which are cited below), it is possible to surmise why <i>Tosafos Yom Tov</i> elaborates at such great length regarding the necessity to understand Yechezkel’s prophecy according to its simple meaning. In that source, Rav Yitzchak Abarbanel rebuts the argument advanced by Christian scholars who maintained that the prophecy should only be interpreted in a metaphoric, spiritual context, but that it was never meant to be understood in physical terms. Seemingly, <i>Tosafos Yom Tov</i> also felt it necessary to negate that interpretation.</i>",
                "There will be three portions of the <i>Terumah Gedolah:</i> a) <i>terumas hakohanim,</i> in which the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> will be located, b) <i>terumas haleviim,</i> and c) the <i>terumah</i> of the city of Jerusalem. Each area will be a square, measuring 25,000 measuring rods by 25,000 measuring rods. As explained in the preface,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">P. 20.</i> the angel’s measuring rod was 6 cubits long. Thus, the area of each of these sections will only measure 150,000 cubits by 150,000 cubits. Now, a <i>mil</i> equals 2000 cubits. Thus, these areas will measure 75 <i>mil</i> by 75 <i>mil,</i> as we stated at the outset.

                "This reckoning concurs precisely with the <i>mishnah</i> in <i>Taanis</i>, ch. 1,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Taanis</i> 10a.</i> which states that the prayers for rain were delayed 15 days after the conclusion of the Sukkos festival, to enable the last of the pilgrims to reach his home on the Euphrates River. The Euphrates is in the north of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, and serves as a border between <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and Babylonia, as stated in <i>Kiddushin,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Kiddushin</i> 71b.</i> and as stated by <i>Rashi</i> in his commentary to the verse in the beginning of <i>Yehoshua:</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yehoshua</i> 1:4.</i> “From the desert… until the great river, the Euphrates.” There are seven tribes whose portions are north of the Great <i>Terumah.</i> Thus, a festive pilgrim who sojourns in the city,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., Jerusalem of the Future.

If we round up the amount of <i>parsaos</i> in each area, the pilgrim will have to travel through 8 * 19 <i>parsaos,</i> or 152 <i>parsaos,</i> on his way home. However, as we explained above, each <i>mil</i> only equals 18.75 <i>parsaos.</i> Therefore, we now have to deduct the extra .25 <i>parsaos</i> we added to each <i>mil.</i> If we multiply .25 <i>parsaos</i> by the 8 <i>mil</i> the pilgrim is traveling through, we see that we have to deduct 2 <i>parsaos</i> from the 152 <i>parsaos</i> arrived at above, leaving us with a total of 150 <i>parsaos</i>. Our Sages calculated that a person walks 40 <i>mil,</i> i.e., 10 <i>parsaos,</i> a day.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Pesachim</i> 94a.</i> Thus, it will be a 15 day journey from Jerusalem to the Euphrates.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Mahadura Basra.

It is not at all far-fetched to say that the city will be that large. Indeed, Nineveh was,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yonah</i> 3:3.</i> “a three-day walk [wide].” How much more so can this be said of Jerusalem in the time of the Redemption, when many nations will stream to her.

                "To emphasize that the prophecies should be understood according to their simple meaning, Rav Yitzchak Abarbanel also cites Yirmeyahu’s prophecy concerning Jerusalem in the Ultimate Future, saying:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yirmeyahu</i> 31:37-39.</i> “ ‘Behold, days are coming,’ says God, ‘when the city shall be built… from the Tower of Chananel to the Corner Gate… and the entire Valley of the Corpses… as far as the brook of Kidron, to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east, it shall be consecrated to God.’ ” Rav Yitzchak Abarbanel asks: The names of these places are well-known landmarks in the surroundings of Jerusalem. Can it be said that the names of these landmarks should be understood in any way other than their simple meaning?",
                "Moreover, in this prophecy, Yechezkel speaks of the order of the sacrifices and how they will be offered, the dedication of the Altar, the service of the <i>kohanim</i> and the Levites, the portion to be given to the <i>Nasi,</i> his offering of his sacrifices, the presents he will give to his sons and servants, the division of the land into tribal portions and the gates of Jerusalem, mentioning them by name. All this clearly indicates that the prophecies are meant to be understood literally. Moreover, many of the matters described here by the prophet existed in the First and Second <i>Batei HaMikdash.</i> If then, those matters existed in a physical sense, why not say that the same applies to the Ultimate Future as well? Why say, that the prophecies must be understood only abstractly and metaphorically? Instead, “we will go forth in the name of God, our Lord,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Michah</i> 4:5.</i> maintaining the faith that this prophecy is to be understood simply, and that Yechezkel delivered it in anticipation of the Ultimate Future.

The same applies to Yechezkel’s prophecy. There will come a time when this prophecy will be fulfilled on the material plane. Since it has not yet happened, we must conclude that it is a prophecy for the future. It cannot be said that Yechezkel’s prophecy was fulfilled with the building of the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, because as we have demonstrated, this prophecy differs from that structure in almost every aspect.

            "See our opening statements.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">P. 21.</i> There it was stated that seven tribes received their ancestral portions north of the Great <i>Terumah.</i> This can possibly clarify the version of the <i>Sifri</i> favored by Rabbi Klonymus, and cited by <i>Rashi</i> in his commentary to <i>Parshas Shoftim:</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Rashi, Devarim</i> 18:2.</i>",

The intent of the <i>Midrash</i> is that this will also apply in the Ultimate Future, when the tribes will receive equal ancestral portions: five [tribes will have their portions] on one side of the Great <i>Terumah</i> and seven [tribes will have their portions] on the other side [of the Great <i>Terumah</i>]. Even in that future time, the <i>kohanim</i> and the Levites will not receive a tribal portion. Instead, “God will be their portion.” They will be given the portion in the <i>Terumah</i> to be dedicated to God, as we explained.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Sections 77-79.</i>",

Therefore, Yechezkel’s prophecy serves as proof that ultimately our people who have been dispersed in exile will return to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> from the four corners of the earth.",
            "Rabbi Akiva stated<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Sanhedrin</i> 110b.</i> that in the Ultimate Future, the Ten Tribes will not return to <i>Eretz Yisrael.</i> This does not contradict the prophecy mentioned above, for as <i>Rashi</i> explains,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Rashi, Sanhedrin</i> 110b.</i> Rabbi Akiva was only referring to the generation that was exiled: “This does not refer to their children and their descendants, but only to those who were exiled. [The exiled] do not possess a portion [in the land],<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Rashi</i> is teaching that even at the time of the Resurrection of the Dead, those members of the Ten Tribes who were exiled will not merit to arise and receive a portion of <i>Eretz Yisrael,</i> as is evident from the discussion in <i>Sanhedrin, loc. cit.</i></i> because they were utterly wicked men. Their children and their coming generations, by contrast, merit a portion in the land, and convey that right [to their descendants].” [The Talmud’s continuation of this discussion proves that Rabbi Akiva did not mean that the descendants of the Ten Tribes would not receive a portion in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>:]",
            "Ravva bar bar Chanah said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan: Rabbi Akiva departed from his ways of piety, as indicated by the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yirmeyahu</i> 3:12.</i> “Go and call out these words to the north,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The words, \"to the north,\" are referring to the descendants of the Ten Tribes, who were exiled to the north (See <i>Rashi, Yirmeyahu,</i> 3:12.).</i> saying, ‘Return O straying Israel, says God, and I will not visit My anger upon you, for I am pious, says God, and I will not bear a grudge forever.’ ”",
            "The Sages of the Talmud did not question Rabbi Akiva’s statements based on the passage in <i>Yechezkel,</i> which discusses the division of the land into equal portions among the twelve tribes. Thus, it is evident that all the tribes will return in their entirety. Each tribe will receive an equal portion, taking their place as an independent tribe. It would not be just that only a few of one tribe return, like those of the Ten Tribes who returned on Yirmeyahu’s urging, and yet receive an equal portion of the land as a tribe with a large population. Instead, the intent is that all the members of the tribes will return, and each tribe will receive an equal portion of <i>Eretz Yisrael.</i> Nevertheless, the Talmud does not quote Yechezkel’s prophecy as proof that the Ten Tribes will return, for [even according to Rabbi Akiva] the prophecy is speaking about righteous men, not those who were exiled. Therefore, the passage cites the verse from Yirmeyahu, “Return O straying Israel,” that indicates that even the wayward and wicked among Israel will return.",
            "The words, “I will not have My anger fall upon you, for I am pious,” indicate that according to the attribute of judgment, it could be expected that God would have His anger be visited upon the Jews. It is only as a result of His piety that God says, “I will not bear a grudge forever.” Instead, after a long exile, the Jews will be returned to <i>Eretz Yisrael.</i> The words, “I will not bear a grudge forever,” indicate that God’s anger will persist for a long time. It will not, however, last forever, and we can look forward to the time when the prophecy will be fulfilled.",
            "One should not interpret the Talmud as posing a question from the prophecy of Yirmeyahu – who preceded Yechezkel – because Yirmehahu’s prophecy was directed to the members of the Ten Tribes who themselves were exiled from the land. However, that is impossible, for Yirmeyahu did not begin his prophecy until many years after the generation that had been exiled passed on. To explain: The Ten Tribes were exiled in the sixth year of King Chizkiyahu’s reign.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>II Melachim</i> 18:10.</i> King Chizkiyahu’s reign continued for 23 years after the Ten Tribes were exiled.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This can be deduced from <i>II Melachim</i> 18:13.</i> Menashe, Chizkiyahu’s son, ruled for 52 years.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>II Melachim</i> 21:1.</i> Menashe’s son, Amon, ruled for 2 years.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>:19.</i> Amon was succeeded by his son, Yoshiyahu. Yirmeyahu’s prophecy began in the 13th year of King Yoshiyahu’s reign.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Yirmeyahu</i> 1:2.</i> Thus, there were 90 years between the time the Ten Tribes were exiled and Yirmeyahu’s prophecy. Since, “the days of our lifespan are 70 years,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tehillim</i> 90:10.</i> it can be assumed that the members of the Ten Tribes who were themselves exiled had already passed on. Moreover, certainly only those members of the Ten Tribes who had reached the age for which they would be considered liable for punishment before they were exiled would not be included in the Resurrection of the Dead. Thus, the Talmud is not using chronological evidence as its argument. Rather, by basing its statement on the phrase, “Return, O straying Israel,” the Talmud is inferring that even the wayward and wicked among the Jews will return and, hence, is questioning Rabbi Akiva’s statement.",
            "This is also implied by <i>Rashi</i> who, in his commentary to that passage, states that the verse implies that, “all Jews will return.” The word “all” implies even the “straying,” and certainly, the righteous. Even Rabbi Akiva does not differ. He never entertained the thought that the descendants of the Ten Tribes would not return, for it is not logical to assume that their descendants, who did not sin, will perish because of their ancestors’ sins, and not return to their land.",
            "For this reason, the Talmud does not challenge Rabbi Akiva’s statements by citing this prophecy, which indicates that the Ten Tribes will return to <i>Eretz Yisrael,</i> or by citing a previous prophecy of Yechezkel:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yechezkel</i> 37:19.</i> “Behold, I will take the staff of Yosef, that is in the hand of Ephraim and the tribes of Israel, his companions, and I will place them together with the staff of Yehudah, and I will make them one staff.” This prophecy implies that the Ten Tribes will return to the kingdom of Yehudah, and become one with the other tribes. In this verse, the word עץ, is translated as “staff,” and refers to a staff of leadership. The verse implies that all the people will return, and thus the Jewish nation will be fit to accept the sovereignty of the House of David. This concept is also reflected in a later verse in that same prophecy:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>:21-22.</i> “Behold, I will take the Children of Israel from among the nations to which they have sojourned…. I will make them into one nation in the land with one king…. They will no longer be two nations… two kingdoms.” This prophecy was not fulfilled in the era of the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> when many rebelled against their rulers and sought the kingship for themselves. True, the Jews were not divided into two nations, but they were divided into many factions.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">By citing these verses, <i>Tosafos Yom Tov</i> is emphasizing that this prophecy was not fulfilled in the era of the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, but rather will be fulfilled in the future with the coming of <i>Mashiach</i>.</i>",
            "The prophecy continues:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yechezkel</i> 37:23-24.</i> “Nor shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; I will save them… David… shall be king… they will follow My judgments” – i.e., the judgments that they despised previously and exchanged for idol worship – “and perform them,” observing the judgments, the statutes of our holy Torah, that they despised in the days of Yechezkel. This prophecy thus serves as testimony to the eternal nature of the Torah’s laws, indicating that they will not change. “They will dwell in the land…, they and their children, and their descendants forever.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>:25.</i> We were exiled from <i>Eretz Yisrael,</i> and have not yet dwelt in it. Thus, this prophecy has not yet come to fruition. Ultimately, it will. We will return and dwell in our land for all time.",
            "The prophecy continues: “My servant David shall be their prince forever.” This prophecy was not fulfilled in the era of the Second <i>Beis HaMikdash,</i> when the kings were the descendants of the Chashmonaim, who were <i>kohanim.</i> True, initially, there was a governor from the tribe of Yehudah, as mentioned in the words of Ezra,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Ezra</i> 6:7.</i> Chaggai,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Chaggai</i> 1:1, 2:2.</i> and Zechariah,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Zechariah</i> 4:6-10.</i> but his rule was not perpetuated.",
            "The prophecy further states:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yechezkel</i> 37:26.</i> “I will establish a covenant of peace with them; it will be an eternal covenant with them.” This is yet to be fulfilled. On the contrary, due to our sins, our people do not enjoy peace. That verse continues, “I will multiply you.” This prophecy also has not yet been fulfilled, as we are the smallest among the nations.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Devarim</i> 7:7.</i> Yechezkel’s prophecy continues with the promises:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yechezkel</i> 37:26-27.</i> “I will place My Sanctuary in their midst forever. My presence will rest upon them; I will be their God, and they shall be My people.” Similarly, this promise has yet to be fulfilled. On the contrary, in our era we ask, “Why is it said among the nations, ‘Where is their God?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tehillim</i> 115:2.</i> Certainly, we are His nation and He is our God, but the point of the prophecy is that the relationship will be obvious, that Divine favor will be manifest upon us to the extent that the nations of the world will recognize that the God of Israel is the true God, and that Israel is His nation, as the prophecy concludes,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yechezkel</i> 37:28.</i> “The nations shall know that I, God, sanctify Israel, since My sanctuary will be in their midst forever.” The implication is that the nations of the world will realize and acknowledge that, “I will be their God.” The nations’ realization will stem from the awareness that, “My sanctuary will be in their midst forever.”",

            "“He built the House of the Forest of Lebanon.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This building was a royal palace built by King Shlomoh, and was not part of the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>. True, our Sages (<i>Yoma</i> 39b; <i>Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer,</i> ch. 49) used the term “the House of the Forest of Lebanon” to refer to the <i>Beis HaMikdash.</i> Nevertheless, the building itself was a palace used by the king.</i> It was one hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high, [supported by] four rows of cedar columns.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>I Melachim</i> 7:2.</i> Each row of cedar columns was 100 cubits long, and there were 50 cubits between the first row and the last one, this being the width of the palace. “There were cedar beams (כרתות) above the pillars.” The pillars had openings between them like exedras do. Thus, the beams were like lintels over the door posts.",
            "These beams also served as support for the boards, the צְּלָעוֹת mentioned in the following verse:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>:3.</i> “the boards that were on the pillars.” [This phrase teaches numerous details about the building’s structure.] The boards are described as being, “on the pillars,” and not on the beams, because the pillars served as the main supports for the building. The beams merely strengthened the structure by joining one pillar to another so that the structure would be a single entity. The beams lay on their sides and did not stand upright. Thus, the phrase, “the boards that were on the pillars,” should be understood as meaning “the boards were on the beams that were on the pillars.” The beams were not mentioned in this verse because they were secondary.",
            "Alternatively, it is possible to say that the beams were not positioned above the pillars, and did not lie on the pillars. Instead, they were connected to the tops of the pillars, and were on the same level as the pillars. Rather than serve as a lintel atop a doorpost, the beams were like long planks that joined one pillar to another. They were thick, of the same breadth as the pillars, joining the pillars to create a level surface on top of them. According to this interpretation, the phrase, “the boards that were on the pillars,” can be understood simply: The boards rested on the pillars, because the beams were on the same level as the pillars. If that is true, the phrase “There were cedar beams above the pillars” must be interpreted as “on the higher portion of the pillars” and not as explained above.",
            "The צלעות, the boards, on top of the pillars, were fashioned from the same wood as were the pillars. Thus, it was as if there were pillars lying on the beams and pillars. This is indicated by the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>:6.</i> “And pillars and timber on top of them,” which <i>Rashi</i> interprets as referring to the wood that served as the boards.",
            "The palace had a ceiling made of cedar wood. The ceiling contained 45 cedar planks, which were placed on these boards. This ceiling was divided into three portions for the three spaces between the four rows of pillars.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Rashi, I Melachim</i> 7:4.</i> Each of these spaces contained fifteen cedar planks, their length extending over the width of the structure, from one row of pillars to the next. The width of the cedar planks, as they were placed one next to the other, ran across the length of the structure. The fifteen planks were not long enough to extend over the entire 100-cubit length of the structure. Therefore, shorter cedar beams were placed at the end of the structure. These beams were placed lengthwise, along the length of the structure. They were fashioned like a lintel at their ends so that they could be attached to the beams fashioned for them on either side.",

The word ְגַבֵּיהֶם derives from the word <i>govah,</i> which literally means “height.” The hubs are referred to as ְגַבֵּיהֶם because they are the highest part of a wheel when the wheel lies on the ground. Another reason why the text uses the term ְגַבֵּיהֶם to refer to the wheels’ hubs is because the center of a circle can be called its height, for all of its sides originate from it.",

The rungs were attached to the surface of the planks, and were not suspended above the planks. Between each rung was a frame on which there were forms of oxen, lions, and cherubs.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, the frames and the planks served as decorative coverings, hiding the wheels from view.</i> The planks reached above the frames, all the way to the wheels. They ascended on an angle, appearing like a cap, or a covering for wagons, until they reached the level of the wheels. The planks continued to be extended until they covered the wheels. However, the two sides did not meet in the center, and they were not covered from above. There, they had a round hole, a cubit and a half in diameter, over the center of the wheels. This covering was called<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>I Melachim</i> 7:31.</i> a כּוֹתֶרֶת, “a coronet.” The hole in the coronet was referred to as פי כותרת, “the opening of the coronet.” Although the word פי is normally translated as “mouth”, it can also be translated as “opening” as in the phrase, ופיה עגול מעשה כן אמה וחצי האמה, “its opening was round, like the craftsmanship of the stands, a cubit and a half in diameter.”",
