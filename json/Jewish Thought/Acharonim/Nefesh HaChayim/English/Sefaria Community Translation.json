However, here we will speak about the word, צלם, according to the simple explanation of the ראשונים of blessed memory. \"That is, the words, צלם and דמות, here are not to be read according to their simple inferences (meanings).  As it is written, \"For, what דמות  (physical characteristic or likeness) could be attributed to ה?\"  {For G-d is incorporeal and has no physical form.}  Therefore, its meaning is that there is within man a resemblance (to the attributes of ה).  As is written in Psalms, \"I was like a desert owl.\"  [Certainly,] King David was not saying that he became an owl with wings and a beak or that his (physical) appearance was changed into that of an owl.  Rather, he was like an owl (in certain aspects) -- that his actions in his wanderings from place to place became like that of a desert owl which lives in solitude and flies from place to place.  So too, according to the simple explanation of the ראשונים of blessed memory.",

It is well known that the definition of אלקים is that ה, May His Name be Blessed, is the source of all the forces in the universe, as it is written in the טור (that ה is All-Powerful).",
                "We say that ה is the בעל or the source of all forces.  Man and 'ה are להבדיל different.  When a man builds a building from wood, for example, the builder doesn't create or manufacture the wood from his own essence.  Rather, he takes wood which has already been created and re-orders them into a building.  After he has organized them according to his will, if he later forgets the building (and his focus is no longer upon it) the building continues to exist.",
                "However, when ה, May His Name Be Blessed, Created the universe, He Created (it) ex nehilo  (something from nothing) with an unlimited non-physical power/force.  From that moment, every power which exists within them and organizes them is dependent only on the fact that 'ה focuses His energy on them at every moment.  For if ה, May His Name be Blessed, would remove the strength/power of His influence from them even for a moment, they would all disappear into nothingness. ",
                "This is what the men of the Great Assembly intended when they instituted (the morning prayers) that \"'ה constantly renews His creation\" -- literally meaning at all times, at every moment, His creation is renewed.  As it is written/explained (in Psalms):  \"...He, Who Makes (present tense) the great luminaries...\"  It does not say that \"He Made\" (past tense)....",

                "This is the reason that 'ה, May His Name be Blessed, is called אלקים, which means the בעל (master, source, owner) of all of forces in the universe.  Any force or power that exists within the universe, emanates from Him, ית''ש, the בעל or source of all the forces or powers.  He continues every moment to infuse within them His power (which Sustains them); everything hangs in His hands at all times to change them or to order them according to His will, ית''ש.",
                "הגהה:  The name/שם of אלקים or the power of אלקים is not just reserved to 'ה as the שם of אלקים is also shared with every בעל כח which is found in the universe.  [As it is known,] each שר is referred to as אלקים.  As it is written, אלהי העמים (the gods of the nations).  As it says, כי כל העמים ילכו איש בשם אלהיו (each member of each of the nations will walk in the name of his own god).  Look the in זוהר ויקרא ח' ע''א, ובפרשת בלק ר''ח א concerning the phrase, ויבא אלקים (and the god came) as it says concerning Avi-Melech, Lavan, and Bilam...This is referring to their שר.  Each nation has a שר that was appointed over them to guide them.  Similarly, judges are referred to as אלקים.",
                "However, none of these forces have power of their own [essence] -- only that which 'ה, Himself, May He be Blessed, implanted within them in order to (be able to) rule over them.  Therefore, 'ה, May He be Blessed, is called, אלקי האלקים (The All-Powerful of the Powerful) and it is written, כי גדול ה' מכל האלהים (that ה' is greater than all the gods/powers).  It is written:  השתחוו לו כל אלהים (all the gods/powers will prostrate themselves before Him).  And also, all of the idolators will call Him G-d of gods.",
                "Therefore, they are called אלהים אחרים (other gods); meaning to say that they have no power of their own -- only that which was granted to them by the true source/בעל כח of them all, His Name be Blessed.",
                "Therefore, as it says in ירמיה י'א that ה' אלקים אמת (that ה is the true power/אלקים); He is the Master/Source of all true power of all and they all receive any power that they might have from ה Himself, May He be Blessed.  This is what is meant by ויפלו על פניהם ויאמרו ה' הוא האלקים (They will fall upon their faces and declare that ה is the true G-d/האלקים)."

                "For man’s good activities/actions, words, and thoughts sustain and give strength to the many forces of the Holy upper worlds and to which man adds holiness and light/radiance to them, as it is written, \"I have placed My words in your mouth to implant the very Heavens and to set the foundations of the world/universe.  As it has been said by the חכמים of blessed memory:  Read it not as \"your children,\" but rather \"your builders.\"  For they (the children who learn Torah and keep His commandments) set/build the upper worlds like a builder sets/orders his building and gives to them great strength/power",

Man, therefore, can cause incalculable destruction, ר''ל, to the many forces and innumerable holy upper worlds beyond calculation.  As it is written, \"The destroyers and the ruiners come out from your midst.\" [We ourselves cause the destruction.]  This may darken (מחשיך) and diminish (מקטין) their radiance, ח''ו.  Strength is thereby added to the other side (עומת) and to the progenitors/sources (מדורות) of spiritual impurity, ר''ל.",

For man was made (בצלם אלקים) in His likeness, etc.  Just like ה', May His Name Be Blessed, is the אלקים, the Master (בעל) of all of the forces (כחות) that are found within the universe which He orders and guides at every moment, thusly ה' has empowered [through] His Will, May He be Blessed, that man (האדם) should be sovereign (man opens and closes) [depending upon his actions] hundreds of  thousands of (upper) worlds and forces through each of his ways (הנהגות) and matters (עניניו) at each moment in actuality (ממש).  {Meaning not just when man fulfills His commandments and learns Torah, but ALL of man’s actions and matters, even the most mundane and seemingly trivial have great effects} according to the far-reaching effects (כפי שרשו העליון) of his actions, words, and thoughts.  It is as if man (כאלו) was also made a master of these forces/energies, just like ה, Himself (כביכול).",

Conversely, the opposite is true as well as we explained above.\"  (דחובי בר נש עבדין פגימו לעילא כו'. וכן להיפך כנ''ל)  Similarly, it states, \"Come and give power to ה' (תנו עוז לאלקים).  As the זוהר says in the beginning of פרשת בא regarding a פסוק in Jov:  כד בעאן לקיימא על אינון עובדין דישראל על ה' ודאי קיימין (When the accusing angels came to levy complaints against Israel for their improper acts, they stood on solid ground).  דהא כד ישראל עבדין עובדין דלא כשרן כביכול מתישין חילא דקב''ה (When Israel engages in improper actions, they weaken the power of The Holy One Blessed be He.)  וכד עבדין עובדין דכשרן יהבין תוקפא וחילא לקב''ה (But when they act appropriately, they give strength and glory to The Holy One Blessed be He.)  Concerning this it is written תנו עז לאלקים, meaning that might is given to אלקים when they act goodly.",

As a consequence of them (your activities), they emerge and go.",

A man should therefore give heart (take heed and consider) his actions when not good ח''ו the extent that they can reach (on high) to cause damage and destruction as a result of even a light (קל) sin ח''ו.  A Jew's sin can cause far more damage and destruction than that which was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar and Titus.",
                "Nebuchadnezzar and Titus effected no damage at all with their actions on high (למעלה) as they had no portion or roots within the upper worlds that they would be able to reach there with their (meager) actions (done in this world alone).  Rather, it was only because of our sins that we weakened and diminished the power of on high (למעלה) [at the very root].  The מקדש (Sanctuary) of ה was defiled [here by us by the spilling of blood, engaging in illicit relationships, and by involving ourselves in idolatry] which caused the defilement of the מקדש העליון.  It was through (our sins) that they, Nebuchadnezzar and Titus, had the power to destroy the מקדש של מטה (the earthly Sanctuary) of the lower realm [the earthly building] which represented the upper sanctuary (מקדש של מעלה).  As is said by our Rabbis of blessed memory, \"The flour (קמחא) had already been ground.\" [The בת קול revealed that Nebuchadnezzar and Titus merely ground flour that was already ground].  For our transgressions had already destroyed the upper Dwelling Place of the Holy upper worlds;  [Nebuchadnezzar and Titus] destroyed only the lower dwelling (נוה מטה).  {Had we, through our sins and transgressions, not destroyed the מקדש של מעלה, Nebuchadnezzar and Titus would not have been able to destroy the מקדש של מטה.}",
                "As King David, peace be upon him, prayed in Psalm ע''ד:  {The simple understanding:  When Israel had finally been given permission to build the בית המיקדש, for which they needed to chop trees, they regarded (יודע) this task as if they were bringing a gift of axes in the thicket of trees (בסבך עץ קרדומות) to (למעלה) on high.}  Rather, the נפש החיים explains that David prayed that [Nebuchadnezzar and Titus] should be regarded as if they had actually destroyed the upper [מרומים] realm, although truthfully, their actions did not touch/reach (לא נגעו) there [to the מקדש של מעלה] in any way, as we explained above.",
                "Similarly, the heart of any man from the holy nation should tremble to consider the holiness that is within his very frame/stature which encompasses all the powers and worlds as we shall explain in with the help of ה in Chapter 6 of Gate 2.  {Man is a counterpart, a blue-print, to all of  the forces and upper worlds in existence.}  Man is thus a blueprint of the upper dwelling (והמקדש העליון) which is the source of all of the forces (כחות) and worlds (עולמות).  The heart of man, in the center (אמצעיתא) of his body (גוף) [which contains his life force] corresponds to the most Holy part of the בית המקדש, the Holies of Holies, (קודש הקדשים) which is the center of the אבן שתיה (Foundation Stone) {upon which the לוחות rested [מסכת יומא דף ה]; the place where יעקב אבינו slept; the site of עקדת יצחק} which encompasses all of the root-source of holiness as chaz\"l have alluded to in the גמרא in פרק תפלת השחר:  \"A person should concentrate his thoughts to the קודש הקדשים during prayer.\"",
                "The זוהר in פרשת שלח explains:  Come and hear. When The Holy One Blessed Be He created man in the world, he set within him in an exalted physical form/appearance.  ה gave him might and power within the middle of his body (גוף), the resting place of the heart.  The same way that The Holy One Blessed Be made the universe as a single mass (חד גופא) with its heart (אבן שתיה) in its center from which all forces emanate which parallels the היכל and the קודש הקדשים upon which rests the Heavenly Presence and where the כפורת וכרובים וארון were placed, the heart of the entire universe, and from here everything is nurtured (מהכא אתזנו) [see there in greater length].",

Thereby, a man strengthens the forces of uncleanliness ר''ל within the house of the upper קודש הקדשים -- far worse than even the act of Titus who strengthened the forces of uncleanliness by bringing a זונה into the קודש הקדשים of the earthly מקדש.",
                "Similarly, any sin or transgression of a Jew when he permits the entrance of anger or evil thoughts/lusts into his heart ח''ו it is as if he brought an alien fire upon the altar.  Meaning to say:  A man in actuality through his thoughts and deeds brings a devouring fire to His house, which was our glory and splendor, May the Merciful One save us, May he be Blessed.",
                "This is what ה said to יחזקאל:  \"The Place of My Throne which I shall cause to dwell there within the midst of the children of Israel shall never again defile My Holy Name בזנותם (through their defilements).
