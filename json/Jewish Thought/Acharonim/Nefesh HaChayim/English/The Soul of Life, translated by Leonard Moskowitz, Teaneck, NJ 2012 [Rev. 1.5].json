    "versionNotes": "<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><b>Translator’s Introduction</b><br>The <i>Neffesh Ha-chayyim </i>is Rav Chayyim Volozhiner’s explanation, in four sections, of: 1) man’s nature and purpose; 2) how prayer is an essential expression of that nature and purpose; 3) how, while the nature of the Infinite Creator is essentially unknowable, His manifestation into creation carries with it a mandate for mankind; and 4) how involvement with Torah is the ultimate fulfillment of man’s purpose and the vehicle of his connection with God.<br>Early during my translation effort I contacted a few Jewish publishers to discuss publication. Most responded that they felt that, because it was so full of kabbalistic knowledge, the <i>Neffesh Ha-chayyim </i>should not be translated.<br>I was later surprised when in Elul 5769 (September 2009), Judaica Press published Rabbi Avraham Yaakov Finkel’s excerpted colloquial translation. I was less surprised that they left out the translations of the many sections they deemed too sensitive. After all, when I once approached Rav Meyer Twersky (Rosh Yeshiva at Yeshivat Rabbeinu Yitzkhak Elchanan and a direct descendant of Rav Chayyim Volozhiner) with a question about one word in Gate 3 of the <i>Neffesh Ha-chayyim</i>, he responded that the contents of that part of the book are <i>d’varim ha-ome-dim b’roomo shel olam </i>(literally “words whose positions are at the world’s pinnacle”; less literally “subjects of extreme holiness”) and shouldn’t be carelessly spoken.<br>When asked how I can justify offering this complete translation, I point out Rav Chayyim Volozhiner’s own words at the end of Gate 3, Chapter 3:<br><i>However, I reconsidered and noted that while this was proper for them in their generation, now a very long time has elapsed without a guide, and the ways of man are to follow the path that, led by his rational intellect, seems right, and the inclination of a person’s heart/mind’s thoughts is exclusively to fly-off in fantasies to wherever his heart/mind leads him. The most important reason is that this teaching has reached the general public, and is a metaphor espoused even by fools saying that every place and everything is absolute Godliness. And they aim constantly to deepen their understanding and to study it, to the point that it captures the heart/minds of the young and immature, and they determine their actions and behavior based on this rationale.</i><br><i>… A person must exercise extreme caution in this matter and constantly guard his soul-</i>Neffesh<i>. For if (heaven forefend) our heart/mind would fixate on this idea, to permit ourselves to act based on this idea, it’s possible for the effect of this (heaven forefend) to be the destruction of many of the holy Torah’s basic principles (may the Merciful save us).</i><br><i>… This is what brought me to initiate a discussion of this matter and to caution and distance others from errors that could be caused by this (heaven forefend), and to thoroughly understand what our sages (OBM) hinted at on this topic. And they are like all of God’s righteous ways, this being an era with a pressing and urgent need.</i><br>What was true in Rav Chayyim’s day is now, to our great sadness, even truer. Rarely a week goes by when I don’t encounter less-educated Jews who have been exposed to the concepts of <i>Ma-kome </i>and <i>Ein Ode Milvado</i>, not in a Jewish context, but rather in the context of popular culture adaptations of Kabbala, and Eastern religions. They have no sense of what our holy Torah and sages have to say on these topics. Their curiosity demands a response from a deeply Jewish perspective, and if we ignore their needs they will (and do) go elsewhere for answers. And they will (and do) act based on what they learn.<br>In his introduction to this book, Reb Itzele (Rav Chayyim’s son) further elaborated on Rav Chayyim’s purpose in writing this book, including how Rav Chayyim saw the <i>Neffesh Ha-chayyim </i>both as a book that would benefit the masses and as an entry way into the hidden aspects of Torah for those who had that capacity. Indeed, Rav Yosef Shani (Shabtai) recommended the <i>Neffesh Ha-chayyim </i>to my peers as an entry way.<br>I consulted some of the greatest Torah scholars of our community (including Rav Aharon Lichtenstein), and they did not oppose the publication of a translation.<br>In addition, this text has already been translated into a Western language, so I am not breaking new ground: Benjamin Gross published a French translation in 1986 [Verdier], with a Forward by the eminent philosopher Emmanuel Levinas.<br><br><b>Translator’s Recommendation for Order of Study</b><br>After repeated journeys through this peerless book, I recommend that the reader skip directly to Gate 1 to learn the four Gates in order. After completing them, go back to learn the Chapters that can be found between Gates 3 and 4, then Reb Itzele’s long Annotation (<i>Hagaha Ha-MHRY”tz</i>) and finally Reb Itzele’s Introduction.<br><br><b>Biographical Information about Rav Chayyim of Volozhin</b><br>For biographical information about Rav Chayyim of Volozhin I recommend Rabbi Norman Lamm’s book “Torah Lishmah: Torah for Torah’s Sake in the Works of Rabbi Hayyim of Volozhin and his Contemporaries”, and the chapter on Rav Chayyim of Volozhin in Immanuel Etkes’ book: “The Gaon of Vilna: The Man and His Image”.<br><br><b>Translation Notes</b><br>In the interest of offering the reader a clearer sense of how Rav Chayyim expressed himself, and in an effort to bring us closer to understanding his mental processes, I’ve tried to preserve his literary style. In most cases I’ve retained his sentence structures, and changed them only when the semantics would have been corrupted or compromised by its preservation. At first reading this may stress a reader of modern English, but I’ve found that after a while, Rav Chayyim’s style becomes familiar and pleasant.<br>As Rav Chayyim discusses at length, Hebrew has many names for God. In English I translate them as “God” followed by the Hebrew name in italics (e.g. God-<i>YHV”H)</i>.<br>In Hebrew, there are at least five names for the English word “soul.” I translate them as “soul” followed by the specific Hebrew word in italics (e.g. soul-<i>Neffesh</i>).<br>In some cases the Hebrew text includes implicit meaning. In these situations I’ve made the implicit explicit by adding a few words in square brackets.<br>When Rav Chayyim cites a book, I’ve included the Hebrew version of the book’s title in the translation’s text. To give the reader a sense of what those books are about, the first time they are mentioned I usually provide a footnote with an English translation of the title. This is not meant to imply that English translations of those books are available.<br>There are cases where a Hebrew word’s gender and number are important to the meaning of the text. When that is so I include the word’s gender and number in square brackets (e.g., “it [fem., plural]”). And when a Hebrew word is used in emphatic form (usually by being repeated), I include the note “emphatic” in square brackets.<br>When a Hebrew word or phrase is included, I’ve transliterated it in a contrasting font (e.g., <i>ahtzmoot</i>). Within each transliterated word, when neighboring transliterated syllables would not affect each individual syllable’s pronunciation, I leave them attached to each other (e.g., <i>neffesh)</i>. When, by being attached, two syllables could possibly affect each other’s transliterated pronunciations (e.g., <i>rakhoom</i>), I separated the one from the next by a hyphen (e.g., <i>ra-khoom</i>); each syllable is then written out as sounded in a manner that I felt was clear to me, a New York-born Jew. I did not include per-syllable accent/ emphasis notations.<br>In a small number of cases, where a single English word didn’t suffice to sufficiently capture the meaning of a single Hebrew word, I translated them as two words separated by a forward slash (e.g., <i>lev </i>as heart/mind, <i>ei-vehr </i>as limb/organ, and <i>yir-ah </i>as awe/fear). When I felt that my translation of a word or phrase had a particularly subjective element, I included a footnote that provides the original Hebrew or Aramaic text. The reader then has the opportunity to translate the text on their own.<br>Whenever Rav Chayyim mentions God or the sages of past generations, he generally appends an honorific (e.g., “God-<i>YHV”H </i>(blessed be He)”, and “the sages (OBM)”). In all cases, out of respect for Rav Chayyim’s sensibilities and somewhat to the detriment of English readability, I’ve left them in place.<br>Rav Chayyim occasionally extends the length of a single sentence well beyond what’s common in current English. Sometimes I’ve broken the lengthy sentence into a few shorter sentences. In others, I’ve divided the sentence into numbered sections that represent the structure of the original.<br>I’ve corrected a number of errors in the chapter and verse citations. I’ve noted when Rav Chayyim’s quotation from a citation differs from what is found in current editions.<br>I’ve also added numerous footnotes with explanatory commentary. In creating this translation I drew on five editions of the Neffesh Ha-chayyim: the 1824 first edition, the 1837 second edition, the 1861 third edition, the 1873 fourth edition, and Issacher Dov Rubin’s 1989 edition. Rubin’s edition, with its punctuation, in-line citations and Hebrew/Aramaic translations, was especially helpful. This translation sometimes differs from it in how the text is broken into individual sentences and punctuated.<br>For reference, I’ve included the 1837 second edition. It can be found at the end of the translation.<br><br><b>Acknowledgments</b><br>I offer warm thanks to my friend and chevruta Chaim Dolinko, who first introduced me to the Neffesh Ha-chayyim more than twenty years ago. I’m certain that he had no idea that he was changing my life in such a profound way.<br>Thanks to Yeshiva University’s Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS) for the use of their beit midrash and libraries, and especially the Mendel Gottesman Library for the use of a first edition of the Neffesh Ha-chayyim, and manuscripts and early editions of the texts that Rav Chayyim cited.<br>Thanks to Rav Meyer Twersky, Rosh Yeshiva at RIETS, for his shiurim in Sha-ar Alef (only) of the Neffesh Ha-chayyim at Congregation Bnai Yeshurun (Teaneck NJ), and for his willingness to provide me with the benefit of his understanding of many key phrases.<br>Thanks to Rav Aharon Kahn, Rosh Yeshiva and my Talmud rebbe at RIETS, for his support in this effort.<br>Thanks to Rav Gideon Lipovsky, who long ago introduced me to the Ariza”l’s Torah.<br>Thanks to my good friend Anna Olswanger, whose love of Jewish books inspired me to start on this translation.<br>Thanks to my good friend Sheri Prupis, whose encouragement provided incentive to continue working on this translation when doubts and difficulties arose.<br>Thanks to Rabbi Yechiel Wiener and Rabbi David Pahmer, Shoalim U’meishivim in the RIETS beit midrash, for their openness, good humor, availability and for their always thoughtful responses to my somewhat unusual questions.<br>Thanks to Donald Lewis Lively for his help in editing this book. Motivated solely by his love for Torah, his enthusiastic and professional assistance significantly improved this book.<br>Thanks to the respected rebbeim of my youth: Rav Yisrael Chait and Rav Zevulun Lieb. They taught me to love Torah and how to learn.<br>I offer my deepest thanks to my dear parents, my teachers, Joseph and Marcia Moskowitz (OBM), who spared no effort or expense to ensure that I grew up in a <i>ma-kome Torah</i>, and who provided me with a Torah education.<br>And lastly, thanks from the bottom of my heart to my dear wife Deborah Teplow for her unflagging encouragement and support for this project (and many others).<br><br><b>Error Reporting</b><br>If you note an error in this book or have a recommendation for its improvement, please send a note to:<br>moskowit@panix.com<br>or<br>lenmoskowitz@optonline.net<br>or<br>leonard.moskowitz@yu.edu</p>\n\n",

            "The motivation for this is that everyone who authors a text starts with an introduction at the beginning of his book. Some have the custom to inform us what to expect to unfold in the book. Some inform us of the book’s key purpose and the intention of its utility. Some follow the path of expressing that humility and fear of God-<i>H</i>’ precedes their wisdom, to humble himself using words of Torah, so as not to boast about his composition.

            "<b>Annotation: </b><i>It could be possible that the meaning of this verse (“excess speech only results in loss”) is that when, from our world-view, it appears that there is something lacking, it requires words to correct. But when there is no lack, why add more words?</i>",
            "And if I should seek to state the correct amount of praise for the honor of my father—the genius, the righteous, the famous (his soul rests in Eden)—I am naked of the power of understanding to evaluate the extent of his Torah and his righteousness. It’s not within my capacity to adequately recognize it myself, nor to acquaint others with it. My elders, scholars of Torah and geniuses, the greatest of the rabbis of our nation (may their lights continue to illuminate), who knew the powers of his accomplishments in the revealed and the hidden, for them it was pleasant to retell their memories of him, for that is vast. And about his book all will write. And indeed, the righteousness of his ways will fill the earth, and his actions will speak for him.",
            "Is there anyone who hasn’t had his attention drawn to note<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb.: <i>ah-sheir lo sha-ma kawl mahs-roo-keeta</i>—Lit.: heard the whistling sound</i> the praiseworthy acts that he did in the land, and the strength and power given him in the true Torah, and good and truthful acts that he performed—how additional greatness was awarded him<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Aram.: <i>hawt-k’naht b’r’voo yateera</i>—Ref.: <i>Daniel</i> 4:33</i>, as if he stands among God’s legions in heaven?",
            "He was the man who took upon himself the yoke of Torah in his time, in his land, as an expression of compassion. And he taught wisdom to hundreds of students. And he merited enlarging Torah, to teach and to explain. He heard and researched and corrected. And he built a great institution of learning that stands on three foundations: Torah, service<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb.: <i>avoda</i></i> and compassion<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb.: <i>oo-g’mee-loot cha-sa-deem</i></i>.",
            "And it’s not surprising that he earned merit for himself and enabled the public to be worthy of merit, for from his youth he bore the yoke of Torah with tremendous assiduousness. And at the age of fourteen he learned fixedly with his older brother, the genius, our teacher Simkha (OBM). And he acquired knowledge day and night. And our elders told us the story of how when the light of candles was not available, the light of the moon was enough for them to learn at night. And at that time they received the path of Torah from the rabbi of rabbis, genius of geniuses, the lion of the supernal residence, Rabbi Aryei Leib (in Eden is his resting place), the author of the <i>Shaagaht Aryei[*].</i>",
            "<b>Annotation: </b><i>And the genius, the author of the</i> Shaagaht Aryei <i>(OBM) was for some years the chief justice of our court here in this holy community, and was known to my father, my master’s (OBM) family.

            "By the time he was twenty-five he had completed the entire Talmud, and early and late <i>po-skim</i>, and he would learn Torah with his brother—the genius who is like the residents of heaven—our teacher Rav Shlomo Zalman[*] (his resting place is in Eden).

            "And beyond his learning, greater still was his service to his teacher (his resting place is in Eden). During the long period that he waited upon him, he illuminated to him the paths of revealed Torah and the wondrous paths in the recondite—this [emphatic] being the “seeing your Teacher before you”[*]. And the sections of the Talmud were revealed to him and wisdom shined brightly for him. And to him it seemed as only a short time that he learned before him in reverence and awe/fear, with trembling and great physical effort. From the River Dinoor<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">After death, souls immerse in the River Dinoor—a river of fire—to purify themselves.

In that same way he taught and informed his children and students about the great oceans that stood before him. Reverence for his teacher was upon him as a wondrous awe/fear, as if he was standing before him in the heavens. And when he began discussions of halakha and recalled the name of his teacher, his entire body would tremble and his appearance would change dramatically as a result of the flashing fire in his heart/ minds when he would think about his ways of righteousness and piousness, and his purity of holiness. And he acquired the light of Torah because his powers were strong in the qualities by which Torah is acquired. And from Eliyahu’s mantle<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb.: <i>ah-deh-ret eliyahu</i>—Referring to the prophet Eliyahu’s mantle which he cast upon Elisha when God selected him to be a prophet (<i>M’lakhim Alef</i> 19:19).</i> he donned humility and awe/fear.",
            "<b>Annotation: </b><i>Perhaps this matter that is mentioned in</i> Eruvin <i>13b: “...and if your eyes could see before you... ‘and your eyes will behold your teacher’” (Yeshayahu 30:20) is like the matter mentioned in the verse (</i>Sh’mote <i>33: 23) “and you will see my back, but my face may not be seen”. It can be interpreted per</i> Midrash Sh’mote<i>, chapter 3 on “I will be what I will be”—My names reflect My actions (and all of the details of the final outcome were included in the initial conception in thought). For that reason the initial conception in thought is called “face”, for it precedes. And the action comes later. And even within the conception in thought itself there’s the initial and overall/abstract [thought] which is hidden internally, and [also] the later thought that flows from the internal which is expressed as speech or action. (This is the knowledge that unfolds within the personality characteristics</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb.: <i>mee-dote</i>—which can also be understood as the lower seven s’feerote.</i><i>.) And it [emphatic] is recognized as the effect of action or in speech (which is action). But the earlier internal thought is impossible to express as speech, as in the context of “honey and milk under your tongue” (refer to</i> Chageega <i>13a [for more details]). And that is the supernal knowledge, as per the context of “a person can’t understand his teacher…” (</i>Avoda Za-ra <i>6b): that a student can’t grasp it unless his teacher illuminates the subject to a scholar who is then capable of understanding on his own. All of this are about thoughts in a person’s heart/mind, but in reference to Him (blessed be His name), for whom “My thoughts are not your thoughts” (Yeshayahu 55:8)—no one can conceive in any manner the general form of His thoughts, even supernal beings. And it’s only His thoughts that unfold to accomplish His actions that are recognizable from His action by each prophet depending on their level. And this is “and you shall observe</i> et <i>my back”, the “</i>et<i>” meaning to include the thought that unfolds to accomplish the action. And it is recognizable via the power of His actions, and it is described relative to the action. “And you will not see My face”—even via the powers of His actions, which come later than what precedes them, (and per the lessons about the word</i> yeir-oo<i>).</i>",
            "And great was the humility of my honored father, the genius (his resting place is in Eden). And he was clothed with all of its<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Torah’s</i> ways and paths. I will tell a few of his ways related to the path of humility, in being with the despondent or extolling being with the humble (<i>Sota</i> 5a). Both of these were apparent in him to any who are worthy, for from his youth through his old age he gave his soul-<i>Neffesh</i> to revive the spirit-<i>Ruakh</i> of the lowly, financially and with the righteousness of his generosity, and to be with the oppressed. And it was his crowning jewel, because the desperately poor rejoiced, because he drew them close with his right hand, and expanded their hearts/minds with soothing words, and with graceful words that arose from his lips.",
            "Additionally, among the ways of genuine humility are to genuinely despise and be repulsed by anything that has to do with the physical, to the point that they are considered as being nothingness and void, and not to experience any pleasure or attachment. And also to regard highly only God’s ways, so that their heart/minds would be open to Torah and service and holiness, so that they would rejoice only in God and so that they would prepare their heart/ minds to be a pleasant dwelling place for Him (blessed be His name), as is written (Yeshayahu 29:19): “The meek will increase their joy in God-<i>YHV”H</i>”, and per the verse that is often upon our lips when we stand in prayer saying: “And to those who curse me, may my soul-<i>Neffesh</i> be silent, and may my soul-<i>Neffes</i>h be like dust to all.” And further on: “Make my heart/mind receptive to your Torah and then my soul-<i>Neffesh</i> will pursue your commandments”. So too, anyone who knew my honored father the genius (OBM) can testify and tell of his great humility, that he would be offended rather than be offending, and was lowly in spirit before everyone. And regarding physical pleasures—he would be careful to absolutely minimize them, and he set about his ways without feeling pleasure. And even when old age arrived and he was afflicted with afflictions-of-love<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb.: <i>yee-soo-rei ah-ha-va</i></i> in his property and his soul-<i>Neffesh</i>, he accepted them with joy and a jubilant expression, without expressing sighs (as our sages state [Berakhot 62a] about those who accept affictions in silence), and he was in a happy frame of mind all those years when he accepted afflictions. And that righteous man only regretted that he had to support his physical needs responding to his illness. And behind closed doors his eyes would drop tears (and my eyes witnessed this, not a stranger). And even though his heart/mind was pained over it, he happily accepted his affliction that allowed him to minimize his perception of physical pleasure, to the extent that he paid no mind to pleasure or wounds<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb.: <i>l’oh-neg v’lo l’neh-ga</i>—Reb Itzele expresses these opposing physical states using two words spelled with the same three letters: <i>ayin</i>, <i>nun</i> and<i>-gimmel</i>.</i>.",
            "Anyone who witnessed the Sun at its peak saw it and was amazed. For despite subjugating his body and reducing his spirit-<i>Ruakh</i> relative to wordly values, in the same way his heart/mind took the opposite position regarding heaven’s values, donning an aspect of boldness and splendor, even unto the last shovelful of dirt thrown on his grave<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Paraphrasing Berakhot 8a</i>. His heart/mind was attentive to create a pleasant dwelling place for Torah, service and compassionate action. How very proud he was to advance God’s ways, to fight the Torah’s battles. And any <i>mitzva</i> that he began with a spirit-<i>Ruakh</i> of wisdom and boldness, he completed with a spirit-<i>Ruakh</i> of understanding and awe/fear of God. He regretted not one of his words, and publicized his fine thoughts before the nation’s multitudes. And all was done calmly and with words that were full of wisdom and which were received with ease.",
            "A central feature of humility is not to be moved by one’s good actions nor by the merit of the high standing that one has achieved. And to the extent that one’s actions and standing grow great, his intellect increasingly recognizes God’s (blessed be His name) greatness. In a similar way the spirit-<i>Ruakh</i> of God-<i>Elohi”m</i> increases his ability to be aware of his lack of abilities, and silences the sensation of the greatness of his own standing. And when he observes that others find it valuable to honor him, it’s too much<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb.: <i>mitz-ta-meik</i>—paraphrasing Shabbat 37b</i> and the behavior is repugnant to him[*], and reminds him of his lack of abilities, and to belittle himself so that his heart/mind doesn’t become proud (as we found in the case of Rav—<i>Yoma</i> 87a—when he saw large groups of people following him to honor him).",
            "<b>Annotation: </b><i>And using an homiletic approach, perhaps this is the second intention of what Rabbee Eliezer stated to his students (Berakhot 28b): “Be mindful of your friends’ honor”—that they should be careful that their own hearts/ minds don’t become prideful beyond the degree of honor that their friends use in relating to them.</i>",

                "And as Kohelet stated (12:14): “For every action, God-<i>Elohi”m</i> will bring to judgment, relative to all that is hidden... .” And it doesn’t say: “For God-<i>Elohi”m</i> will bring to judgment every...”. The reason for this is that the definition of “Elohi”m” is “Master of All Powers”, and when a man stands in judgment before Him (blessed be His name), the specific action won’t be judged in isolation; rather all the effects and results of his actions will be taken into account, be they good or bad, in all the powers and worlds. This is why he states: “...action, God-<i>Elohi”m</i>... .”",
                "And he said: “for every action”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">229</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb.: <i>kee et call ha-ma-ah-seh</i></i> and not “relative to every action”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">230</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb.: <i>kee al call ha-ma-ah-seh</i></i>. It is as was stated (Iyyov 34): “For a man’s action will he be recompensed.” And it is as was explained above (in chapter 6, in the notes), that from the instant it enters into the purity of a man’s thoughts to perform a commandment, immediately its impression is made above, in its lofty root, to build and to plant a number of worlds and lofty powers, as is written (Yeshayahu 51): “And I will place my words in your mouth...” and “to plant the heavens...”. And as they (OBM) stated (at the end of tractate Berakhot): “Don’t read it as ‘your children’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">231</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb.: <i>ba-nahyikh</i></i> but rather as ‘your builders’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">232</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb.: <i>bo-nahyikh</i></i>” as we mentioned above.",

When after the soul-<i>Neffesh</i> separates from the body, he ascends to delight and satiate his soul-<i>Neffesh</i> in the glow of the holy lights, powers and worlds that were increased and multiplied as a result of his good works.",
                "And that the sages (OBM) said (in Mishna Avot): “All Israel, there is for them, a portion <i>for</i> the world-to-come,” and didn’t say “<i>in</i> the world-to-come,” whose meaning would be that the world-to-come is prepared from the time of creation, a subject and a thing by itself, and if a person is pious he will be given a portion from it as his reward. Rather, the truth is that the world-tocome is [emphatically] a result of a person’s own actions, that a portion is expanded and added to and refined for himself via his actions. And therefore they said that all Israel, there is for them, for each one, a portion of the holiness and the lights and the brightness that he refined and to which he added <i>for</i> the world-to-come, via his good actions.",

                "And in contrast to this (Yechezkel 26:2) “I will be filled for it has been destroyed,” [when a person sins] he sets upright and emboldens powers and legions of the defiled and the <i>kleepote</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">234</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>kleepote</i> (“shells” or “husks”) are the remnants of the <i>kei-leem</i> (containers, vessels) that were broken at the time of creation, when they could not contain the “light” that was placed within them.

And those that drew the power of its soul-<i>Neffesh</i> from the side of ritual impurity and the “other side”, he didn’t select as a sacrifice before Him (blessed be He), for it would not have been acceptable.",

For the definition of <i>Elohi”m</i> is “master of all powers”, meaning that they grasped the matters of the upper and lower powers; the statutes of heaven and earth and those who enforce them; and the patterns of their behaviors, relationships and how they are assembled via all the contexts of human actions. According to this pattern and context, each one of them caused himself to act and behave in all his situations, because he saw and grasped the lofty rectifications according to the root of his soul-<i>Neshama</i>.",

And in truth, [the effect of these later-forbidden actions was] the complete erection of the House of Israel, the Chosen Nation, and the rectification of all upper and lower worlds.

            "And the four roots of the supernal man, they [emphatic] are the <i>tzellem</i> from which all the forms of powers in a person exist, as explained in the <i>Zohar Chaddash</i> (<i>Midrash Ha-neh-eh-lahm</i>, <i>Breisheet</i>, page 9a): “That the Creator (blessed be His name) created Man, and created him via the <i>tzellem</i>, and with form, and prepared him from four things independent one from the other: from fire, from wind, from water and from dust… .”",

            "And he invents:<br>An internal [aspects of the] model, so that by using it the internal aspects of the vessel could be made employing the media<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">458</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb.: <i>beit keebool</i>—literally “receptacle”</i> that he desires; and also<br>An external model that encompasses the external aspects<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">459</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb.: <i>dahf-nei</i></i> of the vessel, to delimit the external aspects in their thickness and dimensions according to his will. And the two of them are like one: a single <i>tzellem</i> and model.

And He created four roots from which he brought into existence the spiritual internal and encompassing <i>tzellem.</i>",
            "<b>Annotation: </b><i>And like “I am like a desert pelican” (Tehillim 102:7) means that just as the pelican behaves so as to distance itself from settled areas and to cry out day and night with a wailing voice, so too he</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">460</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Dovid Ha-mellekh</i> <i>distanced himself from his place and did scream and groan day and night. And the dominance of the component of the pelican’s black humor causes her depression—to cry out, and lethargy—to remain in her place in the desert. And so too as a result of the large number of his afflictions, his black humor overwhelms him and causes him to flee from the company of people and to cry wailing, as it’s stated (Tehillim 102:10) “For I ate ashes like bread, and mixed my drink with tears”—it’s the nature of those suffering black humor illness to have an appetite to eat charcoal and coals</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">461</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Both being black</i><i>, and to cry incessantly.

            "So now we understand the general aspects of tzellem and d’moot in relation to spirituality. For when the Creator (blessed be His name) desired with His simple will to create the world that would reveal the likeness of all the details of the world as they are, He emanated one power that the philosophers call hyuli<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">463</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Primordial</i>, and we call it either “power” or “light” or “will”. That is, that in that way He desired that His Will should be revealed via two powers: one that is drawn upwards (for example), and the second that would be drawn downwards (for example). And so that they shouldn’t be separated, He brought into existence intermediaries between them, like the example of “fire” that ascends upwards, and “dust” that descends downwards. But here “air” is close to the nature of fire, to ascend upwards, and it can also descend downwards; and “water” that even though it is drawn to the “air”—as our rabbis stated (Bava Batra 75b): “the altitude of a cloud is three parsa”—even so, they leave their high place in the “air” and descend to a lower place, to the “dust”.",
            "And even though when it comes to the spiritual it makes no sense to refer to “above”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">464</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb.: <i>ma-ah-la</i></i> and “below”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">465</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb.: <i>ma-ta</i></i>— and even more so in the case of the supernal emanated power—however the context of “above” and “below” is not only used in relation to changes of physical position.

In the same way is the matter of powers that ascend “above”, meaning that they are drawn to spirituality, to the level that’s the highest of the high; and when they descend “below”, meaning to the lower levels.",
            "<b>Annotation: </b><i>It makes sense to state using the methods of homiletic interpretation that “and you shall be only above…” is a condition and a command, namely that He (blessed be His name) promises us all the blessings mentioned previously only when we will be “above” regarding holiness, and we will not descend below to the level of the nations of the world. And it explains afterwards what that level in holiness is: “If you hearken to God’s-YHV”H, your God’s-ADoNa”Y commandments… to observe and perform” (Devarim 28:13). This is the uppermost of the high levels. “And do not turn away from any of the words…”—For in turning away from any of the things, even to the right side, you will descend (heaven forefend) to seek after other gods.[*]</i>",
            "<b>Annotation: </b><i>It’s also stated in the Zohar: “Torah without fear/awe and love doesn’t ascend above”—meaning that one who doesn’t have adequate passion and love for the words of Torah, and also isn’t fearful of parting from it like parting from life itself, even if he learns sporadically, it’s impossible for his learning to be accomplished at the highest level of his potential.</i>",
            "<i>Again addressing the topic homiletically, they likened love and awe/fear to two wings, like a bird whose two wings are broken, even so it’s essentially still kosher, as long as the lungs are not punctured, so that the sound of the Torah can be made to be heard, to fulfill (Yehoshua 1:8): “You should contemplate it day and night”.

            "And they [emphatic] are the essence of the Holy One’s (blessed be He) desire to create the four supernal roots, as they (OBM) expounded: “‘<i>Bereshit’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">489</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Translated as “in the beginning”</i><i>—F</i>or the sake of Torah which is called <i>reisheet</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">490</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Translated as “beginning”</i><i>,</i>and for the sake of Israel which is called <i>reisheet</i>”.

            "In that way the Torah is fully integrated from beginning to end, this being what is stated in the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Ehmor</i> 98b): “The entire Torah is [both] sealed away and revealed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">492</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb.: <i>sa-toom v’ga-lui</i>—Reb Itzele uses a number of words for different kinds and degrees of hiddenness.

            "This means that just as He (blessed be His name) is called “God-<i>Ei”l</i> who makes Himself hidden”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">493</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb.: <i>Ei”l mis-ta-teir</i>—<i>Mis-ta-teir</i> (hiding Himself) is the second term Reb Itzele used to denote a level of inaccessibility. “Hidden” is not as absolutely sealed away/inaccessible/not perceivable as “sealed away” (<i>sa-toom</i>).</i> (Yeshayahu 45:15), even though the worlds were created having many levels, relative to them He didn’t change. It’s only relative to them that He makes Himself hidden, so that it will appear to us that His actions have many levels, and so that we’ll grasp His (blessed be His name) unity from within the hidden-ness of the lowest level.",
            "His hiding Himself is entirely so that only in this way will be revealed to us the glory of His unity specifically in this manner, as will be seen in the coming Gates. And it’s known that the hiding of the shining light has a purpose, so that it will be able to be revealed by its sheath, as is explained in the <i>Zohar</i> (Bereshit 15a): “Being shielded within. this being its positive purpose, for the benefit of all.” Refer there [for more details]. And this is “hidden”, as a result of which it is revealed.",
            "So too our holy Torah, even though the most supernal of supernal sparks are concealed within it, within it can also be found levels that are the roots of the vessels of action, speech and thought, corresponding to a person’s <i>Neffesh</i>, <i>Ruakh</i> and <i>Neshama</i>. Hidden within them are the most hidden of the hidden, revealed to us via revealed aspects, the learning of which enables us to perform the commandments. Via the Torah and the commandments (written and oral Torah), we can draw upon and within ourselves <i>tzellem</i> from concealed worlds, and <i>d’moot</i> for the actions of our bodies from the revealed worlds. For that reason it also stated “sealed away”, and it causes it to become “revealed”, per His (blessed be His name) desire that we should grasp the hidden via the revealed.

Also, in the context of prayer, even though it is called “service using the heart/mind”, as was explained briefly above (the end of Gate 1), the essence of all commandments is the performance.

                "And to understand the matter of what the text stated: “…and with all your [plural] soul-<i>Neffesh</i>” regarding the service of the prayer, we must first explain the meaning and context of blessing Him (so to speak, blessed be His name) that we’ve noted a few times in the text: “and you shall bless God-<i>YHV”H</i>, your God-<i>Elohi”m</i>” (D’varim 8:10), “blessed is God forever” (Tehillim 89:53), “bless God-<i>YHV”H</i>, oh my soul-<i>Neffesh</i>” (Tehillim 103:1), and many others similarly. And also in the statements of our rabbis (OBM) we found (Berakhot 7a) that He said (so to speak) to Rabbee Yishmael: “Yishmael, my child, bless Me”, and so too the entire formulaic wording of all the prayers and blessings that the Notables of the Great Assembly<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">533</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Notables of the Great Assembly (Heb. <i>anshei k’nesset ha-g’dolah</i>) codified the prayer service.

                "And the matter of the word “blessed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">534</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb.: <i>ba-rookh</i>, the first word of most blessings.</i>” is not an expression of attributing glory and giving praise as is commonly accepted among the masses, for when He said to Rabbee Yishmael: “Yishmael, my child, bless me” (Berakhot 7a), he didn’t utter there any praise in his blessing, rather a prayer and a request for mercy<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">535</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Implying that God wants and needs (so to speak) man’s blessing, and that man effects something important via blessings.</i>.

The Talmud is discussing the case of a poor person who receives a loan and deposits a security article with the creditor. If the poor person needs the security article to survive, the creditor must return it, and as a result the poor person blesses the creditor. The Talmud then posits the case of a poor person who is a debtor to the Temple for a <i>hekdeish</i> contribution. The text states that in the context of this case, the debtor does not bless God. This might be taken as proof that God doesn’t require blessing. To counter that argument, the Talmud then brings proof from a verse about <i>birkat ha-ma-zone</i> (grace after meals) that one must bless God. It then teaches that the Temple need not return a security article for a <i>hekdeish</i> contribution, as it doesn’t fall in the category of charity, and that is the reason that no blessing of God occurs.</i>",
                "However, the truth is that <i>ba-rookh</i>, its meaning is an expression of increase and expansion, and consonant with the context of (Berakhot 7a) “accept, please, my <i>b’rakha</i>…” (<i>B’reishit</i> 33:11), and “and He will bless your food” (Shemot 23:25), and “and He will bless the fruit of your womb…” (D’varim 7:13), and many others similar to these in the text, so that it’s impossible to translate them as expressions of attributing glory and giving praise; rather [it’s] an expression of increase and expansion.",

And what is written (<i>B’reishit</i> 27:22): “the voice is Jacob’s voice”, that the voice of a man’s prayer arouses the corresponding great voice. And therefore the sages (OBM) expounded (<i>Ta-ah-neet</i> 16b) on the verse (Yirmiyahu 12:8): “she raised her voice against Me; therefore I hated her”—and they stated: “this is an improper leader of communal prayer”, as if to say that only his voice is present, but his voice doesn’t also cause the supernal voice to be aroused to join him. And when it says “she raised her voice against Me”, it means just that voice alone, and it continues “therefore…”.

                "For we found in a few places in the scripture and in the statements of our sages (OBM) that prayer is called by the name “soul-<i>Neffesh</i>”, because some of the important rules regarding the fundamentals of prayer are those derived from the story of Channa, and about her is written (Shmuel Aleph 1:15): “and I have poured out my soul-<i>Neffesh</i> before God-<i>YHV”H</i>”.

If one finishes praying and leaves before the other has finished, it’s as if he expects that the Sh’kheena departed when he finished praying, when in fact the Sh’kheena is still present to the other’s prayers. In response to this self-centered attitude his prayers are rejected.</i>. RaSh”Y explained: “It’s speaking about you, because you yourself caused that your ‘soul-<i>Neffesh</i>’ should be ripped to shreds in front of you. And what is [fem.] ‘soul-<i>Neffesh’</i>?

For if (heaven forefend) His energy would depart from them for even one moment, the space where all the worlds persist and exist would be nullified, and as is stated (Nechemyah 9:6): “and You enliven them all”.",

The Ariza”l, at the beginning of the <i>Etz Chayyim</i>, provides us with a description that can be considered a model of the process of creation, the process that bridges the infinite distance. With an exceedingly keen awareness of its deficiencies, he builds the model upon what he acknowledges is a fundamentally deficient temporal/spatial metaphor, describing the <i>Ein Sofe</i> as an infinite, uniformly distributed presence (so to speak).

And in <i>Eikha Rabbatee</i> at the beginning of the alphabetic section “<i>ah-nee ha-gevver</i>”: “She went and constrained her presence behind the column”, whose explanation there is: using the language of being hidden and covered (refer to the <i>Ahrookh</i> in the entry for <i>Tz-M-Tz-M</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">814</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The four Hebrew letters <i>tzaddik, mem, tzaddik, mem</i>.</i>). So too here [is found] the word Constraining, namely, being hidden and covered.",
                "And the intention is that His unity (blessed be His name), in the aspect of His essence that permeates all the worlds with absolute uniformity, is what we refer to as “Constraint” as a result of His unity that permeates all the worlds being constrained and hidden from our perception, per the context of: “Indeed, you are a God-<i>Ei”l</i> who conceals Himself” (Yeshayahu 45:15).",
                "And our conception of what we are able to grasp, of the extending/unfolding<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">815</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb.: <i>hish-tahl-sh’loot</i>—this word has the sense of something that is rooted above and then extends, unfolds, stretches, extrudes, unwinds, or radiates progressively only in one direction, in this case downward. An example would be an extension ladder based firmly on the ground that opens up progressively by extending upwards. Its root word implies relevance to the structure of a chain. We translate it as “extends/unfolds”.</i> of the worlds one above the other in various qualities, is what we refer to as “Channel”, which is similar to a channel that extends/unfolds. And this is what the Ariza”l stated, that from the perspective of the Constraint—namely from the perspective of His (blessed be He) essential unity in the worlds that permeates everything—from our perspective He appears to be constrained and concealed, while from the perspective of His essence it’s incorrect to attribute “above and below”. It’s only from the perspective of the Channel—namely, from the perspective of our perception that we, from our perspective, grasp the structure of the worlds using the metaphor of an extending/unfolding like a channel—that our perspective [that there exist qualities of] above and below is correct.",
                "(And despite that being so, that from the perspective of the Constraint, namely, that even though He (blessed be His name) constrained and concealed from our perception the light of His essential unity that permeates everything, even so, we [still] couldn’t attribute to Him “above and below” even from the perspective of our perception, if we were able to perceive an absolutely uniform degree of concealment in all places, like the matter of an encompassing sphere to which we couldn’t attribute the matter of “above and below”, or variations in place.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">816</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Chayyim seems to be saying that, even within the universe of constraint, if His essential unity permeating all the worlds was uniformly distributed, then from our perspective we wouldn’t be able to perceive it in any way. In reality we perceive, based on place, variations in the degree of revelation of God’s presence; because of that we are able to perceive God’s presence in our universe.</i> But from the perspective of the Channel, His Will (blessed be He) decreed that after the Constraint and the concealment we perceive the degree of concealment as not being uniform across all places equally. We perceive a range of perceptions based on variations in specific features, similar to the way a beam of light propagates, that it illuminates our perception to perceive the revelation of His (blessed be He) light in the worlds and diverse powers, so that the higher a world or power, the revelation of the godly light within it is greater.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">817</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From our perspective, we perceive more of God’s light in the higher worlds than we do in the lower worlds.</i>",
                "And also, our perception of the revelation of His (blessed be He) light in this world is also as a range of features and levels based on place, as the sages (OBM) enumerated (<i>Kei-lim</i> 1:6): “ten [levels] of holiness” and “three [levels of] holy camps”, one higher than the other in degree of their holiness. So from the perspective of our perception of the revelation of the Channel of His (blessed be He) light, it is correct to attribute “above and below” and all variations in places and diverse features and their specifics that are explained in the words of the Ariza”l. And this is also the context for the phrases “supernal God-<i>Ei”l</i>” (Bereshit 14:19) and “our God-<i>Elohi”m</i> is in heaven” (Tehillim 115:3), “residing in heaven” (Tehillim 2:4) and many others similar to them, that from our perspective it makes sense to say that in that place even we recognize a greater revelation of His (blessed be His name) godly light compared to another place, for the revelation of His (blessed be He) light has the quality of being concealed from our perception. And this is like the context of our Patriarch Yaakov (OBM) when he stood on the site of the Temple, as our teachers (OBM) interpreted “this is none other than God’s residence” (Bereshit 28:17), intending to convey that in this place as perceived by human perception, that there is only a revelation of His (blessed be He) godly light alone.)",
                "And this is the matter of the void and the vacant place that the sages (OBM) mentioned, and that the point of the matter of the Constraint was for the revelation of the containers. Namely, that His Will decreed, for reasons hidden with him, to conceal the light of oneness of His essence (blessed be He) within that space, the space where the worlds and creatures exist, to actualize in that way this wondrous situation, so that the existence of worlds and powers should appear and be perceived via a process of levels and extension/unfolding, and to illuminate them with revelation of His (blessed be He) light as a subtle light, with exquisite control and care, via an infinite number of attenuating partitions, until it is possible—thanks to the extension/unfolding and incredible attenuating partitions— that there should even be places that are not pure, and powers of impurity, and evil and husks, at the depths of the lowest levels, so that it appears and seems as if it is (heaven forefend) a void that is vacant of the light of oneness of His essence (blessed be His name). And we are unable to perceive anything but a very slight, subtle impression<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">818</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb.: <i>r’shee-ma</i>. This is an impression made (as if ) by something that was once there and subsequently departed, leaving only a subtle impression of it having been there.</i> and minimal amount of light like in the form of a Channel (as a metaphor), until when it finally arrives via the structure of levels and many attenuating dividers at the lowest of the lowest powers, the powers—the power of impurity and evil—we don’t perceive the revelation of His light (blessed be He) at all. And this is what was stated that the Channel of light does not extend to the bottom inner surface [of the sphere] and does not contact its bottom surface, and in this way are actualized qualities of “above and below”, refer there.

It is, however, in the state of Constraint, namely, having the quality of concealment alone, wondrous and hidden from our perception,<br>3. So that because of this constraint and concealment our entire perception is of the worlds via the process of extension/unfolding.<br>4. And the drawing down of the revelation of His (blessed be He) light within them is via the process of levels alone, like the metaphor of a channel as we previously discussed.",

And even one who involves himself with Torah and doesn’t do it for its own sake as it deserves, merits a good reward in this world and they do not judge him in that world. And come and see, it’s written: ‘Length of days at its right side; at its left side wealth and respect’—he has a good reward and serenity in this world.”",
                "Lo, even if a person is involved with His (blessed be He) Torah not for its own sake, but rather for his personal benefit—but only if it does not cause vexation (heaven forefend), about which our sages (OBM) stated (<i>Yerushalmi B’rakhote</i> 11a): “it would have been better if the placenta had suffocated him”, and they also stated (Shabbat 88b): “that it becomes like a fatal poison for him” (heaven forefend)—the Holy One (blessed be He) arranges a good reward for him, for he deserves to receive wealth, honor and peace of mind in this world, and he is not judged negatively in that world regarding the intention of his thought and inclination. And how much more so [this is true] if he didn’t intend in any way towards personal benefit, even though his intention was not specifically for its own sake (meaning for Torah’s sake), as I will write later in the third chapter of Gate 4 in the name of the Ro”sh (OBM), but rather the main aspect of his involvement with Torah is straightforward, resembling doing it for its own sake. Lo, involvement with Torah is very dear in His (blessed be He) eyes, more so than all of the other commandments performed for their own sakes in holiness and purity of thought, as is fitting<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">900</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Chayyim states clearly here that simple, straightforward involvement with Torah, even if not completely for its own sake, is more dear to G-d that all of the other mitzvote, even if they were performed in the choicest manner.</i>.",
                "As explained and proven plainly from the <i>G’mara Ah-rakhin</i> (16b): “Rabbee Yehuda the son of Rabbee Shim’on ben Pazi<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">901</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our editions of <i>Ah-ra-khin</i> actually says: <i>Rabbee Yehuda the son of Rabbee Shim’on</i>. See the <i>Sheeta M’koo-beh-tzet</i> there.</i> inquired: ‘Which of the two is preferable: rebuke for its own sake or humility not for its own sake?’ And he said to him: ‘Who would not agree that humility for its own sake is [most] preferable? For the master stated that humility is the greatest of them all. Then even when it’s not for its own sake it is preferable, because Rabbee Yehuda stated in the name of Rav: “A person should always involve himself with Torah and mitzvote, even when not for its own sake, because from doing it not for its own sake, he will eventually come to doing it for its own sake”.’” And thus it tells us that for the case of involvement with Torah, who wouldn’t agree that Torah not for its own sake is definitely preferable to commandments performed for their own sake, for we learned an entire <i>mishna</i> (<i>Pei-ah</i> 1:1): “…and <i>talmud</i> Torah is equivalent to them all”.",
                "And in the same manner our sages (OBM) differed (<i>Sota</i> 21a) regarding the advantage of Torah’s relative degree over the commandments, for the merit and light of the commandments persist both at the time of the involvement with them and when not involved with them; it [fem.] only shields from suffering but does not save a person from coming to sin. In contrast, the light of the Torah, even according to the final decision there, from all perspectives, while he is involved with it, it saves him from sin. And they stated in the Yerushalmi (<i>Pei-ah</i> chapter 1) that all the commandments taken together are not equivalent to even one word of the Torah, as will be explained later (G-d willing) in Gate 4 herein.",
                "Thus, even involvement with Torah not for its own sake is still preferable to performing the commandments for their own sake, if only for this reason: that from doing it not for its own sake, he will eventually come to doing it for its own sake."

For that reason it too is beloved of Him (blessed be He), because it is almost impossible to ascend from the ground to the heights if not via the steps of the ladder.",
                "And for that reason they stated (<i>P’sakhim</i> 50b): “A person should forever<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">902</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb.: <i>l’olam</i></i> be involved with the Torah and the commandments, even if not for their own sake.” They stated “forever” intending to convey “a fixed regimen”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">903</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb.” <i>b’kvee-oot</i>. The central question arises here what Rav Chayyim intended by “a fixed regimen” for someone who is starting on the path of “Torah for its own sake” . Did he intend by this phrase that one should have a study schedule of so-many-hours each day and each night from which one never deviates, or does he intend that one should study literally continuously, from the moment one arises in the morning until one retires to sleep at night? The <i>Ruakh Ha-chayyim</i> (2:2) (a compilation of Rav Chayyim’s teachings on the Mishna Avot assembled by his students), describes “a fixed regimen” as being a fixed schedule of spending half of his time, both day and night, studying Torah in the <i>beit ha-midrash</i>.</i>, meaning that when he is just starting, he isn’t required to do more than constantly learn with a fixed regimen<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">904</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heb.: <i>b’kvee-oot ta-meed</i></i>, day and night.",

Rather, the opposite—he should greatly strengthen his effort towards involvement with the Torah, and he should be absolutely certain that as a result of his effort he will arrive at the level of “for its own sake”. And that’s also the case regarding the commandments, in this same way.",
                "And one whose mind is filled with thoughts to denigrate and demean (heaven forefend) one who is involved with Torah and commandments even if not for its own sake, will not be cleansed of evil and will be held accountable in the future (heaven forefend). And not only that, but according to the words of our sages (OBM—<i>b’raita, Rosh Ha-shanna</i> 17a) he will be counted among those who have no share at all in the world-to-come (heaven forefend), and <i>Gehinnom</i> will end but their punishment will not end even then, and they are considered as heretics, informers and apostates. And in the <i>Mishna</i> too, at the beginning of <i>Perek Cheilek</i>, they counted the apostates among those who don’t have a share in the world-to-come. And they state in the <i>G’mara</i> there (Sanhedrin 99b): “Rav and Rabbee Chaneena both stated: ‘This is one who denigrated a Torah scholar’. Rav Yokhanan and Rav Yehoshua Ben Levi stated… that this refers to one who denigrates his fellow in the presence of a Torah scholar…”—he is also “considered an apostate”. And even if he says “Of what use are the rabbis? They study Scripture only for their own benefit. They study <i>Mishna</i> only for their own benefit”, he is in the class of apostates who denigrate Torah scholars, and he is also called one who acts insolently toward the Torah (heaven forefend), and lo, he has lost his share in the world-to-come (may the Merciful save us).",
                "And likewise Rabbeinu Yona (OBM), in <i>Sha-ar Ha-t’shoova</i>, listed the levels of severity of punishments. For the final level he listed the group about whom the sages (OBM) stated that they have no share in the world-to-come. And they included in that group those who denigrate a Torah scholar. And Rav Chayyim Vittal (OBM) listed him in the <i>Sha-ar Ha-k’doosha</i>, and also included him in that group. And the severity of his awful punishment is because he is among those who darken the light of the holy Torah’s high degree, and profaned it (heaven forefend) as Rabbeinu Yona (OBM) described at length there—refer there to the words of the holy one of G-d. (And he (OBM) wrote there that the core of the punishment of all those listed among that group is also only because of the profaning of the holy Torah’s honor, may the Merciful save us.)",
                "For because he demeans and denigrates another who is involved with Torah not for its own sake, he weakens the other’s involvement with Torah, and the other won’t ever be able to arrive at the level of “for its own sake”, to be a consummate Torah scholar. And this is certainly called “denigrating a Torah scholar”, and there is no desecration of Him (blessed be His name) and His holy Torah greater than this. And he demeaned and lowered its glorious splendor to the ground, down to the dirt, and also destroyed all of his own service to G-d (heaven forefend). For his own service to Him (blessed be His name) is not sustained as it should be among the congregation of Israel except via the actions of those Torah scholars who are involved with the Torah day and night. For the eyes of all of Israel are upon them to know what should be done in Israel, to instruct them regarding the path on which they should tread, and how they should behave. That being so, a person who causes Torah scholars to not be found among Israel, has totally destroyed his entire personal service of G-d (blessed be His name), for the congregation of Israel will (heaven forefend) be left without Torah and without an instructor, and they won’t know what could make them stumble (heaven forefend). And Rabbeinu Yona (OBM) wrote much the same, refer there [for more details].",
                "For that reason you must be careful in the opposite direction, to honor and to elevate with everything in your power anyone who is involved with and grasps onto God’s Torah, even not for its own sake, so that a righteous person will stay his path without weakening from it (heaven forefend), so that he will be able to proceed along it to arrive at the level of “for its own sake”.",
                "And so too, even if we should observe that for his entire life—from his youth to old age and extreme old age—his involvement with her was not for its own sake, you are still required to behave with respect towards him, how much more so not to denigrate him (heaven forefend). For as a result of his being involved with G-d’s Torah with fixedness, there’s no doubt that many times his intention was for its own sake, as the sages (OBM) promised (<i>P’sakhim</i> 50a) that from the state of “not for its own sake” one comes to “for its own sake”. The meaning of this is not specifically that by that he will come to “for its own sake”, so that ever after he will be involved with it, all the rest of his life, only for its own sake. But rather, that any time he learns on a fixed schedule for several consecutive hours, even though, in general, his intention was not for its own sake, even so it’s completely impossible that during his learning that it won’t enter his heart, at least for a short time, the desired intention of “for its own sake”.

And if he scrutinizes and doesn’t uncover a sin that he did with that specific limb/organ and in the manner that would be worthy of those specific punishments, measure for measure, he should consider them as caused by ignoring Torah, because regarding the sin of ignoring Torah the paradigm of “measure for measure” doesn’t apply, for its neglect (heaven forefend) touches upon his entire body, all places and all limbs/organs, as mentioned above.",
                "And the reason for this is as I wrote above in Gate 1, chapter 6.
