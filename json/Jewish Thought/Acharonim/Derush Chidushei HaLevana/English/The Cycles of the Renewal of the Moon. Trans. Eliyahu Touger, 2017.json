Let them serve as luminaries in the expanse of the heaven to radiate light upon the earth;” and it was so. God made the two great luminaries; the great luminary to rule the day, and the small luminary to rule the night, and the stars. God placed them in the expanse of the heaven to radiate light upon the earth, to rule during the day and during the night, and to make a distinction between the light and the darkness.

Instead, as long as the moon would stand together with the sun in one mystical bond, as a result of this, it was called “great” along with it, for even the tail of a lion is part of the lion and is called a lion.

The moon said before the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the world, is it possible for two kings to wear one crown?” God answered: “Go and diminish yourself.” The moon replied, “Master of the world, because I have suggested something that is proper must I diminish myself?” God answered, “Go and ‘rule during the day and during the night.’” The moon responded, “Of what value will that be?

Because the Holy One, blessed be He, said: “Let this goat be offered as atonement for Me for diminishing the moon.”",

        "Introduction": [
            "The two passages cited from the <i>Zohar</i> conclude with the interpretation of the concepts according to the Kabbalah<i>.</i> Therefore R. Moshe Cordevero<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Moshe Cordevero [5282 (1522 CE) – 5330 (1570 CE)], was one of the leading Kabbalists in the city of Safed.</i> in his text <i>Pardes Rimonim,</i> which is based entirely on the teachings of Kabbalah<i>,</i> in the portion entitled <i>Shaar Miut HaYarei’ach</i> (“The Portal of the Diminishment of the Moon”), cited these two passages at length. He interpreted them – and continuing that approach, also the passage from Tractate <i>Chulin</i> cited above – according to the teachings of Kabbalah<i>.</i> I, however, will do the opposite, for the passage in <i>Chulin</i> lends itself (more) to an interpretation according to its simple, literal meaning (<i>pshat</i>). True, the concluding portions of the passages from the <i>Zohar</i> follow the approach of the Kabbalah<i>.</i> Nevertheless, I found it possible to understand the initial portions <small>of these passages</small> according to their simple, literal meaning, and it is proper to do so. Although Scripture alludes to sublime realms, it speaks about matters on this lowly, <small>earthly</small> plane.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The wording used by <i>Tosfos Yom Tov </i>is found in the commentary of <i>Ramban </i>(<i>Bereishis </i>1:1) and Rabbeinu Bachaya (<i>Bamidbar </i>32:3). In contrast to this, <i>Rama </i>of Fano [R. Menachem Azaria of Fano, [5308 (1548 CE) - 5380 (1620 CE)], a leading Italian sage and Kabbalist in his text<i> Asarah Maamaros </i>(the <i>maamar </i>entitled <i>Chikur Din, </i>sec. 3, ch. 22) and <i>Shalah </i>[R. Yeshayahu HaLevi Horowitz 5325 (1565 CE) – 5390 (1630 CE), a sage who lived in Prague at the same time as <i>Tosfos Yom Tov</i>, but later moved to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>] in his text <i>Shalah, </i>(p. 13b ff., 161a ff.), switched the order of those words. These sages phrase the quote: “The Torah speaks in the sublime realms and alludes to this lowly earthly plane.” Thus, <i>Rama </i>and <i>Shalah</i> imply that the primary dimension of the Torah is its mystical truth that reveals a higher spiritual reality. That spiritual reality is reflected in the events and laws recorded in the Torah.<br>By emphasizing the original wording used by <i>Ramban,</i> <i>Tosfos Yom Tov </i>is highlighting that the wording <i>Rama </i>and <i>Shalah </i>used could lead to a wrong approach. One could understand that their intent is that the ultimate truth of the Torah is the teachings of Kabbalah<i>, </i>and the Written Law and the <i>mitzvos</i> are mere reflections of those sublime truths.<br>Furthermore, by basing his text on <i>pshat,</i> <i>Tosfos Yom Tov</i> underscored that it is the Torah as it exists on this physical plane – the simple, literal meaning of the narrative and the laws – that deserves precedence. Certainly, the simple meaning of the Torah’s narrative and laws reflects higher truths, but those higher truths are expressed through study and observance on this physical plane.</i> <small>This is reflected</small> in the approach of most commentaries, and <small>is summarized in the above-quoted principle</small> that “The interpretation of a Scriptural phrase never departs from its simple, literal meaning,” as Mar bar Ravina<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i> </i>The standard printed text of the Talmud attributes this teaching to Mar bar Rav Huna. However, there are texts which attribute it to Mar bar Ravina. Apparently, <i>Tosfos Yom Tov </i>was referring to these texts.</i> recorded in Tractate <i>Shabbos.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shabbos </i>63a.</i> If so, everything said concerning any verse should be interpreted according to its simple, literal meaning.",
            "Moreover, our lot is not to teach mystical secrets in public, as the <i>mishnah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Mishnah Chagigah </i>2:1.</i> states: “<i>Maaseh Bereishis</i> (‘the mysteries of Creation’) should not be expounded upon to two people and <i>Maaseh Mercavah</i> (‘the mysteries of the Divine chariot’) should not be expounded upon even to one <small>person</small>.” ",
            "And at its very outset, <i>Midrash Rabbah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis Rabbah </i>1:5.</i> states: “Let the lying lips be dumb;”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tehillim </i>31:19.</i> this means, “Let them be bound”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse in <i>Tehillim </i>cited by <i>Bereishis Rabbah </i>uses the word <i>te’alamna </i>(תאלמנה). The root of <i>te’alamna,</i> אלם, is also the root for the Hebrew words <i>ileim,</i> i.e. “dumb” or “unable to speak”, and <i>me’aleim, </i>“bind.” The <i>Midrash </i>is explaining that the verse should not be understood as meaning that the liars will literally be dumb. Rather, the lips of the liars will be bound closed.</i>…. “which speak against the righteous” – <small>this refers to the Ultimate Righteous One,</small> He Who is the Life of all worlds, “insolent words” – <small>this refers to teachings</small> that He has withheld from His creation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse in <i>Tehillim </i>cited by <i>Bereishis Rabbah </i>uses the word <i>assak</i> (עתק), which means “insolence”. This word is also the root of the word <i>he’etik </i>(העתיק)<i>, </i>which means “withheld.” Thus, the <i>Midrash </i>is explaining the phrase “insolent words” as referring to the words people use when expounding Torah teachings that God desired to be withheld.</i> “with pride” – <small>It is as if God says:</small> “I am amazed that in order to boast and say, ‘I can discourse on the mysteries of creation….’ “and with contempt” – “a person will treat My Glory with contempt.” For R. Yossi ben R. Hanina said: “Whoever aggrandizes himself through his fellow man’s degradation has no share in the World to Come. How much more so does this apply <small>when it is done at the expense of</small> the Glory of the Omnipresent.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10 </sup><i class=\"footnote\">Speaking about these mystical secrets publicly demeans God, for the common people who hear these teachings will misunderstand them and speak about God in manner that in truth deprecates Him.</i>What is written after <small>this verse</small>? “How abundant is Your goodness which You have stored away for those who fear You.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tehillim </i>31:20. The <i>Midrash </i>is praising those who refrain from teaching mystical secrets because of their awe of God and their fear to create misconceptions in the minds of their listeners.</i> <small>“For those who fear You,”</small> and not for those who degrade Your manifold awe. Let them not <small>have a portion</small> in that “abundant goodness.”",
            "There are public speakers who permit themselves to speak openly about reincarnation because the philosophers of the early eras<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tosfos Yom Tov </i>is referring to Greek philosophers like Pythagoras who introduced the concept of reincarnation (metempsychosis) into Western thought.</i> believed in that concept, as reflected in the writings of Rav Yitzchak Abarbanel<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Yitzchak Abarbanel was a scholar who lived from 5197 to 5268 (1437 CE – 1508 CE).

How much more so <small>do these words of censure apply</small> to those public speakers who, based on their own intuition describe <small>this-and-this person as a</small> reincarnation <small>of so-and-so</small> through allusions that they perceive from Scripture. Their listeners will accept these allusions as if they were received from Sinai, and this is not so. Indeed, the responsa of Rav Levi ibn Chaviv<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Levi ibn Chaviv lived between 5240 (1480 CE) – 5305 (1545 CE) and is known by the acronym <i>RaLBaCh</i>. <i>Ralbach</i> served as the Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem from 5285 (1525 CE) until his death in 5305 (1545 CE). <i>Ralbach’</i>s father was the redactor of the <i>Ein Yaakov. </i></i> (responsa 8 and 75) explicitly forbade speaking publicly about reincarnation.

Therefore, I will follow this path in interpreting these four <small>Midrashic</small> passages according to the simple, straightforward explanation.",
            "Now, the author of <i>Pardes Rimonim</i> did not cite the passage from <i>Midrash Rabbah.</i> It cannot be said that he was unaware of it, for he was thoroughly knowledgeable as is well known.

Indeed, he named that section <small>of his book</small>, <i>The Portal of the Diminishment of the Moon.</i> For this reason, he did not cite the passage from <i>Midrash Rabbah,</i> because that is not his focus.</i>",
            "I, Yom Tov, who is referred to as Lippman, the son of my revered father, R. Nassan HaLevi of blessed memory, saw that God granted me the potential to interpret these passages fittingly, in particular, the passage from Tractate <i>Chulin.</i> In the process, I also offered an interpretation for scattered verses, an entire psalm from the book of <i>Tehillim,</i> and the entire passage describing the fourth of the Six Days of Creation. I cherished this discourse dearly and gave it a distinctive name that reflects its content, <i>Chiddushei HaLevanah,</i> “The Cycles<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\"></i>20. We have translated the title as <i>The Cycles of the Renewal of the Moon</i>, instead of simply <i>The Renewal of the Moon</i> because the Hebrew title, <i>Chiddushei HaLevanah, </i>employs the plural term <i>Chiddushei. </i>With this choice of words, <i>Tosfos Yom Tov </i>is highlighting the fact that the moon continuously renews itself, and will experience a drastic renewal in the Ultimate Future.<i></i> of the Renewal of the Moon.”",
            "I maintain that these passages differ with regard to the titles with which Scripture refers to the luminaries. Initially, it refers to both <small>luminaries</small> as “great,” but then refers to one of them as “small.” On this basis, our Sages’ analyses of that passage differed in two respects. Firstly, each of the Sages derived a particular insight from the variation of terms found in the passage.",
            "They also differed with regard to the extent of the deviation from the initial pattern of creation – was it great or small, i.e., was there a major difference between the present size of the sun and the moon and the manner in which they were originally created, or perhaps the change was minimal, or maybe there was no change at all.",
            "Based on these concepts, I will give a general overview of each passage. Afterwards, I will focus on an analysis of the details of the passage from Tractate <i>Chulin.</i> I will cite all the commentaries I have seen regarding that passage and review them, explaining them according to my understanding and my study, with God’s help.",
            "On the basis of the above, I will explain the passage concerning the fourth day of Creation after first elucidating Psalm 8 of <i>Tehillim.</i> Afterwards, I will derive particular points and insights following the path established by all commentaries and lecturers."

                    "This passage does not focus on the apparent contradiction between the phrases, “the two great luminaries” and “the small luminary” as does R. Shimon ben Pazi,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"></i>1. <i>Tosfos Yom Tov </i>is referring back to the passage from <i>Chulin </i>60b, which he cited previously. because the author of the <i>Midrash</i> did not see these phrases as contradictory, and definitely not to the extent that <small>the phrases</small> are to be considered as <small>referring to</small> two separate, distinct stages of creation, as R. Shimon ben Pazi understands the text. Indeed, this interpretation also differs from that found in both the passages from the <i>Zohar</i> cited above, which also highlight a difference between the moon’s original creation and its present state – although, according to the <i>Zohar,</i> the difference is not as great as R. Shimon ben Pazi maintains. <i>Midrash Rabbah,</i> by contrast, does not see the verses as in any way contradictory, but rather as one integral description of the moon’s creation without implying that it underwent a change – that <small>the moon</small> was created as great and then diminished. Instead, the present state of both the sun and the moon is the same as their original state at the time they were created.",
                    "Scripture’s description of both the sun and the moon as “great” can be explained according to the words of R. Avraham ibn Ezra:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Ibn Ezra’s</i> commentary to <i>Bereishis </i>1:16.</i> If one will ask: The astronomers have stated that the planet <i>Tzedek</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tzedek </i>is the name with which the Sages refer to the planet Jupiter. <i>Tzedek </i>means “righteousness.” The Sages referred to Jupiter as <i>Tzedek, </i>because in many pagan systems of mythology, this planet was identified with their primary false deity whom the pagans believed was the source for righteousness and justice.</i> and indeed, all the planets and stars aside from <i>Kochav</i> and <i>Nogah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Kochav, </i>“planet” (or “star”) and <i>Nogah </i>(“brilliance”) are the names with which the Sages refer to the planets Mercury and Venus respectively.</i> are larger than the moon, why then are they both described as “great”? In resolution: The term “great” does not refer to the size <small>of the planets</small>, but to their light. The light <small>reflected by</small> the moon is much greater than the light of the other planets and stars because it is much closer to the earth. This is also indicated by the term Scripture <small>uses to refer to them</small>: “luminaries.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., by referring to both the sun and the moon as “great luminaries”, the Torah is emphasizing their light, not their size.</i>",
                    "Similarly, with regard to the wording of the <i>Midrash</i> cited: There is no contradiction between the verses, and even at the present time both verses are true. Both the sun and the moon are described as “great luminaries” because of the light each one shines forth. Afterwards, the moon is referred to as “small,” because it is smaller in size than the sun. Indeed, <small>the moon</small> is even smaller than all the stars and planets aside from <i>Kochav</i> and <i>Nogah.</i> Alternatively, <small>the moon</small> was called small because its light is less than that of the sun.",
                    "Nevertheless, the <i>Midrash</i> saw a difficulty in the verses: Why would <small>Scripture</small> demean <small>the moon</small> by calling it small after it was already extolled and exalted by being described as “great” together with the sun, even though both its size and light are lesser? Once prominence is ascribed to an entity, it is improper to retract and minimize its importance. Therefore, the <i>Midrash</i> explains that it was appropriate for Scripture to do so because the moon “entered into its neighbor’s domain.” <small>What does that mean?</small> As we see, during certain days of the month, the moon can be seen in the sky in the morning and the evening, entering the domain of the sun, as it were. Since the moon does so, <small>Scripture</small> minimized its honor and does not refer to it as great, but rather as small, for it conducts itself in the manner of petty people who flaunt themselves before those who are truly great saying, “I am like you.”",
                    "Thus, when R. Pinchas said: “With regard to all other <small>additional offerings</small>… The Holy One, blessed be He, said: “Bring an atonement offering for Me because I diminished the moon,” he was not speaking about diminishing the size or the light of the moon, because there was no change regarding these aspects. God diminished only the moon’s honor by referring to it as “the small luminary.”",
                    "Do not <small>question the interpretation I offered</small> for the moon being called “small” – that the moon was described in this manner because it conducted itself in the manner of petty people who flaunt themselves before all others. These explanations are in accord with the interpretation given by R. Avraham ibn Ezra in explanation of the <i>Aggadic</i> teachings in Tractate <i>Chulin</i> mentioned above,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibn Ezra explains that the passage in <i>Chulin </i>60b does not interpret the diminishment of the moon in a simple sense, but rather that it refers to the moon’s waxing and waning in its phases. <i>Tosfos Yom Tov </i>offers a different interpretation of that passage (see page 86ff.), but cites Ibn Ezra’s interpretation here because Ibn Ezra also refers to the moon as boasting and contending with the sun, as it were.</i> as cited in the <i>Akeidah,</i> ch. 37,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tosfos Yom Tov </i>is referring to <i>Akeidas Yitzchak, </i>by R. Yitzchak ben Moshe Aramah. This text is often referred to as “the <i>Akeidah</i>”</i> who states: The moon’s protests refer to the time of the alignment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The time of the full moon when the sun, the moon, and the earth are all aligned in a straight line. Hence, the disc of the moon is full. Such an alignment occurs every month. When the three bodies are on more or less the same latitudinal plane, a lunar eclipse takes place. Generally, however, they are on different latitudinal planes and hence, such eclipses are rare.</i> It is as if the luminaries are contesting with each other when they are at opposite ends of their orbits. When they are both filled with light it is as if the moon raises itself up to say “I will rule.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>I Melachim </i>1:5. Ibn Ezra borrows the wording of the verse that refers to Adoniyahu, who, like the moon, attempted to achieve greatness he was not destined for.</i> From that time onward, as soon as <small>the moon</small> departs from that point, its light begins to diminish. This is the diminishment referred to <small>by our Sages</small>. God commanded that a sacrifice be brought on the day that all of <small>the moon’s</small> light is eliminated. <small>The verse</small> speaks of “a sin-offering for God,” since God was the first cause for <small>the</small> light <small>of the moon</small> to be diminished, for He created <small>the moon</small> in a manner that it receives light from the sun and does not possess its own light.",
                    "True, the author of the <i>Akeidah</i> rejected Ibn Ezra’s interpretation of that passage, as I will explain in the appropriate place.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See page 70 below.</i> Nevertheless, we learn from this that our conception – that the moon conducted itself in the manner of petty people – is a valid approach, for the sage R. Avraham ibn Ezra follows a similar approach, explaining that the moon’s protest was issued because it sought to exalt itself, saying, “I will rule.”",
                    "The questions raised by the author of the <i>Akeidah</i> which led him to say that this passage should not be interpreted in this manner (as which will be explained below) do not apply with regard to our interpretation of this passage, for the passage teaches us two insights:<br>a) that one should not conduct himself in this manner <small>– encroaching upon another’s domain</small>. True, that is a simple concept and seemingly need not be taught. Nevertheless, here, it is important to emphasize because one might think that license was given for the moon to do so, as the passage continues. The passage teaches us that this behavior is unacceptable by showing that as a result <small>of entering into the sun’s domain</small> the honor of the moon’s name was minimized.<br>b) that the one who causes such conduct requires atonement.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That God, as it were, required atonement, since He structured the pattern of the moon’s appearance in the sky as such that from time to time it appears in the day, entering the domain of the sun as it were. <i>Tosfos Yom Tov </i>elaborates on this point further in the main text.</i>",
                    "Furthermore, from this narrative, we learn through a <i>kal vechomer</i> (<i>a fortiori</i> reasoning) that one who enters another person’s domain without permission is deserving of punishment that is too great to bear. Had we not heard about the punishment visited on one who enters another’s domain with permission, we would not know how serious it is to enter <small>another’s domain</small> without permission."

                    "Nevertheless, the concept that the one who causes someone to enter another’s domain with permission requires atonement mentioned by the <i>Midrash</i> seems to be self-contradictory.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If God created the sun and the moon in a manner that the moon would enter the sun’s domain, why would He require atonement for the moon’s action?</i> In truth, however, this is not so. To explain: When we search for the first place the concept of causation and license are mentioned, it appears to be the verses,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis </i>1:17-18.</i> “God placed them in the expanse of the heaven to radiate light upon the earth, to rule during the day and during the night, and to make a distinction between light and darkness.” From the verses, it is clearly evident that although the phrase “to rule” is used, “ruling,” i.e. exercising authority, is not an element of the distinction that is made, because making a distinction is mentioned separately in the verse. Instead, the term “to rule” refers to the sovereignty and dominion of these luminaries.  A question thus arises: Why does the verse mention ruling “over the day and over the night”?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although we originally translated the Hebrew words, <i>limshol bayom u’valaylah </i>as, “to rule during the day and during the night,” this phrase can also be translated as, “to rule over the day and over the night.” <i>Tosfos Yom Tov </i>is basing his question on this second interpretation.</i> The sun and the moon are not ruling over the day or over the night; they rule over the earth and its inhabitants. Therefore, it would have been appropriate to use less words, and say, “to radiate light and rule over the earth.” True, the verse preceding these verses also mentions<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid. </i>1<i>:</i>16.</i> “to rule the day.” Nevertheless, that verse did not mention radiating light upon the earth. Hence, the two concepts could not be coupled in that verse. In contrast, in this verse, it would have been possible to do so. ",
                    "For this reason, the author of this Midrashic passage postulates that the statement, “to rule during the day and the night,” explains the previous verse, “God made the two great luminaries; the great luminary to rule the day, and the small luminary to rule the night.” True, God originally made the luminaries, each one with a separate dominion. When, however, God “placed them in the expanse of the heaven,” He allowed for the possibility that both luminaries would rule together, during the day and during the night. Nevertheless, the verse does not explicitly state whether the intent was that one of them would be ruling during the day and during the night, nor does it specify which one would be given this sovereignty. Perhaps the intent was that both luminaries were given sovereignty <small>to rule during the day and during the night</small>. True, the day was allotted to the sun and the night to the moon. Even so, it could be said that neither the entire night nor the entire day was allotted to either one, and so the luminaries would share dominion during part of the day and part of the night.",
                    "There are many <i>Midrashim</i> from our Sages that emphasize that the creation during the Six Days of Creation had a unique purpose, <small>but the present form of certain entities is different</small>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tosfos Yom Tov </i>is explaining that just as the sun and the moon were created with a particular potential but afterwards, as they were placed in the heaven to function, that potential was adapted somewhat, so too we find other examples where the fundamental potential of a created being was modified so that it could function in a structured world.</i> For example, on the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis </i>17:1.</i> “I am the Almighty <i>Shaddai,</i>” our Sages commented,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis Rabbah </i>5:8.</i> “I am He who told My world ‘enough.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">God’s name <i>Shaddai </i>can be read as <i>she-dai, </i>“that is enough”.

                    "In this instance as well, from the fact that Scripture demeaned the moon by calling it “small” after first calling it “great,” the <i>Midrash</i> understands that the moon violated God’s intent, just as the earth was cursed because it violated a Divine command, as <i>Rashi</i> states.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Rashi’s</i> commentary to <i>Bereishis</i> 1:11.</i>",

As we mentioned before, there are two possible explanations for this: a) that they should function together for part of the time, or b) that one should have sovereignty even in the domain of the other, also ruling the entire day or the entire night. The author of the <i>Midrash</i> maintains that the intent that one of the luminaries was given sovereignty in the time allotted to the other refers to the sun because it is many times larger than the earth. Thus, even at night when the sun is found below the earth’s horizon, its light shines around the earth, since it is larger than the sphere of the earth.

Nevertheless, since <i>vilon</i> is only a shadow, the stars are visible. Thus, although the shadow prevents <small>the sun’s</small> light from being seen, it does not stand in the way of the sun’s sovereignty and rule.

Although the moon was not made in a manner that would permit it to be visible during part of the day and during the evening, nevertheless the moon still thrust itself forward and perhaps approached the light of the sun so that it would “rule during the day and the night.” Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, demeaned its name. Nevertheless, God did not rebuke the moon as He did the water, nor did He nullify its thought, because the moon had room for justification: it could have claimed that God was the cause of its actions in that He did not explicitly clarify which of the luminaries would be the one that would rule both during the day and the night, or whether both of them would.

Nevertheless, the moon did not return to its initial state, since it had specifically heard God say that the luminaries should rule “during the day and the night.” Even though He called the moon “small,” God also did not force the moon to return to its initial state, for He had been the cause for its act.

Nevertheless, according to the approach of <i>derush, </i>there is room for the interpretation that he will advance.</i> Thus, <i>Rashi</i> comments on that word:<b>In </b>their<b> domains</b> – Whenever a word requires a <i>lamed</i> at its beginning, a <i>hei</i> may be used at its end. <small>The verse refers</small> to the <small>actions of the sun and the moon</small> during the war against Givon, as reflected by the <i>Targum.</i>”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Yehoshua </i>10:12.</i> Similarly, <i>Radak</i> comments on that verse: <b>The sun </b><small>and the</small><b> moon</b> – In the war of Yehoshua…. <b>In </b><small>their</small><b> domains</b> – In the heavens, which serve them as a domain and as a home, as it is written:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid. </i>10<i>:</i>13.</i> “And the sun stood in the center of the sky.” The word <i>zevulah</i> contains an extra <i>hei</i>, like the <i>hei</i> of the word <i>lailah</i>, for the word is accented on the penultimate syllable. <i>Radak</i> is saying that the <i>hei</i> at the end of the word <i>zevulah</i> is extra and does not connote the feminine, just as the word <i>lailah</i> is masculine, as reflected in the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis </i>41:11. Hebrew words ending with the letter <i>hei </i>are often feminine. However, this does not apply when the word is accented on the penultimate syllable. In such words the <i>hei</i> is called “extra,” i.e. it serves no grammatical function. Thus, although the noun <i>lailah, </i>“night,” ends in a <i>hei, </i>since the word is accented on the penultimate syllable, it is quantified by <i>echad, </i>the masculine form of the number one.<i> </i>Thus, we see that <i>lailah </i>is masculine, not feminine.</i> “And we dreamt… on one night.” However, the way of the <i>Midrashim</i> is to give explanations even to extra letters.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As<i> Tosfos Yom Tov</i> will proceed to explain, in the mode of <i>derush</i>, the <i>hei</i> may be understood as feminine possessive.</i> Also, the phrase, “The sun <small>and the</small> moon” requires explanation because the words are written without the connecting letter <i>vav,</i> i.e., without the word “and”<i>.</i> Also, the term <i>amad,</i> “stood,” requires explanation because seemingly, it should have been written with a plural form. True, the singular form could be interpreted as meaning, “each stood individually,” as in the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid. </i>49:22. See the commentaries of <i>Rashi </i>and <i>Ibn Ezra,</i> who explain that the singular form of the verb “strode” is used with “maidens”, which is plural, for the reason <i>Tosfos Yom Tov </i>offers here in the main text.</i> “Maidens strode,” where a singular verb is used for a plural noun to imply that each one strode individually. Here, too, the intent is that both the sun and the moon stood individually. Nevertheless, there is room to explain, following the mode of <i>derush,</i> why the plural form is not used. Therefore, I maintain that the word “sun” in this verse can be understood as an introductory phrase, as if to say, “Let me tell you what happened concerning the sun.” Now, there are places in Scripture where the word “sun” takes a masculine form, as in the verses, “the sun emerged,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis </i>19:23.</i> and “and when the sun sets.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Vayikra </i>22:7.</i> However, there are other verses, e.g., “If the sun shines upon him,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shmos </i>22:2.</i> and “And as the sun was setting,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis </i>16:17.</i> where the word “sun” takes a feminine form. Thus, the word <i>zevulah</i> could be understood as meaning “the sun’s domain.” Thus, the verse could be interpreted as meaning, “The sun – the moon stood in its domain,” i.e., <small>to borrow the wording of our Sages mentioned above,</small> the moon entered the domain and sphere of the sun.",
                    "Moreover, I maintain that the Men of the Great Assembly alluded to this concept in <small>the wording they used for</small> the blessing for the luminaries in the <i>Shabbos</i> Morning Prayers, <i>kara lashemesh vayizrach or,</i> which is usually translated as, “He called to the sun and it shined forth light.” However, if that were to be its meaning, the phrase should have read <i>vizarach or,</i> as in the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Koheles </i>1:5.</i> “and the sun shines.” Moreover, it is unnecessary to mention the word “light.” It is self-understood; thus, the verse cited previously does not mention the word “light”. Instead, I maintain that the subject of the phrase “and it shined forth light” is not the sun mentioned in the preceding phrase, “He called to the sun.” Instead, it refers to the moon, which entered the domain of the sun and shined forth light. The sun responded in anger, and as a result, God “looked and ordained the form of the moon,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See also <i>Tur, Orach Chayim </i>281, which cites a variant version of that hymn.

This interpretation contrasts to <small>the statements in</small> the passage from <i>Midrash Rabbah,</i> which maintains that the moon did not undergo any change – neither a quantitative nor a qualitative one. According to that passage, the size of the moon did not change, nor did its light. Indeed, even the position of the moon did not change. Even though the moon entered the domain of the sun, the moon was originally located in the same heavenly sphere as it is presently located, and not in a higher one.",
                    "The passage from the <i>Zohar Chadash</i> on <i>Shir HaShirim</i> differs concerning this last point, maintaining that there was a change in the moon’s position, as will be explained.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Hilchos Yesodei HaTorah </i>3:1, <i>Rambam </i>writes:<br>There are nine spheres.

                    "This is what the <i>Zohar Chadash</i> meant with its statement: <small>The intent</small> is not that the moon was originally greater and superior <small>to its present state</small>. Instead, as long as the moon would stand together with the sun in one mystical bond, as a result of this, it was called “great” along with it, for even the tail of a lion is part of the lion and is called a lion.

Thus, the moon did undergo a descent, to become sovereign on a lower plane. Instead, the term עִלָּאָה refers to importance. The two terms רַב and עִלָּאָה, “greater” and “superior” that the <i>Zohar</i> uses are merely synonyms. Both terms imply that originally the moon did not possess any superiority over its state after its protest, neither with regard to its size nor with regard to the radiance of its light. Alternatively, we can say that the <i>Zohar Chadash</i> used the term רַב to refer to the physical size of the moon, while the term עִלָּאָה was used to refer to the quality of its light. The <i>Zohar Chadash</i> is emphasizing that the original state of the moon was in no way superior with regard to either of these aspects over its state after its protest. ",
                    "As such, the moon deserved to be called “great” and to be thus equated with the sun only because it stood “together with the sun in one mystical bond,” like the tail of a lion with the lion itself. Therefore, this teaching does not use the wording “two kings.” For how can a lion and its tail be called “two kings”? True, the tail of a lion is also called a lion. That is because it is part of the lion. However, it is not the lion itself. For this reason, the author of this teaching maintains that the moon’s complaint was expressed in its protest that it is not befitting for the King of Glory to use two crowns at the same time. Instead, He should wear one at one time and the other at a different time. The moon’s intent was that its honor would be increased by becoming a “head of foxes” rather than remaining a “tail of lions.” The Holy One, blessed be He, answered the moon by instructing it to go to the lower plane, where it would become a “head of foxes.” God cautioned the moon however, saying that “you will not achieve glory”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Shoftim </i>4:9.</i> in this manner, for you will be called “small,” because smallness is inherent to you.",
                    "We derive an appealing lesson from this narrative that was instilled in <small>our spiritual heritage</small> by the Sages of the <i>Mishnah,</i> who taught,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Avos </i>4:15</i> “Be a tail of lions and not the head of foxes,” emphasizing how necessary it is to guide a person against seeking imagined honor. Thus, we find many students contriving to receive positions of prominence even though they are not masters of Torah, nor masters of commerce. Nevertheless, these students seek to be recognized as men of prominence rather than sit before an elderly master who sits in the <i>yeshivah</i> and occupies a Rabbinic position, drinking in his words thirstily and serving him so that they can see the rulings and judgments he delivers and listen to his explanation of the laws.",

At this time, the moon does not reflect the sun’s light at all and the light of the moon is not at visible. (Were it not for the latitudinal distance between the sun and the moon, there would be a solar eclipse.) Subsequently, as the sun and the moon proceed in their orbits, the angular distance increases and a small crescent of the moon (the new moon) becomes visible. However, the interval when the new moon appears each month is not uniform. Each month, there are small variations.</i> The reason why the moon came to undergo such fluctuations is because it changed its position and ceased to cleave to the sun.

                    "This passage also intends to emphasize that the moon’s protests did not lead to any essential change from its original state, only to a change in its position and a change in its <i>mazal,</i> i.e., the moon’s influence on the other celestial bodies changed. For the term <i>mazal</i> (מזל) derives from the word יזל, as in the phrase,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bamidbar </i>24:7.</i> <i>yizal mayim,</i> “water will flow.” These changes – i.e. the change in the moon’s position and the change in its influence on the other celestial bodies – are the reason why the earlier verse describes the moon as “great” and the later verse that describes it as “small.”",
                    "There are two differences between this passage and the passage from the <i>Zohar Chadash, Shir HaShirim:</i>",
                    "a) According to this passage, the sun and the moon were never so strongly associated with each other to the extent that they were considered like a lion and its tail. Instead, the sun and the moon were separate entities. Nevertheless, the size and the intensity of the radiance of both these luminaries did not change. They remained the same after the moon’s protests as they were before.",
                    "b) The position of the moon did undergo a change. The position of the sun was always above that of the moon. Nevertheless, originally, before its protest, the position of the moon in the heavens was higher than it is now. For previously, the moon was located directly below the sun, above the planets of <i>Nogah</i> (Venus) and <i>Kochav</i> (Mercury). As a result of its protest, the moon was lowered and positioned below these planets.",
                    "We are forced to say that, according to the <i>Raya Mehemna,</i> originally the moon did not cling to the sun as the <i>Zohar Chadash</i> maintains. This is reflected by the moon’s protest, “Is it possible for two kings to use one crown?” For clearly, the moon wanted a crown for itself. Had the moon been on the same plane and clinging to the sun, the question of how two kings could use one crown would not have been fitting. On the contrary, according to that conception, two crowns would be used, as reflected by the passage from the <i>Zohar Chadash, Shir HaShirim,</i> which describes the sun and the moon as “two crowns.” Instead, according to this passage from the <i>Raya Mehemna,</i> originally, the moon was alone and not clinging to the sun. Rather, the moon was positioned directly below the sun, and it showered its influence on two kings, <i>Nogah</i> and <i>Kochav.</i>",
                    "One might ask: According to this explanation, the moon would influence the planets under it, and these planets would not be influenced by the sun. For since the sun was above the moon, the sun would not influence the planets under the moon. Seemingly, using this logic we can ask, since <i>Nogah</i> was below the moon and above <i>Kochav,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although according to secular astronomers, Mercury and Venus are located in different positions, <i>Tosfos Yom Tov </i>is following the order of the planets stated in <i>Rambam,</i> <i>Hilchos Yesodei HaTorah </i>3:1.</i> how could the moon influence <i>Kochav?</i> Why then does the moon speak of two kings using one crown? This is not a valid question, for our Sages of blessed memory did not understand the planets as being positioned in separate spheres one below the other. Instead, in the chapter entitled <i>Ein Dorshin,</i> they taught:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Chagigah </i>12b.</i> Rav Yehudah states: “There are two heavens, as it is written: “The heaven and the heaven of heavens belong to God, your Lord.” Reish Lakish states: “<small>There are</small> seven: <i>Vilon</i>, <i>Rakia, Shechakim</i>, <i>Zevul</i>, <i>Maon</i>, <i>Machon</i>, and <i>Aravos</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These names can be roughly translated as “the Curtain, the Expanse, the Clouds, the Abode, the Dwelling, and the Darkness.”</i> <i>Vilon</i> serves no function….<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As cited above, p. 22.</i> <i>Rakia,</i> in it the sun, the moon, the stars and the constellations are positioned, as it is written:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis </i>1:17.</i> “God placed them in the expanse of the heaven.” Thus, Rav Yehudah maintains that there are only two heavens – one for the sublime angels and one below it for the entire host of heaven. Although Reish Lakish maintains that there are more heavens, he agrees that the angels are located in the heaven called <i>Maon,</i> and the entire host of heaven found in the second heaven called <i>Rakia.</i> ",
                    "Thus, according to both Sages, all of the stars are located in the same heaven. Thus, <small>the</small> order <small>of the planets</small> does not require that they be positioned one on top of the other. True, our Sages maintain that the heavens are measured entities, with each one <small>having an area of</small> 500 years journey. Thus, while it is possible <small>that the stars are located</small> one above the other, it is also possible that they are all of different longitudes on the same latitudinal plane, or that some <small>stars</small> are of different longitudes on one latitudinal plane and other <small>stars are</small> on different latitudinal planes. Accordingly, it is possible that those <small>stars</small> which are of different longitudes – either all of them or some of them – are not on different latitudinal planes at all. One star is not higher than the other. Instead, the stars are on different places on a sphere that has no beginning or end. According to this conception, it can be said that the sun is positioned higher than the moon and originally, the moon was positioned higher than <i>Nogah</i> and <i>Kochav.</i> However, neither <i>Nogah</i> nor <i>Kochav</i> were higher than each other. Instead, they were merely positioned on different longitudes.",
                    "Thus, <i>Nogah</i> and <i>Kochav</i> were on the same plane below the moon, and the moon served as a crown for them. Therefore, the moon argued that it was impossible for two kings – i.e. <i>Nogah</i> and <i>Kochav</i> – to use one crown – i.e. the moon. God answered the moon, “Go and diminish yourself.” As a result, the shape of a <i>segol</i> – one point below two others – was formed. For the other two heavenly bodies, <i>Nogah</i> and <i>Kochav,</i> remained in their <small>original</small> position."

                    "The conception advanced here by <small>the </small><i>Zohar</i> leads to the question: What was the motivation for <small>the moon’s</small> complaint? After all, what difference does it make to the crown if it is being used by two kings? <small>Even</small> the <small>“kings”</small> themselves were not bothered by this. It appears to me that <small>this entire incident is related to teach us an ethical lesson related to the trait of </small><i>tzarus ayin</i><small>, a lack of generosity</small>. The moon’s complaint was motivated by a lack of generosity; it did not desire to provide a flow of influence to the two crowns under it. <small>The moon</small> couched its protest in a dignified manner, as if it was concerned with the “kings” <small>below it</small>. <small>God responded by</small> punishing <small>the moon</small> “measure for measure”, <small>in a manner that reflected the moon’s complaint</small>; i.e., the moon was prevented from influencing either of the “kings.” Below, I will elaborate further concerning this concept with God’s help.

                    "In Shlomoh’s time, <small>the people</small> feared God “as long as the sun and the moon endure, for all generations.” <small>Beyond the simple translation, that verse</small> can be interpreted <small>as an allusion to the desired state of the world</small>: The words עם שמש can be understood as meaning “in an ongoing manner”, for the sun’s light is unchanging, as it was in the past, so it is now. A similar interpretation can be given for the expression, דור דורים, translated as “for all generations”. דור, generation, shares a root with the word דירה, which means “dwelling”. Thus, this phrase means that the Jews’ fear of God will be established and permanent like a person’s dwelling is established and permanent. The notion of permanence relates to the moon, as reflected in our Sages’ discussion of the Greek conception of the movement of the heavenly spheres <small>as compared</small> with our Sages’ own conception:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Pesachim </i>94b.</i> <small>The Greeks maintained</small> that the stars and constellations are fixed in their positions, and the heavenly sphere moves. <small>Our Sages maintained that the heavenly sphere is fixed in its position, and the stars and constellations move.</small> Ultimately, the Sages conceded <small>to the Greek position</small>. Hence, <small>the Sages teach</small> that the term דירה relates to the moon and the other stars, for they are fixed in the sky. This concept is also reflected by another verse:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tehillim </i>19:5.</i> “In <small>the heavens</small> He made a tent for the sun.” The implication is that all the heavens as a whole continually revolve, while the sun remains fixed in its tent, “which will not be moved… or uprooted”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Yeshayahu </i>33:20. <i>Tosfos Yom Tov </i>borrowed the wording of this verse, which describes Jerusalem as a “tent which will not be moved…or uprooted.”</i> from it. <small>To illustrate by analogy: The sun in its “tent”</small> is like a person sitting in a ship; the ship proceeds and cruises on the water. Just as the ship moves <small>while the person is stationary, so too, the heavenly sphere moves while the sun remains stationary</small>. ",
                    "A further concept can be derived from the moon being associated with the phrase, דור דורים. <small>As mentioned, </small>דור<small> shares a root with the word </small>דירה<small>, which means “dwelling”.</small> The moon’s dwelling (דור) is above two dwellings (דורים), i.e., the “dwellings” of the two planets – Mercury and Venus – that were located below it.",
                    "Alternatively, that concept can be derived building on the explanation <i>Radak</i> gives to the phrase:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid. </i>22:18.</i> “<small>like</small> a sphere in a wide-opened land,” and to the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid. </i>29:3.</i> “I encamped <small>like</small> a sphere <small>around</small> you.” In his gloss to those verses, <i>Radak</i> explains that both verses should be understood as if the word “like” precedes the words “a sphere”; <small>i.e.,</small> it is as if the verses read ככדור, with a second <i>kaf.</i> Hence, <i>Radak</i> states, the initial <i>kaf,</i> referred to as <i>kaf hadimyon,</i> “a <i>kaf</i> of comparison,” is missing. The basis of <i>Radak’s</i> rationale is that it is more logical to say that <small>the </small><i>kaf</i><small> that is missing is the </small><i>kaf hadimyon</i>, than to say that the <i>kaf</i> which serves as one of the root letters of the word is missing. <small>Nevertheless,</small> I maintain that it is the <i>kaf</i> which serves as one of the root letters of the word that is missing, and not the <i>kaf hadimyon.</i> <small>My rationale is that</small> it is possible to explain that the absence of the <i>kaf</i> of the word’s root is alluded to by its vocalization sign, which appears under the <i>kaf hadimyon</i> in the word כדור, “sphere”. This is an accepted pattern in Hebrew grammar. <small>Taking this concept a step further,</small> since we see that a <i>kaf</i> which serves as one of the root letters in a word can be missing <small>as in these two verses</small>, why not say that the same concept applies to the phrase, דור דורים? Why not understand the phrase דור דורים as כדור כדורים, i.e., that the moon, the subject of that verse, is כדור, “a sphere,” above כדורים, “<small>two</small> spheres,” i.e. Mercury and Venus, for as is well known, all the stars and planets are spherical? If one will ask, where is the vocalization sign that indicates that the <i>kaf</i> was omitted? It is possible to reply that in the two verses cited previously, <i>Radak</i> understood that the <i>kaf hadimyon</i> was omitted, even though there is no vocalization sign alluding to the omission. Similarly, I maintain that in those <small>places</small> where it is possible to say <small>that</small> a vocalization sign – i.e., the <i>pasach</i> of the root letter <i>kaf</i> – was included as an allusion, it is preferable to say that is the intent, for this is more appropriate <small>according to the rules of grammar</small>. When, however, no sign can be found, <i>Radak’s</i> approach, that no allusion to the missing letter is necessary, may be followed.",
                    "Accordingly, the intent of the verse יִירָאוּךָ עִם שָׁמֶשׁ וְלִפְנֵי יָרֵחַ דּוֹר דּוֹרִים is that the people will fear God, “as the sun,” i.e. as the sun was originally, וְלִפְנֵי, “and before”, when the moon was “a sphere (כדור) <small>above two</small> spheres (כדורים).” Undoubtedly, were the order of Creation not to have undergone a change as a result of the moon’s complaint, the world would be in a more complete state of fullness and goodness. Know that this is true, for it is due to the descent of the moon that the entire concept of the waning and waxing of the moon came about. And as a result, <small>the state of the Jewish people</small> went through similar phases of ascent and descent, as indicated by the <i>Midrash</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shmos Rabbah, loc. cit.</i> that I cited.

                    "The passage from Psalm 72 cited above continues: ירד כמטר על גז כרביבים זרזיף ארץ, “May <small>his words</small> descend like rain on cut grass, like raindrops that saturate the earth.” Rav Avraham Ibn Ezra explains that the word זרזיף does not appear elsewhere in the <i>Tanach.</i> He interprets it as meaning “to saturate” or “to inundate.” This <small>relates to</small> the explanation given previously, that the <i>Raya Mehemna</i> understands that <small>the moon’s</small> protest was the result of its begrudging attitude, that it did not want to impart influence to the two planets. In this psalm, <small>King Shlomoh</small> is saying that this will not be <small>the ultimate state</small>. In the future, because the people will be God-fearing, the moon’s existence will be comparable to the original state of Creation, when the moon was a sphere above <small>two</small> spheres, and influence will be granted in abundance.

                    "<b>An Analysis of the Passage in <i>Chulin</i> 60b</b>",
                    "Before entering into an explanation of this passage, I would like to raise certain questions: i) The passage focuses on an apparent contradiction between the phrase, “And God made the two great luminaries,” and the later phrases, “the great luminary” and “the small luminary.” Why is it necessary to say there is a contradiction between these phrases? <small>In the present era as well,</small> when compared to the other celestial bodies, the light <small>of the sun and the moon</small> is great. Hence, they can both described as “great luminaries” (as cited in sec. 1 in the name of Rav Avraham ibn Ezra), <small>even though when they are compared to each other, one is greater and the other smaller</small>.",
                    "I researched texts that would discuss the difficulty in this passage – some which discuss it as a whole or and others that discussing particular details of <small>this passage</small>. Knowing that the <i>Maharal</i> of Prague<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"></i>1. Rav Yehudah Loewe of Prague, known as <i>Maharal </i>of Prague, was a renowned Torah sage who authored many works, including commentaries on the Talmud and treatises of Jewish philosophy and mysticism. There is some dispute as to the exact year <i>Maharal </i>was born, but all historians agree that he was born between 5272 (1512 CE) and 5286 (1526 CE). <i>Maharal </i>died in 5369 (1609 CE). Rabbi Loewe<i> </i>served as chief rabbi of Prague, and was one of <i>Tosfos Yom Tov’s</i> mentors. Here, <i>Tosafos Yom Tov </i>is citing <i>Maharal’s </i>text, <i>Gur Aryeh, </i>which is a commentary on the Torah, focusing primarily on <i>Rashi’s </i>commentary<i>.</i> was well-versed in all fields of knowledge, I opened his text <i>Gur Aryeh,</i> and I found the object of my search because he did discuss this passage. Nevertheless, <i>Maharal’s</i> treatment of the subject did not satisfy my desire, as will be evident from my citation of his words and my critique of them. True, to borrow the wording of our Sages,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Gittin </i>83b. The metaphor of our Sages has added significance in the present context, because the title of <i>Maharal’s </i>text, <i>Gur Aryeh, </i>means “The Lion Cub.”<i> </i></i> “One should not seek to refute the lion after his passing,” <small>i.e., it is not proper to question the words of a Torah sage when he cannot respond</small>. Nevertheless, our Sages also taught,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Berachos </i>62a, <i>et al.</i></i> “It is Torah and I am obligated to learn.” <small>In this spirit</small> I followed the example of our ancestors and teachers, whereby, that every later <small>scholar who perceives a statement as being problematic</small> turns to the <small>sages</small> of previous generations and raises questions if he has critique of his teachers instead of remaining silent. Others will see both the original work and the question, and choose that which they find more desirable. By saying, “One should not seek to refute the lion…,” our Sages were implying that critique of “the lion’s” teachings should be expressed with deference and respect. It should be realized that were “the lion” still with us, he might well have been able to resolve the questions asked concerning his words. The intent is not, however, to refrain from asking questions. True, the departed sage may well have had a resolution, but a judge can only rule on the evidence before him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Sanhedrin </i>6b.</i> Therefore, our Sages did not say, “One is not permitted to refute a lion….” This should suffice <small>regarding this matter</small>.",
                    "<i>Gur Aryeh</i> writes concerning this issue:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Gur Aryeh, Bereishis </i>1:16.</i> There are those<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Gur Aryeh </i>is referring to the comments of Ibn Ezra cited previously.</i> who raise questions regarding our Sages’ words, for the verse can be understood according to its simple meaning. <small>The sun and the moon are described as</small> “the two great luminaries,” because they are both great <small>in comparison to the other celestial beings. Even so, the sun is referred to as</small> “the great luminary,” because it is great in comparison to the moon. These <small>scholars</small> did not know the words of the Sages, for the wording of the verse indicates that <small>the sun and moon</small> were created <small>at the same time</small>, as it is written, “And He made… the great luminaries.” Now, since they are not identical – one is “the great luminary” and one, “the small luminary” – how could they have been created at the same time? For created beings that are different from each other were brought into being at different times.  How then was it possible for “the great luminary” and “the small luminary” to be created at the same time? This is the true interpretation <small>of the matter</small>.",
                    "And in <i>Parshas Pinchas, Gur Aryeh</i> writes:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Gur Aryeh, Bamidbar </i>28:15.</i> Rav Abraham ibn Ezra sought to interpret the matter cleverly and explain that he did not see any difficulty <small>in these verses</small> (i.e., the apparent contradiction raised by the author of the passage mentioned <small>does not present any difficulty for Rav Avraham ibn Ezra</small>), for the intent of the phrase “the two great luminaries” is that they appear greater than the other stars. <small>Nevertheless,</small> the moon can aptly be called “the small luminary” when compared to the sun. These words are mere prattle. Our Sages<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the Sages who debated the subject in <i>Chulin </i>60b.<i> </i></i> could also have offered such an interpretation. As we already explained in the beginning of <i>Bereishis,</i> such an interpretation should not be offered, since the sun and the moon were created at one time, and it is not befitting that two utterly different entities – one being described as “great” and one as “small” – be created at the same time, for they are opposites. Throughout the Creation, when entities were created together, they were equal. We are compelled to say that the verse, “And God made… the two great luminaries” implies that <small>the sun and the moon</small>] were created as equals, because they were created at the same time.",
                    "After begging forgiveness from <i>Maharal’s</i> honor and the honor of his Torah, I object to <small>Maharal’s</small> absolute renunciation of the position of those who question the interpretation he favors – saying that, “These <small>scholars</small> did not know the words of the Sages,” and his condemnation of the words of Rav Avraham ibn Ezra as “mere prattle” – for offering a simple explanation of the words of the verse. <i>Maharal’s</i> understanding of the source for the question our Sages raised in the passage from <i>Chulin</i> – that since the sun and the moon were created at the same time, they had to have been identical – is a reasonable thesis, but there is no <small>absolute</small> proof <small>of its validity</small>. Why then should <i>Maharal</i><small> reject the</small> interpretation of Rav Avraham ibn Ezra <small>so absolutely</small>, calling it “mere prattle”? How much <small>harsher</small> is <i>Maharal’s</i> statement that “these <small>scholars</small> did not know the words of the Sages”! Behold, there are three testimonies from the words of our Sages themselves, which were not concerned with the questions raised in the passage from <i>Chulin</i>. Without a doubt, the reason is that <small>these Sages</small> also understand the narrative <small>in </small><i>Bereishis</i> according to the simple interpretation advanced by Rav Avraham ibn Ezra and the other scholars <small>whom </small><i>Maharal</i><small> maligns</small>.",
                    "These three “testimonies” are the three passages that I cited before this passage <small>from </small><i>Chulin.</i> The passage from the <i>Zohar Chadash, Shir HaShirim,</i> explicitly states: “<small>The intent</small> is not that the moon was originally greater and superior <small>to its present state</small>. Instead, as long as the moon would stand together with the sun in one mystical bond, as a result of this, it was called ‘great’ along with it.”",
                    "The passage from its companion, the <i>Raya Mehemna,</i> also supports this view. The description of both the sun and the moon as “great” does not create a difficulty for <small>the </small><i>Raya Mehemna</i>, as it refers to “the two kings” as being <small>the planets </small><i>Nogah</i><small> and </small><i>Kochav</i><small> which were originally</small> below the moon and which are now above the moon. According to the understanding <small>of the </small><i>Raya Mehemna</i>, “the two kings” are not the sun and the moon, as the passage from <i>Chulin</i> infers. If so, <small>according to the </small><i>Raya Mehemna</i><small>, the term</small> “great luminaries” can refer to the sun and the moon, as is the simple interpretation, for their light is great when compared to <small>the light of</small> the other stars. Nevertheless, since the Torah later refers <small>to the moon</small> as “small” and does not suffice its reference to <small>the moon</small> by saying, “one luminary to rule the day and another to rule the night,” <small>the </small><i>Raya Mehemna</i> understood that the verse alluded to the diminishment <small>of the moon</small> in the manner which was explained <small>in section 3</small>. Thus, there are two passages that support the approach of Rav Avraham ibn Ezra.",
                    "The third <small>passage that</small>] supports <small>the approach of Rav Avraham ibn Ezra</small> is the passage in <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> which points out the difficulty in the Scriptural passage in that <small>God</small> demeaned <small>the moon</small> by calling it “small” after He originally gave <small>the moon</small> prominence and called it “great.” However, according to <i>Midrash Rabbah,</i> the description <small>of the sun and the moon as</small> “great” does not mean that they were formerly equal <small>in size</small>, but rather that <small>both the sun and the moon</small> were of greater prominence than the other <small>celestial bodies</small>. Nevertheless, <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> felt that an explanation was necessary, since <small>once the moon</small> had been described as “great” – even though it is smaller than <small>the sun</small> – Scripture should not have referred to it as “small,” for that is demeaning.",
                    "Thus, there are three faithful testimonies from the works of our Sages that indicate they understand that the verse should be understood according to its simple meaning and left at that. Therefore, there are no grounds for reproach against one who accepts this interpretation and does not see any contradiction between the fact that <small>Scripture</small> first referred to <small>both the sun and the moon</small> as “great” and afterwards <small>called the moon “small”</small>. Instead, these three passages <small>present</small> a different question: Why <small>was it necessary for Scripture</small> to call <small>the moon</small> “small” <small>after first calling it “great”</small>? From the interpretation of the narrative <small>in these sources</small>, it is obvious that they do not accept the rationale cited by <i>Gur Aryeh –</i> that the fact that the sun and the moon were created at the same time shows that they were created as equals in all matters. Why must <i>Gur Aryeh</i> hold to this rationale so forcibly and say that someone who does not accept it does not know the way of the Sages? We see that there were Sages who did not accept this rationale, as is evident from the fact that they did not see the contradiction between the two verses as presented in the passage in <i>Chulin</i>.",
                    "Furthermore, we find several verses that appear to contradict <small>this principle</small>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Maharal </i>was aware of this question, and offers the following explanation (<i>Chiddushei Aggados, Shevuos </i>9b): when the created beings are complementary, like heaven and earth, it is possible that they were created at the same time even though they are not identical.</i> For example, “God created the great sea-creatures.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis </i>1:21.</i> There are some who, like <i>Rashi,</i> interpret the verse simply, as referring to the <small>various</small> large fish in the sea. Now, certainly, not all <small>the large fish</small> are <small>of</small> the same <small>size</small>, as any sea-farer will relate. Even if one would say that – as is the <i>Aggadic</i> interpretation<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bava Basra</i> 74b.</i> that <i>Rashi</i> also cites – the verse refers to the Leviathan and its mate, <small>the male and female Leviathan</small> were not identical, as is evident from that Talmudic passage which cites the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yeshayahu </i>27:1.</i> “On that day, God will focus the attention of His hard and strong sword upon Leviathan, the extended serpent, and upon Leviathan, the crooked serpent.” <small>The Talmud notes that the word Leviathan is mentioned twice,</small> once referring to the male and once to the female. <i>Rashbam</i> explains that <small>the words</small> “the extended serpent” refer to the male, which is straight, like a door-bolt.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew describes the first Leviathan as <i>nachash bariach, </i>which we translated as, “an extended serpent.” <i>Rashbam </i>interprets the word <i>bariach </i>as meaning “a door-bolt”, for the reason <i>Tosfos Yom Tov </i>gives in the main text.</i> The words “the crooked serpent” refer to the female <small>Leviathan</small> that surrounds the entire world. Thus, even according to this interpretation, the two were not identical: one was male, the other female; one straight, the other crooked. <small>The same principle applies</small> with regard to Adam and Chavah, according to the interpretation<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Berachos </i>61a.</i> that they were created together as a two-faced entity. <small>According to this interpretation,</small> although <small>Adam and Chavah</small> were created together and fused as one <small>being</small>, they were <small>nevertheless</small> formed differently – one was entirely male, and one was entirely female. The same is true regarding the creation of the heavens. First, it is written:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis </i>1:1.</i> “In the beginning, God created the heavens,” and <small>then</small> it is written:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid </i>1<i>:</i>7.</i> “God made the firmament,” as explained by the commentaries.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The commentaries see an apparent contradiction between these two verses, and many of the commentaries have proposed resolutions. See, for example, the commentaries of <i>Ramban </i>and <i>Radak </i>to <i>Bereishis </i>1:1.</i> As cited in the previous section, there are at least two heavens, and they are not identical. Since the higher <small>heaven</small> encompasses the lower one, it must be greater than <small>the lower one</small>. In any event, the verses refer to all the heavens, which were created or made <small>with</small> one <small>act</small>.",
                    "Furthermore, King David <small>praises God</small> “Who makes the great luminaries,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tehillim </i>136:7.</i> using the present tense. <small>King David similarly uses the present tense</small> in the phrases,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid. </i>136<i>:</i>5.</i> “Who makes the heavens with understanding,” and, “Who spreads out the land over the waters.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid. </i>136<i>:</i>6.</i> Without a doubt, <small>God</small> “renews every day, continually, the work of Creation.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tosfos Yom Tov </i>is citing the daily <i>Shacharis </i>liturgy.</i> Unquestionably, were God to withdraw His Creative energy from the created beings, they would all cease to exist immediately.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tosfos Yom Tov </i>is emphasizing that Creation is not a historical event that happened at the beginning of time, but an ongoing process. This concept is explained in <i>Shalah </i>(<i>Asarah Maamaros, </i>Discourse 3 and 4) and at length in <i>Tanya </i>(<i>Shaar HaYichud VehaEmunah</i>)<i>. </i>The underlying concept is that since the world was created <i>yesh me’ayin, </i>i.e., existence came into being from an absolute void, its fundamental state is nothingness. Therefore, were God not to continually renew His creative energy, all of existence would return to that initial state of absolute nothingness.</i> Accordingly, it can be said that if <small>the sun and the moon</small> could both be considered as great luminaries even though they are not identical, because they are “great” in comparison to other <small>celestial bodies</small>, then the words of praise “Who makes the great luminaries” are appropriate, the intent being that the “great luminaries” brought into being at the time of Creation are renewed each day. If, however, one postulates that <small>the sun and the moon</small> were identical at the time of Creation, and the moon was diminished because of its complaint, how could King David <small>praise God as the One</small> “Who makes the great luminaries”? At present, they are not the same as they were originally. Thus, this verse also appears to contradict the logic advanced by <i>Gur Aryeh.</i>",
                    "Similarly, there are many verses which describe diverse entities as “great” even though they are not identical. True, it can be said that <small>these verses do not represent a contradiction to the above thesis, the rationale being that</small> since the entities <small>mentioned in these verses</small> were not created at the same time, they need not be identical. Nevertheless, according to this logic, at times <small>the term</small> “great” will have one meaning, and at times another. Thus, it weakens the strength of that thesis. Thus, the original question returns: Why are the verses considered as contradictory? In truth, there is no difficulty in understanding them.",
                    "ii) <small>The passage in </small><i>Chulin</i> states that the moon complained. Whenever <small>it is postulated that</small> there was a complaint, proof of such is necessary. This is because <small>if – as a result of the contradiction between the verses – one is forced to say that the moon was diminished,</small> it is possible to say that perhaps <small>God</small> immediately diminished the moon without it complaining at all. Instead, <small>God</small> recognized that the world could not be maintained when two kings use a single crown. Afterwards, because He diminished the size of the moon and did not diminish the size of the <small>sun</small> God might have offered the moon consolation on His own initiative. This idea will be mentioned in the fourth question. A parallel <small>to this idea</small> can be found in our Sages’ words,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis Rabbah </i>12:15, cited by <i>Rashi </i>in his commentary to <i>Bereishis </i>1:1.</i> “Initially, the Holy One, blessed be He, created the world with the attribute of Judgment. He saw that the world would not be able to continue, therefore, He blended the attribute of Mercy with <small>the attribute of Judgment</small>.” <small>Without a complaint having been issued, God realized that an adjustment had to be made to the initial state of Creation, and did so on His own initiative.</small>",
                    "iii) The moon’s words imply that its complaint was reasonable and justified. This is also <small>reflected by the fact that</small> God made several conciliatory gestures to <small>the moon</small> after diminishing it. If so, a great question arises: How is it possible that God made both <small>luminaries</small> “great” without realizing that it is impossible for two kings to wear one crown?",
                    "iv) If <small>one</small> assumes that originally <small>the sun and the moon</small> were identical, and that afterwards <small>the size of</small> one was diminished, it is more logical to say that God had the change of mind on His own initiative, realizing that it is impossible for two kings <small>to wear one crown</small>, and therefore, diminished one of the <small>luminaries</small>. What prompted the author of this passage to say that the moon issued a complaint? It cannot be said that <small>the fact that the size of the moon was diminished</small> is proof that the moon complained, because otherwise the sun would have been the one diminished. This is certainly not a viable argument: If the sun had been diminished, one would ask why the moon was not diminished?",
                    "v) <small>The passage quotes God as</small> saying, “Go and diminish yourself.” Why does <small>God</small> say “Go”? Seemingly, it would have been sufficient to say, “Diminish yourself.”",
                    "vi-vii) <small>God commanded the moon to</small> diminish <small>itself</small>. Why didn’t <small>God</small> diminish <small>the moon</small> through a Divine decree? Just as <small>God</small> spoke and <small>the moon</small> was created as “great,” so too <small>God</small> could speak and <small>the moon</small> would be diminished. Moreover, how is it possible for an entity to diminish itself? And if one would answer that the intent is that God would diminish it with His word, the wording used by our Sages is difficult, for <small>the passage states that God instructed the moon to</small> “Diminish yourself.” Instead, <small>the passage</small> should have said, “The Holy One, blessed be He, decreed: you shall be diminished.”",
                    "viii-ix) <small>The passage states that after God told the moon to diminish itself, the moon</small> protested: “Because I have suggested something that is proper must I diminish myself?” It appears <small>that with this statement, the moon</small> revealed the intent hidden in its original statement. <small>The moon’s original question,</small> “Is it possible for two kings…,” could have been understood as implying that it was willing to forgo its honor and be diminished. In that way, the difficulty <small>of having two kings using the same crown</small> would have been avoided. However, the moon’s protest: “Must I diminish myself?” indicates that its initial intent was that the sun be diminished and not the moon. This certainly reflects a severe negative trait and a sign of meanness. Even though the issue raised is legitimate, <small>the moon</small> is deserving of punishment. <small>Thus, the moon’s protest, “because I have suggested something that is proper must I diminish myself?”</small> raises two questions:<br> a) <small>The moon’s</small> claim is <small>a hollow one</small>. Since the moon admitted that its intent was that the sun be diminished, <small>following the pattern that God rewards and punishes His created beings</small> “measure for measure,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sanhedrin </i>90a.</i> it <small>was justified that the moon</small> be diminished. Of what importance then is the fact that the issue raised <small>by the moon</small> was legitimate? <br>b) God’s <small>response also raises a question</small>: Since the moon admitted that its intent was that the sun be diminished, why did God repeatedly seek to console it? Initially, when the <small>moon’s</small> intent was not apparent, and it was possible to interpret <small>the moon’s</small> statement as implying that it was willing to waive its honor and diminish itself, and hence <small>God</small> decreed that it should be diminished, <small>the need for conciliatory gestures is understood</small>. But once <small>the moon</small> revealed that its intent was that the sun be diminished, <small>why were these gestures necessary</small>? True, one might say that, at the outset, God decreed that the moon should be diminished because either way, it was the appropriate thing to do. For if the moon intended that it be diminished, waiving its honor, <small>the moon’s diminishment</small> would be done according to <small>its own</small> will. And if <small>the moon’s</small> intent was that the sun be diminished, then it was appropriate that the moon be diminished <small>for its meanness</small>. Even so, the question still remains: Why did God repeatedly offer the moon conciliatory gestures? On the contrary, <small>the moon proved it</small> was <small>deserving</small> of being diminished <small>when</small> it revealed its intent that the sun be diminished.",
                    "x) <small>The passage quotes the moon as saying: “because I have suggested something that is proper must I diminish myself?”</small> Is the fact that <small>the moon</small> made a proper suggestion sufficient <small>justification</small> for it not to be diminished? For if <small>the moon</small> would not be diminished, there would still be two kings with one crown. And if the moon’s intent was that the sun should be diminished, then <small>the moon</small>] revealed its flaw in character, and <small>proved that</small> it is fitting that it be diminished anyway, as stated above.",
                    "xi) Since the wording, “must I diminish myself,” which <small>the moon</small> used, employs the future tense, it is apparent that the moon had yet to carry out God’s decree <small>and diminish itself</small>. From the fact that <small>God offered the moon</small> several conciliatory gestures, it appears that <small>the moon’s arguments</small> were accepted. If so, why did God not rescind His decree and fulfill the moon’s <small>request</small>? Nothing is beyond God’s capacity, and there is certainly another way that He could have resolved the difficulty of two kings using the same crown. There is no reason to say God <small>did not rescind His decree was because once a Divine decree is issued</small>, God does not desire to retract it, as reflected <small>in the interpretation of</small> Yirmeyahu’s statement:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yirmeyahu </i>28:9.</i> “<small>Regarding</small> the prophet who will prophesy <small>promising</small> peace, when the words of the prophet will come to fruition, it will be made known that God truly sent him.” <i>Rashi,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Rashi</i>’s<i> </i>commentary to<i> Yirmeyahu </i>28:7.</i> based on the <i>Midrash Tanchuma,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Midrash Tanchuma, Parshas Masei, </i>sec. 7.</i> explains that if a prophet prophesies that negative events will occur, the fact that his prophecy does not materialize is not a proof that he is a false prophet, for God is patient and relents, and may withold harmful consequences. <i>Radak</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Radak</i>’s<i> </i>commentary to <i>Yirmeyahu, loc. cit.</i></i> offers a similar explanation, supporting <small>his words through the example of God’s retraction of the prophecy of doom for</small> Nineveh. A prophecy for good, by contrast, will certainly materialize. True, it is possible that <small>a prophecy for good</small> will <small>later</small> be annulled as a result of sin, as reflected in Yirmeyahu’s words:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yirmeyahu </i>18:9-10.</i> “If at any time, I speak concerning a nation… to build it and to plant it… if they do what is evil in My eyes, I will retract the good.” <small>Nevertheless, at least initially, the positive prophecy will be fulfilled.</small> In a similar vein, the <i>Talmud Yerushalmi</i> states<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Talmud Yerushalmi, Sanhedrin </i>11:5.</i> that when <small>the false</small> prophet <small>Chananyah ben Azur</small> challenged Yirmeyahu to prove his words, Yirmeyahu answered him: I am prophesying concerning harmful events. Therefore, I cannot supply proof for my words, because although God said that the evil would come, He may relent. You are prophesying concerning positive events, so it is you who must give a sign <small>of the truth</small> of your words.” From all this, it is apparent that a negative Divine decree may be abrogated. Why then – if God acknowledged that the moon’s claim was valid – did He not retract?",
                    "xii) <small>Our Sages relate that God</small> told <small>the moon</small>: “Go and rule.” As mentioned above,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See question v.</i> The command “go” appears unnecessary.",
                    "xiii) <small>According to our Sages,</small> God instructed the moon to rule during the day and the night. What was the intent in such an instruction? Did God not comprehend that during the day the moon’s light would be of no avail? It would be like the light of a candle in broad daylight, <small>as the moon objected</small>!",
                    "xiv) <small>After the moon protested, God offered another conciliatory gesture,</small> saying, “Go. Israel will reckon the days and the years according to you.” Here, too, <small>as above,</small> the question arises: What is the intent of the command, “Go”? Also, here, <small>our Sages begin reporting the dialogue</small> in Aramaic <small>while previously they used Hebrew</small>.",
                    "xv-xvi) <small>The first conciliatory gesture offered the moon was</small> that the Jews would “reckon the days and the years according to you,” to which the moon countered, “That is impossible without the sun.” Here, also, the same issue raised in question xiii could be asked. Seemingly, the objection is obvious. Did God not know that the sun would also be included in the calculation of the days and the years?",
                    "Moreover, in this instance, the complaint is thoroughly justified, for the days and the years are determined primarily by the movement of the sun. The days are determined by the setting of the sun, i.e., the duration of a day is from one setting of the sun to the next, as Rav Avraham ibn Ezra comments on the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shmos </i>16:25. In that source, Ibn Ezra elaborates in the explanation of the fact that the determination of a day is dependent on the setting of the sun.</i> “And Moshe said, ‘Eat it today.’” Similarly, the years are solar years. The concept of a lunar year is only a borrowed term,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ibn Ezra’s commentary to <i>Shmos </i>12:2.</i> for the word year, שנה, has the connotation of repetition, as in the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>I Melachim </i>18:34.</i> שנו וישנו, “<small>He instructed them to</small> repeat, and they repeated.” In other words, a solar year is the <small>sun’s</small> completion of its circuit of its orbit from the west to the east, as <small>the sun</small> returns to the place where its orbit began. In contrast, the moon finishes its orbit from west to east every month. The term “lunar year” is adopted because <small>the moon</small> concludes twelve cycles in the time it takes the sun to proceed through the twelve Zodiac constellations. Thus, the reckoning of the days and the years is more closely associated with the sun than with the moon. Conversely, it would have been appropriate to mention that the festivals too are dependent on the moon, because the dates on which the festivals fall are dependent on the days of the lunar months, just as they are dependent on the times of spring, the grain harvest, and the fruit harvest. Although the festivals are dependent on the seasons that are determined by the sun, their celebration is also dependent on the moon. Why then did <small>the passage in </small><i>Chulin</i> mention only the days and the years and overlook the festivals?",
                    "<i>Gur Aryeh</i> writes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Gur Aryeh</i>’s commentary to<i> Bamidbar </i>28:15.</i> that because <small>the moon</small> was diminished, it is appropriate to measure according to it, for a small measure is fit to be used in all measurements, while a large measure is not. This consolation was granted <small>to the moon</small> because it was diminished. As a result of <small>the moon’s</small> being diminished, this positive dimension came about. I heard the words <small>of that text</small>, but I do not comprehend them. The establishment of the calendar according to the moon has nothing to do with its size, but with the time <small>the moon</small> takes to complete its orbit. If so, what does <small>the</small> diminishment <small>of the moon</small> have to do with the positive quality of having <small>the days and years</small> measured <small>according to it</small>?",
                    "Furthermore, one cannot say that because of its small size, <small>the moon</small> proceeds faster in its orbit, i.e., that a large <small>entity</small> is heavier and a small <small>entity</small> is lighter. This is not true for two reasons: <br>a) The scholars of natural science have determined that in the fifth type of being, from which the heavenly beings are comprised, does not possess natural characteristics as we know them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Rambam </i>(<i>Moreh Nevuchim, </i>Vol. 1, ch. 72), cites Greek thinkers who explain that in contrast to earthly existence that is made up of a combination of the four elements: fire, wind, water and earth, the heavenly beings are comprised of a fifth type of matter, <i>hyli,</i> that does not share the characteristics of these four elements.</i> Thus, the concept of being heavier or lighter does not apply with regard to <small>the heavenly beings</small>. <br>b) Even if <small>the heavenly beings</small> would have natural characteristics and would be characterized by lightness or heaviness, those characteristics would not have an effect on the speed or slowness of their progress in their orbits. This is evident from the fact that the sun concludes its orbit in approximately 365 and ¼ days, yet its mass is larger than that of any one of the other heavenly bodies and their constellations,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Yeshayahu</i> 13:10.</i> as recorded in the list of the heavenly bodies in the text <i>Yesod Olam,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yesod Olam </i>is a text on astronomy written by R. Yitzchak of Tulitula, one of the students of Rabbeinu Asher.</i> Discourse 3, ch. 17. <i>Shabbetai</i> (Saturn) completes one cycle of its orbit in 30 years, while <i>Tzedek</i> (Jupiter) takes twelve years <small>to complete one cycle of its orbit</small>, and <i>Ma’adim</i> (Mars) <small>takes</small> slightly less than two years <small>to complete one cycle of its orbit</small>. Similarly, the size of <i>Nogah</i> (Venus) is greater than that of the moon, but not substantially greater. (For the moon is 1/39 and a quarter the size of the earth, and <i>Nogah</i> is 1/37<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">th</sup> the size of the earth.) Nevertheless, the time it takes for <i>Nogah</i> to circle the earth is far longer than the time necessary for the moon <small>to make its circuit</small>. For <i>Nogah</i> makes one circuit in 300 days, <small>which is</small> approximately ten times longer than <small>one</small> of the moon’s <small>circuits</small>. Moreover, the planet called <i>Kochav</i> (Mercury) is very small, only 1/19,000 of the size of the earth, and yet it requires 336 days to complete the one circuit <small>of its orbit</small>. The above figures are taken from the works of the astronomers. In its commentary to the verse beginning <i>Vay’chulu,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis </i>2:1.</i> <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> to<i> Parshas Bereishis</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis Rabbah </i>10:4.</i> <small>offers</small> different calculations, and in some texts of <i>Midrash Rabbah</i> those figures are questioned based on the words of the astronomers. <small>Regardless of these details, from all the above, however, it is obvious that the size of a heavenly body is not the conclusive determinant in the speed of its orbit.</small>",
                    "Moreover, based on the above, another question arises regarding the words of <i>Gur Aryeh:</i> <small>If the fact that a heavenly body is small makes it fitting that the reckoning of the festivals be made according to it, seemingly,</small> the reckoning should be dependent on the movement of <i>Kochav</i>, for it is very small. Perhaps this itself was part of the conciliatory gesture made to the moon – that even though it is befitting that the reckoning <small>of the festivals</small> be dependent on the movement of <i>Kochav</i>, since reckoning should be made based on the smallest measure, the honor <small>of having</small> the dates <small>of the festivals</small> be based on its movement was given to the moon to appease it.",
                    "xvii) The moon responded to God’s statement that it would feature in the reckoning of the days and the years <small>by saying</small>, “That is impossible without the sun.” <small>This response</small> shows that <small>the moon</small> returned to its undesirable trait of showing jealousy that the sun would also be included in the reckoning that the Jews would make. How could <small>the moon</small> make such statements without fear that it would be punished again?",
                    "xviii-xix) A prooftext, “And let them be for signs,” is brought <small>by the passage in </small><i>Chulin</i> in support of the moon’s statements. I don’t understand why it is necessary to bring proof that the seasons are calculated according to the sun. This is a fact well known to the sages, their students, and their students’ students. A point of public knowledge does not require support.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tosfos Yom Tov </i>is employing an expression frequently used by our Sages.</i> And if one would say that the prooftext was cited merely for supplementary purpose, the question could then be raised from the opposite perspective: Why didn’t the passage bring a prooftext for God’s conciliatory statement that the Jews would calculate the days and the years according to the moon, citing the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis </i>1:14.</i> “they shall serve as signs… for days and years”?",
                    "It is not appropriate to say that a prooftext was not cited because the verse that could serve as the prooftext, not only does not support, but runs contrary to the desired intent, for it states, “they shall serve” <small>which also highlights the importance of the sun. How would this pacify the moon?</small> This does not present a question, because regardless, God knew that the calculations would also include the sun. Even so, <small>God</small> made this statement to the moon to appease it. As such, it would not have harmed the author of this passage to have quoted this proof. For the <small>verse would</small> not be <small>cited as</small> proof that God made these statements to the moon. Rather, <small>the verse would serve as proof</small> with regard to the issue itself: that the Jews would calculate <small>their calendar according to the moon</small>. The dialogue between God and the moon is not derived from this verse: <small>rather,</small> the verse only serves as a proof of the concept itself. If so, the passage <small>in </small><i>Chulin</i> should also have cited the verse, “they shall serve as signs… for days and years,” when relating God’s words to the moon, because <small>this verse</small> indicates that the reckoning depends on the moon.",
                    "This also leads to another question: The passage <small>in </small><i>Chulin</i> should have cited a prooftext for God’s instruction to the moon to rule during the day and the night, quoting the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis </i>1:18.</i> “to rule during the day and during the night.” If you would say that this verse was not cited since it does not prove that the moon was given authority to rule alone, that will lead to another question: What is the source which led the author of this passage to maintain that God told the moon to rule <small>alone</small> during the day and the night? The simple meaning of the verse is that the charge was delivered to both <small>the sun and the moon</small>.",
                    "xx) The passage continues, saying that God told the moon, “Go. The righteous will be called by your name.” As above,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tosfos Yom Tov </i>is referring back to questions v and xiv.</i> the reason why God told the moon to “go” requires explanation.",
                    "xxi) Explanation is also required as to why <small>God’s statement</small>, “The righteous will be called by your name,” is considered a conciliatory gesture. That question is strengthened by the fact that only three <small>righteous men</small> are mentioned. Moreover, one of the references, Shmuel HaKatan, is not found in Scripture. It is far-fetched to say that the reference is to Shmuel HaKatan, the <i>Tanna</i> mentioned in <i>Pirkei Avos.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Avos </i>4:19.</i> Especially, since if that was the intent, <small>Shmuel HaKatan</small> should not be mentioned between Yaakov and David, but after David, <small>according to chronological order</small>. Indeed, when the text <i>Maaseh HaShem</i> relates this passage in his own words, in ch. 8 of <i>Maaseh Bereishis,</i> as I will mention later on, it mentions <small>Shmuel HaKatan</small> last. Nevertheless, when quoting the Talmudic passage itself, <i>Maaseh HaShem</i> mentions Shmuel second. When the author of the <i>Akeidah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tosfos Yom Tov </i>is referring to <i>Akeidas Yitzchak, </i>by R. Yitzchak be Moshe Aramah. This work is often referred to as “the <i>Akeidah</i>”.</i> cited the passage (in <i>Shaar</i> 37), he removed the reference to Shmuel HaKatan altogether. If so, there were only two righteous men associated with the moon.",
                    "(Parenthetically, it can be noted that in his commentary to the Talmud, <i>Rashi</i> states that the description of David as “small” is found in <i>Divrei HaYamim.</i> In his haste, <i>Rashi</i> was not careful. The intended reference is in <i>I Shmuel,</i> ch. 17.)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This error is found in many early printings of the Talmud. It has been corrected in most contemporary printings.</i>",
                    "xxii) <small>The passage</small> continues, <small>stating that God</small> “saw that the moon would not be consoled.” What <small>lead God to that conclusion</small>? On the contrary, <small>the fact that the moon remained</small> silent could be understood as indicating that it was consoled. And if one would say that “God sees into <small>the</small> hearts”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Mishlei </i>17:3.</i> of all beings and thus knew the moon’s feelings, the passage should not have recounted the interchange cited before as a dialogue between God and the moon, but as God’s awareness of the moon’s feelings.",
                    "xxiii) The passage continues that God concluded, “Bring an atonement offering for Me because I diminished the moon.” This wording is fundamentally problematic. How can such a statement be made? <small>Is it appropriate to say that God could possibly need atonement?!</small> I have already cited<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See page 6.</i> the understanding of Rabbeinu Yitzchak Alfasi, who interprets <small>this statement</small> as meaning, “Bring an atonement offering before Me every <i>Rosh Chodesh</i> to atone for yourselves.” Nevertheless, <small>even in interpreting the statement in this manner, Rav Yitzchak Alfasi</small> did not save the author of the passage from the <small>following</small> question: <small>Why did the author of this passage</small> phrase his statements in a manner that does not reveal his intent? Furthermore, besides obscuring the correct meaning, <small>the text as it is written</small> appears irreverent. Similar statements are found in <i>Gur Aryeh,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Gur Aryeh</i>’s commentary to <i>Bamidbar </i>28:15.</i> to quote:<br> הביאו עלי כפרה<small> The word</small>עלי , “for Me”, <small>should be understood</small> here <small>as</small> meaning “for My sake.” The Holy One, blessed be He, commanded Israel to bring an atonement offering for <small>themselves</small>. This is an honor for the moon,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Rosh Chodesh </i>is the first day of the lunar month. Hence, having the Jewish people bring a special sacrifice on that day is a form of honor for the moon.</i> and as a result it was appeased. According to the understanding <small>of the author of the passage</small> the meaning of the term “for a sin-offering” is that the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded Israel to bring this sacrifice as a sin-offering to God, for God’s sake because He diminished the moon. And <small>God</small> commanded Israel to bring this sin-offering <small>on </small><i>Rosh Chodesh</i> as a token of honor to <small>the moon</small>. This interpretation is sufficient to answer those who question the wording of the passage, <small>i.e., that the passage implies that God requires atonement</small>. ",
                    "Nevertheless, one may still ask: Why did the passage say, “Bring an atonement offering for Me”? Why didn’t it say, “Bring a sacrifice for Me”? This would have been more appropriate wording. Who forced <small>the</small> author <small>of the passage</small> to say, “Bring an atonement offering for Me”? Why use wording that would provoke questions? Although <i>Gur Aryeh</i> states that Rabbeinu Yitzchak Alfasi interprets עלי as meaning “for Me,” I already wrote<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See page 7 above.</i> otherwise, in the name of <i>Rashba</i>, that Rabbeinu Yitzchak Alfasi interprets עלי as similar to אלי, “to Me.” This nevertheless provokes the same question, for seemingly the author of the passage should have used <small>the word</small> אלי rather than עלי. Indeed, it is a question that is almost impossible to resolve. On the other hand, <small>the question raised by </small><i>Gur Aryeh –</i> Why did the passage say “Bring an atonement offering for Me” and not “Bring a sacrifice for Me”? – <small>can be resolved as follows:</small> Since the <small>verse mentions</small> a sin-offering, <small>the author of the passage mentioned</small> atonement, and he also used concise wording. Therefore, <small>the author of the passage</small> did not say, “Bring atonement for your sins.” It is possible to say that <small>the author of the passage</small> chose to use concise wording without worrying about the possibility of questions arising, as we see the Torah did when quoting God as saying,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis </i>1:26.</i> “Let us make man.” Concerning that verse, the <i>Midrash</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis Rabbah </i>8:8.</i> relates that Moshe asked God: “Master of the World, why do You provide <small>heretics with</small> an excuse?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Moshe was asking why the Torah relates that God said, “Let us make man,” when God alone created man. Using the plural term “us” would allow heretics to claim there is more than one God.</i> God responded: “Write it and whoever wishes to err may err.” Nevertheless, I am not comfortable with that resolution, for the words of Torah are composed in one manner, while the words of the Sages require a different approach. Were the wording “Bring an atonement offering for Me” not necessary to teach a concept that could only be derived from these words, it would certainly have been changed, and it would have been appropriate to use other wording which would not evoke questions.",
                    "<small>Furthermore, the concept of bringing an atonement offering for God is problematic.</small> If one requires atonement, is it appropriate that another bring an atonement offering for him? True, the offering would actually be God’s, for everything belongs to Him, as King David said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>I Divrei HaYamim </i>29:14. See also the citation of the verse in <i>Pirkei Avos </i>3:7.</i> “For everything is from You, and it is Your gift that we have given to You.” <small>Nevertheless, having man bring the offering is inappropriate.</small> True, Rabbeinu Yitzchak Alfasi’s interpretation resolves the latter question. For <small>according to this interpretation,</small> the Holy One, blessed be He, did not say that He required atonement, but that the Jews require atonement and, as a means of honoring the moon, they should bring the atonement offering on the day of <small>the moon’s</small> renewal. Nevertheless, this is not <small>the simple meaning of</small> the wording of the passage. It is problematic that the passage employs this wording which evokes a question, unless these specific words help convey the intent of the passage and without <small>these words, the intent of the passage</small> would not be understood. Only for such a reason would the author of the passage use such wording.",
                    "xxiv) Why did the author of the passage not cite support for <small>his concluding statement, showing the source</small> from which he derived this concept, as Reish Lakish did? Even the verse Reish Lakish cited as a source needs explanation, and is interpreted in various ways, as I will explain below. Indeed, blessed is he who knows the one who can appreciate the true intent of the author of this passage! If so, when the author presents his claim without proof, the difficulty in understanding <small>the passage</small> is even more pronounced.",

Other <small>gestures</small> were <small>made</small> to <small>the moon</small>, and <small>yet</small> it did not become appeased.",
                    "I add: Was the moon in fact appeased by this final gesture? The author of the passage does not explicitly say <small>the moon</small> was appeased. By not doing so, he left us in a quandary. Perhaps <small>the moon</small> was not appeased, and God merely did not desire to make any further gestures to appease it. After all, the moon refused to be appeased despite the previous gestures made to it. Moreover, all of these gestures were beyond the measure of the law, for <small>the moon</small> itself brought about its diminishment through its complaint. That <small>the moon</small> caused its own diminishment is evident from <small>the moon’s</small> words, which reflect how it was jealous and requested to possess a unique quality that the sun would lack. This can be seen from the hidden <small>intent</small> in the beginning of <small>the moon’s</small> words when it asked: “Is it possible for two kings to wear one crown?” It is clear that, because of its jealousy, <small>the moon</small> desired that the sun be diminished and it alone remain great. Therefore, God acted according to the letter of the law by diminishing <small>the moon</small>, and all of the conciliatory gestures made to it were beyond the measure of the law. Thus, it could be said that although <small>the moon</small> was not appeased after the offering of a sacrifice was instituted in its honor, <small>nevertheless</small> God did not seek to appease <small>the moon</small> any further. On the other hand, it could be said that <small>the moon</small> was appeased <small>by this final gesture</small>. The reason that the author of the passage did not mention <small>this</small> is because he did not think that it was necessary, since it is self-evident from the fact that further conciliatory gestures were not made to <small>the moon. Now</small> God is not constrained at all, and could have made further gestures. From the fact that He did not, we can conclude that the moon was appeased. Since the passage does not clarify this point, it is unclear which of these two approaches is correct.",
                    "xxviii) <small>Reish Lakish emphasizes that</small> a goat is offered as an atonement offering. Why is the word “goat” used? Why didn’t <small>Reish Lakish</small> emphasize <small>the type of offering – namely a</small> sin-offering? Seemingly, the emphasis should be on the type of sacrifice being brought, not on the type of animal being offered. <small>The</small> significance <small>of the animal</small> is that it is being designated as a sin-offering.",
                    "These are the questions <small>and difficulties</small> that I felt necessary to raise regarding this passage. From them, an explanation will emerge, with the help of God.

                    "I already mentioned the statements of Rav Avraham ibn Ezra in sec. 1, see those words.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In explanation of the <i>Aggadic </i>teachings in Tractate <i>Chulin </i>mentioned above, R. Avraham ibn Ezra writes: “The moon’s protests refer to the time of the alignment of the luminaries. It is as if the luminaries are contesting with each other when they are at opposite ends of their orbits. When both luminaries are filled with light, it is as if the moon raises itself up to say, ‘I will rule.’ From that time onward, as soon as the moon departs from that point in its orbit, its light begins to diminish.”</i> Now, I will cite what the author of the <i>Akeidah</i> (<i>Shaar</i> 37) responded to him. Rav Avraham ibn Ezra concluded his explanation of the passage in <i>Chulin</i> with this statement: “None of the words of the Sages that preceded us have proved futile.” The author of the <i>Akeidah</i> took issue with <small>Rav Avraham ibn Ezra</small> regarding this matter, stating:<br> I see that his words are true, for none <small>of our Sages’</small> words have proved futile. On the contrary, they are all-inclusive. It is the questions and the resolutions <small>ibn Ezra proposes</small> regarding the passage that are all futile; they are unfounded. For <small>ibn Ezra</small> did not bring out any new concept in his explanation of the passage, the only insight his explanations produced was that directly after the moon shines in its fullness, its light begins to diminish. Who does not know that? There is no novelty in <small>ibn Ezra’s</small> explanation, except that he offered it worded as a riddle. It is not possible <small>that this is the intent of the Sages</small>. <small>Moreover,</small> the diminishment <small>of the moon</small> of which <small>ibn Ezra</small> speaks is not diminishment in a true sense; it only appears so according to our perception. For in truth, <small>the moon</small> is always full, for the side facing the sun is never diminished, as our Sages said:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Rosh HaShanah </i>23b, <i>et al. </i>The intent is that we, from the earth’s viewpoint, see the moon’s light as waxing and waning. Were one standing on the sun, however, he would always be able to see the entire orb of the moon.</i> “The sun never saw the moon’s diminishment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">By quoting these statements, <i>Tosfos Yom Tov </i>appears to agree with the rejection of ibn Ezra’s interpretation of the passage presented in the <i>Akeidah</i>.</i>",
                    "Continuing his exposition, the author of the <i>Akeidah</i> offered two interpretations <small>of the passage in </small><i>Chulin:</i> a) the author of that passage intended to use this teaching to reject the thought system of Epicurus,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Epicurus was a Greek philosopher who rejected the concept of Divine providence, and believed that there is no order to existence. Instead, Epicurus believed that everything happens by chance. Heretics are therefore often referred to as <i>epikorsim.</i></i> who believed that existence – as a whole and in its particulars – is governed entirely by chance. To <small>rebut</small> this <small>line of thought, the author of the passage in </small><i>Chulin</i> offered an analogy <small>of the moon</small> engaging in a dialogue with the Creator.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Akeidah </i>explains that the entire interchange between the moon and God is merely an analogy employed by the author of the passage in <i>Chulin</i> to illustrate how God’s intent governs every aspect of Creation.</i> Since the moon saw it had no light of its own, but merely reflects the light <small>of the sun</small>, it asked: “Is it possible for two kings to wear one crown?” The implication is that <small>it appears that</small> everything happens by chance without any <small>Divine</small> intent.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to this explanation, it is as if the moon is saying that if there was a specific Divine intent in all things, two entities would never serve the same purpose. Instead, each purpose would be fulfilled by only one entity.</i> Thus, it is possible that all entities can be equal in sovereignty<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., no entity would rule over another.</i> and in all matters. If so, <small>the fact that the moon</small> is not equal to the sun was simply by chance. Accordingly, there would be no basis <small>for the moon</small> to complain. <small>But</small> if <small>the diminishment</small> occurred as a result of a Divine intent, there is room to ask why this was done to it. <br>God answered: “Go and diminish yourself,” i.e., <small>the diminishment was a result</small> of My intent. <br>The moon replied, “Because I have suggested something that is proper must I diminish myself?” I.e., since I agreed that the diminishment came as a result of a Divine intent and not by chance, which is a proper statement, explain to me Your intent: Why is it that You diminished me, causing me not to have any light of my own? <br><small>God</small> answered: “Go and ‘rule during the day and during the night’.” I.e., that was My intent, <small>for this is the way your influence will be effective both during the day and at night</small>. <br>The moon then responded: “Of what use is a candle in broad daylight?” I.e., <small>the moon’s</small> sovereignty during the day is not significant. <br>God answered: “<small>Israel</small> will reckon the days and the years according to you.” I.e., <small>this is a matter of</small> great benefit, and <small>reflects a</small> prodigious intent.<br> The moon replied: “That is impossible without the sun,” and hence the entire reckoning of the calendar should be made according to the sun. Why <small>was it necessary for the moon to</small> undergo the change and the diminishment? <br><small>God’s</small> response was: “The righteous will be called by your name.” I.e., it is ethically correct for those who are small to “diminish” themselves <small>i.e., to make themselves humble</small> in the presence of those who are great. So too, you, the small sphere, should conduct yourself in this manner, <small>accepting the fact</small> that the recipient of influence should be below and the one who conveys influence should be above.",

Moreover, the other position <small>– that everything happens by chance –</small> is not explained <small>at all</small>, even though that option seemingly remains tenable. Also, how is it possible that after <small>the moon</small> was brought into being without having light of its own, God ordered it, “Go and diminish yourself”? That was already <small>the situation; i.e., the moon was already less important than the sun.</small> Furthermore, since <small>the moon’s</small> desire was to know the reason <small>for its diminishment</small>, why did God not answer at the outset that <small>the moon’s diminishment</small> was for the purpose of establishing the calendar, which was His fundamental intent? <small>Why did God first reply,</small> “So that you will rule…,” which is not a feasible answer? Also, <small>the explanation that</small> the righteous <small>will follow the pattern of the moon</small> is very far from the original question: Is the world governed by chance or by Divine providence? The comparison to the righteous who diminish themselves does not seem related to the concept that the world is governed by Divine providence. In addition, <small>the explanation of the conclusion of the passage according to the </small><i>Akeidah’s</i><small> interpretation</small> reverses the obvious meaning of <small>God’s statement</small>, “Let this goat be offered as atonement for Me for diminishing the moon.” The phrase “for diminishing” implies that God attributed the fault to His act, as it were, while <small>the </small><i>Akeidah</i> explains that the intent is that <small>there are people who</small> sin and think that the diminishment of the moon was not a positive act and <small>that the diminishment</small> happened only by chance.",
                    "The second interpretation offered by the author of the <i>Akeidah</i> is based on another <i>Midrash,</i> which understands the moon as an analogy for the Jewish people, and the sun as an analogy for Esav.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In a broader sense, the analogy refers to all non-Jewish nations, and specifically Rome and Christianity.</i> Using these analogies, the author of the passage in <i>Chulin</i> <small>is explaining</small> that the Jewish people (who are compared to the moon) protest, “Is it possible for two kings to share one crown?” i.e., is it possible for Yaakov and Esav to be equal and <small>for</small> both to inherit two worlds, <small>i.e., this world and the World to Come,</small> for their essences are different. <small>As a result of this essential difference,</small> success should also alternate between them. <br>The Holy One, blessed be He, told <small>the moon (i.e., the Jewish people)</small>, “Go and diminish yourself,” i.e., you will not rule in this world.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., Yaakov’s success (and that of the Jewish people) will be apparent only in the World to Come.</i> <br><small>The moon</small> responded, “Why will I not be successful in this world and in the next?” <br>God responded, “Go and rule during the day and during the night,” i.e., there will be many <small>Jews</small> who will merit success in both worlds. <br>The moon replied, “Of what use is a candle in broad daylight?” I.e., the dominion of those select few is of no consequence in relation to that of the ruling kingdoms <small>at large</small>. <br>God answered, “Israel will reckon the days and the years according to you,” i.e., <small>the Jewish people</small> will establish the calculation of the months and the festivals, and the Heavenly Company will carry out <small>their</small> decision, as our Sages stated<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Shmos Rabbah </i>15:2, which cites this verse as a prooftext for the concept that God told the Jewish people, “There are no festivals before Me except those which you declare.”</i> in their interpretation of the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tehillim </i>57:3.

Even so, God saw that because of its stubbornness, <small>the Jewish people (referring back to the analogue)</small> were not appeased. Therefore, God ordained that <small>the Jewish people</small> bring an atonement offering on account of their stubbornness, in addition to their being diminished.

God responded, <small>telling the moon</small> that it would not reign at all. <small>The moon</small> replied that its complaint was justified. If so, <small>the moon</small> asked, why must it diminish itself and be subjugated to the rule of the <small>non-Jewish</small> kingdoms? In response, <small>God</small> offered to grant <small>the moon</small> a certain dimension of sovereignty. <small>The moon, however,</small> countered, “Of what use is a candle in broad daylight?” I.e., because the power granted to <small>the moon</small> is minimal, it will be of no consequence. God then answered, “Israel will reckon the days… according to you,” i.e., <small>the years will be</small> reckoned <small>according</small> to <small>the rule of</small> the kings of Israel. <small>The moon</small> responded that <small>the </small><i>Tanach</i> also reckons the years according to non-Jewish kings, as recorded in the Book of <i>Daniel</i>, and the Sages reckoned according to the years of Greek kings.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">75</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Sages often date events by referring to the number of years after the start of Alexander the Great’s rule that the event occurred.</i> At the conclusion of the parable, God declares, “The righteous will be called by your name,” i.e., the righteous will be satisfied in the World to Come, <small>although</small> they will be of small stature in this world. <small>God</small> further states that this reduction in stature serves as atonement for the desire and yearning <small>of the righteous</small> for physical matters. And as an additional measure, <small>God</small> commanded that <small>the righteous</small> bring an atonement offering for this sin of material desire. <small>This is implied by the words,</small> “Bring an atonement offering for Me because I diminished the moon,” i.e., <small>it is as if God said</small> “In addition to the punishment already meted out to <small>you</small>, i.e., My lowering of <small>your</small> stature in this world, <small>you</small> also must bring an atonement offering.” <br>These are the words <small>of </small><i>Maaseh HaShem.</i> In this instance as well, it is not necessary to elaborate on the difficulty <small>in correlating this interpretation with the simple meaning of the passage in </small><i>Chulin</i><small>,</small> for we have already mentioned this point with regard to the second interpretation in the <i>Akeidah.</i> The interpretation <small>in </small><i>Maaseh HaShem</i> appears to be taken from <small>the </small><i>Akeidah</i> with only slight variations. Alternatively, the author <small>of </small><i>Maaseh HaShem</i> – as “a wise man who is superior to a prophet”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bava Basra </i>12a.</i> – independently arrived at the same understanding as did the author of the <i>Akeidah.</i>",
                    "<small>The author of </small><i>Maaseh HaShem</i> begins by focusing on the simple meaning of the passage <small>as opposed to the </small><i>Akeidah</i><small> who views the text as an analogy</small>. Thus, at the beginning of his interpretation, <i>Maaseh HaShem</i> stated that <small>when the verse mentions</small> the moon’s ruling during the day and the night, it is referring to the diminishment of <small>the moon’s</small> light. The appeasement <small>granted the moon</small>, that “the righteous will be called by your name,” focuses on another factor – that <small>the moon</small> was called “small.” This is hinted at in <small>the moon’s</small> statement, “Of what use is a candle in broad daylight?” <small>With this statement, the moon is stating that</small> it will be called “small” because its light is not considered significant. For this, <small>God attempted to</small> appease the moon through the explanation that this <small>pattern</small> is also reflected in the righteous, who are called “small”. When this explanation failed to appease <small>the moon, God</small> declared that an atonement offering should be brought <small>every time</small> the moon is renewed. Were it not to have been diminished, <small>the moon</small> would have rose in the morning and set in the evening like the sun. The Jewish people offer a daily burnt-offering at the rising and setting of the sun. Such a pattern is not appropriate for the moon after it was diminished, since a full moon does not rise and set every day. Hence, <small>it was determined that</small> a sacrifice be offered when <small>the moon</small> was renewed. <small>The author of </small><i>Maaseh HaShem</i> states that it is for this reason the phrase מלבד עולת התמיד, “aside from the daily offering,” is not stated in the passage concerning the additional offering of <i>Rosh Chodesh,</i> as it is stated concerning the other additional offerings. Instead, concerning <i>Rosh Chodesh,</i> the passage states, על עולת התמיד, “in addition to the daily offering,” as if to say, “because of the daily offering.”",

Perhaps <small>the author of </small><i>Maaseh HaShem</i> recognized the weakness of his interpretation, and that is why he said that <small>this interpretation</small> was offered only in response to those who raise questions and do not agree with the passage’s intent. <i>Maaseh HaShem</i> then sets out to explain <small>the passage</small> as a parable, as I explained in his name."

                    "The text entitled <i>Gur Aryeh</i> cited above, on <i>Parshas Pinchas,</i> elaborates in the interpretation of this passage, expounding upon it for more than a folio page. To summarize his words: From the perspective of the world, it is appropriate that there be only one ruler and not two. Nevertheless, <small>the sun and the moon</small> were created as equal. Therefore, <small>the moon</small> complained: True, with regard to sovereignty over the world, it is impossible for <small>the two celestial bodies</small> to be the same. Nevertheless, there is justification to ask: Why should <small>the moon</small> be diminished and reduced to a lesser state than it was when originally created?",
                    "God responded to <small>the moon</small>, explaining that its diminishment did not imply inferiority. On the contrary, in its present, reduced state, during the day <small>the moon</small> could be like an officer in the presence of a king. In its original state, by contrast, there would be two kings – and that cannot be. Alternatively, <small>God was explaining that</small> no superior entity can exist without a deficiency. (The exception, of course, is the Ultimate Cause of causes, blessed be He.) Therefore, the sun does not shine at night, <small>for</small> this is its deficiency. Nevertheless, a small entity need not suffer a similar limitation, for its smallness is its deficiency.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, after being diminished in size, the moon would not need to suffer a further deficiency.</i>",

Therefore, the calendar will be reckoned according to <small>the moon</small>, as one reckons according to kings.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the era when Jews had a king, events would be recorded according to the year of the king’s reign, e.g., the famine of the fifth year of King Such-and-Such’s reign.

                    "<small>The moon did not accept that response,</small> replying that since ultimately the calendar will also be reckoned according to the sun, it is a greater king. Or, according to the <small>alternate</small> explanation given above, the moon’s smallness is a reason people will reckon by it <small>i.e., as a result of its small size, the moon completes its orbit in less time than the other celestial bodies, and is thus more easily used as a measurement. According to this explanation, the moon</small> responded that since the reckoning <small>of the calendar</small> also involves the sun, <small>the moon’s</small> prominence is not exclusive.",
                    "<small>God persisted in trying to appease the moon,</small> saying, “The righteous will be called by your name.” The righteous are those who never lose focus of the <small>fundamental</small> point, and never expand and inflate themselves beyond that <small>fundamental</small> point. Thus, <small>the righteous</small> never deviate from their fundamental character trait, which is justice. Therefore, <small>the righteous</small> are called “small”, <small>and are comparable to the</small> earth, which as the least of the four elements remains in the center, without expanding and inflating itself. <small>Not expanding or inflating oneself to reach beyond one’s rightful place</small> is the attribute of the righteous. Thus, smallness is befitting to the existence <small>of all beings</small> in their present state. <small>Hence, having its size diminished establishes the moon as the ruler of the lower plane.</small>",
                    "This did not satisfy <small>the moon</small>, since it originally possessed a superior quality and had lost it. Therefore, <small>God</small> said that <i>kaparah,</i> translated as “an atonement offering,” should be brought <small>for Him</small>. Here, <small>however</small>, the intent of the term <i>kaparah</i> is not “atonement for sin,” i.e., that a person becomes aware that he has sinned, feels regret, and brings an offering so that the one against whom he has sinned will forgive him. All of this is not <small>appropriate</small> when speaking about God. In this context, <small>the term </small><i>kaparah</i> means to wash away and remove, as <i>Rashi</i> explains in his commentary to the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis </i>32:21.</i> אולי אכפרה פניו “Perhaps I will cause his mien to change.” Moreover, even the fundamental meaning of the term <i>chatas,</i> “sin,” is “lack,” as in the verses,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i> I Melachim </i>1:21.</i> אני ובני שלמה חטאים, “I and Shlomoh my son will be lacking,” and אנכי אחטנה, “I would compensate for the lack.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis</i> 31:39.</i> Similarly, a sin-offering is called a <i>chatas</i> because of the deficiency created, for every sin is <small>due to</small> a lack. On this basis, the passage <small>can be understood as stating</small> that God asked that a <i>kaparah</i> – i.e., a cleansing and a removal of the complaints – be brought to appease the moon because of the lack brought about by its diminishment.",
                    "If one will ask: How could God act unjustly <small>toward the moon</small>? This is not a <small>valid</small> question. All of the created beings were brought into existence as an expression of kindness. Fair judgment would not dictate that they be created any other way than the way they were created. The complaint <small>of the moon</small> that it should not have been diminished after being created as great is, from its perspective, a justified claim. However, in truth, <small>the moon’s claim</small> is not <small>justified</small>. For <small>God</small> created His world with kindness, and the created beings have no inherent right to be brought into existence. Therefore, <small>God was justified in</small> diminishing <small>the moon</small> so that the world would be ruled by one sovereign <small>body</small>. Merely to satisfy the complaints of the moon <small>did God</small> instruct that a <i>kaparah</i> be brought. Carrying that line of reasoning further, <small>the terms</small> <i>kaparah</i> and <i>chatas</i> can even be understood literally as “atonement offering” and “sin”, <small>as they are usually used</small>. For <small>if these terms are understood literally, the incident is being understood from the moon’s perspective, that</small> God made this request to appease the moon<i>,</i> as a gesture of honor to it, as Rabbeinu Yitzchak Alfasi explains.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See page ???</i>",
                    "Another concept can be understood <small>from this incident</small>: that without a doubt, the state of lack <small>brought about within</small> the moon <small>caused</small> a state of lack <small>to be</small> created in the world below, <small>i.e., our physical existence,</small> which is influenced by <small>the moon. Conversely,</small> when the moon is renewed, goodness is renewed throughout the world which is influenced by it.

Alternatively, initially, <small>God thought</small> to create <small>the sun and the moon</small>] as equals. Afterwards, <small>God</small> decided to diminish the moon in order for the world to be conducted justly. <small>God</small> then saw fit <small>for the Jewish people to</small> bring a sacrifice to <small>facilitate their ability to</small> draw close to and elicit His attribute of goodness, which brings about a renewal of light for the moon and, as a result, of the goodness drawn down from it to the world.",

                    "<b>The Elucidation of the Passage from <i>Chulin</i> 64a</b><br><small>The passage begins:</small> “R. Shimon ben Azzai – or ben Pazi – pointed out a contradiction <small>between the verses</small>: One verse says: “And God made the two great luminaries,” <small>but</small> it is also written, “the great luminary” and “the small luminary.”",
                    "The contradiction on which <small>the passage</small> focuses is not that initially <small>Scripture</small> equates <small>the luminaries and</small> calls both <small>the sun and the moon</small> “great”, and afterwards refers to <small>the sun</small> as “great” and <small>the moon</small> as “small.” For the author of this passage is no less <small>of a Sage</small> than the authors of the other three passages mentioned <small>at the outset</small>. Just as they did not see this point as significant enough to highlight as an apparent contradiction between the verses, neither did the author of this passage. For in truth this <small>apparent</small> contradiction is not a contradiction at all, as both <small>of the luminaries</small> are indeed greater sources of light than all the other heavenly bodies, as is apparent to any observer. <small>Nevertheless,</small> in relation to each other, <small>the sun</small> is greater than <small>the moon</small> in both size and light. This is also an obvious fact. Accordingly, the author of this passage certainly would realize that there this is no contradiction <small>between the verses</small>.",
                    "Instead, according to my humble understanding, the apparent contradiction <small>stems from a fundamental question</small>: Why did the verse <small>use the terms “the great luminaries,” “the great luminary,” and “the small luminary,”</small> which require explanation? It is true, the explanation is obvious, but still the verse could have been worded in a manner which did not require any explanation. <small>Scripture</small> could have simply referred to the luminaries by name, <small>i.e., Scripture could have referred to the luminaries as “the sun” and “the moon,”</small> as Yosef did, <small>in the verse</small>:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis</i> 37:9.</i> “Behold, the sun and the moon bowed to me,” and as Moshe Rabbeinu did in <i>Parshas Va’Eschanan</i>, <small>in the verse</small>:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Devarim </i>4:19.</i> “and you see the sun and the moon,” and in <i>Parshas Shoftim,</i> <small>which speaks of serving other gods including</small><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid. </i>17:3.</i> “the sun or the moon.” Similarly, here, the narrative should have stated, “God made the sun and the moon, the sun to rule during the day and the moon to rule during the night.” It cannot be said that Scripture intends to teach the concept that the light <small>of the sun and the moon</small> is greater than that of the other luminaries, and that the light of one is greater than the other. That would certainly be of no purpose. Why would Scripture need to tell us something that is obvious?",
                    "If so, the difficulty <small>the author of the passage is highlighting</small> is that the verse uses wording that requires explanation, instead of using wording that does not require explanation. Clearly, then, the intent of the verse <small>in mentioning “the great luminaries,” “the great luminary,” and “the small luminary,”</small> is to teach us a concept. This conclusion is desirable, for if one would maintain that <small>the verses should be understood</small> simply, as teaching that the light of the sun and the moon is greater than that of the other luminaries, and that the light of one is greater than the other, the unusual wording in the verse would be unnecessary because we can observe the amount of light ourselves. <small>All</small> this is correct and understandable to me. <small>Hence, there is a basis for our Sages to comment on this Scriptural passage, and explain the lesson to be derived from it.</small>",
                    "<small>The passage</small> begins to explain the allusions in this verse, saying that the moon asked: “Is it possible for two kings to wear one crown?” It appears to me that a support for <small>the interpretation advanced by</small> the author of the passage <small>can be taken</small> from <small>an explicit</small> verse that alludes to this complaint, and to God’s response, “Go and diminish yourself.”",
                    "<small>One</small> should not object, asking how I can make such a statement, suggesting a prooftext that the author of the passage himself did not cite in support of his words. After all, I have mentioned<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See question xxiv, p. 67-68.</i> that the final point in this teaching, “Bring an atonement offering for Me because I diminished the moon,” is problematic. <small>The author of this passage makes that statement</small> without <small>citing a prooftext</small>, even though the prooftext is obviously the one cited by Reish Lakish. If so, why did the author of the passage not mention <small>this teaching</small>? Because this was the manner <small>in which the author of this passage offered</small> instruction – to make a statement, and present it to the students, sharpening their intellectual acumen, so they could find the desired verse that can serve as a source for the teaching. If this is true with regard to the concluding words <small>of the author of this passage</small> – and we are forced to say that this is his intent there – then it can be said that the conclusion indicates the pattern followed at the outset, and, indeed, throughout the entire passage: that the concepts presented have support in Scripture even though <small>the author of the passage</small> did not explicitly mention them.",
                    "Even without the proof from the conclusion of the passage, it is not implausible to make such a statement. In several instances <small>in the Talmud</small>, we find that a given Sage makes a statement, and a second Sage cites a verse that serves as a source for the first Sage’s statement. This pattern is seen throughout the <i>Midrashim</i> and the <i>Aggadic</i> <small>passages of our Sages</small>: support for a concept <small>stated by one Sage</small> is brought by <small>other Sages who</small> cite different verses. This is the familiar pattern in Midrashic works. Even though <small>the conceptual building blocks of</small> an idea are interrelated in a unified picture, the verses cited as support are scattered in <small>several contexts</small> and in different books <small>of the </small><i>Tanach.</i> Indeed, this very passage follows that pattern, beginning with <small>verses from the book of</small> <i>Bereishis</i> and concluding <small>with verses from the book of</small> <i>Bamidbar.</i> And so too do not be surprised that I bring verses from various books of the <i>Tanach</i> as prooftexts and supports for the words of the passage.",
                    "My heart tells me that the complaint of the moon and God’s response to it, “Go and diminish yourself,” are alluded to in Iyov’s words:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Iyov </i>31:26-28.</i> אִם אֶרְאֶה אוֹר כִּי יָהֵל, וְיָרֵחַ יָקָר הֹלֵךְ. וַיִּפְתְּ בַּסֵּתֶר לִבִּי, וַתִּשַּׁק יָדִי לְפִי. גַּם הוּא עָוֹן פְּלִילִי, כִּי כִחַשְׁתִּי לָאֵ-ל מִמָּעַל, which literally mean: “If I <small>ever</small> saw the light shining, the moon proceeding on its course with glory, and I was lured in the secret reaches of my heart <small>to regard them as Divine</small> and therefore covered my mouth with my hand <small>so as not to utter such words</small>, this too would have been a punishable sin, for I would have denied God above.” <small>According to their simple meaning,</small> all of Iyov’s words are expressions of grievance against God for punishing him severely and rigorously without <small>any apparent</small> cause, for his conduct was not marred by sin, transgression, or guilt.",
                    "<small>However</small> according to our understanding, Iyov’s words can be understood here as follows: <b>If I </b>ever<b> saw the light</b> of the sun <b>shining</b> on the world, <b>and the moon proceeding on its course with glory</b>. Rav Avraham ibn Ezra explains that the latter phrase describes the moon’s progress “in the half of the month” (i.e. when the moon becomes full). Now, the word הֹלֵךְ, “proceeds,” is not entirely appropriate here.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse seems to say that in the first half of the month, the moon’s glory grows. That concept, however, could have been understood from the word יָקָר without the word הֹלֵךְ. Hence, the term הֹלֵךְ implies that there is a further concept to be learned from this verse.</i> Accordingly, I think <small>that the verse can be interpreted as referring to an additional concept. Although we have translated the word </small>יקר<small> as “glory”, it can also be translated as “rare” or as “valuable”. Indeed,</small> we find the term יָקָר, “rare”, used in association with speech, <small>in the verse,</small><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i> I Shmuel </i>3:1.</i> ודבר ה' היה יקר, “The word of God was rare.” It could thus be said that Scripture alludes to the fact that the moon spoke of a matter that is יָקָר, “valuable.” This can be understood as a reference to the moon’s statement cited in the passage – i.e. “Is it possible for two kings to wear one crown?” that the moon described as “proper,” and as a result of which it was הֹלֵךְ – progressively diminished. Seemingly, the moon has a valid complaint. <small>This relates to the continuation of Iyov’s words:</small> וַיִּפְתְּ בַּסֵּתֶר לִבִּי – “I was lured in the secret reaches of my heart.” This phrase could be understood as meaning, “I was lured to think within my heart that Your judgments are not correct and just.”",
                    "The passage from <i>Iyov</i> continues: <small>Despite these thoughts</small> וַתִּשַּׁק יָדִי לְפִי – “<small>I</small> covered my mouth with my hand.” Rav Avraham ibn Ezra explains that covering one’s mouth with one’s hand was “a type of worship to the sun and the moon carried out by the people of early generations.” However, according to our interpretation of the passage, Iyov was saying, “<small>I</small> covered my mouth with my hand,” so as not to make a statement that would express a lack of faith, for this would be an עָוֹן פְּלִילִי – “a punishable sin.” The commentaries<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tosfos Yom Tov </i>is referring to <i>Rashi </i>and Rav Avraham ibn Ezra, who lived before <i>Tosfos Yom Tov</i>. <i>Metzudas David </i>and <i>Malbim</i>,<i> </i>who both lived after <i>Tosfos Yom Tov, </i>interpret the term פלילי in a similar manner as <i>Tosfos Yom Tov.</i></i> do not offer an interpretation of the term פלילי. Apparently, the term means “liable for judgment,” as in the phrase,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shmos </i>21:22.</i> וְנָתַן בִּפְלִילִים – “He must give as dictated by the judges.” According to our interpretation, <small>the phrase </small>עון פלילי<small> can be understood as also meaning that</small> the sin would be entertaining thoughts regarding the justice of God’s judgments.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In a similar vein, in his commentary to the verse, Rav Moshe Alshich cites <i>Kiddushin </i>40a, which states that one is liable for merely entertaining thoughts of worshiping other deities.</i> Thus, <small>the continuation of the verse,</small> כִּי כִחַשְׁתִּי לָאֵל מִמָּעַל should be interpreted as, “I would have <small>questioned the validity</small> of God’s judgments.”",
                    "Nevertheless, after enduring such suffering, <small>Iyov</small> could not restrain himself <small>any further</small>. This reflects <small>our Sages’</small> teaching<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bava Basra </i>16a.</i> on the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Iyov </i>2:10.</i> “Despite all this, Iyov did not sin with his lips.” <small>Our Sages explain</small> that although <small>Iyov</small> did not question God’s judgments verbally, he did <small>question God’s judgments</small> within his heart. Rav Avraham ibn Ezra comments on that verse, “Ultimately, <small>Iyov</small> would <b>sin with his lips</b> and would speak words <small>that reflect a lack of faith</small> because of the <small>great</small> anguish <small>he experienced</small>.” The verse leaves room for such an interpretation.",
                    "To relate the above <small>verse</small> to the passage <small>from </small><i>Chulin</i><small> 60b</small>: The verse from <i>Iyov</i> serves as a support for the statement in the passage, that as a result of the moon’s complaint, “Is it possible for two kings to wear one crown?”, the moon was compelled to “proceed on its course,” i.e., to diminish itself. Later on, I will comment further on the relevance of this interpretation of the verse, “If I <small>ever</small> saw the light shining….”"

                    "<small>The question was raised:</small> Instead of God telling the moon: “Go diminish yourself,” why did He not diminish <small>the moon</small> Himself? In truth, this is not such a challenging question, because God did not desire to harm the moon Himself, for “Bad will not emerge from the mouth of the Most High,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Eichah </i>3:38.</i> and certainly God will not perform a negative act. In this instance, God’s <small>negative statement</small> resulted from <small>the moon’s</small> own complaint, “Is it possible for two kings to wear one crown?”",
                    "However, I will attempt to answer this question, because it appears to me that my answer will also resolve the question raised before, i.e., why did God not <small>diminish the moon</small> Himself at the outset? Did God not know that it is impossible for two kings to wear one crown? In truth, however, God’s original intent <small>was as follows. He</small> initially made both <small>the sun and the moon</small> great, with the intent that one <small>of them would</small> be diminished afterwards. Perhaps it was implicit in the law of Creation that <small>the moon</small> would <small>be able to</small> receive the light of the sun after it was diminished because at the outset <small>the moon had</small> cleaved to <small>the sun</small>. Who can know the mysteries of God’s wisdom and understand its hidden intricacies! Thus, <small>the truth of</small> the moon’s words was not hidden from <small>God</small>. Instead, <small>God’s</small> wisdom had ordained that initially both <small>the sun and the moon</small> would be great <small>luminaries</small>, and then one <small>luminary</small> would be diminished. However, before one <small>luminary</small> was actually diminished, the moon acted prematurely,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We have translated the words אכלה הירח פגה as “the moon acted prematurely.” אכלה פגה literally means “ate an unripe fig.” Our Sages use this expression in <i>Sanhedrin </i>107a to describe King David’s taking of Batsheva. Although Batsheva was intended to be King David’s wife from the outset, King David nevertheless took Batsheva prematurely, in an undesirable manner, rather than wait for Divine providence to unroll.</i> and complained, “Is it possible….”",
                    "A hint of support for the statement that at the outset both <small>the sun and the moon</small> were made great <small>with the intent</small> that one of them would <small>later</small> be diminished can be drawn from the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i> Bereishis </i>1:14.</i> “Let there be luminaries.” In that verse, the word מארת, “luminaries,” is written <i>chasair,</i> without <i>vavim.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word מארת would ordinarily be written as מאורות.</i> Our Sages<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Rashi</i>’s<i> </i>commentary to <i>Bereishis </i>1:14, which is based on <i>Taanis </i>27b.</i> took notice of that fact and commented, “It is a cursed (מארה) day when children become ill with croup.” According to my understanding, <small>the fact that the word </small>מארת<small>, “luminaries,”</small> was written <i>chasair</i>, lacking <small>the two </small><i>vavim</i>, as it were, when relating the Divine utterance leading to the creation <small>of the luminaries</small>, alludes to the concept that God created <small>the luminaries</small> with the intent that one would be diminished. <small>Initially, God’s decree was that</small> a curse, i.e., a מארה, and a diminishment would affect one of the luminaries. I will expound more on this <small>point later</small>, in further explanation of the passage, with God’s help.",
                    "Even though initially <small>the moon was formed in a manner that enabled it to</small> cleave to <small>the sun</small> and be equal to it, <small>God’s initial intent was that the moon</small> would be diminished. From the outset, <small>God envisioned</small> that <small>the luminaries would</small> be separated from each other, that the moon <small>would</small> go forth from its place, and be diminished in the process of doing so. <small>This pattern reflects the opposite of the motif alluded to by our Sages in their statement,</small><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shevuos </i>47b. Our Sages use this concept to explain why the Euphrates is described in <i>Bereishis</i> 15:18 as “the great river,” even though it is not that large a river. Since the Euphrates serves as the border of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, it is given prominence and is referred to as “great.” <i>Tosfos Yom Tov </i>is emphasizing that the converse is also true. Once the moon diverged from the sun, which is truly great, the moon’s prominence diminished because it no longer benefitted from the sun’s greatness.</i> “Come near an oily substance, and oil will be smeared on you.” The converse is <small>also</small> true; one who distances himself <small>from greatness will be diminished</small>. Thus, <small>from the outset,</small> when <small>God</small> said, “Let there be luminaries,” writing the word מארת<i> chasair,</i> <small>without the </small><i>vavim</i><small>, it was implied that</small> there would be two <small>stages in the formation of the moon</small>. Initially, <small>the sun and the moon</small> would be equal, and then <small>the moon</small> would be diminished in both size and light through being separated <small>from the sun</small> and being distanced from it, i.e., <small>the moon</small> was forced <small>to descend</small> two heavens and three spaces between one heaven and the next. To explain: <small>Based on the passage from the </small><i>Raya Mehemna</i><small> cited above,</small><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See p. 34ff.</i><small> the moon was originally positioned directly below the sun, and then distanced to its present position beneath the planet </small><i>Kochav</i><small>.</small> Thus, <small>the moon</small> descended the distance between the sun and <small>the orbit of</small> the planet <i>Nogah,</i> <small>the orbit of</small> the planet <i>Nogah</i> itself, the distance between <small>the orbit of the planet </small><i>Nogah</i> and <small>that of</small> the planet <i>Kochav,</i> <small>the orbit of</small> the planet <i>Kochav,</i> and the distance between <small>the orbit of</small> the planet <i>Kochav</i> and <small>the present position of</small> the moon. Our Sages reckoned <small>each of these orbits and spaces as being the distance of a journey of 500 years</small>. This is close to <small>the calculation</small> given by the astronomers. <small>Thus, in its process of separation, the moon was distanced</small> five times the distance <small>of a journey of</small> 500 years <small>from its original position</small>. As a result of being distanced to such a degree, <small>the moon</small> was diminished.",
                    "<small>Although we have difficulty understanding this concept, that difficulty can be resolved through</small> an analogy given by <i>Rambam</i> in <small>his</small> <i>Moreh Nevuchim.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Moreh Nevuchim, </i>Vol. 2, ch. 17.</i> A child was born in a place where there were no people other than his parents. <small>The child’s</small> mother died before he was able to recognize her, and his father raised him. Thus, <small>the child</small> never saw a woman. When <small>the child</small> asked <small>his father</small> how he came into being, his father explained <small>the process of pregnancy. However, the child</small> didn’t believe <small>his father</small>. Indeed, <small>the child</small> brought proofs from his present state of existence that such a process was impossible.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since a fetus is unable to breathe or eat naturally inside the womb, the son, familiar only with existence as he sees it, will not believe that the process of pregnancy is physically possible.</i> The analogy <small>teaches us that</small> it is impossible to bring a proof from the present state of being regarding the state <small>of existence</small> at the time of Creation. Similarly, in our context, the fact that at present traveling a long distance will not cause a body to be diminished in size or to lose its capacity to generate light, does not refute the possibility that because the moon was forced to separate itself from the sun, its size became diminished and it lost its power to generate light. This is because the <small>state of existence</small> at the time of Creation is not the same as <small>the state of existence</small> after Creation.",
                    " This explanation also clarifies why <small>God instructed the moon,</small> “Go and diminish yourself.” <small>As explained above, the moon’s diminishment was dependent on its being distanced from its original position.</small> <i>Rambam’s</i><small> analogy also clarifies why God did not retract His instructions to the moon after the moon presented its complaints. On the surface, it seems that</small> the moon had yet to be diminished. After <small>the moon</small> complained, “Because I have suggested something that is proper must I diminish myself?” God <small>apparently</small> offered several gestures of consolation. <small>This implies that God accepted the moon’s</small> arguments. Why then did God not retract His decree <small>that the moon be diminished</small>? <small>In resolution,</small> initially, from the very beginning of Creation, God’s intent was that <small>the moon</small> be diminished. <small>Hence, the decree was not retracted.</small> This resolution, however, raises a stronger question: If <small>God’s</small> initial intent was that <small>the moon be diminished</small>, why <small>did He offer the moon</small> several gestures of consolation? That question can be answered through the resolution of another question I raised: <small>Why did the moon protest against being diminished?</small> If the moon was not to be diminished, the question it raised, “Is it possible for two kings to wear one crown?” would still apply! <small>Therefore, the moon had to be diminished, by the force of its own argument.</small>Instead, the moon’s response reflected a different intent. As explained above, the moon’s distancing itself from the sun brought about its diminishment. On that basis, the moon’s response, “Because I have suggested something that is proper must I diminish myself?” can be understood as follows: God’s decree, “Go and diminish yourself,” was twofold: <b>“Go”</b> – distance yourself from your present place, “and <b>diminish yourself</b>.” Hence, the moon protested: “Would not one of these acts be sufficient? Let me go, but why must I diminish myself? Once I have descended from the sun’s plane, even though I am not diminished, there will no longer be ‘two kings wearing one crown.’“ Instead, because of the change in the moon’s position, the situation would resemble, to borrow our Sages’ words,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sanhedrin </i>98b.</i> “an emperor and a deputy emperor.” Since the sun would be several levels above the moon as stated above, the change in position would bring about a change in their prominence, and they would no longer be “two kings wearing one crown.” <small>The moon</small> hinged this request on the argument that it “suggested something that is proper.” <small>Thus, the moon was</small> arguing that it is not appropriate that it should suffer a twofold punishment: that it should descend from a high place to a lower place, and also be diminished as a result. <small>The moon</small> admitted that it deserved punishment because of its original complaint – for <small>the moon’s</small> intent was that the sun be diminished. Nevertheless, since the <small>moon’s</small> statement was ultimately justified, it was proper <small>for the moon</small> to be pitied and not to <small>be forced to</small> suffer a twofold punishment.",
                    "Alternatively, the moon’s response can be interpreted in a different way. The words הוֹאִיל... אֲמַעֵט כו׳ can be understood as having been said <small>in partial acquiescence to God’s instruction</small>. It is as if the moon said: “Since I suggested something that is proper, it is not befitting that I suffer a twofold punishment. I consent to ‘diminish myself’ in my present position, but why must I go to a lower place? It is sufficient that I be diminished.” This second interpretation <small>enables a resolution of another question raised above</small>: Why did God respond, “Go and ‘rule during the day and during the night’”? <small>The question was raised:</small> Why was it necessary <small>for God</small> to say “Go” a second time? <small>The above interpretation explains that point.</small> Since the moon desired only to diminish itself, but not to descend, God instructed it to also descend, implying that it was necessary to do both: to change from the manner in which <small>the moon</small> was created and to diminish itself, and also <small>for the moon</small> to change its position.",
                    "Nevertheless, even according to the first interpretation <small>given above</small>, the instruction “Go” is appropriate. For the moon had yet to heed <small>God’s instructions, and was still questioning whether it should be diminished</small>. Therefore, God had to repeat the instruction “Go,” from which it could be understood that <small>the moon</small> was also to diminish itself."

For God’s attributes are such that He does not withhold reward from any created being.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. <i>Pesachim</i> 118a.</i> For example, Lot’s younger daughter received a reward for naming her son in a manner that reflected modesty, as <i>Rashi</i> states.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Rashi</i>’s commentary to <i>Bereishis</i> 19:37. The comparison to Lot’s daughter adds a further insight: Her act was far from a modest one. Nevertheless, because Lot’s younger daughter named her son in a modest manner, she was granted a certain measure of reward. Similarly, as a whole, the moon’s conduct reflected jealously. Nevertheless, “since it made a proper statement,” the moon was granted a measure of appeasement.</i> <small>The fact that</small> sovereignty <small>was granted the moon</small> during the day and the night, as the author of the passage in <i>Chulin</i> states, does not require support <small>from additional verses</small>, for it is obvious from the narrative itself.

The standard version of the text cites <i>Rambam, </i>rather than <i>Ramban.</i></i> It is possible that the “sovereignty” <small>granted the moon</small> also includes the power of emanation, <small>that sovereignty radiates from them. The sun and the moon</small> are the governors of the lower realms, and through their power every reigning power and constellation rules; the <i>mazal</i> <small>i.e., the “spiritual source”</small> that causes growth during the day governs the day, and the <i>mazal</i> that causes growth during the night governs the night, as reflected in the interpretation of the phrase,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Devarim</i> 4:19.</i> “which God, your Lord, apportioned to all the nations.” This was God’s intent <small>in instructing the moon</small> to “rule during the day and during the night,” <small>that the sovereignty granted the moon also be an active force during the day</small>.",
                    "The moon’s reply, “Of what use is a candle in broad daylight?” is not a complaint regarding the sovereignty <small>granted it</small>, because that sovereignty does not involve shining light. Instead, <small>the moon’s</small> argument was, as explained above, that it is proper that <small>the moon</small> receive compensation for having made a correct statement, i.e. that God should repay <small>the moon</small> by not causing it to suffer a twofold punishment: that it be diminished, undergoing a change in deed, and that it be forced to descend, undergoing a change in position. God had not answered that <small>argument directly</small>; therefore, <small>the moon</small> sought to advance the same argument in a different manner. The <small>actual</small> diminishment of <small>the moon</small> was <small>also</small> twofold: <small>The moon</small> was diminished in size, and its light was diminished. <small>The moon</small> was now asking that at least its light not be diminished. <small>The moon felt</small> that this argument could be advanced since it was promised sovereignty during the day. Accordingly, <small>the moon</small> argued, “Of what use is a candle in broad daylight?” i.e., <small>the moon was arguing,</small> “Even though I will have a measure of sovereignty during the day, I will nevertheless face the ongoing displeasure of being merely ‘a candle in broad daylight’.” Therefore, <small>the moon argued,</small> God should compensate it for making a proper suggestion by not reducing its light, even though He reduced its size.",
                    "It appears to me that support for <small>this interpretation of</small> the complaint, “Of what use is a candle in broad daylight?” can be taken from the words of Bildad the Shuhite,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Iyov </i>25:4-5. See the commentaries of <i>Alshich</i> and <i>Metzudas David </i>there, which also point to the diminishment of the moon.</i> “How can man justify himself before God and with what may one born of woman gain purity? Even the moon does not shine brightly.” <small>The verse uses the phrase </small>עד ירח ולא יאהיל<small>, which we have translated as, “even the moon does not shine brightly.”</small> The <i>vav</i> in the phrase ולא יאהיל  <small>appears superfluous, and seemingly</small> does not fit <small>the context of the verse</small>. Therefore, it is possible to offer two interpretations <small>of the verse</small>. The first is that <small>the word</small> עד refers to <small>something taken by force, like</small> the spoils of war, as in the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis </i>49:27. See <i>Rashi’s </i>commentary there.</i> “In the morning he will eat his spoils.” Thus, <small>Bildad is saying,</small> “Even some of the moon’s size was taken from it, and it also does not shine brightly.” It can be derived from this that <small>the moon</small> should have argued that its light should continue to shine brightly even though its size was diminished. <small>Since this is a logical argument and</small> the plaintiff will plead his own case better than others, <small>it can be assumed that</small> the moon indeed raised this argument.",
                    "Alternatively, <small>the word</small> עד can be interpreted as in the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tehillim </i>32:9. The word עדיו in this verse is rooted in the word עד.</i> עדיו לבלום, “shut their mouths;” i.e., עד means “mouth.” In that vein, <i>Radak</i> interprets <small>the word </small>עדיך as “mouth” in the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid. </i>103:5.</i> המשביע בטוב עדיך, “Who sates your mouth with generosity.” Now, the term “mouth” may also refer to speech. <small>Thus, we find</small> the expression,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Vayikra </i>24:12, <i>et al.</i></i> על פי ה', “according to the word of God,” and <small>it is written,</small><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis </i>41:40.</i> ועל פיך ישק כל עמי ‒ “according to your word, will all my people be directed.” There are many similar <small>examples</small>. According to this understanding, <small>Bildad was saying,</small>] “The moon spoke, ‘Why shall I not shine?’“ i.e., the moon was willing for its body to be diminished, but it asked ‘Why should my light not shine brightly?’",
                    "Nevertheless, God also did not consent to the moon’s request that its light not be diminished, and instructed the moon, “Go, <small>Israel</small> will reckon <small>by the days and the years</small> according to you.” <small>God</small> told the moon, “Go,” <small>i.e., descend as you were instructed. This was necessary, for the moon had yet to fulfill that instruction</small>. Were God to have accepted the moon’s request, the moon would not have had to descend that much in order that its light would not be diminished, so that the light of the sun would rule over it to a greater degree, for <small>the moon</small> would still be on one of the higher levels instead of being entirely below the lower sphere. Even <small>the moon</small> did not say that it refused to go and descend; it merely complained, “Of what use is a candle...” and from that it is understood as a matter of course that <small>the moon</small> would not have to descend as much as implied <small>by God’s previous instruction</small>. Therefore, when God did not desire to fulfill <small>the moon’s</small> request, He told it “Go,” i.e., “Descend entirely to the lower plane where I instructed you to go.” <small>God</small> expressed the instruction in Aramaic as a further gesture of consolation to the moon, for the angels do not understand Aramaic.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See our Sages’ statements: <i>Shabbos </i>12b, <i>Sotah </i>33a.</i> Thus, they would not understand that <small>God was persisting in His command that the moon</small> go and diminish itself."

                    "The moon responded to God, “That is impossible without the sun, for the reckoning of the seasons is dependent on it.” <small>The meaning of this statement is that</small> in response to God’s willingness that the Jews should reckon the days and the years by the moon, there were grounds for <small>the moon</small> to counter <small>according to the</small> following <small>reasoning: God</small> generously agreed to grant <small>the moon</small> the honor <small>of having</small> the festivals reckoned according to dates of the lunar months, and to also have the years <small>calculated in coordination with</small> the moon’s <small>cycles</small> even though in truth there is no concept of a lunar year. The moon wished to forego being considered with regard to <small>calculating</small> the years, since regardless it is impossible to reckon the years without the sun.

Therefore, since fundamentally, the reckoning of the years is dependent on the sun, what honor is there for <small>the moon by</small> also <small>being</small> considered in this reckoning? Accordingly, <small>the moon</small> requested that God’s generous gesture not be a futile one, and that instead, <small>God</small> grant <small>the moon</small> another generous gift, one that is hidden <small>and not stated openly in the passage</small> instead of <small>the gesture of having the years coordinated with the lunar cycles that is mentioned here</small>.

This indicates that “years” stands alone, <small>separate from the other purposes mentioned</small>.

                    "Also requiring explanation is the subject of the phrase, “and they are a faithful witness in the sky.” <i>Rashi</i> interprets <small>this phrase</small> as meaning, “The sun and the moon are witnesses for <small>David</small>; as long as they exist, <small>David’s</small> sovereignty will exist, as it is written,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yirmeyahu </i>33:20-21.</i> ‘If you will be able to break My covenant with the day and My covenant with the night… so will My covenant with David My servant be broken.’” <i>Rashi’s</i><small> interpretation</small> concurs with our Sages’ statement,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sotah </i>31b; <i>Sanhedrin </i>30a.</i> “Whenever <small>Scripture</small> uses the term ‘witness,’ <small>the intent is that</small> there are two, unless the verse explicitly mentions that there is <small>only</small> one witness.” However, according to this interpretation, the verses are repetitious, for it was already promised, “His throne is like the sun… like the moon, his <small>line</small> will be established.”",
                    "Rav Avraham ibn Ezra offers a different interpretation, stating that “the moon <small>will be</small> a faithful witness.” According to that understanding, it is possible to interpret the verses as follows:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The interpretation that follows represents <i>Tosfos Yom Tov’</i>s original understanding, not that of Ibn Ezra.</i> The words “His throne” refer to <small>David’s</small> dynasty, <small>which</small> will be like the sun. <small>However, David</small> himself – <small>i.e.</small> not his dynasty – will “be established like the moon.” Thus, <small>the phrase “be established”</small> is referring <small>back to the phrase,</small> “I will not fail David.” Rav Avraham ibn Ezra interprets David’s seed – and not his throne, the subject of the preceding phrase – as the subject of <small>the phrase</small> “be established.” I similarly maintain that <small>the phrase “be established”</small> can refer back to David himself, the subject of the still earlier phrase. Thus, the verses can be explained as follows: <b>One thing I have sworn, </b>and this oath <small>that God made</small> to David is threefold: a) <b>his seed will endure forever,</b> b) <small>David’s</small> dynasty, i.e. <b>his throne</b> will rule <b>like the sun</b>, the great luminary which rules the hosts of heaven, and c) <small>David</small> himself <b>will be established forever.</b> <small>The word</small> “forever” <small>as it is used</small> here should be understood in a personal sense, i.e., David will rule throughout his life. <small>In other words,</small> David himself, and not his dynasty, will undergo phases of waxing and waning like the moon. This corresponds with the interpretation of Rav Avraham ibn Ezra, that the words, “it is a faithful witness in the sky,” refer to the moon, which serves as a faithful witness to David’s personal history.",
                    "We have thus supported the thesis we sought to substantiate – that Yaakov and David resemble the moon. They are called small like the moon and <small>personify</small> its qualities. On this basis, an insight into the work of the liturgists who ordained<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Sofrim </i>20:2.</i> that after <small>reciting</small> the blessing for the sanctification of the moon, we recite בָּרוּךְ יוֹצְרֵךְ בָּרוּךְ עוֹשֵׂךְ בָּרוּךְ קוֹנֵךְ בָּרוּךְ בּוֹרְאֵךְ (“Blessed be He Who formed you; blessed be He Who made you; blessed be He Who brought you into being; blessed be He Who created you”).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The order in which these phrases are recited varies according to custom. The order cited by <i>Tosfos Yom Tov </i>is cited in <i>Tashbetz Katan </i>(responsum 220) and by Rav David Avudraham. Both <i>Tashbetz Katan </i>and Avudraham highlight the association with Yaakov.<i> </i></i> The first letters of the descriptive terms for God mentioned here spell out יעקב – Yaakov. It is as if <small>the verse</small> is saying that God created <small>the moon</small> with these four letters that spell out the name Yaakov. The name Yaakov reflects <small>our patriarch Yaakov’s</small> fundamental nature, like all the names that God brought about within the world,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See p. 108 above</i> which are not arbitrary like the names given by common people. Similarly, the nature of the moon is reflected by these letters which form the name Yaakov, for the nature of the two are the same.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Bach </i>(<i>Orach Chayim </i>426), who makes similar statements. See also <i>Tikkunei Zohar, Tikkun </i>18.</i> For similar reasons, the phrase, “David, King of Israel, is alive and enduring,” is recited after the blessing for the sanctification of the moon. <small>In this phrase,</small> David is described as “King of Israel,” to emphasize that he is <small>”King of Israel” and</small> not “King of Esav” and the like, who are identified with the sun. David is also described as “alive and enduring,” for King David’s nature resembles that of the moon. Seeing the moon’s renewal teaches us that David is still “alive and enduring” like the moon that can be seen at present, and he also will be renewed as the moon is renewed. <small>The process of renewal is reflected</small> in Yechezkel’s prophecy of the future, in which he states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yechezkel </i>37:24.</i> “My servant David will be king over them.” <small>Yechezkel</small> then emphasizes the matter by repeating,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid. </i>37:25.<i> </i></i> “My servant David will be prince over them forever.” This concept substantiates Ibn Ezra’s interpretation of the phrase, “They are a faithful witness in the sky, eternally true.” The term <i>selah</i>, translated as “eternally true,” refers to the Ultimate Future, <small>when the moon will be renewed in a complete sense</small>. The expression, “David, King of Israel, is alive and enduring,” was derived from the words of our Holy Teacher <small>Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi</small>, who told Rabbi Chiya:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Rosh HaShanah </i>25a.</i> “Go to Ein Tav.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ein Tav is the name of a place.</i> Sanctify the moon <small>there</small> and send me <small>the message</small>, ‘David, King of Israel, is alive and enduring’ <small>as a sign that you did so</small>.” <i>Rashi</i> explains <small>that Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi chose this message because</small> “David King of Israel is described with the analogy of the moon as it is written, ‘His throne is like the sun before Me. Like the moon, his <small>line</small> will be established forever.’”"

Instead, the opposite appears true, for were <small>the moon to have been</small> appeased by God’s conciliatory gestures, it would have been appropriate for <small>the moon</small> to have given thanks and praise to God for responding to its complaints. This is the appropriate course of action to take in response to a king, and how much more so in response to the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He. Since <small>the moon</small> did not do this, it is obvious that <small>the moon</small> was not appeased. Perhaps one could say that the opposite conclusion could be reached, for if <small>the moon</small> was not appeased, why did it remain silent and not make further requests? Since both conclusions could be reached, why say that the fact that <small>the moon</small> did not express thanks and praise indicate that it was not appeased? Why not say that the fact that <small>the moon</small> remained silent indicates that it was appeased?",

                    "I can find support from Scripture also for this concept, that the moon remained silent so as not to make light of the honor of the righteous. <small>This concept is reflected</small> in the verse <small>describing Menashe and Efraim</small>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis</i> 48:19.</i> “Nevertheless, his younger brother will be greater than him and <small>the renown of</small> his seed will fill…” <small>On the surface,</small> it was not necessary to refer to Efraim as קטן, “younger.” It would have been sufficient to say, “his brother,” since the beginning of <small>Yaakov’s</small> words, “I know… also he will be…” are <small>obviously</small> referring to Menashe. <small>Thus,</small> by saying “his brother,” it would have been clear that <small>Yaakov’s</small> intent is <small>to refer to</small> Efraim.

Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Meir agree that the goats <small>offered on</small> the festivals and on <i>Rosh Chodesh</i> atone <small>for entering the </small><i>Beis HaMikdash</i><small> or partaking of sacrificial offerings when</small> one did not know <small>that he was impure,</small> neither before he did so, nor afterwards.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These offerings also atone for an impure person who entered the <i>Beis HaMikdash </i>without knowing that it was the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, or an impure person who partook of a sacrifice without being aware of its consecrated nature.</i> This <small>concept</small> is derived from <small>the fact that with regard</small> to the goat <small>brought as a sin-offering on</small> <i>Rosh Chodesh</i>, the Torah states: חַטָּאת לַה;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bamidbar </i>28:15.</i> “a sin-offering for God.” This phrase implies that <small>this sin-offering</small> atones for a sin of which only God is aware.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., even the person himself did not know that he had sinned.</i> <small>Moreover, these Sages agree that the Torah implies that the same concept also applies with regard</small> to the goat offered <small>as a sin-offering</small> on the festivals. <small>This is derived from the Torah’s use of the word</small> ושעיר, “<b>and</b> the goat” <small>when discussing the goat offered on the festivals</small>. The <i>vav</i> <small>at the beginning of the word </small>שעיר<small>, meaning “and”, hints at a connection between this sin-offering and the other two sin-offerings</small>. Rabbi Meir <small>maintains that this concept</small> also applies to the goats <small>offered</small> on Yom Kippur. Rabbi Shimon <small>differs and</small> maintains that the goats offered on <i>Rosh Chodesh</i> atone only for <small>the sin of a</small> pure person who ate impure <small>sacrificial food</small>.",
                    " Thus, Rabbi Shimon does not interpret <small>the phrase</small>, “a sin-offering to God,” which is used <small>in connection</small> with the <i>Rosh Chodesh</i> sin-offering, as referring to <small>atonement for</small> a sin of which only God is aware. If so, what inference does he derive from that phrase? In <i>Tosfos Yom Tov,</i> I wrote that Rabbi Shimon derives the same inference as Reish Lakish <small>i.e., that the phrase “a sin-offering for God” alludes to God’s request that an atonement offering be brought for Him for diminishing the moon</small>. Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Meir <small>can also accept that concept, because if the Torah wanted to teach only that the offering atoned for God’s diminishing the moon,</small> it would have stated חַטַּאת ה׳, “a sin-offering of God.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The wording in the standard texts of <i>Tosfos Yom Tov </i>is slightly different.</i> Since <small>the Torah</small> states חַטָּאת לַה׳, both concepts can be derived from the phrase. From this, <small>we can appreciate</small> that Rabbi Shimon maintains that both concepts cannot be derived from the phrase, and only the concept taught by Reish Lakish can be derived from it. I merited to understand that this was Reish Lakish’s intent. This is reflected by the wording Reish Lakish used: “Why is the goat offered on the new moon distinguished?” and not: “Why is the sin-offering offered on the new moon distinguished?” <small>This wording is appropriate</small> because this goat serves a different purpose than all the other goats mentioned in the passage. According to whose opinion is <small>this goat</small> different? Only according to Rabbi Shimon, for according to Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Meir, all the goats mentioned in the passage share the same purpose, <small>i.e., that of </small>atoning for one who did not know <small>that he was impure</small>, neither before <small>entering the </small><i>Beis HaMikdash</i><small> or before partaking of sacrificial foods,</small> nor afterwards. <small>Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Meir</small> interpreted the phrase חַטָּאת לַה׳, “a sin-offering for God”, as teaching that the offering atones for a sin of which only God is aware. Rabbi Shimon, by contrast, maintains that this goat is unique and does not bring about atonement for a sin <small>of which only God is aware</small>, like the other goats mentioned in this passage. Instead, <small>this goat</small> atones for the sin of a pure <small>person</small> who eats impure <small>sacrificial foods</small>. The phrase חַטָּאת לַה׳, “a sin-offering for God,” is not <small>necessary to teach</small> this <small>concept</small>. Why then is the wording <small>referring to this goat</small> different <small>than that used with regard to the other goats brought as offerings</small>? To teach that God was asking for an offering to be brought because He diminished the size of the moon.",
                    "It could be said that Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Meir also accept this concept. As I wrote in <i>Tosfos Yom Tov,</i> it is possible to say that <small>Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Meir</small> understand this phrase as teaching two concepts. Nevertheless, there is no imperative to say that; it is possible that these Sages understand <small>the phrase</small> חַטָּאת לַה׳<small>, “a sin-offering for God,”</small> as teaching only one concept – that the offering atones for a sin of which only God is aware. <small>For these sages</small> explicitly say: “The goats brought on <i>Rosh Chodesh</i> atone for impurity of which one is unaware.” What compels <small>us to say that</small> they understand <small>this phrase</small> as teaching two concepts? The only motive to say that <small>these Sages</small> understand the verse in that manner, is so that they will not be disagreeing with Reish Lakish.

A wine press I trod alone… For a day of vengeance was in My heart, and the year of My redemption has arrived.” Like all <small>[of Yeshayahu’s]</small> prophecies beginning from the prophecy,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid. </i>40:1.</i> “Comfort you, comfort you, My people” and onwards, this prophecy focuses on the Ultimate Future. <small>[According to]</small> the simple understanding <small>[of the verses</small>] of the psalm under discussion – with the exception of the phrase, “to silence an enemy and one who seeks revenge,” as I will explain – it does not appear to refer to the Ultimate Future. Nevertheless, it is fitting to proceed to explain how the entire psalm refers to the Ultimate Future. In that way, the words of our Sages<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the interpretation of <i>Midrash Tehillim </i>cited above.</i> – though they do not require support or proof – will be further understood and apparent. <small>[To explain the psalm verse by verse:</small>]",
                    "<b>God, our Lord….</b> – The difficulty with this verse is apparent. How does “placing Your glory above the heavens” lead to “Your name <small>[being</small>] glorious throughout the earth”? Our Sages already focused on this <small>[matter</small>], explaining that <small>[this verse</small>] alludes to <small>[the request</small>] the angels <small>[made</small>] at <small>[the time of</small>] the Giving of the Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shabbos </i>88b relates that at the time of the Giving of the Torah, the angels requested of God, “Place Your glory above the heavens,” i.e., “Grant ‘Your glory’ – the Torah – to heavenly beings – the angels.”</i> I maintain that – consonant with the simple meaning of the verse – the intent is: “How glorious and powerful will Your name be throughout the earth when You place Your glory above all the heavens and their hosts!” How will God’s glory become apparent over the heavens? By disrupting the celestial order from the pattern that was decreed. This certainly <small>[reflects</small>] glory. This verse uses the word<i> hodcha,</i> which we have translated as “Your glory.” <small>[However, </small><i>hod</i>] can also mean “strength”, as <i>Ralbag</i> interprets the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Iyov </i>39:20.</i> “The power (<i>hod</i>) of His sneezing is awesome.”",
                    "<b>Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings….</b> – Our Sages<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sotah </i>30b.</i> understood this verse as referring to <small>[the infants who joined in the recitation of</small>] the song <small>[sung in appreciation of the crossing of</small>] the Sea of Reeds. However, according to my understanding, the <small>[words </small><i>olelim v’yonkim</i><small>, which are commonly translated as “babes and sucklings,” should be understood differently. I posit that</small>] the word <i>yonkim</i> should not be understood as “sucklings,” i.e., <small>[as referring to</small>] infants who nurse from their mothers, but <small>[instead</small>] as referring to young children of more advanced ages. Indeed, our Sages<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For instance, in <i>Shabbos </i>134a. See also <i>Yoma </i>75b, <i>Sukkah </i>46b.</i> use the term ינוקא, <i>yanuka,</i> to refer to a young child. Similarly, <i>Rashi</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his commentary to <i>Tehillim </i>8:2.</i> interprets עוללים, <i>olelim,</i> <small>[which is commonly translated as “babes,”]</small> as referring to mankind as a whole, <small>[interpreting the verse as follows:</small> <br>In Your great humility, You established strength from the mouths of <i>olelim</i> and <i>yonkim,</i> i.e., You caused Your presence to rest in the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i> and You ordained that Your strength would be acknowledged by the <i>kohanim</i> and the Levites, who are mortals who grow in filth, like babes and sucklings, as reflected by the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Iyov </i>16:15.</i> ‘I soiled (<i>olalti</i>) my radiance with dust.’ <small>[Similarly</small>,] all young children are called <i>olelim</i> because they are <small>[live in</small>] filth<i>.</i>” In the same vein, <i>yonkim</i> can be interpreted as referring to young children, as our Sages employ the term. This is closer to the simple meaning of the term. <i>Rashi</i> understands the verse as referring to <small>[God’s</small>] presence in the <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, where the <i>kohanim</i> and Levites sing before Him. <small>[Therefore, </small><i>Rashi</i>] cannot understand <i>olelim</i> <small>[as referring to children, since children do not serve in the </small><i>Beis HaMikdash</i><small>. </small><i>Rashi</i><small> must therefore use the word as a metaphor for mankind as a whole</small>]. However, I understand <i>olelim</i> and <i>yonkim</i> as referring to children of a slightly advanced age. <small>[This understanding is reflected by one opinion</small>] in the Midrashic understanding of this verse. As <i>Midrash Tehillim</i> <small>[comments on the above verse</small>]: <br>One <small>[Sage</small>] understood <i>olelim</i> as referring to infants in their mother’s womb, as reflected by the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid. </i>3:16.</i> “Like fetuses (<i>olelim</i>) that never saw light.” Another <small>[Sage</small>] understands <i>olelim</i> as referring to infants that have emerged from the womb, as reflected by the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Eichah </i>4:4.</i> “Infants (<i>olalim</i>) asked for bread.”",
                    "According to my understanding, <small>[there is a correlation between these verses</small>]. Our Sages state<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Berachos </i>40a.</i> that “the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge” that Adam ate was wheat, because knowledge is dependent on grain. <small>[The Sages derive this from the fact that</small>] an infant does not acquire knowledge until he partakes of bread. Thus, when “infants ask for bread” and thereby gain knowledge and begin to speak, that is the age at which<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sukkah </i>42a.</i> “a father is obligated to teach his son the verse, ‘The Torah Moshe commanded us…’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Devarim</i> 33:4.</i> and the first verse of the <i>Shema.</i>” Hence, eating grain generates the possibility that, “Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings, You established strength.” This verse uses the word <i>oz</i> for strength. <i>Oz</i> refers to the Torah, as our Sages state, <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Midrash Tehillim </i>8:4.</i> “The <small>[sole</small>] meaning of <i>oz,</i> ‘strength,’ is Torah.”<i>Olelim</i> are young children who have enough intelligence to be able to ask for bread. Similarly, the term <i>yonkim</i> is used to refer to children who study Torah, as stated in the several places in the Talmud, e.g.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Chagigah </i>15a, b. See also <i>Gittin </i>56a, 68a, and <i>Chulin </i>98b for other examples where <i>yanuka </i>refers to an older child.</i> “He said to the child (<i>yanuka</i>), ‘Tell me the verse you are studying.’” “Out of the mouths” <small>[of such children</small>] – i.e., because of their Torah observance – “strength is established” for God to disrupt the celestial order <small>[in favor of the Jewish people. Conversely, when the Jews</small>] neglect <small>[Torah observance</small>], God vows,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Devarim </i>31:17.</i> “I will hide My face from them, and they will be consumed,” i.e., the fate <small>[of the Jews</small>] will be given over to the natural order.",
                    "Therefore, Psalm 8 uses the term <i>oz</i>, which is used to describe the strength of the Torah, as our Sages commented<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Midrash Tehillim, loc. cit.; Zevachim </i>116a.</i> on the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tehillim </i>29:11.</i> “God endowed His people with <i>oz,</i> strength.” I maintain that the Torah is called <i>oz</i> <small>[and identified with strength</small>] because it generates the power to disrupt the natural order. For when the Jews carry out God’s will they amplify God’s power, as alluded to by the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tehillim </i>60:14. We have translated the verse according to the understanding of the <i>Midrash, Eichah Rabbah </i>quoted by <i>Tosfos Yom Tov. </i>In a literal context, the verse would be translated differently.</i> “Within God, we will generate power.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Eichah Rabbah </i>1:33.</i> The foundation for this structure <small>[of power is the Torah study of young children, i.e., the words of Torah that come forth</small>] “from the mouths of babes and sucklings.” For the Torah study <small>[of young children has a quality that surpasses that of the Torah study of adults</small>], as Abbaye commented,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shabbos </i>119b.</i> “<small>[The effects generated by the Torah study of</small>] a voice untainted by sin are incomparably <small>[greater</small>] than those generated by a voice tainted by sin.”",
                    "Thus, it was established through “the mouths of sucklings and babes” that God’s name would be “glorious.” <small>[Psalm 8:2 uses the word </small><i>adir,</i> <small>which we have translated as “glorious.” However, </small><i>adir</i> <small>can also</small>] mean “mighty” – <small>[i.e., God is mighty</small>] with His glory and His power manifest over the heavens. Why <small>[was it necessary to</small>] request this? “Because of Your foes,” i.e., it is necessary to request that God manifest His glory and His power over the heavens because of His foes.",
                    "From the following verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tehillim </i>8:4.</i> “When I see Your heavens, the work of Your fingers,” another interpretation can be reached. Thus, Tractate <i>Kesubos</i> relates:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Kesubos </i>5a.</i> Bar Kappara expounded: The work of the righteous is greater than the work of heaven and earth, for regarding the creation of heaven and earth it is written,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yeshayahu </i>48:13.</i> “Behold, My hand laid the foundation of the earth and My right hand spread out the heavens,” while regarding the work of the hands of the righteous it is written,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shmos </i>15:17. This verse states that the building of the <i>Beis HaMikdash, </i>which is the handiwork of the righteous, motivates God to join in its construction and invest Himself in it with both hands, as it were. In contrast, the verse cited previously states that God made heaven and earth with only with one hand, a lesser degree of involvement, as it were.</i> “The place that You, O God, founded for Your dwelling, the Sanctuary that Your hands, O God, established.” One Babylonian, Rabbi Chiyya was his name, challenged <small>[that statement, noting: It is written:</small><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tehillim </i>95:5.</i>] “And His hands formed the dry land.” <small>[In support of bar Kappara, it was said: “Although the term “His hand” is pronounced in the plural,]</small> it is written in the singular.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The difference between the word <i>yado</i>, “his hand” and <i>yadav, </i>“his hands” is the letter <i>yud. </i>Those supporting bar Kappara were explaining that the verse in Psalm 95 is written <i>yado, </i>as the singular “His hand”, but it is read <i>yadav, </i>“His hands”. <br>As <i>Minchas Shai </i>notes in his commentary to the verse, the <i>Mesorah </i>(“tradition”) does not reflect a difference between the <i>ksiv, </i>the written text of the <i>Tanach, </i>and the <i>kri, </i>the manner in which the verse is read, concerning this matter. Indeed, in our version of <i>Tehillim, </i>the word in question is written ידיו, “His hands”, with the <i>yud </i>denoting the plural. <br>The <i>Shita Mekubetzes</i> suggests that the <i>Gemara</i> informs us that R. Chiyya is a Babylonian<i> </i>to explain the context of the Talmud’s discussion, for the Babylonians did not have accurate knowledge of the exact <i>mesorah </i>regarding when words are spelled one way, but read a slightly different way.</i> <small>[In response, it was said, “The verb,]</small> ‘formed’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although the English verb “formed” is both singular and plural, in Hebrew verbs are conjugated differently to denote whether they are singular or plural. Psalm 95:5 uses the plural form of the verb “formed”.</i> is plural!” Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak said: “His fingers ‘formed,’ as it is written,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tehillim </i>8:4.</i> “When I see Your heavens, the work of Your fingers.” <small>[Since His fingers “formed” a plural form of the verb is used</small>].",
                    "Based on the principle stated by bar Kappara – that the deeds of the righteous are greater than the creation of heaven and earth – I will explain this verse and the following ones until the end of the psalm. ",
                    "The psalmist is saying: Based on the utterances of the <b>babes and sucklings, You established</b> the foundation on which the structure <small>[of all existence</small>] was built. <small>[God did this in a manner that His</small>] glory and strength will cover the heavens and the light <small>[of the celestial order</small>] will not shine forth. <small>[Hence,]</small> the dominion and rule <small>[of the celestial order</small>] will not be manifest upon the earth. The reason for this is that <b>Your heavens</b> are but <b>the work of Your fingers.</b> <small>[Since we don’t know how many of God’s fingers created the heavens,</small>] we can only assume the minimum. Therefore, <small>[we can</small>] infer that the heavens are the work of only one <small>[of God’s hands. In contrast,]</small> the deeds of the righteous are greater, since they – as it were – reflect the work of both of <small>[God’s</small>] hands. Thus, the righteous rule over the work of the heavens. How is this possible? The glory and power of God that is manifest over the heavens is <small>[generated by</small>] <b>the mouths of the babes and sucklings</b> and the deeds of the righteous. True, <small>[as Abbaye taught, “The effects generated by the Torah study of</small>] a voice untainted by sin are incomparably <small>[greater</small>] than those generated by a voice tainted by sin.” Nevertheless, <small>[the effects generated by the Torah study of the righteous – even though</small>] it is not comparable <small>[to that of the children –</small>] is still powerful.",
                    "The psalm continues: <b>the moon and the stars that You established.</b> <small>[When mentioning the moon and the stars, the psalmist</small>] changes the word used, stating that <b>You established.</b> <small>[Thus,]</small> <b>the work of Your fingers</b>, stated beforehand, is not sufficient <small>[when discussing the moon and the stars. Hence,</small>] this phrasing implies that the moon and stars are not merely described as <b>the work of Your fingers</b>, but as having been “established”. <small>[The word</small>] “establishing” represents a stage of development beyond “work” (מעשה). After “work” is completed, <small>[the object produced by the work is then</small>] “established.” This is reflected by the phrases,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Devarim </i>32:6.</i> “He has made you (עשך) and established you,” and “Your hands made me (עשוני) and established me.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tehillim </i>119:73.</i> <small>[A similar motif applies with regard to</small>] the moon and the stars. <small>[After being made, they were established, for the moon</small>] did not remain in the same state as <small>[it was</small>] originally created <small>[i.e., “made”</small>]. Thus, the moon was <small>[originally</small>] the same size as the sun, <small>[but then</small>] it had its size diminished. After <small>[being made, the moon</small>] was “established” in a different form than it was originally. Similarly, the stars were made and then established. <small>[For as part of the</small>] conciliatory <small>[gestures granted the moon</small>], its hosts were increased. <small>[According to the conception that</small>] the stars had already been created, <small>[as part of the gestures to the moon,</small>] God decreed that they would appear and disappear with <small>[the moon</small>], as our Sages stated.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It appears that the citation in the Hebrew text, <i>Bava Basra, </i>is in error and the intent is <i>Bereishis Rabbah </i>6:4.</i> How much more so <small>[does this apply</small>] if <small>[the stars</small>] were created <small>[only</small>] after <small>[the moon was</small>] diminished and not earlier, thus their very existence serves as an “establishment” of the moon. <small>[Thus, since the moon was established</small>] in this manner, the psalmist said, “Since I see the moon and the stars as they have been established, I declare:<b> What (</b>מה<b>) is man…!</b>”",
                    "<small>[In this verse, the word</small>] מה, <b>what</b>, is used as in the exclamation מה אדיר שמך, <b>How glorious is Your name!</b> Similarly, in the phrase מה אנוש<b>, what is man,</b> the word מה<b>, what</b>, <small>[is used</small>] to exclaim a wondrous expression of praise. <small>[The psalmist is saying:</small>] “Just as You established the stars in an effort to placate the moon after it was diminished, so too how great is man, who was also mentioned as part of those gestures, since You declared that the righteous will be identified with the moon.” This verse, <b>What is man that You have been mindful of him, a mortal that You have designated him for attention?</b> refers to Yaakov and David, the two righteous men who are identified with the moon.

                    "c) Seemingly, directly after stating, “Let there be luminaries in the expanse of the heaven” <small>the narrative should have continued,</small> “to radiate light upon the earth.” Were that wording to be used, it would not have been necessary to state, “Let them serve as luminaries in the expanse of the heaven to radiate light upon the earth.” In the description of the fashioning <small>of the luminaries</small>, it is written: “God placed them in the expanse of the heaven to radiate light upon the earth,” without repeating the wording. Similarly, it would appear appropriate to use such wording here as well.",
                    "d) <small>In relating God’s utterance,</small><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis </i>1:14.</i><small> the narrative states that the luminaries were created</small> “to make a distinction between the day and the night.” <small>However, in the description of</small> the fashioning of the luminaries it is written that they were created for two purposes:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid. </i>1:18.</i> “<b>to rule</b> during the day and during the night, and <b>to make a distinction</b> between the light and the darkness.” If the distinction between day and night is the same as the distinction between light and darkness, <small>it is necessary to understand</small> why God’s statement does not mention <b>ruling</b> <small>during the day and night</small>. Furthermore, if day and night, and light and darkness are identical, <small>the narrative should have</small> stated simply, “to make a distinction between them.” <small>Conversely,</small> if the distinction between light and darkness is not the same as the distinction between day and night, God’s statement and <small>the description of</small> the actual fashioning <small>of the luminaries</small> are not the same at all. <small>The description of</small> the actual fashioning <small>of the luminaries</small> is totally different from <small>God’s description of their being brought into being</small>.",
                    "e) <small>The passage states:</small><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid. </i>1:14-15.</i> <b>והיו</b> לאתת ולמועדים ולימים ושנים. והיו למאורת “And <b>they shall serve</b> as signs, for appointed times, for days, and years. <b>Let them serve</b> as luminaries…” <small>These verses repeat the verb </small><b>והיו</b><small>, which we have translated as “they shall serve” and “Let them serve.”</small> In <i>Parshas Shmos,</i> it is stated,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shmos </i>4:9.</i> וְהָיוּ הַמַּיִם אֲשֶׁר תִּקַּח מִן הַיְאֹר וְהָיוּ לְדָם בַּיַּבָּשֶׁת “<b>And it shall be</b> that the water that you will take from the river <b>shall be</b> blood on the dry land.” <small>In this verse, as well,</small> the word והיו, <small>which we have translated as “shall be”,</small> is repeated. <i>Rashi</i> notes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Rashi</i>’s<i> </i>commentary to <i>Shmos </i>4:9.</i> <small>this repetition, and derives an insight from it</small>. In that instance, however, the <small>verb</small><b>והיו</b><small> </small> needed to be stated <small>at least</small> once. In the passage from <i>Bereishis</i> under discussion, however, <small>the verb </small><b>והיו</b><small> could have been omitted entirely</small>. The passage could have stated: “Let there be luminaries in the expanse of the heaven to make a distinction between the day and the night, and as signs… and to radiate light,” <small>without mentioning the verb </small><b>והיו</b><small> at all</small>.",
                    "f) <small>The passage states, “And they shall serve as signs, for appointed times, for days, and years.”</small> It seems unnecessary to mention days, because <small>the verse</small> already stated, “Let there be luminaries… to make a distinction between the day and the night.” In addition to this redundancy, <small>this verse is problematic because seemingly</small> “for days” should have been stated before “for signs.” Firstly, in this way, the redundancy would not be so apparent, for it would have <small>appeared as</small> an explanation <small>of the preceding phrase. Thus, the verse would read,</small> “to make a distinction between the day and the night; and they shall be for days, and years,” i.e., the distinction between day and night will make it possible to count the days. Secondly, <small>it is logical that the phrase</small> “for days” precede <small>the phrase</small> “for appointed times.” <small>“For appointed times”</small> refers to the festivals, which occur just three times a year – or five times <small>a year</small>, if Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur are included. How much more so should <small>the phrase “for days”</small> precede “for signs,” which as <i>Rashi</i> explains refers to the <small>lunar and solar</small> eclipses. <small>It is only possible for eclipses to occur once a month</small> – a lunar <small>eclipse can only occur</small> at the time of a full moon and a solar <small>eclipse can only occur</small> at the time of a new moon. Moreover, <small>eclipses do not occur every month, and even when they do occur,</small> they are not visible in the entire world or even in an entire region.",
                    "g) <small>Why does that verse state,</small> לאתת “as signs,” למועדים “for appointed times,” and לימים “for days,” <small>with each of these</small> preceded by the letter <i>lamed,</i> “for” <small>or “as”</small>, while the <small>verse merely states</small> ושנים “and years” <small>without</small> a <i>lamed</i>?",
                    "h) Why does <small>the passage</small> say “and it was so” <small>after the introductory statement, “Let there be luminaries”? Seemingly, this statement is unnecessary,</small> for the passage continues, “and God made the two great luminaries.” True, <small>the same expression is used in the middle of the narrative of</small> the third day, <small>after God said,</small> “Let the earth sprout forth vegetation” and <small>in the middle of the narrative of</small> the sixth day, <small>after God said,</small> “Let the earth bring forth living beings.” Nevertheless, here explanation of this passage is necessary and this is our present focus.",
                    "i) The phrases “the great luminaries” and “the small luminary” require explanation, as reflected by the <i>Midrash.</i>",
                    "j) The passage states: “God made the two great luminaries…. God placed them in the expanse of the heaven.” Why <small>was it necessary for there to be two activities</small>, “making” and “placing”? Was God unable to make the luminaries in the heavens themselves, i.e., with one act to make them in the heaven without having to place them there afterwards?",
                    "k) <small>The passage concludes,</small> “And God saw that it was good.” After <small>God created light on the first day,</small> it is written,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis</i> 1:4.</i> “God saw the light, that it was good.” Seemingly, the same pattern should have been repeated here, i.e., <small>the verse</small> should have said, “God saw that the luminaries were good.”",
                    "l) There is a general <small>question that applies with regard</small> to the Creation as a whole. Throughout <small>the narrative of creation</small>, it is written וירא... <b>כי</b> טוב, “God saw… <b>that</b> it was good.” <small>Yet</small> in summation of the entire narrative, it is written,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid. </i>1<i>:</i>31.</i> וירא א-להים את כל אשר עשה <b>והנה</b> טוב מאד, “God saw everything that He had made and <b>behold,</b> it was very good.” <small>Why is a different term used?</small>",
                    "In resolution, regarding the verse, ויאמר א-להים יהי מְאֹרֹת, “God said, ‘Let there be luminaries,’” the Masoretic tradition<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Masoretic tradition is the cumulative writings of scholars who received the tradition from Ezra the Scribe and his court, regarding the correct text of the <i>Tanach</i>. This tradition details which words are written in a long form (<i>malei</i>) and which are written in a short form (<i>chaseir</i>), when there is a difference between the manner in which a word is written (<i>ksav</i>) and how it is read (<i>kri</i>), which letters are written in an oversized or miniature manner, and other matters of this nature. Among the texts that focus on this branch of study are <i>Masores Siyag LeTorah, </i>written by Rabbi Meir Abulafia, and the commentary to the <i>Tanach, Minchas Shai, </i>written by Rabbi Yedidyah Shlomoh Nortzi.</i> relates that the word מְאֹרֹת appears twice in the <i>Tanach</i> lacking both <i>vavim</i>, in the verse, “And God said, ‘Let there be luminaries,’” and in the verse, “God made the two great luminaries.” <small>By contrast, in the verse,</small> והיו לִמְאוֹרֹת, “They shall be luminaries,” the word “luminaries” is written as לִמְאוֹרֹת, lacking the second <i>vav</i> but not the first. It is, however, possible to say that <small>in this verse the word </small>לִמְאוֹרֹת should be written לִמְאוֹרוֹת with both <i>vavim,</i> since there is no tradition that it is lacking <small>one</small> <i>vav</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Minchas Shai </i>to <i>Bereishis </i>1:15, which states that there is a tradition that the word לִמְאוֹרֹת in this verse should be written including the first <i>vav, </i>but without the second.</i> Whatever <small>the spelling of </small>מאורת<small> in that verse</small>, the word מְאֹרֹת in the verse, יהי מְאֹרֹת, “Let there be luminaries,” and in the verse, ויעש א-להים את שני המארת הגדלים, “and God made the two great luminaries,” is written lacking <i>vavim</i> entirely. <small>This</small> indicates that originally, when God conceived of the luminaries, He had in mind the possibility of diminishment, and <small>indeed,</small> when God made <small>the luminaries</small> He <small>diminished one of them</small>. That diminishment affected both the size <small>of the moon</small> and the measure of its light. When considering all the particulars, it is possible to say that there are two other <small>dimensions to the moon’s</small> diminishment: that the place of its orbit was lowered to the lowest sphere, and that as a result of this diminishment, there is a possibility for a lunar eclipse. Hence, there are four aspects <small>to the moon’s</small> diminishment, <small>which are alluded to by the lack of four </small><i>vavim</i> <small>in the verses discussing the creation of the luminaries</small><i>.</i> According to the version that <small>the word </small>מְאוֹרֹת<small>, “luminaries” in the verse</small>, “They shall be luminaries” is also written lacking one <i>vav,</i> that <small>missing </small><i>vav</i> can be understood as alluding to a solar eclipse, because the possibility for a solar eclipse also resulted from the diminishment of the moon. For when both the sun and the moon were equal in size and on the same plane, there could not be a solar eclipse, since the moon was not located on a lower plane and thus would not intervene – as it can at present – between someone looking from the earth and the sun.",
                    "In summary, the Masoretic text clearly indicates – as I explained in the elucidation of the passage from <i>Chulin</i> – that the diminishment of the moon was necessary, and would have happened even if <small>the moon</small> had not complained. This is <small>alluded to</small> by the <i>mesorah</i> <small>with the words</small>, ויאמר א-להים יהי מְאֹרֹת, “And God said, ‘Let there be luminaries’”. <small>The missing </small><i>vavim</i><small> in the word </small>מְאֹרֹת<small> serves as a mnemonic device to teach us</small> that God caused the lack – i.e., the diminishment – of the moon and that <small>diminishment</small> would have happened even if <small>the moon</small> had not complained. Similarly, the fact that the word “luminaries” in the verse, ויעש א-להים את שני המארת הגדלים, “God made the two great luminaries” is lacking <small>two </small><i>vavim</i>, indicates that God created the moon <small>intending for it to be diminished</small>, even were it not to have complained.",
                    "<small>The concept that the moon underwent a diminishment is also reflected by</small> the phrase, יהי מארת ברקיע השמים, “Let there be luminaries in the expanse of the heaven.” <small>It seems</small> unnecessary for the verse to say ברקיע השמים, “in the expanse of the heaven.” <small>However, this apparent redundancy alludes to the moon’s diminishment.</small> The term <i>rakia</i> refers to the sphere in which the sun is located. <small>This sphere is called </small><i>rakia</i> because it is in the middle of the seven heavens that are designated for the seven planets.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the sun is in the fourth orbit. Below the sun are the moon, <i>Kochav </i>(Mercury), and <i>Nogah </i>(Venus), and above the sun are <i>Ma’adim</i> (Mars), <i>Tzedek</i> (Jupiter), and <i>Shabbetai</i> (Saturn).</i> Therefore, <i>rakia</i> is an appropriate term, for just as the <i>rakia</i> divided between the higher waters and the lower waters,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis</i> 1:7.</i> so too, the orbit of the sun divides between the three <small>orbits of the planets closest to the earth</small> and the three orbits <small>furthest from it. The moon was created</small> in this orbit before its diminishment. True, as explained above, <small>God</small> already planned to diminish <small>the moon</small>. Nevertheless, initially, <small>God</small> established both <small>the sun and the moon</small> in this middle orbit. Moreover, initially, it was <small>God’s intent</small> to only create these two luminaries and no others. Nevertheless, after <small>God</small> diminished <small>the moon</small>, He “increased its hosts,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Rashi</i>’s commentary to <i>Bereishis</i> 1:16, based on <i>Bereishis Rabbah </i>6:4.</i> i.e., <small>God also brought into being</small> the stars, including the five <i>nevuchim,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This term refers to the five planets, <i>Kochav </i>(Mercury), <i>Nogah </i>(Venus), <i>Ma’adim</i> (Mars), <i>Tzedek</i> (Jupiter), and <i>Shabbetai</i> (Saturn). They are called <i>nevuchim, </i>“perplexed,” because the mazelike nature of their orbits causes them to appear “perplexed” in their movements through the heavenly sphere (Shmuel<i> </i>ibn<i> </i>Tibbon).</i> and all <small>the stars</small> in the orbit of the constellations. <small>On this basis, it can be understood why initially, the purpose of the creation of the sun and the moon is described as being:</small> “to make a distinction between the day and the night.” This was achieved through the creation of the sun and the moon alone. Hence, only the two <small>major luminaries</small> were mentioned <small>in the Torah’s description of God’s</small> initial intent. <small>In contrast, the phrase “to radiate light” refers to</small> all the other stars, for they also radiate light to the earth. For this reason, “to radiate light” was not mentioned <small>in connection with</small> the creation of the sun and moon, <small>but only</small> when the other stars came into being after the diminishment of the moon. Nevertheless, that diminishment was implicit in God’s initial intent, as explained above and as will be clarified further in the elucidation of the subsequent verses.",
                    "<b>יהי מארת... והיו לאתת Let there be luminaries… They shall serve as signs</b> –The repetition of the root והיו in this verse alludes to a second “being,” i.e., that the sun and moon’s “being” <small>i.e., form</small> would go through a change, for one of them would be diminished. As a result of the moon’s diminishment, there would be signs, appointed times, days, and years. Since God desired to appease <small>the moon</small> because of the diminishment, He told <small>the moon</small> that the Jews would reckon the days and years according to it. <small>The verse did not mention</small> days before signs, because by deviating from the order that frequency dictates, the verse alludes to the fact that after the diminishment <small>of the moon</small>, through which the luminaries would enter a different state of being that would lead to <small>the existence of</small> “signs and appointed times,” God stated, in order to appease <small>the moon</small>, that the Jews would reckon their days and years according to it. <small>The verse states </small><b>והיו לאתת ולמועדים ולימים ושנים</b><small>, they shall be as signs, for appointed times, for days and years. The words “signs”, “appointed times,” and “days”, are all preceded by a </small><i>lamed.</i> The fact that a <i>lamed</i> was not added before the word <i>v’shanim</i> (making it <i>ul’shanim</i>)<i>,</i> as in the other three words, also serves as an allusion. It points to the moon’s response that the reckoning of years is fundamentally dependent on the sun and its annual cycle, as explained above in the explanation of the passage from <i>Chulin.</i>",
                    "<b>והיו למאורת ברקיע השמים Let them serve as luminaries in the expanse of the heaven to radiate light</b> – The repetition of the word והיו refers to another change that would come to pass as a result of the diminishing <small>of the moon</small>, creating a new entity, {the light,}<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This and other additions in squiggle brackets were made on the basis of the text of <i>Chiddushei HaLevanah </i>printed as an addendum to <i>Machon Chochmas Shlomoh </i>edition of <i>Rambam’s Hilchos Kiddush HaChodesh.</i></i> that would exist “in the <i>rakia,</i> the expanse of the heaven.” The <i>rakia</i><small> constitutes</small> the lower <small>heaven</small> which was created to separate between the <small>higher</small> waters and the <small>lower</small> waters. This <small>refers to</small> the open space that is between the spheres, as I explained in another exposition, which explains the entire process of creation as it transpired in all the first Six Days of Creation, which I called <i>The Formation of the Elements</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tosfos Yom Tov </i>wrote several expositions, <i>derushim, </i>which are transcripts of sermons that he delivered. Of these, <i>Chiddushei HaLevanah </i>is one of the few for which the text is extant.</i> In essence, the sun and the moon do not possess the potential to radiate light, for the heavens and all their hosts do not possess any defined potential. All the changes that result from them in <small>this</small> lowly world stem from the recipients. Therefore, the sun darkens a person’s complexion, but whitens clothes, for everything depends on the recipients. Hence, were <small>the moon</small> not to have been diminished, the difference between the day and the night would have been of an entirely different nature. The light <small>that radiated forth on</small> the first day <small>of Creation, before the creation of the luminaries</small>, and the darkness mentioned <small>in those verses</small>, would have continued, and the distinction <small>between this primeval light and primeval darkness</small> would <small>have come as a result of</small> the luminaries. This constituted the difference between the first three days of Creation and all subsequent time. During the first three days of Creation, the distinction between light and darkness was made without the luminaries. From the fourth day onward, God desired that the difference between light and darkness come as a result of these luminaries. Initially, {however, God did not desire} to conceal the original light <small>that radiated forth throughout</small> the first three days. Nevertheless, {after the complaint of the moon,} God desired that one <small>of the luminaries</small> be diminished, and that the light of the first three days <small>of Creation</small> be concealed. <small>The luminaries</small> would come into existence and they would generate light in “the expanse of the heaven,” i.e., <small>in the area that</small> separates between <small>the higher</small> waters and <small>the lower</small> waters. The light that <small>the luminaries</small> would generate would be dependent on the manner in which its influence is accepted <small>by the recipients,</small> as stated above.",
                    "On this basis, we can understand the rationale <small>for the creation of the</small> two luminaries as equal <small>in size</small>, although the original intent was that ultimately one <small>luminary</small> would be diminished. This pattern resembles God’s creation of the light at the beginning of Creation, and His subsequent concealment of it for the reason explained by our Sages.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Chagigah </i>12a. That source states that God’s original light was concealed so that the wicked would not benefit from it.</i> Accordingly, <small>in this verse</small>, the focus is on the original <small>intent</small>, when <small>the sun and the moon</small> were created as equals, and the original light radiated forth. <small>This passage relates that after creating this original light, </small><i>vayavdel E-lohim,</i> <small>“and God made a distinction.”</small><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis </i>1:4.</i><small> The words</small> <i>vayavdel E-lohim</i> allude to the concealment of the light <small>on</small> the first day <small>of Creation</small>, i.e., God made a distinction concerning this light, and set it aside for the righteous in the Ultimate Future, as <i>Rashi</i> explains.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Rashi</i>’s<i> </i>commentary to <i>Bereishis </i>1:4.</i> It is in this very thought that <small>the impulse that</small> the moon would be diminished arose. <small>The moon</small> would shine in “the expanse of the heaven” as explained, and the primeval light would no longer shine forth <small>because it would</small> be concealed.",
                    "Since there are three <small>totally</small> different changes in being resulting from one activity,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the moon’s existence underwent three stages: a) initially it was of one size and was located in the orbit of the fourth sphere, b) its size and light were diminished, and c) it was compelled to descend to a lower orbit.</i> therefore the verse immediately states “And it was so.” Even though the order of creation underwent a change – originally, the luminaries were of equal size, and afterwards, their being became different – by saying, “and it was so,” the narrative indicates that one should note that the state of being of the luminaries underwent a change. <small>It is as if the narrative says,</small> note the progression of the different states of being as described, although <small>these states of being</small> appear contradictory to each other.",
                    "<b>God made the two great luminaries</b> – The narrative proceeds to describe how this action fulfilled God’s <small>original</small> intent, for He made two great luminaries, equal in appearance and size, and having the same location. Nevertheless, immediately afterwards, <small>God</small> diminished one of <small>the luminaries</small>, because even initially, the intent was that they be diminished. Initially, were the luminaries to have remained equal <small>in size</small>, light and darkness would not be dependent on them. <small>The luminaries</small> would merely “make a distinction between the day and the night,” <small>as stated initially in the narrative</small>. Nevertheless, after <small>God’s</small> wisdom dictated that the original light be concealed, <small>the sun and the moon</small> would serve as the sources of light “radiating light upon the earth and its inhabitants.” And for this reason, <small>the sun and the moon</small> would “rule,” one “during the day,” and the other “during the night,” as the narrative proceeds to state. As a natural consequence, this brought about “the signs, appointed times, days, and years,” <small>mentioned earlier</small>. All of these times alter the intervals for good or for the opposite, Heaven forbid. As explained previously,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Page 104ff.</i> all of this came about as a result of the diminishment <small>of the moon</small>. Originally, before the diminishment, the sun and the moon were not designated for these functions; <small>they were</small> merely <small>designated</small> “to make a distinction.” The light that shined originally would be the ruling factor.",
                    "<b>God placed them in the expanse of the heaven</b> – The difference of opinion <small>between the Sages of Israel and the Greek scholars, regarding</small> whether the heavenly sphere is fixed in its place and the stars and constellations move in their orbits, or the stars and constellations are fixed in their positions and the heavenly sphere moves, has existed from the era of the <i>Tannaim</i>, as recorded in Tractate <i>Pesachim</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Pesachim</i> 94b. See page 40 above.</i> The view of our Sages is that the heavenly sphere is fixed and the stars and constellations move…. <small>This conception is</small> supported by the narrative that states first, “and God made the two great luminaries,” and only afterwards, “God placed them in the expanse of the heaven.” It appears from this <small>passage</small> that the luminaries are a unique creation and not <small>merely</small> part of the heavens. <small>To explain:</small> Were one to say that the luminary moves in its orbit and the heavenly sphere is fixed, it is understandable that the luminary is a separate entity from the heavens, and revolves on the surface of the heavens. <small>A parallel to this exists with regard to</small> the creation of man, concerning which it is stated,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis </i>2:7.</i> “God the Lord formed man,” and only afterwards, “God the Lord planted a garden… and placed man there.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid. </i>2:8. I.e., just as man was first created and then placed in a different location, the moon was first created and then placed into its orbit.</i> If, by contrast, one would postulate that the luminary was fixed <small>in the heavens</small> and the heavenly sphere revolved, the luminaries would be part of the essence of the heavens. Otherwise, were one to postulate that the luminaries were separate entities implanted into the heavenly sphere, as it were, the substance that previously existed there would be nullified. That <small>theory</small> runs contrary to logic.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to this theory, the luminaries would be displacing other matter.</i> Instead, one would be forced to say that <small>the luminary</small> is part of <small>the sphere</small>, it is just that God in the power of His wisdom made that portion of the <small>heavenly</small> sphere luminous. If that is the intent, the sequence “He made the two great luminaries” and only afterwards “God placed them in the expanse of the heaven,” is problematic…. “Plac<small>ing</small>” could be interpreted as distinguishing them and granting them honor, as in the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shmos </i>6:1.</i> “I placed you as a judge for Pharaoh” and “I will place him as prominent.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tehillim </i>89:28.</i>…",
                    "On this verse, there is a relevant passage from the <i>Midrash:</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis</i> <i>Rabbah </i>6:8.</i> “How do the spheres of the sun and the moon set?... Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai said: ‘We do not know whether they fly through the air, glide in the heaven, or proceed in their usual manner. It is an exceedingly difficult matter, and no created being can fathom it.’”… It is possible to explain that “flying” refers to proceeding at an exceedingly fast pace. “Gliding” also reflects swift progress, but not as fast as “flying.” An object glides rapidly because the air does not impede its progress to the same degree as an entity of substance which holds back one who runs on it. One who “proceeds in his usual manner” does not move quickly. All of these three approaches, however, follow the approach <small>of our Sages</small>, that the stars revolve and the heavenly sphere remains fixed in place.",
                    "<b>To rule during the day and during the night, and to make a distinction between the light and the darkness</b> – The wording of the verse indicates that <small>ruling during the day and during the night, and making a distinction between light and darkness</small> are two separate purposes. <b>To rule</b> was part of the appeasement that God <small>granted the moon</small>, instructing it to “go and rule during the day and during the night”. ",
                    "Afterwards, the verse mentions making <b>a distinction between the light and the darkness</b>, which is the same as stated in God’s original intent, <b>to make a distinction between the day and the night</b>, as “God called the light, day.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis</i> 1:5.</i>...",
                    "The fact that God did not explicitly mention the luminaries in the phrase, “And God saw that it was good,” as He <small>explicitly</small> mentioned the light with regard to the first day, is readily explained as related to the moon’s complaint. <small>To cite a parallel:</small> The <i>Midrash</i> relates<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis Rabbah </i>4:6;<i> Yalkut Shimoni, Bereishis </i>1:5.</i> that <small>the phrase</small>, “And God saw that it was good,” was not mentioned with regard to the second day because division was created on that day. That Midrashic passage continues: “Now, if <b>God saw that it was good</b> is not mentioned with regard to a division that is for the benefit of the world and its stability, how much more so does this apply to a division that leads to the disruption of the order of the world.”",
                    "<small>The text continues for a little bit more than a page. Nevertheless, portions of the manuscript were illegible and thus not copied in the printed text.

                    "As mentioned, after the conclusion of every phase of creation, it is written, “And God saw <i>ki tov,</i>” commonly translated as “<b>that</b> it was good,” while at the end of the entire narrative of Creation, it is written,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Bereishis </i>1:31.</i> “And God saw everything that He had made and <b>behold </b>(<i>v’hinai</i>), it was very good.” Our Sages explain that <i>ki</i> can also be understood as <i>im,</i> i.e., it is a conditional term. After every day’s creation, God saw the possibility for good. Nevertheless, the ultimate good can only be achieved when man uses the world for Torah. Therefore, after the creation of man, the Torah states, “And God saw everything that He had made and behold<b>,</b> it was very good.” At that stage, the goodness will not be conditional, because through man’s action, the world will be brought to its complete perfection, as will be realized in the Ultimate Future."
