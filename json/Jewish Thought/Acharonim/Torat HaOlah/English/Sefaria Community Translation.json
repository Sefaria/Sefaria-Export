            "Menachot 110a: “A Song of Ascents, Behold, bless the Lord, all you servants of the Lord, who stand in the House of the Lord at night” (Psalms 134:1). What is “at night”? Rabbi Yoḥanan says: These are Torah scholars, who engage in Torah study at night. The verse ascribes them credit as though they engage in the Temple service... Reish Lakish said: What is that which is written: “This is the law [torah] of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering...” (Leviticus 7:37)? [This teaches that] anyone who engages in Torah is as though he sacrificed a burnt offering, a meal offering, a sin offering, and a guilt offering... \"...And in every place offerings are presented to My name, and a pure meal offering...\" (Malachi 1:11) Do they really present offerings in every place? [Rather] these are Torah scholars, who engage in Torah in every place. [God says:] I ascribe them credit as though they burn and present offerings to My name.",
            "And we say there that Torah scholars who engage in Torah are as if the Holy Temple is being built in their days.",
            "In Midrash Rabbati Tzav (Pesikta Rabbati 16:1), Rav [Huna] said two things: 1) The exiles will only be gathered in through the merit of Mishna. Why? \"And while they are courting among the nations, I will gather them\" (Hosea 8:10). Rav Huna said, \"Or from where the sun rises to where it sets, My name is honored among the nations, and everywhere incense and pure oblation are offered to My name...\" (Malachi 1:11). Is it really so that a pure oblation is offered in Babylonia? Rather, this [Babylonia] refers to the Mishna. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, \"Since you engage in the Mishna, it is as if you offered a sacrifice. Shmuel said, \"When they are ashamed of all they have done [make known to them the layout of the Temple]...\" (Ezekiel 43:11). Is there a layout of the Temple to this day? Rather, the Holy One, blessed be He, said, \"Since you engage in its study, it is as if you built it.\""

                "There were 11 kaftorim [on the menorah of the Mishkan], parallel to the Torah’s 11 essentials and roots, as [Rabbi Yosef Albo] the author of the Ikkarim wrote (1:15), “Using this method, we find that the essentials and roots are eleven”... And although HaRav Abarbanel, in his book Rosh Emunah, argued against  those who identify roots and essentials for Torah since we must believe in the entire Torah, his words have neither root nor essential in this. We have seen the Sages say (Makkot 23b-24a), “David came and established the Torah on ten principles, Isaiah came and established it on six, etc.”<br> And the flowers [on the menorah of the Mishkan]  were nine, parallel to nine true beliefs which every person of Torah should believe, such that one who denies any of them is called a “heretic”..."
