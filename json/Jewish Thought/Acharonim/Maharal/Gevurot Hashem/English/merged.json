            "\"It is the glory of God to conceal a thing; but the glory of kings is to search out a matter\" (Proverbs 25:2). We find in the Midrash (Bereshit Rabba, Ch. 9): Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Chama bar Chanina said: From the beginning of the book of Bereshit until \"and he completed\" it is the glory of God to conceal a thing.\" Concerning the remaining parts of the Torah, \"search a matter out.\"",
            "Since a person's understanding is subjective, (relative to the person) the concept being studied cannot be completely unrelated to the subjective world of the student. Were a perception completely unrelated to the human being, it would not be fit for human analysis.",
            "For this reason the Torah does not openly speak of the world to come or the immortality of the soul. If the Torah were the work of a ruler of flesh and blood concerned to warn his subjects not to disobey his commands, no doubt these things would be mentioned. The concepts 'world to come' and 'garden of Eden' would be used as incentives to ensure that his will is followed. Those who obey him would be guaranteed-a share in the 'garden of Eden' and those who disregard his will would be threatened with dire punishment. However the Torah work of the living God transmitted to us by the prophet. therefore the topics dealt with are relative to the comprehension of the prophet. 'The world to come' and 'immortality' are Nivdal. set apart from corporeal man and having no existence within, the world presently accessible to him; consequently any concepts we can formulate about them must be remote and apart from human comprehension; and a prophet cannot consider anything that is beyond human reach.",
            "In this respect, there is a difference between wisdom and prophecy. The scholar comprehending through intellect can grasp the most abstract and esoteric concepts. The prophet on the other hand is called a \"seer\" or \"man of vision\". Since his prophecy shares its characteristics with his external vision and viewpoint, he must have some experiential connection with the object of his prophecy.",
            "Therefore our sages have taught (Baba Batrah 12a) a sage is better than prophet. And the explanation is that prophecy is like seeing in the eye whereas the object is outside, and even though the prophecy isn't tangible feeling, it's still like feeling related to the object, the prophecy power of the prophet, which is visioning power or other power of accepting the prophecy, is related to the object the prophecy is about."

                "<b>Who can speak of the mighty acts of <i>Adonai</i>; Proclaim all God's praise? Ps. 106:2 </b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From the <i>Shabbat </i>liturgy: “If our mouths were as full of song as the sea, and our tongue as full of jubilation as its myriad waves, if our lips were full of praise like the spacious heavens, and our eyes shone like the sun and moon, and our hands as outstretched as eagles of the sky, and our feet as swift as hinds – we still could not sufficiently thank You.</i> This verse teaches us that to praise the Holy One is impossible from two perspectives. First, one cannot fully express the greatness of God’s acts. Second, since God's acts are without end, it is impossible to praise all of them. Therefore both qualitatively and quantitatively one cannot fully praise God. Qualitatively, words cannot fully capture the greatness of God's might and quantitatively, one cannot mention all of God's acts that deserve praise. This is the meaning of the verse from Psalms. Regarding the qualitative nature of God’s acts, Scripture states, \"Who can speak of (<i>milel</i>) the mighty acts of God.\" The word <i>milel, </i>tell, implies saying something new as in the verse, \"Who would have said (<i>milel</i>) that Abraham that Sarah would suckle children?\" (Gen. 21:7) The second half of the verse expresses the great number of God's acts, \"Who can proclaim all God's praise?\" The expression, \"all God's praise,\" implies the great number of acts God has performed.",
                "The <i>Talmud </i>relates: \"A certain reader went down<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this story, the person who was leading the congregation in prayer added a list of adjectives in praise of God. In the rabbinic world, there was not yet a set liturgy yet so the prayer leader would improvise in phrasing the prayers. Rabbi Hanina chides the prayer leader for adding too many adjectives in praise of God and not using the three terms of praise which Moses stated and the Great Assembly canonized. The Men of the Great Assembly created the first order of prayers at the beginning of the second Temple period.</i> (to lead prayers) in the presence of Rabbi Hanina and said, 'O God, great, mighty, terrible, majestic, powerful, awful, strong, fearless, sure and honored.' Rabbi Hanina waited till he had finished, and then said to him, 'Have you concluded all the praise of God? Why do we say all this? Even with the three terms that we do say (<i>haGadol haGibor, v’haNorah</i>, from Deut. 10:17) , had not Moses mentioned them in the Torah and the Men of the Great Synagogue not inserted them in the Amida, we should not have been able to mention them, and you say all these and still go on! It is as if an earthly king had a million denarii of gold and someone praised him as possessing silver ones.'\" (B. Berachot 33b)",
                "Maimonides explains this to mean that one should not try to praise the extent of God's greatness nor mention all of God's mighty acts since they are without number. This is the meaning of the parable: switching gold with silver demeans the quality of the praise just as praising the king for having thousands of denarii when he actually has thousands upon thousands diminishes the king and would be an insult to him.",
                "Therefore, one must ask, how can we be commanded to praise God's mighty acts that took place during the Exodus? Why not say, \"Who can tell the mighty acts of <i>Adonai</i>, proclaim all God's praise,” and refrain from praising God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since we cannot possibly mention all the miraculous acts that God performed during the Exodus or the greatness of each individual act why are we commanded to mention all of God's mighty acts and praise God for having redeemed us? God's greatness is beyond human comprehension and expression.</i>",
                "It is true that we are incapable of \"telling the mighty acts of God and proclaiming all God's praise.\" The reason we speak of God's mighty acts on Passover eve is not for God's sake but for our own sake. We recite these praises so that we don’t become ungrateful for the miracles and wonders that God has performed for us. If we give thanks for even a small portion of that which God has done for us then we are less likely to become ungrateful.",
                "This suggests that if it was not our intention to praise God, then it is not forbidden to speak of God's attributes, as Rabbi Hanina said, \"Had Moses our Master not mentioned these three words…we should not have been able to mention them.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If it is one's intention to praise God then one might sound like a servile person who flatters others. Praise serves a higher purpose of developing a sense of reverence in the presence of God. God does not need our praise, in other words; we need these words of praise to develop the proper attitudes in ourselves. We do not call God Ha-el <i>hagadol hagibor v'hanora</i> – the great mighty and awesome God - as a means of praising God but simply because this was the formula used by Moses. It serves as a means of developing reverence rather than serving as a means of praising God.</i> Since praise of God is unseemly, why did Moses offer these words of praise, 'great, mighty, and awesome?' It was not Moses intention to speak words of praise God but rather to teach the people of Israel to become more God fearing. By contemplating these three terms (God is great, mighty, and awesome) the people could develop fear of God. That is why it was permissible for Moses to recite these words and for the Men of the Great Assembly to insert them into the Amida. Even though they were included in the Amidah, they were not offered as words of praise. They were simply words that were taken from Scripture.",
                "The fact that the Men of the Great Assembly decreed that they should be included in the Amida proves that we do not say them to include words of praise but rather to create a set text for the Amida based on the language of Moses."

                "<b>Why Do We Recall the Exodus on Passover Eve: Critiquing Maimonides </b>It is a positive commandment to tell the story of the Exodus on the first night of Passover. This commandment is discussed by Maimonides in the <i>Mishnah </i>Torah: It is a positive commandment of the Torah … as stated: \"Remember this day, on which you left Egypt,\" (Ex. 13:3) just as it is stated: \"Remember the Sabbath day to sanctify it.\" (Ex. 20:8) From where (do we learn that it is a commandment to tell the story of the Exodus) on the night of the fifteenth? The Torah states: \"And you shall tell your son on that day, saying: 'It is because of this...'\"(Ex. 13:8) implying that the <i>mitzvah </i>is to be fulfilled when <i>matzah </i>and <i>maror </i>are placed before you. This <i>mitzvah </i>applies even if one does not have a son. Even sages are obligated to speak about the Exodus. Whoever elaborates on the events which took place during the Exodus is worthy of praise. (<i>Hilchot Chametz U'Matzah</i>, 7:1) Maimonides implies that one must recall the Exodus on the fifteenth of Nisan (\"Remember this day on which you left Egypt\") in the same manner that one is sanctifies the Sabbath on the Sabbath eve. Thus, Maimonides states that telling the story of the Exodus must begin in the evening just as the Sabbath is sanctified at nightfall. (The Maharal suggests that Maimonides' explanation is problematic.) The Sabbath is different from Passover since regarding the Sabbath, the Torah states that one must \"sanctify it.\" Regarding Passover the Torah states \"Remember this day\" but it does not state to \"sanctify this day,\" as it does for the Sabbath. \"Remember this day on which you left Egypt\" applies every day and not only on festivals. Also, regarding the Sabbath, the Torah states to observe (<i>shamor</i>) and to remember (<i>zachor</i>) the Sabbath Day. The <i>Talmud </i>states \"One who is commanded to observe the Sabbath must also \"remember\" the Sabbath.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The commandment regarding the Sabbath is written differently in the two versions of the Ten Commandments. In Exodus 20 the Torah says to remember the Sabbath; in Deuteronomy 5 the Torah states observe the Sabbath. The two terms refer to the different aspects of the Sabbath: Remember is the prescriptive aspect of Shabbat (Reciting the <i>Kiddush</i>, lighting candles, preparing special meals) while observe refers to the proscriptive aspect of the Sabbath (not lighting a fire, refraining from work, etc).</i> (B. Shavuot 20b) Regarding Passover in Exodus 13:3, the Torah says nothing about 'observing' the day so one cannot assume that this verse applies to the fifteenth of Nisan. The other verse which Maimonides mentions is also problematic in proving that one must tell the story of the Exodus on the fifteenth of Nisan. The verse, \"And you shall tell your son on that day, saying: 'It is because of this...'\" applies to teaching the Exodus to one's children; it is not a general obligation for everyone to remember the Exodus. Also, it brings us back to the original question. How does one know that this verse applies to the fifteenth of Nisan? It might apply to speaking of the Exodus every day. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Both verses that Maimonides uses as proof texts speak about remembering the Exodus but do not specify what day the Exodus should be remembered on. Maharal suggests that both verses might be a general commandment to remember the Exodus daily and not necessarily on the anniversary of the event.</i> The <i>Mekhilta</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Mekhilta </i>is an early <i>Midrash</i>.</i> also understands Exodus 13:3 as applying not to Passover eve but to the general obligation of remembering the Exodus: \"And Moses said to the people: Remember this day when you went out of Egypt, etc.\" I know only that the Exodus from Egypt is mentioned in the daytime. Whence do I derive the same for the evenings? From, \"… so that you remember the day of your going out of Egypt all the days of your life:\" (Deut 16:3) \"the days of your life\" — the days; \"all the days of your life,\" includes the nights, as per Ben Zoma. (<i>Midrash Mekhilta Parshat Bo</i>, 13:3) This would seem to contradict the opinion of Maimonides' interpretation of Exodus 13:3. There is no hint in this verse that one must mention the Exodus on Passover eve, the fifteenth of Nisan. The verse suggests that one only needs to mention the Exodus. It would be enough to recite the <i>Kiddush </i>(which contains a mention of the Exodus). Rather, the verse from which one learns that we are obligated to tell the story of the Exodus on the eve of Passover is, \"When, in time to come, your child asks, 'What means the testimonies, statutes, and rules that the Lord your God has enjoined upon you,' You shall say to your children, \"We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt'…\" (Deut. 6:20)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Haggadah </i>begins its telling with Deuteronomy 6:20 - \"We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt…\" This is the answer given in the Torah to the question attributed to the wise child. For the Maharal, this would appear to be the key passage in the Torah since it contains both the most complex question as well as the most general answer to the question of why we remember the Exodus as well as who must remember the Exodus. Deut. 6, then, is considered to be the model for the <i>Haggadah</i>, even though Exodus 13: 3 and 14 are the basis for telling the story on the eve of the fifteenth of Nisan.</i> Commenting on this verse, the <i>Midrash </i>states, \"Rabbi Eliezer asked: From where does one learn that if a group of scholars or students are together on Passover eve, that they must study the laws of Passover....because it is stated, 'What mean the testimonies…'\" (<i>Mekhilta Bo </i>13:14)",
                "Since this verse states: \"What mean the testimonies, statutes and rules,\" it must be speaking about a person who is knowledgeable. (This verse implies that the child who asks the question has the ability to differentiate between three types of commandments.) The word testimony (<i>edut</i>) refers to commandments that testify to the events in Israel's history, such as, the Passover offering is testimony that God 'passed over' the houses of the Israelites; <i>matzah </i>is testimony that the Israelites left Egypt before the dough had time to rise; and <i>maror </i>testifies to the bitterness of slavery and hard labor. Other commandments are statutes (<i>hukkim</i>), such as the commandment to offer a lamb and not a cow, and that it must be one year old and not two year old. These laws are called statutes (<i>hukkim</i>) because there is no explanation for the law and they must be obeyed on faith alone. There are also rules (<i>mishpatim</i>) in the Torah such as the rule that an uncircumcised person cannot eat the Passover offering and that only an Israelite can consume the Passover offering. These rules make clear that the offering only applies to those who were redeemed from Egypt and to no one else. Even though the verse states 'child' (\"When your child asks\"), the verse refers to sages in general, since the point of the verse is that the questioner is discerning in his questions. He knows enough to know how to differentiate between the different types of commandments: testimonies, statutes, and rules. The verse in Deuteronomy states that one still has to teach all matters relating to the Exodus even though it is obvious that these matters are known to him already. The fact that the child asks a question does not imply that he doesn’t know the answer. This is implied in the teaching: \"If his son is wise, then let him ask. If the son is not wise enough, let his wife ask him; if she is unable to do so, let him ask himself questions. Even two sages who are together should ask one another, \"How different is this night!\" (<i>Pesachim </i>116a) The reason that it is better for a child to ask questions is because the purpose of the telling is to publicize the wonders and miracles which the Holy One performed at the time of the Exodus. It is better for the child to ask since this will allow for an even greater spreading of the Exodus story. One should relate all matters regarding the Exodus to him. Telling the story to a good student who already knows about the Exodus is not as effective as such a student already knows about it. Still, a <i>mitzvah </i>is still a <i>mitzvah</i>! One is obligated to study about the story of the Exodus since even though one already knows the story, by telling the story orally, one publicizes the Exodus more.",
                "We see from Deuteronomy 6:20 that even two scholars or a someone celebrating Passover alone is obligated to relate the story of the Exodus. This verse is not a proof text for the commandment but an example to remind us that it applies not only to one's child but to all Jews. Like Exodus 13:8, it applies to the eve of Passover. At this time one is obligated to tell the story of the Exodus to his child and even to himself, even if he is a scholar. Even though the Mekhilta speaks of studying the laws of Passover, discussing the laws of Passover is one way of teaching the story of the Exodus, since when we explain the different Passover foods we tell the story of the Exodus…\n"

                "<b>The Exodus as Foundation of Torah Faith </b>God chose to make His deeds known to all humanity on the eve of Passover. The Exodus is the foundational story in the Torah and the root of all belief. Many <i>mitzvot </i>were decreed in order to keep the Exodus before us as the basis of belief and so it would never be forgotten, such as: dwelling in the Sukkah, \"in order that future generations may know that I made the Israelites live in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt,\" (Lev. 23:43) and Sabbath, \"Remember that you were slaves in the land of Egypt.\" (Deut. 5:15) Certainly Passover and the festival of Unleavened Bread served as a reminder of the Exodus. On each festival we sanctify the day by saying, \"A reminder of the Exodus from Egypt.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We often associate <i>Kiddush </i>with wine. Actually, it refers to the blessing after the wine in which we declare the \"sanctity\" of the day: \"Blessed are You, Our God, Ruler of the world, You have chosen us from all peoples, exalting us and sanctifying us with <i>mitzvot</i>. In Your love, Our God, You have given us feasts of gladness and seasons of joy; this festival of matzot, season of our freedom, in love, a holy commemoration, a reminder of the Exodus from Egypt. God, You have chosen us from all peoples, consecrating us to your service, giving us the Festivals, a time of gladness and joy.</i> In addition to all these occasions, we are obligated to remember the Exodus every day, and according to Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah, both day and night. The Exodus and not the miracles associated with it are the foundation of faith. Even though the Holy One performed countless miracles and wonders, the Torah did not command us to remember them. While someone of limited intellect who makes his judgments based on what he sees, the miracles and wonders might seem greater than the Exodus, this is not the case from the Torah's perspective. The Torah made the Exodus the principle and the basis of faith, as we see from the examples listed above and which we learn from many other statements in the Torah. Commenting on the verse, \"Jethro rejoiced<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to another <i>Midrash</i>, Jethro didn’t just \"rejoice\" (<i>vayichad</i>) but he affirmed his faith and adopted the religion of Israel. The word <i>vayichad is </i>said to be related to the word <i>yichud</i>, affirming God's oneness.</i> over all the kindness that the Lord had shown Israel when He delivered them out of Egypt\" (Ex. 18:9) the <i>Mekhilta </i>states, \"The Exodus is equal to all the miracles and mighty acts that the Holy One performed for Israel.: (<i>Yitro </i>Ch. 1)",
                "<i>Midrash Shocher Tov </i>states:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shochar Tov </i>is a <i>Midrash </i>on the book of Psalms. It is a homoletical work known since the 11th century. It was called also Shocher Tov because it begins with the verse in Prov. 11:27.</i> “the Lord has taken you, and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt…” (Deut. 4:20) “Just as the gold smith stretches forth his hand and takes the gold from the fiery furnace, so the Holy One took Israel out of Egypt. Just like a fetus in its animal's womb so the shepherd places his hands and takes out the new born animal, as it is stated: 'Has any God ventured to go and take one nation from the midst of another nation?'\" (Deut. 4:34) ",
                "This <i>Midrash </i>explains two important things about the nature of the Exodus from Egypt (with these two metaphors). First, that Egypt was so powerful and invincible, so that the people of Israel could not free themselves from their control. And second, we learn that the Israelites were so dependent on the Egyptians that they did not have any independence or self-will. Thus, Israel was compared to gold in fiery furnace in which the fire serves as a separation between the gold and the one who wishes to take it out of the furnace. When Israel was in Egypt, the Egyptians subjugated them and ruled over them so severely that there was no way for them to escape. Regarding the metaphor of the fetus, Israel was attached to Egypt in the way that a fetus is attached to its mother so that it has no vitality or independence of its own. This is what the Torah implies when it states that the Lord freed Israel from Egypt \"with a mighty hand.\" (Deut. 6:21) and a \"outstretched arm.\" (Deut. 5:15) <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Midrash </i>uses two metaphors to describe the nature of Israel's Exodus: the fiery furnace and the womb. The Maharal sees in these two metaphors two aspects of slavery and liberation. The first metaphor suggests the nature of Egypt's tyranny. The second metaphor, the womb, suggests that Israel could not become a full nation until it was fully developed into a nation that could be redeemed. Both the furnace and the womb were a deterrent to Israel's Exodus: Oppression by Egypt and immaturity on the part of Israel. He now explores these metaphors. Metaphors are both helpful for understanding an idea but also have limitations. One cannot understand them too literally.</i> ...",
                "\"With a mighty hand:\" When the <i>Midrash </i>compares the Exodus to taking gold out of a furnace, it is suggesting that God took Israel out of Egypt much in the way a goldsmith might take gold from the furnace barehanded. Doing so with tongs would not have been so miraculous. Since the gold is in a furnace, the fire not only refines the gold but serves as a partition, preventing the goldsmith from removing it from the furnace. The fire and furnace serve as a partition between him and the gold. So, too, when Israel was subjugated to Egypt, there could be no connection between the Holy One and Israel. In order to take the Israelites out of Egypt, the Holy One had to connect with the Israelites which was as difficult as a goldsmith reaching into the furnace with his bare hands. This is the meaning of the verse, \"The Lord… brought them out of Egypt, that fiery furnace, to be His very own inheritance.\" (Deut. 4:20) The difficulty was from the perspective of Egypt which prevented Israel from connecting with God. ...",
                "The second metaphor describes the problem of leaving Egypt from the perspective of Israel. The Torah states, \"'Has any God ventured to go and take one nation from the midst (<i>mi-kerev</i>) of another nation?\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Maharal's understanding of Israel as a fetus has surprising implications for how we understand abortion and what defines viable life. Israel, the fetus, is not a full nation, as long as it is in the womb of Israel. It is still <i>yerekh emo</i>, still part of its mother. It is merely part of the 'entrails\" and not a full person yet. This fits with the notion of the life of fetus which Jewish law views as potential life and part of the mother rather than a separate being.</i> The word <i>kerev </i>is similar to the language of scripture, \"Moses washed the entrails (<i>ha-kerev</i>)…\" (Lev. 9:14) In other words, while they were in Egypt, the Israel became so absorbed into Egypt that Israel was like the fetus is part of the mother's entrails. Only when it is completely developed did it emerge from the womb as its own person. While they were in Egypt, the people of Israel continued to develop into a complete nation, and would only reach this stage when they numbered 600,000.",
                "This number represents Israel's wholeness. After Israel was punished following the golden calf the Israelites still numbered 600,000, and later, in the book of Numbers, they are still numbered as 600,000. The completeness of Israel is represented the number 600,000. When their number increased later one, it was because they were blessed with increase fertility.",
                "The number six represents wholeness… only that which has three dimensions is complete… since a cube contains four directions and above and below, it represents a whole structure. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One doesn’t usually finding geometry in rabbinic commentaries. I have chosen to summarize this section. The Maharal looks at the numbers as each representing a point in space: one a single dimension, two points a line, four a plane and six a three dimensional cube - a shape that he considers \"whole.\" Similarly six, hundred, and thousand represent complete numbers since they do not change when counting. The numbers, then, represent, wholeness and completion.</i> Because Israel numbered 600,000 it now represented a nation that had reached a state of wholeness. The number 600,000 is considered complete because there are three levels to the number: 'six,' 'hundred,' and 'thousand.' ",
                "",
                "These numbers are all considered to be whole numbers… all numbers are counted with hundreds and thousands (and not tens of thousands). Tens is not included as a complete number because we don’t count in tens. We don’t say six-tens but we say six-hundreds or six-thousands. These numbers are considered complete since they can be combined with the number six without changing the six. When Israel reached the number of six - hundred - thousand, they were they considered complete and prepared to go forth from Egypt like the fetus who reaches its maturation and can come forth from its mother's womb…",
                "One can further understand that the Egyptians overpowered Israel both in term of Israel's form (<i>tzurah</i>) and their substance (<i>chomri</i>). <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a central idea to which the Maharal returns repeatedly in his commentary: Tzurah and chomer, or form and substance. Chomer is the material make up of an object or a person, while tzurah is the idealized form of the thing or person. Everything and everyone is defined by form and substance.</i> There are two aspects to every people or nation. They are made up of substance which makes them a people and they are also defined by their form which gives the nation its uniqueness. The two verses quoted above refer to the two aspects of the people of Israel (the fiery furnace and the womb). The subjugation of Israel had to do with its substance and with its uniqueness. Israel's substance was controlled by subjugation, and its form was controlled by jealousy, opposition and oppression. Slavery affected their substance while oppression affected their form… <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Egypt set out to destroy Israel's substance (their physical makeup as a nation), as well as their spirit (their essence as a people). The two verses with which we began this section regarding the fiery furnace and the delivery of Israel from the womb each refers to a different aspect of Israel as a physical and as a spiritual people.</i> Thus, regarding the Covenant of the Pieces (Gen. 16) it is stated, \"Know that your offspring shall be strangers…and they shall be enslaved and afflicted. The two aspects of Israel's experience in Egypt - physical enslavement and spiritual affliction refer to these two aspects of Israel's identity, substance and form. Israel was subjugated both in terms of its physical substance as a people, and its spiritual form as a nation. Physically, Israel was like a fetus that was attached to its mother. God took them out in the way that a shepherd delivers the baby from its mother. Just as the beast is <i>chomeri, </i>physical substance, so Egypt is substance and Israel was delivered as a physical people from Egypt's womb. Spiritually, God took the people Israel out as a nation by removing them from the fiery furnace of Egypt. Gold is another term for Israel which was refined and purified in the furnace of Egypt. The verse, \"The Lord… brought them out of Egypt, that fiery furnace, to be His very own inheritance\" refers to the people's spiritual form which was redeemed from Egypt.",
                "Scripture states, \"When Israel went forth from Egypt; the House of Jacob from a foreign people.\" (Ps. Ch. 116) Scripture mentions both names because God redeemed both aspects of Israel: its physical substance and its spiritual essence or form. The two names of the Jewish people refer to the form and substance of Israel as a nation. Jacob, which is a humble and lowly name, is connected to the material substance that makes up the nation. This name comes from the word <i>ekev</i>, a heel and to supplant. The name Israel refers to the spiritual form of the nation. This name is connected to the more important aspect of Israel - it is connected to the essence of Israel, <i>ki sarita</i>, \"who wrestled with God.\" "

                "And the Shabbat before Passover is called Shabbat haGadol, and many words have come about this, but none explain it except that we read as a haftara that day \"And they will be pleasing to haShem\" (Malachi 3:4-24) and there it says (Malachi 3:23) \"before the coming of the great [haGadol] and the awesome day of haShem:\" For this reason it is called Shabbat haGadol. And the explanation that the Exodus from Egypt was called great on account of the greatness of God's awesome acts that God did and acted when they left Egypt, and in the future, in the world to come, Israel will aquire even higher levels, and the Holy Blessed One will do even greater deeds than all the great deeds, and even more awesome than all the awesome deeds. And as Israel merited the level of the Exodus from Egypt when great deeds were done with them, they will merit an even higher level and and deeds will be done in the n world to come. And thus the Shabbat before Passover is called Shabbat haGadol, for every Shabbat is a source and remembrance of the world to come which is called Shabbat as well, and thus the Shabbat preceding Pesach is a remembrance of the great Shabbat that will be the \"great and the awesome day of haShem.\"",
                "And thus the Shabbat before the Day of Atonement is called Shabbat Tshuvah [repentance/returning], and this is because the Day of Atonement is a day of repentance/returning, for all return to their original inheritance by the forgiveness of the Holy Blessed One who forvices them, and they return to haShem and this is known, and thus the Torah determined the jubilee on the Day of Atonement for all return to their original inheritance, and the day of Atonement is similar to this, for they repent/return from the iniquities that were upon them and return to haShem, and in the future when every day will be Shabbat all return to haShem at the diminishing of thus world, and this will be by the merit of the Day of Atonement that they now return to haShem, thus they will merit to repent/return on that Shabbat to haShem. And since every Shabbat is a source of the world to come and a remembrance of it, thus the Shabbat preceding the Day of Atonement is a source for the Shabbat on which all will return to haShem, and obviously it's the Shabbat before and not the Shabbat after, for that Shabbat is first and higher. And since the Shabbat of the future of the world to come belongs to the Day of Atonement as we said, our Shabbat is an allegory for it belonging solely to the Shabbat before it, and not the Shabbat after the Day of Atonement for the Day of Atonement has already passed and this is clear. And thus for the matter of Shabbat haGadol.",
                "And look, it is made clear that the Shabbat before Passover we can call it Shabbat haGadol for Passover is great, as above, and the Shabbat relying on it is the Shabbat even more magnified and blessed, for it is all the more the great and awesome day, and understand well that this is correct and there is no doubt for understanding it."

                "<b>Also there (Sota 30b):</b> Rabbi Yosei HaGelili taught: At the time that [the Jewish people] ascended from the sea they resolved to sing a song. [And how did they recite this song?] If a baby was lying on his mother’s lap or an infant was nursing from his mother’s breasts, once they saw the Divine Presence, the baby straightened his neck and the infant dropped the breast from his mouth, and they recited, “This is my God and I will glorify Him” (Exodus 15:2). As it is stated (Psalms 8:3): “Out of the mouths of babies and sucklings You have founded strength (<i>oz</i>, which is spelled the same as the first word in the song).” Rabbi Meir would say: Even fetuses in their mother’s womb recited the song at the sea, as it is stated (Psalms 68:27), “In full assemblies, bless God, the Lord, you that are from the source of Israel.” To here [is the Gemara.]",
                "They wanted to say with this as we said above. For the Song is from the angle of that which is caused desiring to cling to its Cause from which it comes. For every caused thing desires its cause. And hence Rabbi Yosei HaGelili reasoned that the baby who is caused by the mother and clings to his mother, or an infant who turned to the thing that is the source of existence for him, which is nursing – so he was nursing from his mother’s breasts – when he saw the Divine Presence, which is his true cause, he left the physical source and cause and turned to his Cause, which is actually his Cause. For all things turn to their cause. The general principle of the thing that they wanted to say with this is that their level was so great, to the point that they all turned to the Cause and were clinging to it. And this is the matter of Song. For you do not need to say that this Song of the infant was oral and with speech, as people think. Rather, since the level of the Jewish people was so great, to the point that they were all clinging to the First Cause, they were separated from the physical."

And some ask - behold, we have not found an answer to the [question], \"How is it different?\" And because of that, they explained things that are distant from the truth. But all of this is not difficult - as the answer is certainly at the end of the  [section], when he answers, \"Pesach, Matzah and Maror,\" when he gets there.  However, \"We were slaves,\" is the beginning of the story.

                "5 And furthermore you should know, that when the Holy One brought the plagues upon Egypt, he struck them in all divisions of the world, for just as we have said that the plagues came upon them from below, above, and in the hollow (on the surface) of the world, so too they came upon them in all the divisions of the world. There are ten divisions to the world and they are the ten divisions that the Holy One created in the six days of creation. Each division had its own statement and these are the ten statements with which the world was created, for \"Bereishit\" was also a statement as is stated in Masechet Rosh Hashana (32a). Even though the plagues did not come upon them in the order fo the statement with which the Holy One created the world for each one has its own order, that is because with regards to the plagues, each plague was always more severe than the previous on for you wouldn't make one severe plague followed by one that is not as severe. Therefore they went from least to most (severe) and this is what causes the change in the order of the statements.",
                "Still, you will find clearly that all of these plagues corresponded to the ten statements. Because of this you will find in the final statement (Bereishit 1:29) \"And G-d said, Behold I have given you all seed bearing herbs... to eat.\" This is the tenth statement that G-d gave living beings their sustenance and food since food upon consumption becomes blood, and when they become blood, the animal is sustained. G-d altered this statement by making the river blood for just as this statement would have been nullified if the creation of blood, their sustenance, had been removed, so too it is considered lost and destroyed when there is an increase in blood for all addition and all subtraction are equal.",
                "The second plague, Frogs, corresponds to the statement \"Let the waters swarm a swarming of living creatures.\" This nullified the statement \"swarming of living creatures\" for there was addition here and addition and subtraction are equal for it is called striking it when there is a departure from the order (created by) of the statement and here was a change from the natural order.",
                "The third plague, Lice, that the dirt became lice struck at the statement \"\"Let the water that is beneath the heavens gather into one place, and let the dry land appear,\" and now the dry land was struck that the dirt of the land turned to lice. \"Afar\" (dirt) (of the land) refers to an area fit for habitation. The rest of the land is called \"Eretz\", but \"Afar\" refers to inhabited land is clear in Perek Kisuy Hadam (Chullin 88b).",
                "Wild Animals corresponds to \"Let the earth bring forth living creatures,\" that G-d altered this statement to the point that they became completely destructive.",
                "Pestilence corresponds to \"Let there be luminaries in the expanse of the heavens.\" It is agreed upon by researchers that renewed pestilence comes from sparks from the stars that become renewed in their visibility. From them come changes in the air and thickness from star sparks - so say the researchers. Therefore, the pestilence that came upon strikes at the statement \"Let there be luminaries.\"",
                "Boils was a plague against \"Let us make man in our image,\" for we have already explained earlier that boils was a plague that attached itself to man and we don't fine any that attached themselves to man except this one. And since it is written, \"Let us make man in our image - in the image of G-d He created man,\" and with the plague of boils their form and mold was changed, that they no longer had their shape and visage because of the boils attached to them, for the boils destroyed the image of the person that they no longer had a shape and form. For this reason, the sorcerers were embarrassed to stand before Moshe and Aharon when the boils came upon them.",
                "Hail corresponded to \"Let there be an expanse in the midst of the water, and let it be a separation between water and water.\" With this statement, an additional action occurred in the sky and hail came from it in an unnatural way. This was a change in the statement \"Let there be an expanse in the midst of the water,\" for from the skies came hail.",
                "Locusts corresponded to \"Let the earth sprout... fruit trees producing fruit,\" for the locusts were a destruction of this statement specifically, for locusts are more capable than any other insect in destroying fruit as is written (Devarim 28:38), \"The field will produce much seed, but you will gather little for the locusts will consume it,\" and it also says, \"All your trees and fruit of your land will be inherited by locusts.\" From here you see that Locust are specific in their ability to destroy tree and fruit. Even though the hail also struck the trees of the field, it wasn't specific to the trees of the field for it also struck animals and people. But the locusts were specific to the trees and fruit.",

They are both beginnings. Just as the plague of the firstborns was equal to all the other plagues, so too, the statement of \"Bereishis,\" was equal to all the other statement - so we find in the Midrash.

For the commandment of this sacrifice is to eat it, \"with its legs and its inner organs\" (Exodus 12:9), since it is not fitting for this sacrifice to be divided up, but rather, \"its head with its legs and its inner organs.\" For something divided up is not one; as behold, it has portions. But something that is whole has oneness, since all of the content of this sacrifice is to show oneness. And likewise, \"It shall be eaten in one house\" (Exodus 12:46): This whole idea is that it is forbidden to divide a sacrifice between two group or that it is forbidden to eat it in two places - as it is a disagreement among Tannaim in Tractate Pesachim (86a).
