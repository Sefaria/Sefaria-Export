                    "The active wisdom of the holy. Wisdom of the holy is exalted above all wisdom, in that it overturns the will and spiritual-mental attribute of those that learn it to bring them closer to the very elevation by which it itself is intensified. This is not so regarding all other worldly wisdoms, for even though they draw from sublime, beautiful and noble ideas, they do not have this active attribute - to extend the very self-essence of their ponderer toward their values - and in truth each of them has no relationship whatsoever to other forces or the human self except for the force of its own discipline alone. And the reason for this is that all holy ideas come from the life-source of the living, from the life-foundation of all existence, and in them is the holy content to constitute multitudes of creations without end, to establish the heavens and form the earth, and all the more so to embed a new form and to imprint it on the soul of their ponderer. And no secular knowledges contain this power, because they are not self-renewing nor do they generate newness themselves, but they depict and display what is found in reality from the viewpoint of the intellect, and therefore they are not also able to make their ponderer into a new creation, to uproot him from his evil attributes and place him in the situation of a new reality, pure and alive in the light of true life, which stands forever."
