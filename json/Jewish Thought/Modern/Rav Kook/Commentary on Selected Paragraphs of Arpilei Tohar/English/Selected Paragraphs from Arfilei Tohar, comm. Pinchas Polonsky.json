In other words, we must develop the good essence that already exists within those negative thoughts and traits. It will then become evident that the evil is merely superficial, while holiness and goodness are present and merely being misused or sublimated. Therefore, these thoughts and qualities are not intrinsically \"bad\"; rather, they are simply misguided. The idea of channeling the soul's evil aspirations into a positive direction (instead of suppressing them) is a classical tenet of Judaism.",

                "<b>The insolence at the time preceding the Messiah comes about</b><br>The phrase \"insolence at the time preceding the Messiah\" refers to the words of the Talmud (<i>Sotah</i> 49b), which states: \"In the footsteps of the Messiah insolence will increase\". The Hebrew term <i>chutzpah</i> can be translated in various situations as \"impertinence\" or \"insolence\". However, in this case it has a more positive connotation; here, the term implies audacity, or the ability to persevere in the face of adversity and to achieve one's goal with absolute resolution.<br><br>The term <i>chutzpah</i> was used by Zionists to emphasize the free, bold, pioneering character of the first Zionist settlers in the State of Israel, as well as their psychological superiority over Jews of the Diaspora. Rav Kook, who identified the Zionism of his times as the beginning of the Era of the Messiah (the Talmud's description of the increase in <i>chutzpah</i> clearly correlated with the psychological self-determination of the first Zionists), uses the word to describe the audacious departure from religion on the part of the founders of Zionism. See also sections 68 and 107.",
                "Rav Kook speaks here as much of the contemporary cultural thought (which is manifested in science, ideology, philosophy, sociology, and so forth) as of the projection of this state of things onto religion. The world has now developed and matured to the point where people need a complete picture (such as the modern scientific paradigm or the model offered by physics, in which all parts of the whole are determined by general laws, and it is those laws that humankind strives to discover); the contemporary mind will not tolerate a model in which unrelated parts exist in themselves, disconnected from general principles or philosophies.<br><br>In principle, this contemporary state of affairs is a positive thing (\"the world has progressed\"), for it advances humankind. But it has negative side effects as well. Many individuals in contemporary secular society regard religion in such a way that they generally support its essential values and ideals, but reject those \"details\" that they see as disconnected from the central goals of the religion. For instance, some people recognize the important idea behind the Sabbath as a weekly day of rest - and even extol the ancient Jewish religion and proclaim the ideal of a weekly day of rest; at the same time, they reject the concrete laws against Sabbath work, as they do not see how these \"details\" are related to the principle of \"rest.\" Or, for example, while extolling the moral justice proclaimed by the ancient prophets of Israel, some individuals reject the prophets' exhortation to observe concrete commandments, as they see these as unrelated to the general principles and ideals of moral and social justice.<br><br>Secular Zionists at the time of Rav Kook saw many of the commandments of Judaism as discrete parts, disconnected from general ideals, and they therefore rejected them. ",
                "<i>Teshuvah</i> means repentance, return, the rectification of sins and flaws, the lifting of the world to God.",
                "In other words, the rejection of religion in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries reflected not a decline in the spiritual level of the Jewish people (as many in the religious establishment claimed), but, on the contrary, a higher demand for spiritual systems, for a clear understanding of the connections between the concrete aspects of religion and general spiritual principles. At the same time, in the world of Torah studies, no similar intellectual movement took place. Thus, the public consciousness asked for a more advanced and deeper understanding - and the world of the Torah had no adequate response. This is what led to the \"terrible destruction\" of the traditional framework of Jewish observance.",

                "<b>The essence of learning Torah for its own sake</b><br>We normally understand the phrase \"to study Torah for its own sake\" (and the Jewish tradition emphasizes the importance of precisely such study) as study without practical purpose, study for the sake of studying. Rav Kook casts the phrase in a new light, meaning \"to study Torah for the sake of Torah,\" that is, for its ability to renew and deepen the individual who studies it. This involves the study of the interconnections between all of the details and specifics of the commandments and the general ideological and philosophical principles. Such study, as demonstrated in the preceding paragraph, is necessary in order to help our generation reach a state of <i>teshuvah</i>.<br><br><b>An additional note on the connections between Paragraphs 1, 2, and 3</b><br><br>Just as the \"kosher\" alone is insufficient and must be raised to a higher level of idealism and sanctity, so, too, the \"usual\" study of Torah as no more than a collection of laws is inadequate (especially as this was the type of study that led to its rejection by an enlightened generation). Study of Torah must include the revelation of the meaning of its laws and their connection with general values. This is the message of paragraph 3."

                "<b>There are various causes of depression</b><br>When we look at the world around us, we see much that grieves us. In many situations, our grief must be overcome by \"the joy of performing a mitzvah\"; mitzvah - that is, not only by means of gladness and joy, but through the understanding that the grief itself is the point of departure for progress, for the realization of God's commandments by Israel. For this is the very thing Israel is called to do: to bring the divine light into the world through the realization of the commandments.",
                "That is, the soul ceases to see and distinguish the divine light; the person is mired in the material realm.",
                "The lifting of the soul to higher worlds is the realization of the commandment to return (<i>teshuvah</i>). In Rav Kook's teachings, as explained in <i>Orot haTeshuvah</i>, <i>teshuvah</i> is not only a matter of rectification of misdeeds, but also elevation of the world to a higher spiritual level. Since in the process of its creation the world has been moving away from God, it must return to God; thus, global <i>teshuvah</i> is the original commandment - to lift the entire world nearer to God. Return of the individual's soul from the \"exile\" of materialism is also a form of <i>teshuvah</i>.",
                "In other words, pure spirituality, by itself, unconnected to material realization, is not \"full-blooded\": it is pure - but pale and impotent. Although it is distressing when the soul descends into lower, material worlds, it gains fullness and completion there, it becomes emotionally and existentially richer, and, on its return to the sublime level, it is enriched. This is what comprises joy. Today's descent of the soul is the basis for its future ascent, which will bring it to a more sophisticated level. We should find joy in the awareness of the future ascent of our soul, and of the whole world with it.<br><br><b>Additional note on the connection between this paragraph and the preceding one</b><br><br>When the older approaches to Torah study (which failed to provide a sense of connection between the parts and the whole) cease to be effective, the soul, both individual and national, plunges into the darkness of materialism; in this lower region it is at least able to observe the link between specifics and general values. The individual and social bodies both wish for material pleasures, and they immerse themselves in these; the soul contemplates this and is distressed. This distress must be overcome not by rejecting materialism, but through an understanding that this descent is historically necessary (and although one need not contribute to it, one must recognize that the world is so ordered), and through the joy of realizing that in the future, with the help of a more full-blooded life, we will rise to a yet higher level. (It is important to note that we are speaking here not of a descent into sin by the breaking of commandments, but of the descent into materialism by grasping for worldly pleasures.) All of this applies, of course, both to the individual and the nation."

Moral laws also include, of course, repentance, forgiveness, mercy, grace, and so forth - that is, everything that comprises divine morality as we understand it.",
                "Thus, the universe itself is essentially moral, created by God in such a way that moral law governs it. (This is discussed in more detail in <i>Poetry of Being</i> by Yosef ben Shlomo, Chapter 6, \"The Moral Tendency of Being.\")",

                "That is, the providence founded on the attainment of the ideal takes into account not only the past and present (the cause) but also the future (goal). In order for the world's future to be what God wishes it to be, certain processes take place in the present. The first type of providence is causative; the second is teleological.",

We must overcome distress caused by current circumstances by regarding those circumstances not in isolation, but as a link in the chain of past, present, and future.

The holiness of the <i>tallit</i> is not obvious, whereas that of the <i>tzitzit</i> attached to it is open and visible. But it is only the existence of the <i>tallit</i> that makes possible the fulfillment of the commandment to wear the <i>tzitzit</i>. Yet the <i>tallit</i> is also a reservoir of immense hidden holiness, only some of which is revealed through the <i>tzitzit</i>.<br><br>Note that the word <i>tzitzit</i> is derived etymologically from a root meaning to \"show on the outside.\" Thus the concealed holiness of the <i>tallit</i> shows through the <i>tzitzit</i>.",
                "In other words, God's purpose for Creation is the realization of holiness in the material world; therefore, everything material - every person and entity - contains great potential holiness. We see a small obvious manifestation of this holiness (the <i>tzitzit</i> in relation to the <i>tallit</i>) when the material - including the body, society, the state, civilization - gives us the opportunity to carry out specific commandments. Ultimately, however, it is not these commandments in and of themselves, but of the gradual revelation of that hidden potential holiness contained in the body itself (society, state, civilization). Then, even matters of ordinary, transient life will \"make visible the light of eternal life.\" Therefore, the rectification (<i>tikkun</i>) of the material (including the body, state, and civilization) encompasses immense although not obvious, holiness."

                "In summary, various religious conceptions, addressing the question of the relationship between \"this world\" of transient life and \"that world\" of true and eternal life, generally follow one of two approaches. The first approach sees this world in a positive light, but merely as a preparation for the future world, with no inherent value of its own (this is the usual understanding of the words of the Mishna: \"This world is like the antechamber of <i>Olam haBa</i>\"). The other approach views this world as an obstacle that must be rejected in order to reach eternity. (This spiritualist approach is usually rejected by Judaism, but variations of it can be found in some European sources.) Rav Kook believes that contempt for the material world, which is an element of both approaches, though more sharply expressed in the second, is fundamentally incorrect, and that reality \"avenges itself.\" Strong souls, sensing the spiritual importance of the material (although such people would never use such words themselves), frequently reject religion, since, in moving to the purely spiritual and severing itself from its foundation in reality, religion loses its vitality and cannot answer the spiritual needs of such people. Accordingly, Rav Kook offers a third approach. He sees \"this world\" as an integral part of eternity, and thus eternity is filled with the light of transient life, which now takes on a full, spiritual and religious meaning. See also paragraphs 141 and 142 below."

It must be noted, however, that Rav Kook lacks the reverence for the common people, which was widespread in some ideological teachings of the time.

The <i>partsuf aeir anpin</i> unites six <i>sefirot</i>, from <i>Hessed</i> to <i>Yesod</i>, which correspond to the six days of creation - that is, to the normal and natural functioning of the world. This is why the dialogue with God at this level is manifested in \"natural\" divine rule: justice, mercy, and the love of God; while at the level of <i>arikh anpin</i>, the original universal design is realized, in accordance with which a person must be part of the divine unity.

Therefore, in the dialogue with God at the level of <i>zeir anpin</i>, good and evil are distinct: this is good, this is bad; for this you are rewarded, for this punished; this advances the world, this impedes its progress - and that is, indeed, how the world functions locally. <i>Arikh anpin</i>, however, is the all-encompassing unity of the world, in which evil simply does not remain, as there is no room for it (and for this reason, there is no question of justice).

Then people are faced with less bitterness and trouble to overcome: this is the sweetening of bitterness. For example, Rav Kook wrote during the First World War that for all of the war's horrors, it was opening the path to the building of a Jewish homeland. War is a very bad thing, but it can ultimately pave the way for something better - in this case, for a restructuring of the world that would lead to the return of the Jewish people, after 2,000 years of exile, to its homeland.

In accordance with this, the personal freedom of the individual is a reflection, a local manifestation of this universal supernal divine freedom. God is free in Himself, and therefore, when one acts more freely, one is closer to God than when one acts under duress. When one acts freely, one draws nearer to God and so feels better.
