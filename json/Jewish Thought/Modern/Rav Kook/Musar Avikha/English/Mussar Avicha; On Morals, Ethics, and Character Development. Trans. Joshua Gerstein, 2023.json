Additionally, see the introduction to <i>Chovot Halevavot</i>,<i></i> where Rabbainu Bachaya explains the reasons he composed his work as follows: “It became difficult for me to remember it all by heart, and I was afraid that I would forget what I have learned of them, and that the ideas … would unravel in my mind … I decided to write them down in a book … so that I might expect of myself always to know them and bring myself to perform them …”</i> Both in matters particular to themselves as individuals and even in general matters [appropriate for others], the person [by writing this work] will gain in understanding through their own innovations. An individual who is already on an intellectual level such that they can formulate their own intellectual analysis can only attain perfection by utilizing their intellect.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b> By utilizing their intellect:</b> In addition to serving as a personal \"Mussar Sefer\" to counter forgetfulness, there are two more reasons for the need to write on this topic, as mentioned in the work <i>Mesillat Yesharim</i> by Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzato (the Ramchal). First, to truly grasp the concepts of <i>Avodat Hashem</i> (divine service), one must dedicate time, energy, and intellectual effort, just as one would to study other parts of the Torah. Second, in Chapter Four, the Ramchal explains that acquiring watchfulness (zehirut) requires analyzing the mesSages of the Torah and applying them according to one's individual understanding. Since each person is unique, their reflections and what resonates with their souls will differ from one another.</i>"

                "1. [Contemplating and understanding] About the true definition of faith [<i>Emunah</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>The true definition of faith:</b> This does not refer to what to believe in but rather what the meaning and understanding of our belief is, that is, what we mean when we say, “I believe.” See also Maimonides in <i>The</i> <i>Guide for the Perplexed</i> I:50, where he writes that “When reading my present treatise, bear in mind that by ‘faith’ we do not understand merely that which is uttered with the lips, but also that which is apprehended by the soul …” This means that the definition of faith (<i>Emunah</i>) is much deeper than simply saying the words; rather, it is a feeling and action of the soul. The understanding of faith in the worldview of Rav Kook can be best summed up in a quote found in Middot HaRayah: “faith in God is the ground in which all values of life bloom …” (Middot HaRayah <i>Emunah</i> 5). [See also <i>Olat Re’iyah</i>, Volume<i></i> I, pg. 336–338, 414.] Additionally, see the essays that elaborate on the theme of faith included in the Appendix: “Lights of Faith,” published 1928 in the <i>Netivah</i> journal, and “Call of God,” published in 1934 in the <i>HaAretz</i> newspaper.</i> Its form as it resides in the soul, its necessity, and the magnitude of its truth [<i>emet</i>], there being no higher level of truth [<i>emet</i>], based on that which is established and verified by reason and the senses, as is well known.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Is established and verified by reason:</b> Rabbi Yosef Albo, in <i>Sefer Ikarim: Book of Principles</i> 1:19, explains faith as follows: “Belief in a thing means a firm conception of the thing in the mind so that the latter cannot in any way imagine its opposite, even though it may not be able to prove it … Belief also applies in relation to a thing that the believer himself did not observe with his senses but that someone else—a popular and reliable person, or a number of prominent persons—observed at a given time and that has come down to the believer from the man or men who observed it by a continuous tradition from father to son.”</i>",

About the truth of the Creator,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>About the truth of the Creator</b>: After explaining what faith is, Rav Kook moves on to expound what a person is supposed to believe.</i> which we possess from the Master of all deeds, may His name be blessed, and which was given to the faithful shepherd, our master Moshe, of blessed memory.",
                "3. About the magnitude of [the Torah’s] holiness. About its exalted status. About the splendor of its luminescence. About the magnitude of bliss with which it endows those who study and contemplate it sincerely and purely. About the sanctity of its commandments and their splendor and how it is the world’s radiance and perfection, as is compellingly true and recognized by means of clear and proven ideas.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b> Compellingly true and recognized:</b> [See <i>Olat Re’iyah,</i> Volume<i></i> II, pg. 55–56.]</i>",
                "4. About the truth of the Oral Law,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>About the truth of the Oral Law:</b> This means that this tradition was meticulously handed down over the ages by the leading Sages of the generation and is an integral part of the Jewish tradition without which leading a true Jewish life would be impossible.</i> which the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded our master, Moshe, of blessed memory, and which was transmitted to the Sages from one generation to the next. [This Oral Law] is contained in the Mishna and Talmud and the works of the Sages of blessed memory that are associated with them. About the magnitude of [the Oral Law’s] truth and sanctity and bright luminescence and the greatness of the attainments of those who walk in its paths. About the sanctity of the streams that flow from it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b> About the sanctity of the streams that flow from it:</b> This refers to the sanctity of the teachings of the Sages. In <i>Orot HaTorah</i> 1:1, Rav Kook explains that the Sages receive their sanctity inasmuch as their words are the continuation of the process that started with the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. Every enactment of the Sages takes the “supernal light” of the written Torah and allows its values and ethos to permeate the daily living and actions of the Jewish people.</i>",
                "5. About the truth of Kabbalistic knowledge.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>About the truth of Kabbalistic</b> knowledge:</b> Kabbala refers to Jewish mysticism, the esoteric and inner aspects of the Torah, its wisdom, and its knowledge. Rav Kook himself defines Kabbala as “the domain that deals with the knowledge of God, the domain of pure faith that stems from within the soul and emanates from the source of life” (<i>Orot</i>, pg. 101).</i> About the necessity for its existence. About the attainments of those who know it and are involved with it. About its universal benefit and that it is exalted beyond any sort of wisdom and is superior to any type of knowledge.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Superior to any type of knowledge:</b> Throughout Rav Kook’s writings, it becomes clear that he believed that without contemplating the esoteric aspects of the Torah, a person will not be able to actualize their full potential in their <i>Avodat Hashem</i>. See, for example, <i>Iggrot Re’iyyah</i> <i>h</i> letters 76, 87, 108, 414, 483, and 602. See also <i>Eder Hayakar</i>, pg. 13–15, and <i>Orot HaKodesh</i>, Vol. I, pg. 100 and pg. 361.</i> The necessity for the elite [Torah scholars] to engage in it with purity of heart and pure joy and modesty in order to know the Lord and cleave to Him, may He be exalted."

                "C.<br>[After elaborating upon the five topics that should be included in the course of study, Rav Kook now moves on to explain the necessity for this educational and spiritual endeavor.] As long as a person hasn’t educated themselves to understand clearly the value of the human soul, the value of a Jew,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>The value of the human soul and the value of a Jew:</b> [See <i>Pirkei Avot</i> 3:14; Zohar <i>Shelach</i> 159b.] The complete Mishna in <i>Pirkei Avot</i>, as taught by Rabbi Akiva, states: “He used to say: Beloved is man for he was created in the image [of God] … Beloved are Israel in that they were called children to the All-Present ….” Additionally, the Zohar explains that the value of man is based on verse 1:27 in Bereishit, which states that man was created <i>Betzelem Elokim</i> (in God’s image)—meaning that man’s essential nature inherited an aspect of God, as it were. See also where Rav Kook elaborates on this topic in <i>Shemonah Kevatzim</i>, Kovetz 7, section 169; <i>Pinkasi HaRaya</i>, Vol. 2, Pinkas 41; and <i>Orot HaKodesh</i>, Vol. 2, pg. 359.</i> the value of the holy land,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>The value of the holy land</b>: This refers to the importance, centrality, and holiness of the Land of Israel to Jewish living. While there is a plethora of sources on this topic, only a few will be brought here as examples to highlight this idea. Midrash Tehillim 87:2 states: “God loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwelling places of Jacob,” and the Sifrei states in Parshat Re’eh 12:29 that mitzvah of dwelling in the Land of Israel is equal to all the other commandments in the Torah. Additionally, the Talmud states in quite stark terms: “Every Jew who lives in the Land of Israel accepts the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven, and everyone who leaves the Land is akin to one who worships idols” (Tractate Ketubot 110b and Tractate Avodah Zara 17b). [See Zohar Emor 93a, “one nation in the land”; and Tosofot’s commentary on Zevahim 60-61, the sanctity of the land and the Temple, and Tractate Megilla 17b, their status is raised up in Jerusalem.]</i> the proper longing that every Jew should have for the building of the Temple, and the greatness of the Jewish people and their advancement in the world,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>The building of the Temple … and their advancement in the world:</b> This means the coming of Mashiach and the dawn of the messianic age.</i> it is nearly impossible for them to partake of the taste of divine service [<i>avoda</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>It is nearly impossible for them to partake of the taste of divine service [<i>avoda</i>]:</b> For how is it possible for a person to fully experience something when they do not understand it?</i>",
                "Our Sages of blessed memory stated<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">[<i>Sifrei</i>, Ekev.]</i> concerning the verse “And to serve [<i>Lavodo</i>] Him with all your heart”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Devarim 11:13.</i> that service of the heart refers to prayer. If so, prayer is of [a similar] nature [to] divine service, and [therefore] one is not fit for divine service unless one is in a mental state of divine reverence such that the elements of prayer are close to one’s heart.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b> That the elements of prayer are close to their heart:</b> As Rav Kook explains in the next paragraphs, if a person has no conceptualization of a given notion, it is impossible for them to pray regarding it.</i> If a person is oblivious to the value of their soul, how can they pray wholeheartedly and with a sense of need that the Lord, may He be blessed, grant them knowledge, wisdom, and understanding? Given the fact that they are oblivious, since they possess wealth, honor, and all that is good, what are they lacking if, God forbid, they do not become wise and gain understanding?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b> That they are oblivious … what are they lacking:</b> If a person does not understand the spiritual nature of their soul, how will they be able to pray properly for their spiritual needs?</i> Therefore, a person must learn and delve into the matter until the magnitude of their deficiency and the need for knowledge, wisdom, and understanding becomes totally clear to them, that they thirst for it and pray lovingly from the depths of their heart that the Lord, may He be blessed, grant them these [attributes]. And the benevolent Lord will not deprive those who walk in purity of that which is good.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b> Will not deprive those who walk in purity of that which is good</b>: This means that the effort a person puts into their prayers will be answered accordingly.</i>",
                "And if one is unaware of the value of a Jew, how can one pray wholeheartedly for their redemption? Surely the desired intent in praying the blessing of “the redeemer of Israel” is not merely about one’s own personal suffering that one feels as a result of the burden of the exile. For the blessing’s content indicates that its intent is a function of Jews’ value and sanctity.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b> Function of Jews’ value and sanctity:</b> The <i>beracha</i> in <i>Shemona Esray</i>, which Rav Kook explains here, reads, “Look, please, upon our affliction, and defend our cause, and redeem us speedily for the sake of <b>Your Name</b>”, meaning that the idea of <i>geulah</i> is not simply for the physical plight of the individual Jew; rather, it concerns redemption for the Jewish people to be able to fulfill their unique national mission in the world. The Ramchal explains in Part 2, Chapter 4 of <i>Derech Hashem</i> that the actions of the Jewish people have a direct impact on the level of Divine Providence felt in the world. [See also Megillah 17b; Rashi s.v. <i>Atchalta</i>: To free us from the travails that always afflict us, etc., for this is referred to as redemption; and Maharal, <i>Derech Chaim</i>, Chapter 6: For every salvation from the nations and from the hand of the rulers is all considered redemption.]</i>",
                "And if one is unaware of the value of the holy land and its special qualities and sanctity, how can one pray for the rebuilding of Jerusalem, since prayer must come from the depths of the heart,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">[Tractate Berachot 10b.]</i> out of a sense of deficiency in that area?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Out of a sense of deficiency in that area:</b> This reflects the understanding of the discussion on one of the underlying purposes of <i>Tefilah</i> as presented by the <i>Rishonim</i>. On the one hand, according to the Rambam, there is a daily obligation for <i>Tefilah</i> from the Torah (Hilchos Tefilah 1:1). On the other hand, the Ramban explains that <i>Tefilah</i> is not a Torah obligation but only a necessity when a person finds themselves in need and distress (Ramban’s commentary on <i>Sefer HaMitzvos</i>, “Mitzvas Eseh 5”). To bridge this gap, Rav Soloveitchik offers a novel explanation relevant to the topic at hand. He explains that even the Rambam believes that the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>Tefilah</i> only applies when a person is in need; however, the Rambam “regarded daily life itself as being “existentially in need,” inducing feelings of despair in the sensitive person. It is persistent \"tzara, which exists daily,” and “real prayer is derived from loneliness, helplessness, and a sense of dependence” (<i>Reflections of the Rav</i>, pg. 80–81). Therefore, only when a person truly believes that they are lacking in a certain area will their <i>Tefilah</i> be effective.</i>",
                "[Therefore] Prayer is an excellent test for a person to determine whether they are truly purifying their soul as the Creator, may He be blessed, desires and whether they have come close to aligning their will with that of the Creator.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b> Aligning their will with that of the Creator:</b> Through prayer, a person can see if they have realigned their priorities with those that are of the upmost spiritual importance, as it says in <i>Pirkei Avot</i>, as taught by Rabban Gamaliel, the son of Rabbi Yudah Hanasi. He used to say: Do His will as though it were your will, so that He will do your will as though it were His (<i>Pirkei Avot</i>, 2:4; see <i>Olat Re’iyah</i> <I>I</I>, “Matters of prayer, Guidance for prayer,” Part 3, Section 5).</i>",
                "Therefore, a person must be [extremely] careful not to be influenced by their desires in terms of the physical pleasures of eating and drinking and the like. For it will inculcate a materialistic nature in a person, causing them not to be self-aware of the lack of the true sacred things [and they will therefore not pray for the proper things]. [This will then cause the person’s] prayer to be forfeited. For it is a major principle in divine service that once a person is consoled by the fact that they have what they need to eat and be satisfied and other such vacuous things, when they pray the prayers of praise, <i>aleinu l’shabeach</i> (it is incumbent on us to praise) and <i>al kein nekaveh</i> (therefore we hope),<i></i> the person cannot imagine that the world will be repaired by means of the Almighty’s kingdom and the idols being wiped out and the wicked turning to Him, may He be blessed. For how do the idols harm one whose eyes and heart are fixed on filling his belly with delicacies?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Whose eyes and heart are fixed on filling his belly with delicacies:</b> As can be found in the <i>pasukim</i> throughout <i>neviem</i> and the classical mussar <i>sefarim</i>, when a person is too full of the pleasures of <i>Olam Hazeh</i>, they very quickly lose the ability to focus on the Torah, <i>Mitzvos</i>, and <i>Olam Habah</i>. For example, see <i>Chovas Halevavot</i>, Section Three; <i>Mesilat Yesharim</i>, Chapter 3; and <i>Orchot Tzadikim Shaar HaAhava.</i> </i> While images of lust are in a person’s heart, they will not comprehend or understand.",
                "Therefore, a person should strengthen themselves, be wise and devise a plan for [overcoming this challenge]. And we will beseech and pour out our souls before the merciful and benevolent God who desires our perfection, which is His honor and splendor.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Which is His honor and splendor:</b> When the Jewish people follow the proper path, it brings honor to Hashem.</i> He will guide us in His ways and illuminate them for us by means of His great light so that we may know and understand what He, may He be blessed, demands from us and what is the right and good way to walk in His paths."

                    "Indeed, the topic of divine service [<i>avoda</i>] in general, as well as reverence [<i>yirah</i>], love [<i>ahavah</i>], and cleaving [<i>devekus</i>], are universally known. However, this knowledge is merely knowledge of the terms, not the meaning contained in those terms.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b> Not the meaning contained in those terms:</b> This means a superficial knowledge rather than an intimate knowledge and understanding of these terms.</i> Due to the sanctity of the depths of the discipline of reverence, for which all other disciplines are but preambles and prefaces,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Are but preambles and prefaces:</b> As the verse in Iyov states: “And He said to man, 'Behold (<i>Hen</i>), the fear of the Lord is wisdom and shunning evil is understanding’” (28:28). The Gemara writes in Shabbos 31b that in Greek, “<i>Hen</i>” means “one.” According to the Gemara, this is meant to teach us that only <i>yirat Hashem</i> is the true wisdom. See also <i>Derashot Haran</i>, Drush 5, where he explains that <i>yirat Hashem</i> is the foundation of the entire Torah.</i> it cannot be known to man by means of external speech alone, only through contemplation through internal dialogue.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b> Only through contemplation through internal dialogue:</b> The Ramchal further writes in his introduction to <i>Mesilat Yesharim</i> that only through thorough analysis of the topics of <i>Avodat Hashem</i> will a person be able to truly acquire them.</i> This is the very reason for their obscurity: It is because most people, even Sages, are accustomed to disciplines in which their internal and external dialogues are equivalent. When one speaks about most disciplines, it is possible by means of that discussion to discern their depth and the need to study them in order to master them. It would not be possible for any intelligent person to imagine that he knows them unless he actually does. This is not the case when it comes to all aspects of the duties of the heart, where the statements taken superficially do not reflect the depth of the wisdom contained in them. There is no language adequate for [describing in full detail] all the fine points of understanding that they require, and one who does not clarify the matter properly will think that he knows the content [of <i>Avodas Hashem</i>] simply because he knows the terminology [that defines them].",
                    "It is therefore necessary to study so that he will be acquainted with them internally, and thereby his knowledge of the prerequisites for such awareness will expand to the point where he can also share his knowledge with others.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b> Share his knowledge with others:</b> Only when a person completely and truly understands a topic can they share it with others in a coherent way.</i>",
                    "The underlying reason why these terms themselves are known to all is a function of nature.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b> Function of nature:</b> This means the natural spiritual state of a person’s Neshama (soul).</i> For all aspects of the duties of the heart and its purification in refining the soul and all virtues are inherent to man, as they are the tools for all aspects of [spiritual] life. For example, the elements of reverence [<i>yirah</i>], love [<i>ahavah</i>], and cleaving [<i>devekus</i>] and the like are found in man’s soul and need not be invented per se.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Not be invented per se:</b> As Rav Kook writes elsewhere, “The soul’s demands point us to where a treasure of life is waiting. Thus, the happiness of a person is dependent on the ability to pay attention to these demands. This principle is true even when the soul is giving off vague noises, when it is impossible to recognize letters, words, rules, or explicit mesSages …” (Shemonah Kevatzim 8:56, translation courtesy of Rabbi Ari Zev Schwartz, <i>The Spiritual Revolution of Rav Kook</i>, pg. 17–18).</i> They merely have to be elevated so that they are channeled to the right path, meaning that they are all directed toward the Lord, may He be blessed, who is the ultimate hope. Wisdom in this area [of understanding the necessary aspects of <i>Avodas Hashem</i>] means understanding how all aspects of virtue are directed toward the Lord, may He be blessed, and His honor. This being the case, the terms [defining the topics of <i>Avodas Hashem</i>] per se are not the wisdom needed for divine service, but neither are they extraneous to it.",
                    "It is for good reason that the Creator, may He be blessed, instilled these capabilities in us.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b> Instilled these capabilities in us:</b> As Rav Kook will explain in upcoming paragraphs, the constant journey of <i>Avodat Hashem</i> can only be attained if its attributes are natural and innate to the personality of each individual. It is because of this that people feel that they clearly recognize the concepts of reverence (<i>yirah</i>), love (<i>ahavah</i>), and cleaving (<i>devekut</i>), even when they are not able to clearly articulate what they mean.</i> True guidance to serve the Lord continuously should never depart from a person, even for a moment, but anything that a person attains is easily lost and is difficult to safeguard every moment unless it is innate. Therefore, the Lord, may He be blessed, compassionately fixed all these elements in our nature. When the intellect elevates them, then if a person follows the laws of the Torah of the Lord, may He be blessed, exclusively, these elements will truly remain permanently fixed in their heart, just as they were fixed naturally in them before being subjected to analysis.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Before being subjected to analysis:</b> After gaining the basic level of understanding, a person with the requisite intellect is required to study these topics in a deeper way.

                    "This teaches us the extent of the obligation to diligently pursue knowledge of the Lord concerning His comprehensive providence and incredible benevolence. For our only objective is that these virtues, which are fixed in our nature, should themselves be fixed permanently in this manner once it becomes clear to us that they are primarily intended to be used for the service of the Lord. This is the virtue of cleaving [<i>deveku</i>s], namely, that the virtues be permanently attached to the soul. Once they are elevated by means of knowledge, bringing one closer to the Lord, he will always be with Him. That being the case, it is impossible to fix these virtues in a state that is not their original natural state using means that would be inadequate for their original natural state.",
                    "What this means is the following: We see that man’s natural virtues can only be fixed in him based on knowledge, and his virtues are established based on his knowledge, whether true or false.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Established based on his knowledge:</b> This means that a person’s character traits are based on their worldview of right and wrong.</i> [For example] A minor who is completely undiscerning possesses no virtues whatsoever. When he grows up and recognizes that food is good, he will like it and will be angry at someone who takes away what he needs. As his knowledge develops, his virtues will develop accordingly. Therefore, when we want to establish all of [the virtues] within the framework of reverence [<i>yirah</i>], for the Lord and love for Him, it is necessary for knowledge of His proper ways and awareness of Him to be expanded, thereby conditioning the virtues. For [with] each deficiency in knowledge, the virtues will be lacking manyfold, as it is their root and foundation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Their root and foundation:</b> Just as in the physical world, where virtues only develop through acquiring the commensurate knowledge of them, so too in the spiritual world. Therefore, a person cannot begin to grow their spiritual virtues in the right direction without a clear and deep knowledge of the concepts themselves.</i>",
                    "That which we said [above], that when the virtues are all established in connection with divine service they are not in accordance with their original nature, is purely as a result of the body.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>As a result of the body:</b> The fact that emotions, desires, and virtues are initially centered around physicality is due to psychological development. A child has an extremely self-centered view of the world, which gradually declines as they grow.</i> The virtues, per se, are certainly spiritual functions. However, their actions are linked to the bodily organs that carry them out and thereby transform them. The virtues acquire a sort of initial nature in terms of physical and deluded matters that are not in accordance with intellectual truth through the bodily capacities that precede them chronologically.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Which precede them chronologically:</b> This happens through the emotional and physical development of a person.</i> However, in terms of the soul, its primary nature is certainly for the purpose of virtue. When a person transforms their nature from an adolescent one, it is not a fundamental change but rather a reversion to their original nature.

This movement [of gratitude] is one of the most important movements of the soul, being rooted in a principle corresponding to the perfection of existence dictated by the truth of the ultimate wisdom. The greater the good [that an individual receives] and the longer its duration, and the greater the gap between the recipient and the patron due to the exalted nature of the benefactor, the greater the sense of gratitude will be [on the part of the recipient of the gift].",
                    "[Therefore], the general perfection of existence [of that which is in the world], as dictated by the truth of [God’s] ultimate wisdom, demands perfect service [on the part of humanity] to the true Benefactor, blessed is He, by virtue of the rule of gratitude, to do that which is good and proper in the eyes of the Lord, and in accordance with His governance concerning the actions of His creatures. That which is good, following in His ways [studying the Torah and the performance of mitzvot], will please a person, and they will consider evil those [ideas and actions] that conflict with God’s sacred will, based on the system of the sanctity of the worlds and the antithesis of sanctity that they comprise,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b> Which they comprise:</b> In truth, all that is created in existence—both good and evil, positive and negative—emanate from the Divine will.

For He, so to speak, chose to desire it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Chose to desire it:</b> God desires, as it were, that a person be given the free will to choose to follow the path of good and depart from the path of evil.</i> The greatness of the rehabilitation [<i>tikkun</i>] and the service [of God and the fulfillment of the mitzvot] resulting from following in the path of goodness in order to express gratitude for the Benefactor, blessed is He, is commensurate with the perfection of the One who set up everything and the greatness of His will.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Greatness of His will:</b> Just as God is infinitely beyond the comprehension of the human mind, so too is the nature of comprehending the gratitude that we must have for God and His goodness toward us.</i>",
                    "[Therefore,] we are certainly incapable of imagining even partially the enormity of the powerful actions [needed to be taken] that ought to result from gratitude for His beneficence, may He be blessed. We must train ourselves in this light gradually, so that our soul not be weakened by its brilliance—and there is no limit to the weakness that will afflict the soul if the individual denies that which this true principle demands in terms of the Lord’s true actions.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Lord’s true actions:</b> The innermost parts of our soul recognize the depth of gratitude that is owed to God.

                    "Therefore, it is a fundamental principle that an individual should train themselves in the way of divine service out of love emanating from gratitude for God’s beneficence toward them.

[See Maimonides, <i>The Guide for the Perplexed</i>, Section I:8; Rabbi Moshe Cordovero [Rama”k], <i>Shiur Komah</i>, Chapter 20.]</i> It is true that divine service, and particularly service of the heart [<i>avoda shebilev</i>] (prayer), in terms of recognition of God’s greatness and His exalted glory, that He is the true good, cannot reach its perfection by defining a [fixed] level. On the contrary, the more a person increases his knowledge, the more he will discern further levels [of understanding of Divine service]. However, prayer is called “transient life,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Transient life:</b> As per the Talmud in Tractate (Shabbat 10a).

Similarly, gratitude is “fixed” as well as “transient,” based on the person’s current spiritual understanding of the gratitude he owes to God.</i> and its purpose is also to fulfill the obligation of divine service out of gratitude. For this reason, one should not receive any tangible benefit before praying, as [our Sages] of blessed memory<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Berachot 10b.</i> derived from “You shall not eat anything with its blood”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Vayikra 19:26.</i> and “You have cast Me behind your back.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Berachot 10a; Melachim I, 14:9.</i> Therefore, its level is specific to each individual according to the degree of benefit that they have received from the benevolent God.

Rather, even in the case of divine service out of love emanating from gratitude, they are also considered pious people. This is especially true because the individual will ultimately attain the great love, which is not contingent on receiving benefit, as there is no greater benefit than His great name, and what good can be compared to it?",
                    "This is what is meant by “Where is the humble one?” because the person didn’t have the arrogance to say that this level was beneath them.

This is a simpler and more accessible venue for him. From there, one should ascend to the lofty level of the virtue of great love based on a recognition of God’s exaltedness, may He be blessed. The individual will thereby be lowly in their own eyes, having to constantly consider how all that they have, and their very existence, is merely the result of the profusion of benevolence from the benevolent God, blessed is He.",

For it is possible for the Lord, may He be blessed, to perform incredible benevolences and equip the soul to receive them in ways that are incomprehensible. Therefore, it behooves us to always choose to act in accordance with the true perfection that God knows to be the select perfection. But if we act based on what we imagine or perceive, we will certainly fall short. When we were in our mother’s womb, or even when we were nursing or as older individuals, we were unable to perceive the value of the many benevolences that the gracious and merciful One intended for us now as a bequest from the Lord, such as children and all of our possessions, and especially the pleasantness of wisdom, the satisfaction of doing good and kindness, and the capacity for these things. Similarly, we cannot imagine the enormity of the good that He will bestow on us if we follow in His ways, for our welfare, as promised to us by nearly all the prophets and our Sages, of blessed memory, common sense clearly bringing us to the same conclusion.",

They warn them, saving them by allowing them to flee to a safe and tranquil place. Consequently, a certain person hears about this great act of kindness that has been performed and sends the individual a thousand silver shekels as a gift.

And we know clearly that His will is vastly more precious and immeasurably and incomparably more glorious than all the preciousness, honor and perfection in all of existence. Therefore, does it make sense to be concerned or to think about the gain or perfection that the person themselves receives and by means of which their personal will is fulfilled, when they know that as a result of attaining perfection for themselves (and for all creatures, as is known from the Lord’s secret, possessed by those who fear Him), they are thereby doing the will of the Creator? For that is more significant and precious than all the creatures themselves, together with all of their dignity and precious glory. For everything is His, and all that they possess is from His hand, may He be blessed.

                    "Now, just as wisdom must reach its state of perfection, so too the will must reach its state of perfection. For we observe that if a person possesses wisdom, but their will is not perfected, they are not perfect at all. On the contrary, their wisdom will only be detrimental to themselves. For example, a person who recognizes the value of proper conduct and paths of justice but who has a corrupt will and desires only evil, corruption, exploitation, and violence will never be happy. For whenever the individual focuses on their wisdom, they will be resentful because of their will, which draws them to all that is antithetical to wisdom. And when they pay attention to their corrupt will, the individual’s wisdom will reproach them and point out that this path is evil and bitter.

And just as the meaning and essence of wisdom is perception and knowledge, and the aspect of it that is perfection is specifically knowledge of God’s governance and His benevolent ways, as this is the limit of perfection of the object of that perfection, the same is certainly true of the will. It means that the individual’s will is so perfect that it resembles the perfection of the ultimate will, so to speak, which is the source of all existence and their governance. If so, this is only possible if the will is inclined exclusively to carrying out the will of their Father in Heaven.",

Therefore, any importance that there is in all of existence is a mere accident, fancifully ascribed to the individual but really belonging to God, may He be exalted.

For Rav Kook, this discussion is a natural outgrowth of the paragraphs on humility as a factor in recognizing a person’s true place in the world and their connection with the Divine.</i> We [recite a blessing before learning the Torah or fulfilling a commandment to] recognize the benevolence of God toward us by means of [receiving spiritual] pleasures [and contentment], particularly the sanctity of the commandments and the Torah and the fulfillment of each request; nonetheless, the main aspiration, inner desire, and motivation in all of these activities are that it is His will, may He be blessed, and no other intention is comparable. Therefore, we always conclude or open with “Blessed are you, Lord,” meaning that the blessing is His, may He be blessed, and is worth desiring. But within the [recitation] of the blessing itself, the possibility exists that we perhaps merely say this out of consideration for proper ethics and because it is dictated by gratitude for the [added spiritual] benefit we received in terms of ourselves. Therefore, it [that is, amen] comes to indicate that this [doing God’s will] is the ultimate and exclusive truth and ultimate reality based on wisdom and justice. This, [the answering of amen, and the understanding of the sole importance of doing God’s will] is certainly more powerful than directing the will by means of ethics alone,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Ethics alone</b>: This means the blessing itself.</i> indicating that it is necessarily so based on wisdom and perfection, both in terms of Him, so to speak, and in terms of us, and is everlasting and powerful.

                    "It is possible to say that this is also the meaning of the opening of the gates of the Garden of Eden to which the Sages refer<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">98</sup><i class=\"footnote\">[Shabbat 119a.]</i> when they say that “The gates of the Garden of Eden are opened for anyone who answers Amen with all of his might, as it says: ‘Open the gates and let a righteous nation that is faithful [<i>shomer emunim</i>] enter’.” For if a person doesn’t comprehend the meaning of His service, may He be blessed, and the exalted nature of His glory, that the ultimate spiritual bliss is nothing other than His glory, may He be blessed, which results from this, even if he receives a reward, and even if he grasps that the reward is perception and perfection, since he does not grasp the sanctity of divine service in all of its purity, he has acted for his own welfare and not for the sake of the act itself. Therefore, he will only receive his reward when he enters his Eden and is able to perceive it, for his abundance cannot surpass his finite and limited self.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">99</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Finite and limited self:</b> If divine service is based on limited concepts of reward and punishment and a person fulfils the commandments only to receive a spiritual reward, then only after death, when the person leaves this finite realm and with the help of God “enters Eden,” will they be able to truly grasp their reward. However, as Rav Kook writes in the next lines, a person who fulfils the commandments due to understanding the truth and desiring exclusively to satisfy the Divine will be able to receive their divine reward based not simply on their own merit but with additional heavenly rewards inasmuch as they have fully attached themselves to the Divine.</i> Not so for the one who knows the meaning of divine service and connects to it with purity of heart and desire of the soul with intellect and knowledge, with the divine commitment of the principles of wisdom and righteousness. Since his intention is not for himself, his reward is not commensurate with his essential [spiritual] worth but rather with the level of his attachment to the Holy One, blessed be He. His participation in Eden will increase commensurate with the Creator’s glory, without requiring his entry into it, merely knowledge of the perfection found in the place of His glory, may He be blessed. He will already be in his Eden by virtue of the opening of the gates, allowing him to see and perceive it. In addition, a person who also has intent for himself is considered to be opening his gates himself. But the worth of one whose will is attached to that of his Creator is infinite, and his gates will be opened from a place beyond the reach of any act, as opposed to when he is the one who opens them.",
                    "One may also suggest that, since every individual has their own Eden, as the Sages state,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">100</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 100a.</i> it is not fitting to refer to these individual Edens as gates, only as entrances and doors. By contrast, based on what we explained, one who says Amen is connected to the totality of existence and has no individual aspect. He is superior to one whose intention is for himself, as the intellectual life that grasps general principles and encompasses all of existence is superior to the emotional life, which is restricted to himself to the exclusion of others. His entrance into Eden is, therefore, not through a private entrance but rather through the gates of the universal Eden, and Eden opens for him on a universal level.",
                    "We will now add another explanation, with the help of the Lord, may He be blessed, concerning the telos [inherent purpose] of divine service: Its exalted level demands logically that it can only be for the glory of the will of the Master, may He be blessed. If a person has any other purpose, it is a shortcoming in the perfection of their intellect and righteousness, which should only accept everything as it truly is.",
                    "The intellect would only place a secondary inherent purpose, even if it also has some value and perfection in its own right, alongside a primary and greater one—as in the example we gave of the thousand pieces of silver relative to saving the country—as a result of our deficient intellect and emotions. This is a function of our being limited and finite creatures, being limited to the degree to which we are able to absorb knowledge and values and propensities. When the soul is saturated with something, thereby becoming disposed toward it, it will consequently be deficient in its tendency toward something else.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Toward something else:</b> It is true that while looking objectively at divine service, the only impetus should be the fulfillment of the Divine will. However, as mentioned above, there is still the lower form of perfection of following the commandments for personal spiritual benefit. Rav Kook explains that as imperfect creatures, although we theoretically recognize these two forms of divine service, a person is normally satisfied with serving God for their own spiritual benefit and therefore will not have the mindset to be able to search for and then acquire the higher form of motivation for divine service.</i> It is therefore utterly impossible for a person to favor perfection in terms of the benefit that he receives, since the ways of perfection in the paths of wisdom teach us that it is a grave deficiency to value any benefit that anyone receives in comparison to the enormity of the benefit and significance of fulfilling the will of the Master, may His name be blessed. The systems of our hearts and all of the wisdom of our souls are certainly inadequate to contain even the very tip of the proper tendency toward service in His name, may He be exalted, given its greatness and glory and His sacred will. Therefore, how can we inculcate another tendency in our soul, causing a corresponding deficiency in the true life and perfection in ourselves, which are distanced from Him due to our faculties of intellect and will being preoccupied?",
                    "But in truth, no type of perfection loses its worth completely, even when pitted against a loftier perfection. Therefore, in terms of the Creator, may His name be blessed, who is exalted beyond any inclination, God forbid, certainly despite all of the greatness of the telos of the grand creation and existence, which He created for His glory, the [spiritual] intention [for the fulfillment of the commandments] nonetheless relates to each and every sort of perfection and benefit. This is because benefit in terms of its recipients is also benefit on their [current] level of perfection and good.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">102</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Perfection and good:</b> Ideally, a person should only be educated in the performance of the commandments to serve the Divine will, the greatest possible perfection. Any other sort of motivational education will inherently detract from this ultimate purpose, as mentioned above. However, this is only true in our limited human capacity of understanding and action where, if we focus on a smaller form of perfection, we are unable to reach a greater form of perfection. Nonetheless, from the Divine perspective, the smaller perfection of personal spiritual benefit is also included in the ultimate plane of Divine perfection.</i> This [understanding] is especially true at a time such as this, when people’s [spiritual and religious] views are imperfect and they have not yet attained true recognition of the primary perfection, and they take [the spiritual] benefit that they receive to be their reward [and the impetus for divine service]. [Therefore] The intention to benefit them is certainly a perfect telos under these circumstances, except with respect to people of comprehension, where there is a greater perfection that overrides it.",
                    "[And that which is written:] The beneficiary’s [humanity’s] obligation of humility and subservience to his benefactor [God] is proportional to the benefactor’s intent to bestow benefit on him, as explained at length in <i>Chovot Halevavot</i> in the section “Divine service,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Divine service:</b> In this section, Rav Kook addresses a misunderstanding that could arise from an incomplete understanding of the <i>Chovot Halevavot’</i>s intentions in his chapter on divine service. There, it is written: “Service may be defined as a beneficiary's submission to his benefactor, expressed in rendering good that is within his power to the latter in return for the favor received. Therefore, whoever considers God's bounties, bestowed upon him, which are in common with all other human beings, will faithfully accept the obligation of the service of God in the ways indicated by his intellect” (in the section on divine service, Chapter 3). This would seem to indicate that a person’s intention in fulfilling the Divine will should be motivated by a sense of gratitude and not by a simple desire to fulfill the Divine will. However, as Rav Kook will explain, <i>Chovot Halevavot</i>’s intentions are for a person to contemplate the <b>mental recognition</b> of being a beneficiary and how that reflects on the Divine perfection, rather than the <b>physical benefit</b> itself.</i> and is [only] a function of the benefactor’s perfection [namely, that He is so wholly perfect that He also desires to benefit others]. The benefactor’s perfection is proportional to his intention to benefit others. This is the root of subservience to the truly perfect One. The benefit is actually only a matter of experiencing [recognizing] this perfection in some sense. Although due to our deficient knowledge we don’t experience this subservience to our benefactor, it is actually its sole root and essence. Therefore, we have learned that we certainly owe the Creator, may His name be blessed, every aspect of subservience, based on His intention to benefit us alone. This is the absolute truth. In addition, He arranged His will such that it be fulfilled by our actions because this is the most perfect good, which has no equal. Nonetheless, our divine service should be in our hearts and intellect primarily for the sole purpose of increasing and exalting His glorious name. For to the degree that we include any other purpose, we will lose a portion of this true perfection, which is mandated by perfection and logic.",
                    "Therefore, in this world, where only our personal benefit is perceived, the primary intention for the existence of the creation, as it is currently, is our perfection and welfare. For it is inappropriate to say regarding the Creator, may He be blessed, that there are matters that are only a means to an end if their existence is not intrinsically good. For nothing prevents Him from accomplishing His goals without intermediary means. This was somewhat noted by the Rambam, of blessed memory, in <i>The Guide for the Perplexed</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">104</sup><i class=\"footnote\">[See I:69; II:12.]</i> Rather, all the (positive) actions are necessary and good in their own right.

                    "We need to express the concept of intention, in the context of each level in the world and its creatures, in accordance with its level, this being its truth, and the manner of divine service will flow from this. In this world, in which this great perfection has not yet been revealed to people, namely, that the essence of everything is His will, may He be blessed, the governance, providence, and telos are currently only for beneficence and our welfare.",

                    "There are several causes of interfacing between traits and blurring of boundaries between them. Sometimes two traits are adjacent because they are similar on a superficial level, and it is impossible to acquire only one of them without having a powerful image of it [the character trait in question].

                    "Among [the fundamentals of] the soul’s traits requiring perfection is the trait of fortitude [<i>gevurah</i>], meaning fortitude of the soul, without which it is utterly impossible to be truly perfect in terms of knowledge and fear of the Lord. It is certainly impossible to accomplish anything significant without it. The trait of fortitude includes the following: Once a person decides that he needs to work on something out of an obligation to perfect himself, he will be firmly committed to it and will not become fed up with the numerous minutiae. His soul’s fortitude will guide him to act with pure desire, doing whatever is necessary to achieve good results, even if they are a long way off.",
                    "Without the trait of fortitude, when he is first infused with fear of the Lord and the obligation to be diligent in observing the commandments, he is enthused to learn the Torah diligently to know his Creator’s glory and the manner in which one can do what He deems good, but by the time he goes on to engage in the depths of analysis and sacred expanses of its breadth and details, his enthusiasm emanating from the original perception will already have petered out. Therefore, he needs the trait of fortitude in order to exercise self-control so that he continues to firmly hold on to what he engaged in for the benefit of his soul. Consequently, the soul’s constant joy, filled with the tranquility of being fixed within the power of ascension, will increase. Thus, the joy of the soul will remain unchanging in the face of the depths and their perplexing streams.",
                    "In his introduction to <i>Mesilat Yesharim</i>, the saint explained that people refrain from studying (or barely study) topics relating to divine service, such as love, reverence, and improvement of one’s traits, because the basic obligation concerning these topics is well known. For this reason, people see no need to delve into their fundamentals and details.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Introduction to <i>Mesilat Yesharim.</i> </i> However, there is another, more fundamental reason for this, which is a lack of the trait of fortitude. For when a person begins to investigate these lofty matters, he is terrified and enfeebled as a result of seeing himself as being distant from the fulfillment of the great obligations that they impose. Therefore, great fortitude is required. He must not be discouraged by the knowledge that the essence of perfection is contingent on perfect, true knowledge of the Torah. Rather, he must investigate all the ways of divine service and piety without being overly intimidated by his distance from them. Instead, he should calmly and bravely resolve to try and attain their perfection. As soon as he fully grasps the true understanding of a certain detail, he should put it into practice.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Put it into practice:</b> One obstacle to self-improvement is the mistaken belief that if one cannot give 100 percent, there is no point in trying at all. Rav Kook emphasizes the importance of recognizing that even small efforts make a difference and not becoming discouraged by current imperfections. Every small step toward improvement contributes to eventual perfection.</i>",
                    "However, it is not easy for a person to acquire the trait of fortitude. Indeed, it can only be acquired by means of the Torah and diligence, as it is written, “I am understanding; courage is mine.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishlei 8:14; <i>Pirkei Avot</i>, Chapter. 6.</i> But for someone lacking fortitude, there is no guarantee of success merely because he immerses himself in these matters. Due to his weakness, he will not be able to carry them out properly. Therefore, one should strive to acquire the trait of fortitude and its purification to serve as a foundation upon which he can build an edifice of studying the ethical and divine topics. Correspondingly, fortitude of the soul is a very valuable trait that is necessary for attaining every sort of perfection, whether specific or general.",
                    "But very few people attain it in its pure form, as it interfaces with several negative traits: anger, arrogance, jealousy, hatred, competitiveness, vengeance, and the like. Sometimes this trait [of fortitude] will be found among those who have not paid attention and [acquired for themselves] fear of the Lord, [and therefore their fortitude comes] with its wicked neighbors [anger, arrogance, and others]. [Likewise,] some people undertake to bear the yoke of reverence but do not make the [proper] effort to investigate the correction of their traits in detail and do not distinguish between it [ the trait in question] and its surrounding neighbors, and therefore they abandon the process entirely. But if done properly, separating and selecting the waste from the worthwhile, all of the positive traits wicked neighbors will obey it and do that which is good and proper in the eyes of the Lord, may He be blessed.",
                    "[Similar to fortitude,] there are many other traits that need to be severed in this way. As long as they are attached to each other, they will not produce successful results.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Successful results:</b> This is because the negative aspects will outweigh and pervert the positive ones.</i> There are, in fact, spiritual forces that interface with negative forces on many sides in most of their applications. There are also those that only interface with a few negative ones. This distinction can help guide the ways by which the positive trait is extricated from [the influence of] its wicked neighbors.",
                    "Humility [<i>anavah</i>] is a positive trait when a person knows its meaning, understands the concept well, and knows how to apply it and incorporate it into his soul. But when viewed superficially, the trait of humility carries with it the trait of sadness [<i>itzavon</i>], because they resemble each other on a superficial level. For [example] joy and arrogance [<i>ga’ava</i>] both disperse one’s spiritual forces, except that joy disperses them in a positive fashion, whereas arrogance disperses them in a negative way.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>In a negative way:</b> Both pride and happiness can make a person feel joyful and spiritually expansive, but the crucial distinction lies in their effects. Humility leads to positive expansiveness, while pride leads to negative expansiveness.</i>",
                    "Similarly, the trait of humility consolidates and settles them, as does sadness, one in a good way and the other in a bad way.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>In a bad way:</b> Similarly, both humility and sadness can lead to a concentration and in-gathering of the soul's capacities. Humility results in a positive gathering because the person recognizes that their qualities come from a higher source, leaving no room for arrogance. Conversely, sadness leads to negative in-gathering of the soul's capacities due to the person's lack of self-belief.</i> So too, the positive trait of humility interfaces with the negative trait of sadness. If a person does not study the fine points of actualizing his traits, then when the topic of humility comes up and he wants to contemplate it by means of recognizing his shortcomings, the two traits will merge, and sadness will blur and obscure all the pleasantness and radiance of humility.",
                    "Indeed, although on a superficial level they seem to share the same path, at the depths of their roots they are very different.",
                    "For sadness only arises after a person has decided that his personal level is exalted and that he is deserving of greatness but is then disappointed to discover deficiencies and shortcomings in himself that are unbecoming to him. This is certainly heartbreaking and contains no element of truth.",
                    "However, the trait of humility results from his knowing that he is not innately worthy of any sort of greatness and that any greatness and goodness that he attains are due to the benevolence of the Lord, blessed be He, toward him. He will then be lowly and deficient in his own eyes, yet experience no sadness. Rather, he will rejoice in his fate, and he will thank the Lord for His benevolence concerning the small amount of good that he discovers in himself. He will also eagerly pursue the attainment of many other delightful virtues. For since he sees that despite being inherently unworthy, the Lord, blessed be He, graced him with goodness, this will also suffice for him to acquire even greater and more amazing attainments.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Amazing attainments:</b> When a person acknowledges that any good qualities they possess are gifts from God and not solely a result of their own merit, they become filled with optimism, believing that these qualities will continue to grow and multiply if they make the effort to cultivate them.</i>"

It seems clear that the inclusion of bawdry [<i>nivul peh</i>] in the prohibitions of sexual immorality [<i>giluy ‘arayot</i>] is “an item that belonged to a category and was singled out for the purpose of teaching about the entire category.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Entire category:</b> One of the Thirteen Principles of Torah Exegesis.</i> It is similarly prohibited to engage in speech that is inclined to arouse him to anything that is prohibited.

Similarly, in Rashi Shabbat 103a, s.v. <i>Ervat</i>. <i>Sefer Chareidim</i>, Chapter 4, negative commandment 49: Bawdry is an extension of the commandment. It would appear from what it says in Shabbat 33, “due to the sin of bawdry,” that it is part of the primary biblical prohibition, like all those that precede it, in line with the statement of the <i>Sha’agat Aryeh</i>, 24, concerning the blessing on learning Torah, that the severity of the punishment for refraining from reciting the blessing indicates that reciting it is a biblical mandate.]</i> the prohibition is essentially due to the obscenity of the speech itself and not because it leads to the actual prohibition. The same is true in the case of every sort of speech that normally stirs the heart to something evil, such as arrogance or flattery and the like. Even if a person were to say that he is not concerned about it due to his nature, nonetheless it remains prohibited. It is only in the case of an extremely pious person, on the level of earlier generations, that one could say that it is permitted if he sees that the present circumstances require it. As stated in the first chapter, “his own statements contradict each other.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Contradict each other:</b> [Shabbat 13a.] The Gemara in the Tractate Shabbat tells a story about Rabbi Pedat, who used to greet his sisters with a kiss as a sign of respect. However, his own opinion contradicted this behavior, as he believed that physical closeness to his sister was prohibited. The commentators of the Gemara explained that Rabbi Pedat permitted himself to act this way because he was a truly righteous person and did not fear any sinful thoughts resulting from his actions. The sage Rav commented that Rabbi Pedat's leniency was applicable only to exceptionally righteous individuals of the previous generations, and even for them, it was permitted only temporarily and for a specific purpose.</i>",
                    "The matter still requires investigation as to whether or not this is conclusive, as perhaps prohibitions of speech might be intrinsically forbidden, as we find in such cases in the context of sexual immorality,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">[Ibid. 33a.]</i> Shabbat,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">[Ibid. 113a.]</i> and handing a Jew over to gentiles [<i>mesirah</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">[Bava Kama 117a.]</i> that speech is prohibited [in addition to the action itself].

                    "However, if fulfilling a commandment requires him to speak in a manner that appears arrogant, it is permitted based on the rule that a positive commandment overrides a negative one in a case where it is impossible to fulfill both. That is to say, where he feels that it is absolutely impossible for him to achieve the desired result without speaking in this fashion, then he is obligated to be careful that it does not lead to actual arrogance, although the extension is permitted by the extension of the positive commandment that overrides it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b> Commandment that overrides it:</b> In essence, as mentioned, speaking arrogantly is included in the prohibition of arrogance.

However, it is important to note that the prohibition of arrogance in one's heart remains in effect, regardless of the circumstances.</i>",
                    "The prohibitions of arrogance include the prohibition against speaking arrogantly, even where it does not lead to actual arrogance. This is clear from the Talmudic discussion in the chapter “Elu Devarim” in Pesachim, which states that we learn from the cases of Devorah and Hillel that if a person is arrogant, if that person is a sage, he loses his wisdom, and if a prophet, he loses his prophecy.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>He loses his prophecy:</b> Pesachim 66b.</i> Those were only instances of speech, as one cannot suppose that righteous people of their caliber were arrogant and that is why they spoke as they did.

                    "Either way, it [the trait of arrogance] is prohibited. It follows that announcing one’s own praises and virtues, concerning matters of Torah, wisdom, or other virtues, is prohibited because of the actual prohibition of arrogance.",
                    "It is only permitted in a case of great necessity, just as physical contact is permitted in such a case for a very pious person for the sake of a positive commandment.

It is difficult to understand how these Amoraim praised themselves, especially considering that praising oneself is forbidden due to the prohibition of arrogance. Rav Kook uses these examples to explain that exceptional and holy individuals are permitted in specific situations to speak words of self-praise. In these cases, those Amoraim needed to say this to prevent this Mishnah from being understood as an axiom, leading people to mistakenly believe that there is no reason to make an effort to acquire the attribute of humility. The reason they chose to testify about themselves in this manner was to demonstrate that it is still possible to arrive at even the highest level of humility—where it is permissible to speak words of arrogance externally, as explained earlier [Sota 49b].</i> These are necessary for the sake of a commandment, in order not to formulate the Mishna in a misleading way. Therefore, Rabbi Yehuda Hanasi demonstrated that this tradition only referred to humility and fear of sin of the highest level.",
                    "The same is true of the statements of R. Shimon bar Yochai: “I have seen the elite” and “I can absolve.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">[Sukka 45b.]</i> These statements are essentials of the Torah, for a number of essentials of the Torah concern matters of souls, their connections, and their virtues, and knowledge of R.

                    "Also, it is sometimes permitted for a very pious person to praise himself so that others will envy his virtues, and “the envy of Sages will increase wisdom.” The greater the envisioned benefit that can only be attained in this fashion, the broader the license to employ this approach. This category encompasses the statement of Abaye: “I am like Ben Azzai in the marketplaces of Tiberias.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Marketplaces of Tiberias:</b> The Amora Abaye used to say, \"I am ready and prepared to answer any Torah question they ask me,\" just as the Tanna Ben Azai did when he stood and lectured in the marketplace of Tiberias, proclaiming that none of the Sages of Israel could ask him a question for which he had no answer. Statements such as these also fall under the category of things that are permitted to be said for the purpose of spiritual benefit, allowing others to envy his wisdom and aspire to attain it [Kiddushin 20a].</i>",
                    "However, it would seem that safeguarding [human dignity] that is appropriate according to one’s true worth without being misleading is not arrogance at all and, on the contrary, is a fulfillment of a positive commandment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Positive commandment:</b> This can be found in <i>Chovat Halevavot</i>, “The Gate of Submission,” Chapter 9. There, he writes that praiseworthy pride is “the pride of the wise man in his wisdom or of the righteous man in his good deeds when it is an expression of his gratitude to the Creator for helping him greatly on them, and of his joy in them. When it causes him to improve and continue exerting himself in them, and …”</i> Halachic authorities are of the opinion that it is forbidden to relinquish human dignity even in the face of a commandment. The fact that the Torah permitted one to passively suspend a biblical commandment for the sake of human dignity and that the Sages considered it sufficient cause to even actively suspend their decrees is sufficient precedent. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Is sufficient precedent:</b> See Tractate Berachot 19–20, where it states and brings examples of the concept that “Great is human dignity, as it overrides a prohibition in the Torah.” For example, the Gemara discusses the timing of burying the deceased in relation to the recitation of the Shema. According to a baraita, it is generally not permitted to take the deceased out for burial during the time of reciting the Shema; they should be buried later. However, if the burial procession has already begun, those participating in the procession do not need to stop to recite the Shema. The Gemara raises a contradiction, citing the case of Rav Yosef, who was taken out for burial during the time of Shema. The resolution is that for important individuals, the Sages make an exception and are more lenient to honor them at their burial. This is also seen in the opinions in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 13:3, “Magen Avraham” and “Taz.” There, the Shulchan Aruch writes that if someone realizes that their Tallit (prayer shawl) is invalid while they are in a Carmelit area (where it is rabbinically forbidden to carry) on Shabbat, they should not remove it until they reach their home, because showing respect to others takes precedence. The Rema adds that even if it is a tallit katan (a small Tallit worn under clothing) and one of the tzitzit (fringes) becomes invalid, they do not need to remove it. If they feel embarrassed to sit without a Tallit, they can continue wearing it without reciting a blessing, out of consideration for human dignity.</i> A person can measure his human dignity according to his status and circumstance, as long as his traits are appropriate and he is able to judge himself without error.",
                    "It is stated concerning this, “Do not covet honor in excess of your schooling,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">[Avot 6:4.]</i> meaning what you are accustomed to, as customary honor is human dignity. But a person should be careful not to be enticed to try to ascend to lofty levels in order to thereby merit more honor based on his new circumstances or to attain more honor than he deserves in his current circumstances. These are two corrupt aspects, each one being grave in its own way.",
                    "For it is despicable for a person to desire and covet honor in excess of his current circumstance and without it occurring to him to better his circumstances. This will almost never lead him to any sort of perfection that would bestow honor on him because from his perspective, he already has the honor of which such perfection would make him worthy.

                    "Therefore, it seems that a person should initially train himself not to covet a level that is above the state that he is in whatsoever. Afterwards, he should investigate the means of attaining honor in his current situation, examining how much is appropriate and obligatory and how much is excessive and forbidden.

                    "In my humble opinion, it seems that there is a prohibition of placing a stumbling block in front of a blind person in terms of attributes as well.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>In terms of attributes, as well</b>: In the final paragraphs of this chapter, Rav Kook, using a wide array of Talmudic and halachic literature, proposes that the prohibition of <i>lifnei ivver</i> applies to inducing negative character traits in a person to the same extent it does to facilitating other forms of prohibited actions. Specifically, Rav Kook uses the \"kol vachomer\" argument to prove that, since the Sages instituted decrees and preventative measures even in terms of appearance of wrongdoing [<i>marit ayin</i>] concerning attributes, they should institute other preventive measures as well, including <i>lifnei ivver—</i>prohibition of placing a stumbling block. \"Kol vachomer\" (קל וחומר) is a term used in halachic jurisprudence that means \"light and heavy\" or \"a fortiori.\" It is a type of logical reasoning by which the truth of a proposition is inferred from a weaker case to a stronger one, or vice versa. When using a kol vachomer argument, if a certain rule or outcome applies in a less severe situation (the \"light\" case), it can be inferred that the same rule should undoubtedly apply in a more severe situation (the \"heavy\" case). Conversely, if a rule applies in a more severe situation, it can be inferred that the same rule applies even more so in a less severe situation. Therefore, if <i>marit ayin</i>,<i></i> a “light” prohibition, is included in character traits, then <i>lifnei ivver</i>,<i></i> a “heavier” case, should also be included.</i> I heard it taught by a great man<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b> Great man:</b> The great man being referred to is Rabbi Yisrael Salanter, the founder of the “Mussar Movement.” His thoughts on this topic can be found in the work “Tnuat Ha-Mussar,” Volume One, pg. 281 and Volume Two, pg. 191.</i> that there is no prohibition of placing a stumbling block in front of a blind person in terms of attributes, but I do not know why this should be so.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Should be so</b>: This opinion of Rav Kook is also found in the work <i>Orchot Tzadikim</i>, Gate 14, “The Gate of Envy,” where it is written as follows: “The early Sages used to pray, ‘May we not have any envy against others, and may others not envy us!’ Now why would they pray that others should not possess this quality more than other evil qualities? But this is the explanation of the matter: — Many men cause others to envy them and covet their possessions. Therefore, the early wise men used to pray that others do not envy them because of anything that they, the Sages, were responsible for. And the Torah has said, ‘Nor put a stumbling block before the blind.’”</i> After all, there is a prohibition of placing a stumbling block in front of a blind person in terms of bad advice.",
                    "However, in terms of attributes, this is not entirely conclusive, as the law concerning placing a stumbling block in front of a blind person is that whenever it is possible to assume a permitted motive, we do so, and we see that a case of doubt is not included in the prohibition of placing a stumbling block in front of a blind person.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>In front of a blind person:</b> In Tractate Avodah Zara 15b, it is clarified that when there are two possible interpretations of a particular action, one suggesting it is permitted and the other indicating it is prohibited, the preference is given to the permissive interpretation with regards to the principle of \"placing a stumbling block before the blind.\" Consequently, it was deemed permissible to sell large livestock to non-Jews, who might work with it on Shabbat, as we can say that the buyer acquired the cow for the permitted purpose of slaughtering it rather than intending to use it for agricultural purposes during Shabbat. Similarly, Hillel permitted the sale of a cow designated for agricultural work during the Sabbatical year to someone suspected of not observing the laws against plowing. As in the previous case, this leniency is based on the possibility that the buyer acquired the cow for the purpose of slaughtering it rather than for agricultural purposes during the Sabbatical year. Therefore, this action is not considered placing a stumbling block.</i> This is true even in a case where it is the less likely scenario, as the majority are intended for plowing; nonetheless, it is possible to assume that it was purchased for slaughter. That being the case, so long as it is not known that this [action] will lead to a prohibited [character] trait, it is possible to assume a permitted outcome. And even if it tends to lead to a trait that is mostly negative, there are always means of using any given trait in a positive fashion.

                    "After all, the first chapter of Bava Batra relates that Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakai did not inform people about his dream out of concern that it might lead to their performing a commandment in a less than ideal way.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Less than ideal way:</b> The passage in the Talmud (Bava Batra 10a) recounts that Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai had a dream in which his nephews would incur a loss of 700 dinars during the year.

However, Rabban Yochanan was 17 dinars short of the desired goal. Later, the king's officials came and demanded exactly 17 dinars from the nephews as taxes at the end of the year. When his nephews feared that the officials might continue collecting taxes from them, Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai comforted them and revealed his dream, explaining how his act of charity saved them from incurring a greater loss.

It is important to note that excessive weakness, overwhelming shame, and particularly deep sadness and a broken heart are seen as deficiencies that hinder the soul's completeness. However, feeling these emotions will ultimately guide the soul to distance itself from sin in the future, helping it avoid such situations. Consequently, the body will awaken and strengthen the soul, leading it to choose the path of goodness and righteousness. Thus, the weakness felt during times of self-evaluation should not be viewed as the ideal state but rather as a temporary and accompanying phenomenon that will eventually pass.</i> For a person who uprightly and righteously walks in the way of the Lord, blessed be He, will not weaken but rather will be girded in strength and splendor. He will not be ashamed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">[By the lowliness of shame mentioned above, such as in one who sins and is embarrassed about it or a person who partakes of another’s food and can’t look him in the face (Yerushalmi ‘Orlah I:3). The negativity of this shame was instilled in the basic intent of man’s creation and the manner of its governance (<i>Pitchei Chachmah V’daat</i>, 1).]</i> but rather will exalt in the honor with which the God of all souls, may He be exalted, crowned him. He will not be sad, for rejoicing in the Lord is his strength. His heart will not be weakened, for the name of the Lord is a tower of strength for the righteous who walk upright.",
                    "However, those who approach the way of the Lord, blessed be He, wanting to travel the paths of the obligations of the heart without study, which must precede action, will err concerning this [above] principle. They will think that weakness and sadness are innate to self-evaluation and pure reverence. However, the soul will not take kindly to that which is contrary to its nature, and, therefore, this will cause depression and will not add service or wisdom.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Not add service and wisdom: When individuals fail to intellectually differentiate between their essential nature and the transient emotions that accompany the process, their self-evaluation may lead to feelings of depression and despondency rather than motivation to put in extra effort and enthusiasm to further their spiritual journey.</i> Concerning this, it says,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">[Kohelet 10:15, Midrash Rabba, <i>Chovot Halevavot,</i> in the section on Monotheism, Chapter 2, Ibn Ezra and Rashi.]</i> “A fool’s exertions tire him out, for he does not know how to get to a town.”",

However, one should not rely on his own understanding in order to reach the depths of the details of the wisdom of the soul, which is one side of the study of divine service, especially since its other side is the divine wisdom dealing with global providence, whose major principles are numerous and extremely difficult.

This is a vice, which is only found in a person because of their lack of knowledge, as this sadness and lack of self-satisfaction is a result of the person failing to make the effort to understand what the level that they demand of themselves is and what its true definition and requirements are.

But since they do not know what they seek, no path for enlightening themselves spiritually can be revealed to them, and the person sits in darkness, sadness, and despair.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sadness and despair: A person's inability to find peace and satisfaction is often linked to their failure to reach a higher spiritual level, which seems distant due to their lack of knowledge. The sadness and dissatisfaction they experience arise from not understanding the true essence and requirements of this desired level. If individuals were to engage in introspection and seek understanding, their souls would be illuminated with joy and contentment, and the pathways to spiritual growth would become clearer. However, without attaining this knowledge, they may find themselves in spiritual stagnation and sadness.</i> Therefore, a person should take the time to reflect on what they seek in order to perfect themselves and on what path will allow them to succeed in achieving this. Once the person investigates this, the Lord, blessed be He, will open the gates of light for them, as “Good and upright is the Lord; therefore, He shows sinners the way …”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">[Tehillim 25:8.]</i> Therefore, the person will never covet a level that is beyond them, because if they recognize the level and know its aspects and requirements, it is no longer beyond them.

Their intense focus on aligning with these aspirations may unintentionally hinder the emergence of new and holier thoughts, which are more practical to acquire, as they have not prepared themselves for such possibilities. Consequently, their strong efforts to internalize the higher spiritual level may lead them to believe that unless they feel that the level is fully integrated within them, they haven't achieved complete perfection in their actions.</i> In fact, fulfilling the commandments and studying the Lord’s Torah are so exalted that they perfect the soul far more than any perfection that a person can picture. They are themselves the true perfection. The bottom line is that as long as a person seeks to walk exclusively in the way of the Lord, blessed be He, to perform the commandments and diligently study the Torah and to sanctify themselves below [in this world], and similarly in terms of prayer, to attune their will to prayer and the meaning of the words, they will ascend and receive assistance from heaven to grow in the Torah, wisdom, and good deeds. But a person will rob themselves of the joy and happiness of divine service and will find many obstacles on the path to perfection if they wish to experience exalted levels in their prayer and instantly feel a profound attainment and tremendous pleasure, for they will be incensed and unable to calm down. The same is true in terms of Torah study [a person will rob themselves of the joy and happiness] if they want to attain new knowledge and many insights every time and in each topic [they study]. And it is similar in terms of good deeds if they only want to feel enlightenment in their heart and mind.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Enlightenment in their heart and mind</b>: While it is natural to desire personal elevation, one should not be overly anxious about not comprehending such lofty ideals, as true perfection comes from fulfilling commandments and studying the Torah.

But as long as a person is empty of Torah, as is my status as a result of my many sins, then when this desire to think thoughts from the depths of the heart is aroused, great care must be taken.
