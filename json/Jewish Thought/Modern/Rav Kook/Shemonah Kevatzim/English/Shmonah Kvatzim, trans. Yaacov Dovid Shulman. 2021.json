                "At times, your soul is revealed to you in all its naked ugliness, and you are repulsed by the vision. But only in this way can you calm your spirit: for corresponding to the ugliness of the soul and its impurity, so will its beauty and purity grow. “One corresponding to the other did God create them.”",
                "After you strengthen yourself and rise beyond the shocking vision of that aspect of ugliness—so that the aspect of purity shines before your eyes, the aspect of the beauty within your soul, and your eyes, seeing, are illumined—then you will gain consolation for every monstrous vision that had terrified you. “The humble will increase their joy in God, and the most impoverished will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel” (Isaiah 29:19)."
