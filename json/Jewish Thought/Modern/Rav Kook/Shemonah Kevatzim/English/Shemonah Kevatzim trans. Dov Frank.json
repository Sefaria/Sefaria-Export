                "The fallen souls with whom I associate give me strength. I sympathize with them, I desire their rectification, their wellbeing, their light, their salvation, and they feel revivified and peace of mind. The essence of their depression stems from a thirst for the light of God and His goodness, and they rejoice for there is someone who can speak to their inherent goodness. For I know how very deep the light of God burns in these fallen [souls]; a spirit from on high blows within them: how deeply in their souls do they want to walk in the pathways of light, in the ways of goodness and dignity. I am certain that in the end, God's aid will come to them, and the light of God and His goodness will manifest upon them and they will return out of great Teshuva; from an abundance of love will they come close, and the light of dignity and righteousness which is alight in their depths will become a huge burning light. \"The nation which walks in darkness will see a great light, those who dwell in the land of the shadow of death, a light will shine upon them\" (Isaiah 9:1)"
