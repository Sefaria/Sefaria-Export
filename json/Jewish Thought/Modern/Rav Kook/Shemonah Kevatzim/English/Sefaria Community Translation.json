The lives of high souls are nursed from its springs, from the Splendor of the worlds, from the majesty of Eternity. The lights appear with the pure recognition of divinity, by the refreshment of the desire to be situated in the center of existence in the power of its elevation. The Jewish soul is pressed by the blossoming forth of love that fills the light of its life, which takes up all of its focus. Great raging waves from one end of all the worlds to their other end rage deep within its soul. Purity overpowers purity, eternity overtakes eternity - and the secrets of the Life of the world pushes the cycles of history, so that Jewish history is revealed in the splendor of its colors. It moves and soars in its awesome power towards its supernal action, its holy flight - the holy of holies. But below it small clouds flow, dark lights mixed with shade that draw forth from its nectar, brightened by traces of its light, but darkening and mixing with them, weighing down the souls that become attached to them. For such is how they are in their foundation and thus do they love. And with the descent, many causes of darkness, wild and stormy winds and a misleading bridle upon the jaws of peoples. Yet amidst all the darkness flicker sparks of its splendor."

                "The thought of the reality of the world strengthens practical precision and adopts the foundation of valor. And conversely, the ideal and visionary depiction of reality weakens the character of valor and places practical content within the idealistic vision. Heresy stumbled on the stumbling block of the gross material reality of the world in the crude form of separation from the unity of divine rule, and it raised itself from practical and real content, wishing to rise to idealistic sublimity, and it stumbled in that the separated materiality overpowered in form and enslaved the idealistic content to it. Thus it defiled the storehouse of every precious vessel, beginning with connection and ending with separation. The Hasidic tendency diminished the reality of the world, and through this practical enthusiasm was weakened and was sublime in idealistic inwardness. Indeed, later on it descended from its completeness to defend the limited practical existence in its world, and it was not similar to heresy, which abhorred the practical from separation that has no healing. The way of Torah is not occupied with taking away the reality of the world, but rather with unity. Divine rule and valor is evident in prominence and clarity, and practical content is extremely precise. And if worlds come in which all is sublime, then all the content of heroism as it is evident in the advantageous sublime tangible creation will shine in the light of great kindness, in which idealistic brilliance resides. And to this storehouse of life all eyes are turned, and it comes specifically according to the multitude of action, and Torah was given to Israel because they are brazen, from His right a law of fire for them, the laws of these are fire."

This rebellion against the sovereignty of silence destroys all its buildings, all the storehouse of simplicity and rectitude, of depth and transcendent communication - everything shatters in fragments. Afterwards, if one wants to rebuild that which was destroyed, they must establish everything anew, and in that moment a discerning person is silent. In truth when silence is honored in the moment of its appearance, then it asserts its rule, establishes its hall, penetrating to the deepest depths of its abyss and bringing out glorious ramifications and mighty branchings with a powerful and refreshing vital force - the shrubs (sichim) are filled with strength and new expressions of the lips (Is. 57:19) come. Then the time for speech begins, in its beautiful glory, and the spirit of silence serves as the mediating angel that works upon the flood of speech, flowing like a river in all its preciousness and abundant wealth. \"I will create new expressions of the lips: Peace, peace, both far and near, says the Lord. And I will heal him. (Is. 57:19) \"...Their fruit will serve for food and their leaves for healing.\" (Ezekiel 47:12) "

                "When we forget our own subjective soul, when we distract ourselves from looking at our inner life, everything becomes confused and uncertain. And the main teshuvah, that lights up the darkness in an instant, is that one returns to oneself, to the roots of one’s soul, and immediately returns to God, to the soul of all souls, and stride forward up and up in holiness and purity. And this is the case with a lone individual, a whole people, all of humanity, with the restoration of all being, whose ruin always proceeds from forgetting itself. And if it desires to return to God, but isn’t prepared to gather its scattered ones, this is a deceptive teshuvah, taking God’s name in vain. And so only by the great truth of teshuvah to oneself, will a person and the nation, the world and all the worlds, all of being, return to its maker, to light in the light of life. And that is the secret of the light of the Messiah, the coming into view of the soul of the world, with whose illumination the world will return to the root of being, and God’s light will reveal itself upon him. And from the source of this great teshuvah, man will draw the sacred life-force of true teshuvah."

Only afterwards can it be sweetened through the power of consciousness and clarified until it takes its clean, ennobled form which is solely the hatred of wickedness, while toward those who carry it, who are the wicked themselves, we are filled with compassion. ‘Let the sins cease and not the sinners.’ (Berachot 10a) If at its inception hatred comes in its ideal form, focusing its essence only on the hatred of abstract wickedness, it will never be actualized in its full strength even as that hatred of wickedness. This is because the lack of hatred for the wicked will blur the hatred of wickedness itself, and then all the storehouse of good will be placed in great danger. This was the stumbling block for many fallen, who fell because from the beginning they employed the hatred of wickedness in its ennobled form, and the absence of hatred for the wicked afterwards was transformed into love for them. And through the love of the wicked they fell into the love of wickedness itself. Therefore, the first thought must be in the quality of the aspect of judgment, and afterwards mercy will come and sweeten it through their union. "
