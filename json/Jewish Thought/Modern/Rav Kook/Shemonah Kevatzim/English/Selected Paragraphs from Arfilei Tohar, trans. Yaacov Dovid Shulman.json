The mark of a pure fear of heaven is that it elevates a person’s natural morality – which is planted in one’s straightforward nature – to higher levels than that which it [could] otherwise stand upon. But if we imagine a fear of heaven of such a nature that without its influence on [a person’s] life, [one’s] life would tend to result in more good and bring about [more] matters that help the individual and the community, and the influence [of that fear of heaven] would diminish this active power – such a fear of heaven is a flawed fear.\n"

And this has caused terrible destruction. We must employ the supernal remedy, which is [the attainment of] increased strength in [our] spiritual ability. Then the common people will, [with their] feeling, directly understand and access a way of comprehending and appraising that which connects all of [their] Torah-[related] knowledge and deeds to the most supernal wholeness.

One cause [of depression] is a tendency,[expressed in] action, for coarse pleasure. A person’s soul is drawn by that to a place of darkness, and [there] it grieves over its descent.[A person] should transform this great woe to joy, for when [his] soul [will] rise from the yoke of exile that had burdened it, a great stream of joy [will] rise up from below, and the sublime, pure [level of reality will] grow ever richer in its spirituality."

The necessity for this rebellion is the tendency toward the aspect of materialism that must of necessity come into being in the nation as a whole in a powerful form, after periods of many years have passed in which the nation as a whole was completely devoid of the need and ability [to engage in] the material endeavor.

The inner, essential “I” – whether of the individual or of the community – appears within [an entity] only in relation to its holiness and purity [and] in relation to the degree of its supernal power suffused by the pure light of an elevated illumination, flaming  within it. “We and our forefathers sinned” (Psalms 106:6). Adam sinned. He was alienated from his essence. He turned to the consciousness of the serpent and lost himself. He did not know how to give a clear answer to the question, “Where are you?” (Genesis 3:9), because he did not know himself, because he had lost [his] true “I,” with [his] sin of bowing to a strange god. [The nation of] Israel sinned. It “ran after foreign gods” (Deuteronomy 31:16). It abandoned its essential “I.” “Israel rejected goodness” (Hosea 8:3). The earth sinned [during the week of Creation]. It denied its essence. It constricted its power. It went after [limited] goals and purposes. It did not give forth all of its hidden power so that the taste of the tree would be equal to the taste of its fruit (Sukkah 35a). It raised its eyes to look outside of itself, to think about [its trivial] future, its “career.” The moon complained [at that time] (Hullin 60b). [As a result,] it lost its internal orbit, the joy of its portion. It was dreaming of a superficial beauty of royalty. Thus does the world continue to sink, with the loss of the “I” of every [entity] – of the individual and of the whole. Learned educators come and focus on the superficial. They too remove their consciousness from the “I.” They add straw to the fire, give vinegar to the thirsty, and fatten minds and hearts with everything that is external to them. And the “I” grows progressively forgotten. And when there is no “I,” there is no “He,” and how much more is there no “You.” The Messiah is called “the breath of our nostrils, the anointed one of God” (Lamentations 4:20). This is his might, the beauty of his greatness: [that] he is not outside of us. He is the breath of our nostrils. Let us seek Hashem our God and David our king. Let us tremble before God and His goodness. Let us seek our “I.” Let us seek ourselves – and find. Remove all foreign gods, remove every stranger and illegitimate one. Then “you will know that I am Hashem your God, Who takes you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. I am Hashem your God” (cf. Numbers 15:41)."
