        "Preface": [
            "T<small>HE</small> sermons in this volume were preached during the darker days of the war. I have tried in them by applying a few fundamental principles of the Jewish conception of life and history to elicit the significance of certain events of these years in terms of a “moral strategy” of the war.",
            "It is with some hesitation that I submit these sermons to a wider public. The spoken word is essentially different from the written one. Committed to print, it must lose some of the force and emphasis derived by it from both the original situation in which it has been spoken and the oratory of the speaker.",
            "To my mind the justification for this volume lies in the persistence of the “original situation,” which will most probably not pass for many years yet. In terms of our moral strategy this war will not be over when the soldier has done his work. For a considerable period yet, mankind is destined to grope in darkness between a world that is irretrievably lost and a new life not yet born, the resolute striving for which requires a moral stamina and depth of vision not yet possessed by mankind in general.",
            "To-morrow will come, but not so soon. I hope that in this no man’s world between yesterday and to-morrow these sermons may be of some help in the clarification of the issues with which they deal.",
            "In conclusion, I wish to thank Mr. M. Simon, M.A., for valuable help and advice in the preparation of the present volume for publication.",

                "I<small>N</small> the Haftorah of the day we read the famous sentence which seems to be the summing up of the message of Judaism to the world and which expresses the only hope of humanity in this hour of trial and suspense. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">*Zechariah <small>IV</small>, 6.</i>“Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts”.",
                "Never have human hearts wished these words to be true more earnestly than they do to-day. On the other hand, never was the human mind more doubtful as to the essential truth of this sentence than it is to-day.",
                "“Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit” … there is comfort in this, there is hope in this. But is there more, more than mere comfort and, it may be, unfounded hope, cleverly devised only for those who are in need of such comfort and hope because they are without might and without power? Is there truth in this, truth that can be proved by the facts of our life? Is there historic truth in this?",
                "It is not a little pathetic to observe how obstinately we Jews—a nation that has long forgotten what real might and power are—have always insisted on the tenet of “Not by might”.",
                "Again and again in our history we have had to suffer the brutality of power. Again and again we have had to experience in our own life how might rules in this world and how dark and dreary a fate is meted out to those who have nothing more to rely upon than spiritual and moral strength. Never has there been a nation on earth with more reason to respect power than the Jews. But in spite of their experiences no nation has ever treated the exhibition of bare force with more contempt than the Jews. Again and again we witnessed the success of force and material might, again and again we proclaimed: “Not by might but by my spirit, saith the Lord”.",
                "How is such an attitude to be explained? How can it be so obstinately maintained in the face of innumerable facts that seem to stultify it? Do we Jews not know this world? Do we not know human nature? Do we not know life? Have we not witnessed the course of human history long enough? Have we not seen force march from triumph to triumph, trample upon the creations of the spirit, ruthlessly destroy moral standards of living, and break everything that in the name of justice or right or truth stood in its way? Have we not learned yet that the only thing that is able to humiliate force is more force? Do we really walk about the world with our eyes shut to the facts? Or do we perhaps cling so obdurately to this unreasonable belief of ours in the spirit because we are so utterly powerless that there is nothing more left for us but this comfort of the weak, this hope of despair?",
                "<b>2</b>",
                "I believe that Judaism knows man fairly well; it also knows history and understands it, and because of this Judaism declares: “Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit”.",
                "This is, indeed, our comfort, this our hope. Not the comfort of weakness, nor the hope of despair; but the comfort of fortitude and the hope of strength.",
                "Hope comes of strength, it is justified, when there is faith behind it. And it is the entire faith of Judaism that is the foundation of our hope for the ultimate victory of the spirit. It is our faith in God that stands behind it. Faith in God involves faith in life, it means faith in the ultimate value of life, in a moral purpose slowly but surely realising itself in life. Faith tells us that this world has been created by Him not for the purpose of being destroyed by the devil. Faith in God declares that the world can never be delivered up to the ravaging powers of darkness and destruction.",
                "Our faith in God, our trust in reason, our confidence in life, our unshakable belief in a moral purpose of history, all this has been summed up in the courageous words: “Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord”. For us who are Jews, this is the very essence of life. If these words do not hold true, life itself is nothing but a horrible nightmare. If the spirit will not conquer, life itself must perish. If justice is to succumb, mankind will be wiped out. If truth is not to be victorious, the whole of the Universe must disintegrate, fall to pieces, and vanish in the void.",
                "Our faith in the ultimate victory of the spirit is unshakable. It is as strong as life is, and it will last as long as life will last on earth.",
                "<b>3</b>",
                "But what about the facts of life? Do they not prove that we are mistaken in our faith? Does not life show that it is always the fittest that survive, the mightiest and most powerful? To this we Jews have <i>lived</i> the answer: No.",
                "Our own life, our own history gives evidence to the contrary. It is true, often we saw brutal force triumphant, but just as often we saw it humiliated, wallowing in the dust, trodden even by the feet of the weakest. Again and again we witnessed the success of barbarous might, but in many more cases we watched its destruction and annihilation.",
                "We Jews are the witnesses of human history. There is one thing that we have never experienced: the ultimate triumph of barbarism. Among all the western nations we are the one with the longest memory. We have known almost all the tyrannies of the world, we felt their whip on our own bodies, and to-day we can give evidence that there was not one among them that we have not seen totter and tumble, fall and crash.",
                "Our very existence, the fact that we are here to-day, able to witness the gigantic bid now being made by brutal force for domination over the spirit and everything that the spirit stands for, the very fact that the Jews are still able to feel the lash of the tyrant’s whip, is for itself proof enough that, at the end, it is not the tyrannies that survive, not barbarous strength that conquers.",
                "Napoleon said once—and he should have known if anyone—that there were two principles in the world wrestling with each other for mastery, the principle of the sword and the principle of the spirit, and that ultimately the spirit is always victorious.",
                "It is our deepest conviction that the eternal words of the prophet: “Not by might, nor by power” not only express hope and comfort but also state a fact, explain history and proclaim a truth which has always prevailed and will always prevail.",
                "<b>4</b>",
                "Of course, this does not justify complacency; it does not mean that we have nothing else to do but to sit back in our easy-chairs, waiting for the ultimate victory of the spirit.",
                "Whenever a generation facing a violent struggle between force and spirit trembles in fear lest the spirit might lose the battle, one thing is certain: that this generation has sinned against the spirit. And before the spirit can conquer, the sins must be expiated, the wrongs redressed.",
                "The sin against the spirit committed by our generation becomes clear when we compare ourselves with our opponents in the present struggle. On their side, the side of brute force, the struggle is carried on with a methodical ruthlessness the like of which the world has never seen. There is one thing of which the adversaries of the spirit know nothing to-day: compromise. They could have avoided this struggle, they could have achieved great advantages for themselves by negotiation and compromise. But, “No compromise” has been the watchword of the forces of darkness. And it is precisely compromise which has been the sin of our generation.",
                "Had we been as faithful to the spirit as barbarism has been faithful to its own intentions, the catastrophe would never have occurred. Had the democratic world been as sincere, as uncompromising, as thoroughgoing in what it tried to achieve as the world of darkness was in the pursuance of its own detestable aims, the tragedy would have been avoided.",
                "But, no. They were thoroughgoing and uncompromising; we were not. We adopted the cause of the spirit as our own, but we were not faithful to it. We professed high and lofty ideals, but we were not prepared to make the sacrifices demanded by them.",
                "We said: Justice! but did not care very much when injustice struck the neighbour down. We shouted: Freedom! and had only pity for those who had been robbed of their share in it. We acknowledged Truth, but were always prepared to accept the <i>fait accompli</i> created by falsehood, treachery, and the perversion of truth.",
                "There was much selfishness in all of us, and out of selfishness we were always prepared to compromise. This was the great sin of our generation against the spirit. To be sure, barbarism will not prevail; but the spirit can be victorious only through the sacrifices of a faithful and uncompromising generation. This is the only hope for the future. Faithfulness and no compromise. When this terrible conflict is over, there will be more faithfulness, more justice, more truth in the world. It may be that then we shall understand better why all this hardship and suffering and destruction was necessary to bring about that better world for which all mankind is longing.",
                "There is a saying in the Midrash explaining the deeper significance of the commandment of the M’norah, of which we read in the week’s portion of the Law.",
                "The question is: Why was it necessary to light a M’norah in the sanctuary? Is the Almighty, who is nothing but light, in want of the light we mortals are able to prepare for him? And the answer is:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">*Tanchuma, Numbers, B’haalotcha.</i>",
                "Rabbi Chanina said: The Holy One, blessed be He, spoke to man: That eye of yours, there is white and black in it, and you see with the dark part of your eye and not with the bright one. So am I, the Lord, nothing but light, and that is why I need the light which comes from you, the light that is perceived in the midst of darkness. Because there is no darkness with me, I need your help, for I need that light that breaks forth out of the darkness.",
                "This is the task of man: to create light out of darkness, order out of chaos, life and happiness out of destruction.",
                "Darkness there must be, that light may be created.",
                "Chaos there must be, that order may grow.",
                "And all this God has put into our own hands; all this depends on us. For all this God Himself is waiting that it may be performed by us; for light out of darkness, for new life and new happiness out of death and destruction; for that great day when it shall become manifest all over the world that it is not by might, nor by power, but by the spirit of God that human happiness can be maintained."

                "This meeting was not a Jewish one, but the banner bore the Jewish motto. Since the destruction of the Jewish State in the year 70 Jews have been marching to the rhythm of a hope that pointed to the future. We have no To-day; To-day is usually not worth living. We have only Yesterday and we live for To-morrow. We are great masters in the art of going on toiling and drudging in spite of and forgetting the wretchedness of To-day. We have survived utterly unbearable living conditions because we have always known that To-morrow would come, that we shall be there when To-morrow comes, and that we shall make To-morrow.",
                "All our prophets spoke of To-morrow, of the “Great Day” that will come, that is bound to come because there is a God in the world, because there must be a meaning in life.",
                "In the Haftarah of Shabbat Haggadol, which heralds the festival of Freedom and Redemption, we read the words: <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">*Malachi i, <small>III</small>, 19.</i>“For, behold, the day cometh, it burneth as a furnace; and all the guilty and all that work wickedness shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch”.",
                "For this day we Jews have been waiting all the dark years of our life in Exile, the day of the ultimate annihilation of wickedness, for which together with us the whole world is hoping at this moment. But do we realise as we should what our responsibilities are in respect of this day? Do we understand how to prepare ourselves for To-morrow, how to prepare ourselves for making To-morrow, when Tomorrow will be here? These are questions not for politicians only or for War Cabinets, but for everyone of us. And on the reply that every one of us will give to them depends the future happiness of our people as well as that of the whole of mankind.",
                "<b>2</b>",
                "There are two things that Jewish tradition teaches us regarding To-morrow. The prophet calls it: <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">†</sup><i class=\"footnote\">†Malachi, iii, 23.</i>“the great and terrible day of the Lord”. Secondly, we are told that God will send us <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">‡</sup><i class=\"footnote\">‡Ib.</i>“the prophet Elijah before the great and terrible day”. Two questions arise from these statements. First, why is it to be a terrible day? A great day, yes. A glorious day, yes. For wickedness will be destroyed and justice will triumph. But, why a terrible day? Why not a day of joy and happiness? And then, why is it Elijah who will be sent to herald this great and terrible day?",
                "To the first question we may give the answer that it will be terrible because To-morrow must not be the day of triumph for one nation over another, terrible for one and happy for the other; nor must To-morrow be a day of political and military victories alone; but a day of triumph for justice over injustice, for decency over brutality, for truth over lies. It will be terrible because wickedness will be so completely exterminated that, as the prophet put it, “neither root nor branch will remain of it”. Now, where are the branches and roots of wickedness?",
                "Let us not deceive ourselves. Let us not point to this or that country alone. The roots and branches of wickedness are very widely spread all over the world. They are here, there, and everywhere. In our day, Evil has become a world-power in the shape of Nazidom and Fascism. But it could become such a force in Germany and Italy only because it was mighty and powerful in all countries. When the forces of evil cautiously started to build up their power in Italy and Germany, they found, probably to their own surprise, that they had powerful allies all over the world. Their allies were the “roots and branches” of evil spread among all the nations. Instead of indignation, instead of the wrath of the civilised world, they met with encouragement, understanding, and sympathy, or, at the very least, with timid toleration.",
                "There was one sin of which the whole world became guilty in the last couple of decades: the toleration of evil. In diplomatic language it was called Neutrality. But are we allowed to be neutral towards wrong-doing, brutality, persecution and the suppression of justice, truth and freedom?",
                "The world was neutral, the nations were “tolerant” and did not want to realise that the toleration of evil is in itself doing evil. By tolerating evil we all lent a hand in making it the terrible power of destruction which we see it to be in these days. By tolerating evil the whole world has become accessory to the crimes which have been committed by the power of evil.",
                "Some years ago a famous American author wrote a novel in which he pictured a supposed successful Fascist revolution in the U.S.A. By the very title, <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">*By Sinclair Lewis.</i>“It Can’t Happen Here”, he satirised those people who thought to parry such an event by the constant repetition of this and similar phrases. People do not realise that, after all, there is but one human race and we are all made of the same stuff. It is not the case that one part of mankind consists of mere devils and the other of pure angels. Fundamentally, all men are alike. If wickedness is strong somewhere in the world, it only proves that it is strong in us human beings. And what happens in any one country can only happen there because it may happen everywhere. Only because it is a latent possibility everywhere can it be turned into triumphant actuality somewhere.",
                "We are accustomed to accuse the totalitarian States of having no respect for the sanctity of the pledged word or promise. But do we ourselves always honour our promises? Have we never broken our word? We call them brutal—and brutal they are—but is there no brutality in our own life?",
                "We call the dictators, robbers and exploiters, and rightly so. But, is there no robbery and exploitation in the rest of the world?",

                "Let no one assert that there is a fundamental difference between these two sets of shortcomings. There may be a difference of degree, but essentially they are linked together, and only together do they represent the whole picture. Because evil has been strong in us it was able to become a world power in others. Had there been more justice exercised in our small individual worlds, we should have had more justice in national affairs. Had there been more love in each of the nations, we should have had more kindness and understanding between the nations. Had we been more truthful, truth would be mightier. Had we been more just, justice would be stronger.",
                "We have all become guilty, every one of us has his own personal share in the terrible crimes of our generation. Humanism died out because it died out in us. Civilisation collapsed because it collapsed in us. Man has failed, and we all are responsible. Evil has triumphed, because it has its roots and branches everywhere. Yet, To-morrow will still come. In fact, it is already on its way. To-morrow has already started. For To-morrow is not only a great day, it is also a terrible day, for To-morrow will bring the extermination of evil. Unfortunately, there is to be extermination everywhere; the roots and branches of evil are widely spread all over the world.",

Kings <small>XVIII</small>, 21.</i>“How long halt ye between two opinions? If the Lord be God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him”. Strange words were these. If Baal be the truth, go and follow him. They did something that was even worse than the straightforward and clear acceptance of idolatry; they wavered between two opinions, between two worlds, God and Baal. The nation tried to serve both, God and Baal. It aimed at a compromise between God and Baal. And this, the compromise between the service of God and the service of Baal, is worse than the clear acceptance of Baal, for it is the distortion of the truth that is in God. Compromise between truth and a lie is worse and much more dangerous than a clear-cut lie, for it involves the misuse of the truth in the service of the lie. A mixture of light and darkness is worse than unmixed darkness, for it is the darkening of light. There must be no compromise between God and Baal; rather than compromise, serve Baal wholeheartedly.",
                "We have said that there is a common guilt in the world because the whole of mankind had—to say the least—tolerated the growth of evil and by toleration helped it to become powerful. It is well to realise that this blind toleration was only possible because, like Israel at the time of Elijah, the world was halting between two opinions, because we were wavering between the service of the truth and that of falsehood. We thought of compromise between justice and its violence, between the forces of freedom and the forces of slavery, without realising that there are certain moral purposes in the life of man which do not admit of any compromise.",
                "Whatever good we have tried to do we have done half-heartedly. We had democracy, but democracy had no faith in its own destiny. We had a League of Nations, but one that was startled by its own boldness. We wished for peace, but did next to nothing to secure it.",
                "And if we think of our own Jewish affairs, it cannot be doubted that all our Jewishness bore the stamp of half-heartedness. Whether the issues were national, communal or religious; whether Palestine or the Community or Jewish Education was at stake—we have bungled everything, all our efforts have been covered with the pale cast of unhealthy compromise.",
                "It is an old Jewish custom to open the doors of our houses on the “Seder” nights to welcome the prophet Elijah. By this custom we wish to indicate that we are still waiting for To-morrow, waiting for Elijah to announce that To-morrow has come. I feel, however, that Elijah’s reply would be: Well, brother, To-morrow will come. But are you still wavering between two worlds, are you still trying to serve God and Baal? If so what is the good of To-morrow, what use are you going to make of To-morrow?",
                "To-morrow will come. But, are we prepared for Tomorrow, are we ready to make To-morrow?",

                "P<small>EOPLE</small> speak of us as “the wandering Jew.” The wandering Jew does not travel alone; he is accompanied by the wandering Amalek. Wherever the Jew may go, Amalek follows on his heels. We have known him since first we made our appearance on the stage of the world’s history. Amalek has driven us from country to country, he has followed us from nation to nation. It has always been the same story: Jews fleeing from oppression, wandering on deserted tracks, hoping for rest, longing for safety, and when they thought that they found it at last—<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">*Exodus, <small>XVII</small>, 8.</i>“Then came Amalek”. Jews run from Amalek, but Amalek is everywhere. They say the Jew is ubiquitous, much more so is Amalek. They call us international, much more so is Amalek.",
                "“Then came Amalek.” Once more Amalek has come; but this time he has laid aside his mask and revealed himself in his true shape. This time he has come not only to us Jews, but, like a lightning scourge, he has swooped down on the nations and the whole of mankind. For the first time in history he has revealed himself in his true colours. Amalek! The enemy of the Jew, the enemy of the world.",
                "This, of course, must have been a very unpleasant surprise to those who had some sneaking regard for Amalek, the Jew-baiter. There is, however, nothing new in Amalek being the enemy of mankind. This has always been so. Whether people saw it or not, our enemies were always the enemies of progress and happiness.",
                "For why does Amalek hate us? There are many people, and very often even Jews, who are always prepared to point to certain faults of the Jewish character, or to certain forms of Jewish behaviour, as the causes of anti-Semitism. When a non-Jewish clergyman not long ago in a letter to the Jewish Press suggested in all good faith and with the best intentions that the reason why the Jews were hated was because they were no longer good Jews, we were treated to the absurd spectacle of a number of Jews rushing into print to prove that his theory was ridiculous, and that the faults for which the Jews are blamed are not their faults, or that they are not responsible for them.",
                "Of course, we do have our faults. We do not wish to be angels. We go even further and declare that in claiming our right to live we claim the right to have faults like any other nation on earth. Whoever denies us the right to human shortcomings is at the bottom of his heart denying us the right to live. Yes, we do have our faults. But only the most narrow-minded can think even for a single moment that we are hated because of our faults. Ask the record of the world to give evidence. When have the nations hated out of moral indignation? How often has it happened in human history? When has the world at large hated faults and loved moral perfection? It is true that once upon a time there lived a Jewish prophet who called for such a hatred and such a love, a prophet who, witnessing social injustice, the exploitation of the poor, the persecution of the weak, called out in the anguish of this soul: <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">*Amos <small>V</small>, 15.</i>“Hate the evil, and love the good”. But when did men listen to him? When did they hate evil as they can hate, and when did they love good as they can love?",
                "The general history of the nations fully explains the particular history of the Jew. Moral considerations have hardly ever in history determined the objects of hatred or love. The story of love and hatred among nations as told by history shows that nations love themselves and as a consequence they will love the lie that subserves their selfish interests, they will love the evil that will lead to the attainment of their aims, they will love every crime and every vice that will help them to satisfy their boundless self-love. They can hate too, and how they hate everything that stands in their way! They hate justice if it attempts to interfere with their machinations or to curb the gratification of their desires: they hate decency, if it bids them to abandon their plottings against the happiness of others. But faults? They do not hate faults. The idea of an anti-Semitism created by Jewish faults, as an expression of moral indignation sustained for 2,000 years, is contrary to all historic experience, it is a fairy tale that can only be believed by cretins and hypocrites.",
                "All historic experience goes to show that peoples and nations have always been so wrapped in self-love as to resent everything that is strange to them, everything that differs from them. The more unusual a thing is, the stranger it appears, the more is it resented. Normally, however, the general aversion against the stranger is kept in check by certain considerations. For instance, one cannot always hit him when one would wish to, for most probably he will hit back. But what if there need be no fear of retaliation, and what if the person whom you resent but need not fear is the strangest among all the strangers, differing from you most? Then, naturally, the aversion becomes more intense. Then, there is but one thing that can control it: humanity, justice, the love of good and the hatred of evil. And if people do not hate evil, they will love only themselves and hate everything that is not themselves and can be hated without fear of reprisals.",
                "These rules derived from historic experience are, in the main, sufficient explanation of anti-Semitism. Jews are hated because they differ and dare to differ without having a hard fist to defend themselves when the necessity arises. We are hated not because this or that is wrong with us, but because much is foul in the world at large.",
                "Amalek stands for the person who lives by uncontrolled impulses, by animal instincts. He hates because he is a hater. He hates us because he follows the line of least resistance and in doing so he is able to trample justice and human dignity underfoot without risk of retaliation. But he hates not only us. He is the enemy of the world to the same extent as he is our enemy; as he hates us, so does he disdain decency and justice.",
                "And again Amalek has come; not only over us, but as a consuming pestilence over the world. This time he is mightier than he ever was in the past and for this reason he has had the audacity to strip himself of his old disguise. This time he stands before the world in all his naked brutality and hideous ugliness, exposing himself and all the other little Amalekites who were still pretending to hate Jews because of this or that. He has torn the mask from all of them and has taught the world once again that the enemy of the Jew is the enemy of mankind. It is time that the world learned the lesson.",
                "He who denies justice to the Jew will deny justice to anyone else whenever it suits his purpose.",
                "He who repudiates decency in his dealings with Jews will do the same whenever he is able to afford it in his dealings with non-Jews.",
                "He who treads the human dignity of the Jew under his feet has no respect for the dignity of other human beings either.",
                "It is time that all this should be understood and acted upon in the best interest of all mankind.",
                "In these days there is much talk about the coming of a new and better world which is to be built on the ruins of the past. What is to be the place of the Jew, of the Jewish nation in this New World? We hear almost nothing about it. In fact, a suspicious silence is kept on this question. On the other hand, we have witnessed certain actions on the part of those who are fighting for that better world which are not encouraging at all. Remember the shameful regulations concerning Jewish internees in one of the camps in Canada. Think of the disgusting treatment of refugees who were fortunate enough to escape from enemy-occupied territories and succeeded in reaching the shores of Palestine. After having been rendered homeless (partly also thanks to the stupidity and hypocrisy of “democratic” policy in the years before the war), now they have been deported like criminals in their hundreds, men, women and children, to some unknown destination.",
                "We do not know what this New World will look like. But here I give the most reliable method of proving its real worth: what is the plight of the Jew in the New World?—this will be the test. Have the wrongs been righted, has justice been done to this nation? The answer to this question will tell of the sincerity of the New Order. For here you have a nation, claiming its right to live, which is unable to back up its claim by huge armies and by might, a nation that is claiming its right in the name of right, that can back its claim only by the moral conscience of the world. The measure of justice the world is prepared to grant this nation is the measure for the acknowledgment of all true justice on earth.",
                "Once more Amalek has come; not only over us but over the whole of mankind. Will the nations understand the meaning of this lesson? Will they learn that justice as well as freedom is indivisible: that there can never be one measure of justice and freedom for the use of the Jews and another for the mighty masters of the earth? Will a new period of human history open in which the watchword will be: “Hate the evil and love the good”? Or shall we again be disappointed?"

                "Remembrance and Dedication are two words which have worn dangerously thin in the course of human history; they have been used much too often and always in the same unsatisfactory way.",
                "It is unfortunately the case that in every generation there are those who have to give their lives and have, therefore, to be remembered.",
                "Unfortunately too, every generation is at least once in its life-time committed to “the high cause” that demands of us to be prepared to give our lives.",
                "The constant recurrence of these demands only proves that we do not know how to remember or how to dedicate ourselves to “the high cause”. For, surely, the purpose of the dedication should be to create a world in which no man need ever be committed to the famous high cause that necessitates our giving lives in order that future generations may live more happily.",
                "So far we have failed in this.",
                "Surely, the meaning of remembering our dead cannot be only to honour their memory and to express our sorrow and our gratitude. The purpose of remembering should be the creation of a world in which there is no remembrance of those who brought the supreme sacrifice, because there has been no necessity to die for “causes”.",
                "So far, we have failed in this. We have failed because we do not know yet how to remember, we do not know how to dedicate ourselves. Where lies the fault or the mistake?",
                "It is possible to approach this question from many angles. On this Day of Remembrance and Dedication, however, I will try to approach it through the medium of one of the simplest and plainest of words, the word Mother. We do not know how to remember, how to dedicate ourselves because we have built up a civilisation that has neglected and often even ignored the Mother.",

God spoke to Abraham: <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">*Genesis <small>XXII</small>, 2.</i>“Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering”. And Abraham rose early in the morning … eager to fulfil the command of God, and he took his son Isaac.",
                "Much has been said and written on the subject. We have been accustomed to admire Abraham. But, for the last few years, since the present tragedy of mankind began, whenever we read the story of the “Akedah”, I seldom think of Abraham; I think of somebody else, of somebody who is not even mentioned in the story, who seems to be entirely forgotten, whose share was yet the most tragic in the great drama: Sarah, the Mother.",
                "Abraham and Isaac undertook to fulfil a command of God, they dedicated themselves to a very high cause, they were heroes. But there was no command for Sarah. She was only the mother and nobody thought of her.",
                "Take your son, your only son, whom thou lovest, take Isaac, said God to Abraham. And Abraham was a great man, very great indeed; he did not waver. He rose early in the morning and took his son.",
                "And yet, I wonder, would he not have been even greater if he had answered like this: Almighty, I am prepared to do your bidding. I am prepared to offer you my son. But, you see, he is not only my son. There is Sarah too, and he is much more her son than mine. After all, I am only the father, she is the mother. Let us ask her too. Is she prepared to give her son as a burnt offering?",

                "Remembering the innumerable Isaacs who have been offered by their fathers to one or the other great cause, we must describe our civilisation as the history of “the great man” who continually commits himself to “high causes” and forgets the mother.",
                "The “great man” is hardly ever so great as Abraham was: the “high cause” is hardly ever so high and so pure as Abraham’s cause was. In the terrible drama of the Binding of the Sons and their delivering up to the “high causes”, which is being acted by the nations all through recorded history, the place of God has often been taken by some bloodthirsty Moloch and the place of Abraham by so-called great men who have been the mad servants of Moloch. And because of this, unlike the case of Abraham, there is no one to stay the hands of the fathers.",
                "And yet it seems to me that there is one thing that could check the outstretched arm, chase Moloch from his usurped throne, and call back the “great man” to normality: the remembrance of the Mothers.",
                "In these terrible years, I have often wondered whether those who are so well prepared to destroy life and happiness ever think of their own mothers. Whether, thinking of their mothers, they would still be able to destroy and to commit all the acts of brutality with which they are dishonouring human nature? Whether, bearing in their hearts a picture of their own mothers, they would not remember that the other man is also a son, a child, and his mother too wishes him to live and to be happy?",
                "Would there ever be wars if the fathers would realise that their sons are first of all the sons of the mothers? If, instead of being so eager to sacrifice their sons for their causes, they would think for a while of the mothers, and then go to them and speak like this: Mothers of our sons, there is a great cause in the world to which we have committed ourselves. We need the sons, your children, we need their lives in the interest of the great cause. Can we have them?",
                "Would the mothers, if left to decide for themselves, recognise any other high cause than the greatest and holiest of all causes, that of being a mother, of giving life and protecting life?",

And one must fear that so long as this remains so, we shall have to continue remembering generation after generation of those “who have given their lives”.",
                "The “great father” is usually so small that he does not even know how to remember his sons. He remembers them as heroes who have died for something worth dying for; thus, he is able to see some justification and sense in their tragedy. Remembering them we wish to comfort ourselves for the loss; there is always the high cause that justifies the greatest sacrifice. But, if you justify the loss, if you can find meaning in it, you are already preparing the next war.",
                "Let us, at least, learn from the mothers how to remember. The healthy instinct of the mother, if not corrupted by our masculine civilisation, does not remember glorious heroes, but children who died before their time, who died because the fathers were stupid enough to allow a world “order” to exist in which war became the readiest way to human happiness.",
                "At this moment, it certainly is an imperative necessity to gather all the remaining strength of all free men on earth to destroy the forces of darkness which threaten to engulf mankind. But let us feel horror at a world in which such a situation can arise. Let us remember the madness of previous years which has led inevitably to the present catastrophe.",
                "There are many plans for avoiding the recurrence of such a situation. There were such plans after the last war, there are such plans after every war. So far, they have been of no avail. And sometimes, one feels that they failed because they were drawn up by the fathers. Fathers are prone to commit themselves to all kinds of causes in which they forget the mistakes of the past, the tragedies of the past, and so allow the world to drift into a situation in which the sons must give their lives that Life may be possible.",

Never again should mothers be miserable because their children must dedicate themselves to one or other of the “high causes”.",

                "However, in a struggle like this, which, as it proceeds, reveals itself more and more clearly as a contest between good and evil, there is an aspect of strategy which is just as important as the military one, namely, the moral strategy of the battle.",
                "Let me try to explain what is meant by a moral strategy.",
                "In the last few weeks, this country sustained a number of military and political reverses. People went about with gloomy faces. They were disheartened by the long succession of defeats. Perplexed and bewildered, they listened to every transmission of the wireless, they bought every newspaper they could get hold of, looking for some guidance, hoping for some pleasant surprise, for a voice to tell them that, after all, things were not so bad.",
                "I venture to assert that the reason why their uneasiness was so acute was that they thought in terms of military strategy alone, they thought only of bombers and tanks, of armies and generals, but were unable to judge events by the standard of a moral strategy.",

In that terrible time of trial and suspense, while the “horsemen” of the enemy “fly as a vulture that hasteth to devour”, while they “gather captives as the sand”, “scoff at kings and princes”, “deride every stronghold”, in that time the just will live by his faith.",

In the whole record of mankind there is no nobler and more inspiring example of the sustaining and invincible power of faith than the history of the Jewish nation. Our enemies, always many and powerful, disappeared. We, always few and powerless, have survived. They went under, living by their might. We have survived, living by our faith. They relied on military strategy and were destroyed; we relied on moral strategy and were preserved.",

It is the great tragedy of our times that men and nations have lost faith in justice, in freedom, in humanity, in goodness. They do not believe any more that it does pay to be good and humane and just. The Faith of mankind is in ruins. The staggering successes of evil are due to the fact that for many long years so-called democratic statesmen were busy destroying and betraying the faith of mankind. They were stupid enough not to be concerned with moral strategy at all. To re-establish the faith of mankind in justice and democracy, in honour and human dignity, is the first condition for the victory of the just cause. Seen under this aspect, the happenings of the last few weeks mark the beginning of the epoch of justice for which the world is longing.",

For the first time, after many years of tragic disappointments during which Machiavellian heresies were current among men and nations, they have seen that a great nation was prepared to lose rather than to betray. In the field of moral strategy this is the first success of the cause of justice. For every deed of decency is a blow against the forces of evil. It encourages humanity. It must bring forth more and mightier deeds of decency all over the world and will gradually build up the invincible power of the just cause.",

In former times, in the midst of tragedies, Jews were firm, quiet and steadfast. To-day we are nervous, fidgety and doubting. Our ancestors lived by their faith and were the great masters of moral strategy. We, however, are a generation without real faith. For our ancestors Faith meant the idea of a great pattern of universal and cosmic life, devised by God and carrying a deep, though often hidden, sense. All the happenings around them, all the events of their individual lives or those appertaining to the life of the nation and of mankind, wars, epidemics, natural catastrophes, had their appropriate place in one great Divine scheme. The scheme, as they understood it, may often seem to us naive and simple. Its greatness consisted in the fact that no event was taken at its face-value, but was seen in a certain relation to the whole. A disaster did not count as such, it counted only as the part it had to play in the whole system of a life based upon Faith.",

Faith in God teaches with an iron logic that wrong-doing does not pay in the long run, that it is not the way of life but of destruction and death.",

It is certainly true to say that, in the long run, everything will depend on whether man succeeds in his own betterment or not. However, this is not enough. Such a general statement regarding the future of mankind cannot satisfy us Jews. For thousands of years, we have lived by our faith in the ultimate victory of what is good and true. And people who live by such a faith rightly demand that the historic events around them should be explained as parts in a great divine scheme which, ultimately, will bring about the victory of goodness and truth, so ardently longed for.",

                "The Psalmist seems to give the answer to such a question when he says: <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">*Psalms <small>XCII</small>, 8-9.</i>“When the wicked flourish as grass, and all the workers of iniquity spring up; it is that they may be destroyed for ever. And thou, O Lord, art on high for evermore”. The meaning of these words is not, as commonly understood, that God allows the wicked to grow mighty and powerful only for the sake of destroying them at the end that His name may be acknowledged forever. This would be neither just nor clever. It would certainly be more reasonable not to let them flourish at all than to wreak vengeance on them after they have become mighty and have been able to cause suffering and sorrow. A more careful reading of the sentence puts the matter in a different light. The Psalmist mentions two groups of people: “the wicked” and “the workers of iniquity”. And two verbs are used: of the wicked it is said that they flourish, whereas the workers of iniquity spring up, break forth, or budding out they become visible.",
                "Bearing this in mind, we notice a clear difference between the two groups. The wicked will be recognised as such at the first glance. You have only to look at him and you know: “the wicked”. What he is, he is openly. He has courage, he is a known enemy, he is a challenger. The “workers of iniquity”, however, are more modest and not so easily recognisable. They are working slowly, they are working cautiously, they are working hard but secretly, hidden from the eyes of men behind their mask of decency and civilised behaviour. They can only be seen when they “spring up” from underneath their cover.",
                "But there are times when the “workers of iniquity” do come out into the open. The success of wickedness emboldens them to lay aside their masks.

One day, another, and yet another day … One week, a second one, and still one more…. Quite so, one may say, but what is the point?

This triumph of the number enabled modern civilisation to outstrip completely the achievements of previous generations. What did they know of speed, of production, of division of labour, of efficiency in the modern sense? So far, so good. We are better mathematicians. But are we happier for it than previous generations were? Are we better for it? Are we nearer the realisation of the great purposes of human life as expressed by the prophets and the thinkers among men? Our mathematics are all right, but what of it? Has there ever lived a more unhappy and discontented generation than the present one? Our predecessors did not talk in terms of speed or tempo, but neither had they the slightest inkling of such other mathematical blessings as the bomber and the tank.

                "In a modern Russian novel I found a story told of an old kingdom which was ruled by an old king. The old king was not very efficient. His people lived quietly under him. Life had no great excitements nor great tragedies. People did their monotonous work and were content. One day, however, the young prince decided that the old muddle must cease. He thrust his father from the throne and made himself King. He then informed his counsellors that the first great task to be undertaken was to organise the country on entirely new lines. First of all, they must take stock of the realm and of everything that was therein. Consequently, a whole army of officials were sent out to count everything. They counted the cottages and the palaces, the fields and the woods, the mountains and the dales, the lakes and the rivers. Every herb, every flower, and every tree received an official stamp with a number on it. When the work was done, they reported to the King. Look, they said, here is your whole realm, properly registered in these books. There is nothing under your rule for which you cannot find its proper number. The young king was not satisfied. “All this is very well,” said he, “but where are my stars, the stars of my skies? You did not count and stamp my stars”. They decided to build a tower high enough to reach to the sky. The King himself wished to ascend it to count his stars. For many a year they worked on the tower. Thousands of people from all the provinces of the realm were torn from their homes and families and put to slave labour. At last, the tower was ready. The King, clad in his most stately robes, all majesty and grandeur, started to ascend the tower. After years of climbing, he arrived at the top of the tower. He looked round, and as he looked he burst into bitter tears…. What had happened was this: All the years of his rule this very efficient king had been growing big and heavy. When he entered the tower, he was so heavy that the tower could not bear him. With every step that the great king made skywards, the tower sank under his weight. With every step up, the tower went a step deeper into the ground. When the King arrived at the top of his tower, he was just as far from his stars as ever in his life. His mathematics were exact, only he made one grave mistake. All through his life the King had forgotten one thing: himself. He counted everything, he weighed and measured everything, but this great mathematician and organiser forgot to weigh and to measure himself. For everything in his realm he had a number by which he could tell its value, there was no number for himself to tell him his own worth in the world.",
                "In fact, this great mathematician with all his cleverness, had never tried to find out the mathematical formula by which he could have determined, say, the worth of his head, or the value of the motions of his heart, or the weight of the deeds of his hands. Foolishly enough, he had never thought of valuing this whole counting business of his which he had established in his realm.",
                "The same seems to be the trouble with this counting civilisation of ours, as well as with the individual lives of most of us. Most of us work all our life to achieve something. And we usually think we have succeeded if we can express our achievements in numbers; in numbers of pounds and shillings, in numbers of “hands” which we keep at work, in the number of the shop-windows which we own. We think we are getting on in life if the numbers over which we have control are rising. Most of us are possessed by a consuming passion for counting. Most of us are toiling all day long, to be able to sit down in the evening to count and count and count. We are so busy counting and slaving in the thraldom of the number that only very seldom does it occur to us to ask the question: What is the sense of all this counting? It seldom occurs to us that while we are busy creating sums and new numbers days and weeks and years pass, days and weeks and years of our short lives which will never come back again. And when we arrive at the end of our life’s journey and look back and draw up the great balance sheet and once more check all the accounts and are able to convince ourselves that all our life long we were good mathematicians and succeeded in piling up numbers upon numbers, then—notwithstanding all our successes—most of us do not feel very happy. Usually, we feel empty and miserable and lonely, and deep down in our hearts we know that, in spite of all our mathematical ingenuity, there was a miscalculation somewhere in life.",

But do not forget to take stock of the greatest fortune a man possesses, do not forget to count the days of your life. Did you work all day to amass new sums? Do not sit down in the evening to count the sums and numbers you made; first go into a quiet corner and say: This was one whole day of my short life. Ponder on the day, how you spent it. Was there any sense in it? And how are you to use the fruits of your toiling so that your work may not be the wasting of your days but the fulness of a life lived to some reasonable end and a satisfactory purpose?",

                "More and more we are compelled to recognise that the only thing which really matters is man himself, the fundamental thing worth counting is the days of man.",

Let us then use the great power that is in the number so as best to serve the welfare of all men and not only the interests, ambitions, and vanities of the privileged few. Let us then have more respect for the hours and days and years of human life all over the world. Let us then continually weigh and measure the true value of our endeavours.

Another opinion is: the haste meant is that in which the Glory of God left the country. And the Yalkut continues: One might think that the future redemption of Israel will also happen in haste. To exclude this idea the prophet said: “For ye shall not go out in haste, neither shall ye go by flight; for the Lord will go before you, and the God of Israel will be your rearward”.",
                "What strange discussion is this? Surely, it cannot be that the mere detail that the children of Israel were urged to leave Egypt in haste gave rise to these strange ideas. There must, we feel, be something deeper in these statements.",
                "If we want to understand the meaning of Israel’s slavery in Egypt, we must realise that their Galut, their homelessness and insecurity, did not commence when they went down to Egypt. Already their fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob lived in exile; they all were homeless.",

His son, Isaac, was also a homeless wanderer in the world. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">*Genesis <small>XVI</small>, 16.</i>“Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we”, they said to him. And so was the lot of Jacob a life of insecurity and homelessness.",

That Judaism might be possible Abraham had to leave his native land, to disengage himself from its culture and civilisation, its religions and ideals. He had to go away. The “Go away” made him the father of our people. And the same is true of Isaac and Jacob. That they might become the “Fathers” they had to live in opposition to the customs and ideas of the world around them. They had to be strangers in the world, they had to be homeless, living in lonely faithfulness to their own life-purpose. Exile made them the Fathers of our people.",
                "The stay of our ancestors in Egypt was only the logical continuation, it was an inevitable step towards the firm establishment of Judaism and the creation of a people that was destined to become the People of God. In the hard school of Egypt a nation was moulded that was to be different from all the other nations of the world; a nation that in the dark hours of slavery had learned to look for the real value and the true purpose of life; a nation that had learned humility and had rid itself of the infantile diseases of nationalist vanity and lust for power; a nation that was thus well prepared for the service inaugurated at Sinai.",

                "How often did they faithlessly desert their mission! The hard shcool of Egypt did not succeed in transforming the character of the people completely. Redemption came too soon to them, before the people were ripe for the great task that was awaiting them.",
                "This is the idea to which the above quotation from the Yalkut gives expression. “The haste of Israel” indicates a premature redemption. Redemption came before its time; the people were not yet prepared for it.",

It is true that exile and suffering may have a wholesome effect on man. They may purify his nature, they may fortify his character, they may make him great, they may ennoble him, but only if they do not go beyond man’s strength to carry the burden of such an existence of pain and sorrow. When, however, the suffering that Galut implies is too hard and surpasses the human capacity for endurance, it can achieve nothing good, it will not ennoble man, it will not make him any better. On the contrary, it will make him miserable and wretched; it will be the cause of his degeneration, it will break his character, and ultimately destroy him.",
                "The Galut in Egypt was too hard, Pharaoh too cruel. And for this reason Israel had to leave the country before the appointed time. The redemption had to take place in haste. Had the Egyptian slavery lasted any longer, it would have completely broken the nation and rendered them, for all time to come, unfit for the mission for which they were destined. And God Himself had to lend a hand to such hasty redemption, otherwise He would have lost them for ever. “In haste”, remarks the Yalkut, what is meant is the haste of God. Before the date originally intended, God had to hasten to their help. He could only partly achieve His purpose with them, because the trials of their slavery exceeded their ability to suffer.",
                "Thus, this redemption was not complete. It was a hasty salvation. Israel was saved from destruction; it was not yet mature for its mission. Hence, failure followed upon failure.

In this endeavour my mind travels back, first of all, to that Black Friday last summer when a stunned world learned the news that Paris, the centre of light in Europe, had surrendered to the forces of darkness. The following day, being a Sabbath, I had to preach in a London Synagogue, and, among other things, I said something like this to the bewildered congregants: “Do not despair; think for a while of our own Jewish life and be reassured. We ‘Asiatic’ Jews are the oldest among the nations of Europe. We have a better and a longer memory than any of them. And we Jews can say this to-day: We have known most of the great tyrants and tyrannies of the world. We have groaned under their yoke. We saw them all growing mightier and mightier. And yet, here we are to-day to proclaim that never did we see them ultimately triumphant. Here we are to-day to give evidence that as often as we witnessed their rise, we also witnessed their downfall. We knew them terrible and mighty, but there was not one among them whom we Jews have not seen down-trodden and wallowing in the dust”.",

Think of the millions of murdered Chinese, murdered because armament manufacturers all over the world wanted more profit. Think of Abyssinia, left in the lurch by the Great Powers. Think of democratic Spain, left to its fate because reactionaries all over Europe wished the “gallant Christian gentlemen” to triumph over humanity.

With the fall of darkness the London sky was glowing red and redder, not towards sunset, but towards the East; the ominous sign of the burning of the London docks.",

Now, however, this will be changed.

By violently destroying the life of a fellow man, the murderer does violence to himself, to the image of God in which he too has been created. With every perverse and vicious act a man commits, he undermines the foundations of his own life. The mass-murderer is always a human wreck. By destroying others he is destroying himself, his own soul, the essence of his own humanity. The victims have a strange and terrible power over the hangmen, a power of vengeance from which there is no escape.",

There are no armies, there is no fight or battle; there is mere butchery. We do not doubt for a single moment that the butcher nation is doomed for ever. The butchery is so unnatural that it will prove more deadly for the perpetrators of the crime than for their victims. In this unnatural bloodbath Germany is drowning herself, she is destroying the very roots of her humanity. Never again will she recover from this unnatural massacre of the Jews.",

One shudders to think of the consequences. When the ogre’s castle comes tumbling down there will be chaos the like of which the world has never experienced; chaos in which Europe itself will disappear, never to rise again. The innocent blood of the massacred European Jewries undermines the very foundations of the whole of Europe. It is spreading a moral pestilence all over Europe from which there can be no recovery.",

                "What is the rightful place of the Jew in the world? Where do we Jews belong?",
                "There are various Jewish replies to this most controversial question.",
                "We are, of course, the loyal citizens of the State in which we live. There are Jews who even maintain that in England they are English, in America American, in Ireland Irish, just like any of their non-Jewish fellow-citizens, differing from them only in the matter of religious persuasion. However, if we are sincere we must admit that there is one important condition to our loyalty to the State, a condition that has been sharply illustrated by the Jewish experience of the last few years. We are loyal citizens, if the State deserves loyalty. Nobody had a right to expect loyalty of Russian Jewry to the barbarous regime of the Tsar, which endeavoured by means of pogroms and persecution to divert to the Jews the popular wrath aroused by its mismanagement and corruption. Has anyone the right to expect of German Jewry loyalty to the gigantic gangster organisation that calls itself the Third Reich?",
                "We are loyal, but as Jews we cannot accept such a maxim as “right or wrong, it is my country”. However patriotic Jews may be, they must never allow the difference between right and wrong to be blurred by slavish subservience to the egoism and egotism of the State. Whatever the flag which we may wish to serve in loyalty and devotion, for a Jew right must remain right and wrong must remain wrong. This is but one aspect of the complicated position of the Jew. In spite of his patriotic duties, which he may wish to discharge to the best of his abilities, he cannot but recognise certain moral standards which at all times remain independent of the State. In reality, of course, the only way of serving the true interests of a State is by adhering to independent moral standards, be it even by denying loyalty to the forces temporarily in authority. But centuries will pass before the nations will have realised and acknowledged this principle. Until then our loyalty as citizens must remain conditional. As a consequence, the Jew, however conscientious a citizen, will remain an outsider. Citizenship does not give the full reply to the quest for the rightful place of the Jew in the world.",
                "Another and more radical answer is that of a Jewish nationalism, which at least has the merit of a delightful simplicity. Like others, it says, we are a nation. Like others, we have a place in this world—Eretz Israel. We have lost it owing to misfortune and the superior force arrayed against us at a certain moment of our history. But misfortune and force are not valid arguments against the right of a nation. Once more we are claiming our own “place in the sun”.",
                "This certainly sounds most reasonable. But is this all we have lived and suffered for during two thousand long years of exile and persecution? Can this be a justification for the misery of our life in Exile? Let us assume we shall be very lucky. One day, who knows, we may get our own independent Jewish State. What then? How far shall we be then? If we are not careful, we might be striving for the kind of “happiness” under which all mankind is crushed to-day. One day we too might be in the position of poisoning our youth with the curse of nationalism. The time may even come when we shall be a “proud” and warring nation, driving along victoriously with our own mechanised armies. Naturally, never wanting war, but always prepared to defend the frontiers of our sacred heritage.",
                "If so, if the Jewish happiness of the future lies in such or similar conditions, I say “No” to this future and this happiness. If this be the place allotted to us in the world, let us rather have no place at all.",
                "I say this in no pacifist mood towards the present conflict in the world. After human wickedness on the one hand and human stupidity on the other have pushed mankind into the abyss, there is nothing else left but to fight the struggle out to the bitter end. But Jews should not be blind to the facts. It is enough for us to suffer from human wickedness and stupidity, but what reason can we have for identifying ourselves with them by planning the Jewish future on lines that have led the nations into the present chaos?",

We Jews are like the remnants of a species that, according to all scientific reasoning, should have completely died out long ago, but which in some mysterious way still manages to survive. We have no part of our own in the realities of life. We are admitted to a share with the nations in what is theirs. We are allowed to help them, or even to give our lives for the kind of world which they have built, but nowhere in the world is there a piece of life of which we Jews can say that it is ours, over which we as Jews have control. We do not belong here.",

All the time we have suffered incredibly; thank God, we have not inflicted similar sufferings on others. We have been slaughtered and killed; thank God, we have been no murderers or killers. Like our father, Jacob, we have often prayed to God: <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">*Genesis <small>XXXII</small>, 12.</i>“Deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau”.

There have always been Jews who, overawed by the prospect of a life in loneliness, try to break out of the isolation by all kinds of assimilation, be it religious, national, cultural, or social. But surely, the culmination of Jewish history, the purpose of the Jewish tragedy, cannot lie in fraternisation with the world as it is.",

We are alone because—in the sphere of western civilisation anyway—we are the only grown-up nation, having done with most of the futilities of national existence thousands of years ago.",

We Jews are alone in our misery, so is He in all His might and Glory. There is no place for us, neither is there any for Him. The system of living in the world has been devised without us, neither has God had much say in it.",
                "God in all His Might and Glory is patiently waiting for the New Man to deliver Him from His loneliness by making Him the corner-stone of human life. God is waiting for the company of a mankind to come. Can it be our task to-day to go out and fraternise with life as it is, to accept life as it is, and thus to augment the solitude of God?",

It was the period in which the greatest teachers of Israel lived and brought up numberless pupils; the epoch in which Sh’mayah and Abtalyon, the great Hillel and Shammai were the recognised national authorities; the time of Rabbi Jochanan ben Zakkai, who in spite of all his greatness was only the least among his colleagues and friends. If there ever lived a generation worthy of the land, it was this one. But yet, the Temple was destroyed and Jerusalem lost. Why?—Because of the sins of the nations around Jerusalem. Because in a world in which barbarous Rome was mistress, in the midst of states ruled by force and crime and intrigue, no state could exist that was striving to become the Kingdom of God on earth, to be governed by the rule of the Torah.",

The nations have not yet been able to cede equality to the Jew, who is claiming nothing but his right to live. Just as in the past the world was morally not ripe for a Jewish State, so in the present the nations have not yet grown up so far as to recognise and to accept the existence of the Jewish nation.

                "The Bible has had a more profound influence upon the development of humanity than many a great empire. The Revelation of Sinai and the moral code emanating from it have been among the greatest civilising factors on earth. Can one express this in numbers? How much the Bible?

What productive capacity “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself” or “Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger as for the homeborn”?",

The whole course of history proves that ideals which take hold of people are much more powerful than guns, tanks and aeroplanes. There is good reason for saying that the potency of Judaism has been vindicated even by the present world conflagration.",

It is only to be expected that every Jew should serve the just cause conscientiously and to the best of his abilities. But the lion’s share of the Jewish contribution to the war effort lies in a different sphere altogether; and again this contribution cannot be evaluated by numbers and statistics because it is of a spiritual nature.",
                "Every student of British history and civilisation knows of the influence which the Bible has had upon the development of the British national character. Some time ago, one of the foremost thinkers in this country had the courage to state publicly that without this biblical influence upon the formation of the national character the brave people of this island would hardly have possessed the endurance and moral courage needed to meet the challenge of the fateful summer of 1940 and of the dangerous winter that followed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">* Cf. the article by E.

Soviet Russia is of course not a Jewish country as our enemies pretend; but it is the fact that she came into existence as the world’s answer to the stirring message of a Jew. The Jew was not a faithful Jew and his message not a Jewish message, but neither the man nor his message is conceivable without the impact of Judaism upon the destinies of men. The dreams of a homeless Jewish fugitive have taken shape in a great state and in powerful armies that spell death and destruction for the enemies of mankind. This is another instalment of the Jewish contribution to the war effort.",
                "Or think of Christianity. The new German paganism hates it, because, if true to itself, Christianity must be a dangerous stumbling-block across the path to world domination. Nazi philosophy sees in Christianity just another means by which Judaism has influenced the life of man. There is no reason why Jews should not accept the accusation. It is the fact that Christianity is one of the ways in which the spirit of Judaism has exercised its power over mankind. We are glad to learn that to-day this emanation of the Jewish spirit is reckoned an obstacle of some magnitude in the calculation of the enemies of humanity. This too is a Jewish contribution to the war effort.",

                "(1) “Malchiyot” or Kingship, meaning the Kingship of God, the acknowledgment of God’s sovereignty in the Universe, as we express it in our prayers,",
                "(2) “Zichronot” or Remembrances, both of the world and of Israel before God,",
                "(3) “Shofarot” or Trumpets, concluding with the time when the trumpets of the Messiah will announce that God’s Kingdom on earth has been firmly established among men.",

Sifré ib.</i> it ought to be the reverse. It should begin with the prayers which are called “the Trumpets”, continue with “Remembrances”, and conclude with the expression of the idea of God’s Kingship. Without entering into the question why we have not adopted the biblical order, I should like to point out the special significance of each of the arrangements mentioned—the traditional one of Kingship, Remembrances, Trumpets, and the reversed biblical order of Trumpets, Remembrances and Kingship.",
                "<b>1</b>",
                "The order with which we are familiar conforms to the history of Judaism. Judaism began with “Malchiyot”, with the conception that God is God, that He is the Sovereign Ruler of the world, the Kings of Kings, and that man’s task is <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">*Cf. the “Aleynu” prayer.</i>“to build the Kingdom of God on earth”. “Kingship” was the beginning of Jewish history. All our historic experiences as a nation, all our memories, our “Zichronot”, are but the consequences of the one central thought—God. And it is on account uf their absorption in this one thought that Jews are still waiting on all the highways of the world for the day when the messianic Trumpets will sound to spread the tidings that the homeless nation, the wandering Jew, has found home at last.",
                "This order—Kingship, History, Fulfilment—is the symbol of Judaism.",
                "But not everybody is ripe for the Way of Judaism; there must be a prior way too, a way leading to Judaism. And this other way to Judaism must not start with “Malchiyot,” with the realisation that God alone is our Lord and has a claim on man’s whole life, that He matters more than wealth or comfort or success. How many of us would be able to understand this? How many of us can start with “Kingship”?",
                "Consider, for example, the “modern” Jew. What does he know of God, what of God’s Kingdom on earth? This Jew of to-day is incapable of beginning from the idea of God. He does not realise what the consequences of this word must be for the life of man, in his business or profession, in his thoughts and his deeds, in his behaviour towards his fellow-men. He does not know it; he is morally and spiritually asleep. Before he can even start with Judaism proper, he must be driven out of his indifference, his conscience must be stirred. And therefore this other way back to Judaism must follow a different order. At its inception we find “Shofarot”—Trumpets, or such “sounds” as might awaken the hearts and minds of men.",
                "But what are these “Sounds”?—They might be anything that would serve the purpose. To-day, they are the mighty sounding of the voice of History, the voice of God speaking to us through tremendous historic happenings. All the disappointments of men, all the tragedies, the terrible sufferings of the last few years, they are God’s own “Trumpets” calling us; forcibly opening ears that did not want to hear.",
                "Surely, in the last few years History has been a terrible but efficient schoolmaster. What has it tried to teach the modern Jew?—I would say that those of us who have started to think have been taught “Zichronot”, they have been taught to remember; to remember many a thing the modern Jew wanted to forget for ever. It was the characteristic sign of the modern Jew that he was a person without memories, a man with a suppressed past. He did not know what was behind him, nor did he want to know it. He wanted to forget. He was running away from his own yesterday. He wanted to begin a “new life”, he wiped out his memories. Thus it happened that the “modern” Jew, the descendant of the oldest nobility in Europe, the offspring of the prophets, became the typical upstart of society because he no longer wanted to continue the tradition of the generations of his people.",
                "But this belongs already to the past. To-day, the course of events is bringing us our memories back. Jews who think are beginning to remember; and will have to go on remembering, for History will not allow them to forget.",
                "We wanted to forget our own past, we wanted to begin anew, because we wanted to escape Jewish destiny. We were tired of homelessness, of eternal wandering; we wanted so much to get home somewhere. Like little children who shutting their eyes imagine that no one can see them, we thought that if we forgot the past the world too would be prepared to forget, or at least to forgive, that we were Jews. It was a tragic mistake. In the last few years, History has taught us that the world never forgets. And whenever Jews or Jewries think they have, at last, safely escaped Jewish destiny, the world ferrets them out from their artificial anonymity, pointing with the finger at them, at the Jew. Think of French Jewry. If there ever was a Jewry without Jewish memories, if ever Jews succeeded in wiping out their past, it was they. To-day, they are on their tragic way back into the Ghetto again. The whole world is aware of the Jew as never before, because the Jew wanted to forget and make others forget him.",

                "Then there is another, perhaps even more important, reason why History is reviving in Jews long-forgotten memories.",
                "The “modern” Jew was giving up Judaism, he was gradually drifting away from it, because he thought it old-fashioned, he imagined he had found something better. There was in front of him the new and young civilisation of Western Europe. It was promising, it was alluring. Old Judaism could not compete with it. But what did this great Western Civilisation for which Jews abandoned Judaism keep of its promises? What did it bring us and the world?",
                "Every thinking man understands it to-day: it was new but inexperienced, it was young but unreliable; it was shining and beautiful to look at but foul in its very foundations. It has caused confusion, destruction and incredible suffering. It has brought bankruptcy—economic and moral bankruptcy—over the world.",
                "And for this empty bubble, this glittering shell, we have thrown overboard good old weather-beaten,reliable, eternal Judaism. For a civilisation which, while professing that it is based on a religion of love, never argues without the sword in the hand, we have jettisoned even the memories of the Jewish Way of faithfulness through the word.",

One must try to understand how all this has come about. The noble endeavours of man, human progress and enlightenment, science and philosophy, great new inventions and bold research, could have brought us deliverance from poverty and misery, an age of plenty and contentment. How could all these potential blessings turn into a curse at our hands, into an all-embracing world tragedy?",

Yes, we were progressing, but so quickly that we left God behind. We were building, but without God. Our civilisation is bankrupt because it is idolatrous. It has served the idols of selfishness, of greed, of “success”; the idols of power and might, the idols of the class or the nation. It was in this latest proud period of human progress that the conscience of the world became so enfeebled as to permit a whole nation to speak of “Sacro Egoismo”, the Holy Egoism. Well, here they are, the fruits of holy egoism.",

I look at the picture and know: this man was a Jew. Then usually comes the surprise, when my host proudly pointing at the picture says: “This was my father”.—Your father? … Unbelievable. Knowing you, I could never have guessed it. Your father? But there is no trace of him, neither in you nor in your children.

We all know it only too well. Nothing will follow, nothing will happen. Everything will remain as it was yesterday and the day before yesterday. There will be no change of ways, no change of heart or mind. We know very well that already to-morrow we shall all continue in our old ruts as if nothing had happened. There will be no new deeds, there will be nothing new.",

                "There can be no change, for our entire relationship to Judaism is fundamentally wrong.",
                "Judaism is a pattern of life; it is a way of real, everyday life. And even such holy days as Rosh Ha-Shanah and Yom Hakkippurim are but part of the pattern. In olden days, when the Jew entered the synagogue on the Day of Atonement he did not—as it were—mechanically interrupt the normal routine of his life, turning to something that belonged to an entirely different level, to something that did not truly belong to him and was above him. Yom Kippur was the climax of <i>his</i> year. The Holy Days themselves were but part of the Jewish “routine.” They were the greatest intensification of the “routine” of Judaism. They were Jewish life, everyday Jewish life, lived in its deepest and most intensified manner. They were an organic part of the Jewish Year, and, consequently, they could not fail to exercise the greatest influence upon it. Not so to-day. Yom Kippur is no longer the climax towards which the normal Jewish routine is moving, but a lonely isle in the stream of time. For Judaism is no longer the great pattern of our lives. It is no longer the rhythm determining our way of living, but an observance at the fringe of life, at its periphery. We do not live it any longer, but in the midst of our life we look at the calendar and remember that there is something to be “observed”, a Kaddish, some other Synagogue ceremony, a Rosh Ha-Shanah or Yom Kippur. Then, we interrupt ourselves; life is suspended for a while; we take leave of it; and on the door we hang up the poster: This life is closed for the duration of the Kaddish, the annual event. This life will be opened again after the ceremony.",
                "This is how Jews understand their Judaism to-day, as something that must remain outside the normal routine of their life. We have followed the example of Europe and made God and Life, or Religion and Life, two spheres apart. Here life—there the synagogue. Here life with its own laws, there the synagogue with its own ritual.",
                "Modern Jews often complain about the “ritual”. They are often prepared to accept “Religion,” they even call themselves “religious”, they only object to the “ritual”, which has no meaning for them. But the modern Jew has no right to complain or to criticise, for it is he who has converted Judaism into a lifeless ritual; the wedding-ritual, the Kaddish-reciting-ritual, the tombstone-consecration-ritual, or the ritual of the Holy Days. All that has remained of Judaism is the ritual. But it is our own fault. We have exiled Judaism from our life, we have exiled it into the ritual. This is the tragedy of Judaism to-day.",
                "Thus not even a Yom Kippur can bring about any change. Nothing new will happen, there will be no new and better deeds on our side as a consequence of this day, for even this great day is not intrinsically related to our real life. Our real life … we closed it down before we entered the synagogue, and we shall continue it to-morrow from exactly the same spot where we left off yesterday.",

                "Even this great day of Atonement is for the bulk of modern Jews but a ritual. Its real purpose, its life purpose “T’shuvah”, conveys but very little to most of us to-day. “T’shuvah” or “Return” is only possible when the heart of a man is filled with longing to relate his own individual life to the real and hidden meaning of all life on earth. “T’shuvah” is only possible when such longing has rendered our heart restless, urging it to seek a task and a place in this world so as to enable us to synchronise our individual life-pulsation with the heart-beats of the Universe. “T’shuvah” is only possible when our soul—rendered homeless by longing—is searching for the last cause, the ultimate sustaining power, God, suspecting Him everywhere, ready to meet Him at every corner, at the next turning, and to cast into Him its homeless root and find anchor in Him.",
                "Only where such longing exists can there be a realisation of our failure to reach out towards the goal of our longing; only there can men realise that they have lived away from God instead of living towards Him; that instead of coordinating their own individual life-rhythm with the rhythm of the whole of life which is anchored in God, they have disturbed the harmony of the whole, they have lived against the purpose of the whole, they have sinned.",
                "Only where this longing for God exists can there be a realisation of sin, a realisation that deepens the sense of failure and frustration, intensifies the longing and guides a man back Godwards once more.",
                "But we, the great majority of modern Jews, have no realisation of sin. We do not “believe” in sins any longer. We have no use for the word sin. Who of us thinks of himself as a sinner at the opening of the Day of Atonement?",
                "We are no sinners any longer. Only they know of sin who know of the longing for God, for identification with the Divine purpose of life as a whole, for relating oneself to the last cause and aim of the whole. But we know almost nothing of this longing. We are not sinners, this is our greatest sin. This is why Return has no meaning for us. Return … where to?—The longing is the sign-post, pointing the way. Where it is lacking all the ways are the same and all the directions lead to nowhere.",

And now and then, there are moments in our life when we do feel His patient eyes resting on us. Now and then, events occur which make us wonder whether after all there might not indeed be more things between heaven and earth than are dreamt of in the philosophy of Horatio. Now and then the veil is lifted for a short moment, a very short one, yet long enough to make us waver in our silly cocksureness and wonder whether after all we are not all the time wasting our lives, shutting our eyes to the essential issues, living in the fool’s paradise of our narrow minds and small hearts. If in such moments of our life we would pause for a while and then start to think again on new lines and not just following the old groove, if we had “curiosity” enough for the great adventure of searching the new vistas which are opened for us in such moments of grace, if in such moments we had the courage to face the gaze of the Infinite, the Unknown, the Gaze of God, the great longing would take hold of us, and it would carry us towards a fuller, greater, and better life. But unfortunately, most of us do not pause, we have not enough curiosity nor enough courage, and instead we run, run from the gaze of God.",
                "We are doing it very ingeniously. For it is not so easy to run away from God. This is what we do. We build beautiful palatial synagogues and run there into the synagogue, thinking, surely one is safe from God in a synagogue. People feel the eyes of God rest on them, they become uncomfortable, and try to hide themselves behind the recital of a Kaddish. Where can a man be safer from God than behind a Kaddish, or a prayer book, or some other religious ceremony? We are running from God, hiding ourselves in the “ritual,” in the ceremony, behind that lifeless hocus-pocus to which we, modern Jews, have degraded Judaism, our Judaism, which once was life, life before God, life consciously lived under the watching eyes of God.",

In other words, Jewish settlements as they have emerged in the various countries of the world, Jewries as they have taken shape in the course of the long centuries of our history in exile in all corners of the world, will be broken up and dissolved; Jews and Jewries will be driven out into the Wilderness of the Nations.",
                "To-day, we have reached this stage in our history. The exiles have been exiled anew. Jewries all over the world have been uprooted. Those compact enclosures of Jewish life, each with a history of its own, each with a religious culture of its own suited to its environment, each almost a separate Jewish nation of its own, with distinct traditions and institutions, have been forced open and their contents poured out, spread out all over the world.",

This is a misinterpretation of Jewish history. This would be true if the breaking up of the great historic Jewries were only a matter of migration, a matter of geography, of “whither”, where to go, where to find a new home. Thank God, these questions and problems do not exist for the English and American Jewries. Materially at least and for the time being they are settled. And yet they too live in the wilderness. In fact, this tragic process of the breaking up of historic Jewries, of the disintegration of Jewish settlements, of banishment from the homes which Jews have found in the countries of the world and which in some cases they have inhabited longer than the present occupiers, into the homelessness of a new Exile, into the Wilderness of the Nations, started with the ancestors of those Jews who to-day constitute the bulk of the American and English Jewries. The tragedy began sixty, eighty, a hundred years ago, with the great migrations of Jews from Russia, Poland, Rumania towards the West; it has culminated in our days in the breakdown of all the continental Jewries.",

                "It is true that the material position of the Jewries in the Anglo-Saxon world is, thank God, much sounder than that of their brethren elsewhere. But this process of disintegration of the historic Jewries presents not only a problem of migration, of Jewish politics and economics; it involves a spiritual crisis of the first magnitude.",
                "The disintegration of individual Jewries means in fact that Judaism is disintegrating. The shifting of the “Jewish Geography” brings in its wake the disorganisation of the spiritual structure of Judaism. It is a mistake to think that Judaism can be transported—as it were—from one country to another. Judaism is not a book or a library which you may carry with you from one place to another. Judaism is not a mere theoretical system, a compilation of ideals and beliefs. Judaism is life lived by Jews, it is a system of purposes and intentions, carried into realisation by living Jewries. The great Russian Jewry, with its own history, its own traditions, its Russo-Jewish propensities and idiosyncrasies, it was Judaism. In its dissolution Judaism also dissolves. Polish Jewry, German Jewry, in all their activities, their communal organisations and religious-cultural institutions, their particular style of thinking and living, represented various historic shapes of living Judaism. In their disintegration Judaism goes under, in their disappearance Judaism disappears.",
                "One cannot replant the Judaism of one country in the soil of another. Every Jewry is unique. The shape that Judaism takes in the various Jewries is always “locally” determined.

Stop talking of English or American Jewry. There is no such thing as yet. There are Jews in these countries, but these countries have not yet become homes to new Jewries; they are still part of the Wilderness of the Nations into which Jews have been driven. There is no positive manifestation of Jewish life which could be called Anglo-Jewish. What is still Jewish with us is Russo-Jewish, Polish-Jewish or Lithuanian-Jewish; and what English, is not Jewish, is often anti-Jewish, often the jettisoning of Judaism. Jews in the Anglo-Saxon world either vegetate on the remnants of former Judaisms imported by the emigrants, or else throw even such remnants overboard. “Anglo-Jewish” is an accident in Jewish history, not yet an achievement, as Russo-Jewish, Polish-Jewish, or German-Jewish was.",

But why should this have been an occasion for devotion and worship? Two answers are given by our Rabbis in the Midrash. Rabbi Levi said that by speaking to the people about the questions their children would ask them in the future, Moses wished to convey to them “the bad tidings that a time would come when the Torah would be forgotten in Israel”. The Rabbanan however said: On the contrary. The words of Moses brought the good news that they would have sons and daughters. “And they bowed down and worshipped in gratitude for the good tidings that they would have children.”",
                "The explanation of Rabbi Levi is clear and easily understood. The children of Israel heard bad news from Moses. A time would come in the history of Israel when the Torah would be forgotten. But what did his colleagues mean by saying that it was good for them to know that they would have children? Was it such a great surprise to them that they would have children? Did they need any reassurance on this point? They were a whole nation of men, women and children. Surely, it was the most natural thing on earth for them to continue to have children. How could they have been so deeply impressed by such tidings that, as the Bible tells us, as they heard the news, they bowed down and worshipped?",

This was a great and surprising prophecy; so surprising that had they not heard it from Moses himself, they could not have believed it. Torah forgotten and yet for Jews to have children … whenever this happens in Jewish history it is a miracle.",

Of course people may say that at least we have children. It is correct to say that we do bring children into the world. We love them and work for them; it is our great happiness to see them grow up and settle down. But once they have grown up, are they still ours? Do they still belong to us? Do we really <i>have</i> our children? They fight on all the fronts, except on the Jewish front. They give their hearts to many a cause but not to the Jewish cause. They are good youths. They are intelligent, idealistic and capable of enthusiasm—but they are not ours. We do not have our children. Anglo-Jewry is gradually losing the battle for Jewish survival because it is losing its young. This, however, is the most natural thing on earth. A generation of Jews that is empty of Torah, of Jewish knowledge and culture, cannot and will not hold its youth. Children that ask and fathers who reply are not only a feature of the Seder evening but—and this is of far greater importance—also the foundation of Jewish life. On the continued discussion between the generations depends the future of Judaism. But a child will not ask unless there is a father who can reply, unless he can hope for guidance from his parents. We are losing our youth because an ignorant Jewry has nothing to offer that youth deems worth while having.",
                "It was great news indeed for the children of Israel to learn that though Torah would be forgotten their children would remain theirs. They had good reason to be grateful, to bow down and to worship.",

Judaism is a spiritual power and can survive only as such. The only weapon of a spiritual power is knowledge. One can of course not expect every Jew to be a scholar, but one can hardly imagine a more tragic situation than that which prevails in Anglo-Jewry to-day, in which the Am-ha’arets rules and “manages” the affairs of one of those very few remaining free Jewries on whose efforts and achievements so much depends for the future of Israel.",

It is a tragic farce that in the midst of a war in which the Jewish nation has suffered more than imagination can conceive and in which all the free nations are in arms for freedom and democracy, the structure of Anglo-Jewry should be closely related to that of totalitarian communities and a clear defiance of the elementary principles of democracy.",

I have high respect even for an ignorant lay leadership if it works sincerely. If such lay leaders and communal workers are sincere, they deserve our deepest gratitude. But for God’s sake, let them be more modest and cautious, let them be advised by those few still in our midst who do have substantial knowledge of Judaism; let them not “run” Judaism as one runs a business concern; let them not tramp about within its delicate framework like an elephant in a china shop.",

There is no Hebrew word for this calling. One thing however is certain: A Jewish Minister of Religion is not the spiritual leader of his congregation. He and his office have been produced by the vision of the Am-ha’arets, and the Am-ha’arets does not ask for spiritual leadership. All he wants is an official, whom he pays and who has to give him service. This administrative official has to entertain him at his wedding or Bar-Mitzvah celebrations and to lend soothing decorum to his mourning in his hour of sorrow. He has got to; that is his job, it is what he is being paid for. In his sermons his task is not to teach what Jews should learn but to preach what they like listening to. In general there is one golden rule laid down for him: in everything and always and at all costs the minister has got to please. And woe unto him should he not come up to the expectations of the moneybags that rule his congregation.",
                "In such circumstances ignorance must become rampant within the Ministry itself.

                "Naturally, this commandment, which was the expression of the gratitude of the people for the good land which God gave them, could only be fulfilled in the land, after Israel had taken possession of the land. As the Talmud remarks: “The commandment of the First Fruits was not binding before the land had been conquered and divided among the tribes of Israel”. In view of this, the comment in the Midrash is rather surprising: “Do this commandment, for in the merit of its fulfilment you will enter the land”. The question is rightly asked: How could the observance of this commandment help the Israelites to enter the land if the prior condition of the “First-Fruits” was the possession of the land? How could the Israelites fulfil the commandment of the “First-Fruits” outside the land and before its conquest?",
                "This is not merely an academic question, concerning a practice which has been in abeyance for thousands of years. The answer to it contains a deep significance for ourselves at the present moment.",

                "Nations have laws and statutes, they have their moral codes and customs, religious and social traditions, which are often based on a more or less sound sense of fair-play and equity. But in critical periods, like wars or other great upheavals, they are prepared temporarily to suppress their sense of justice and fairness, to suspend their own moral codes; they allow themselves to act and to behave as the needs of the moment dictate without considering right or wrong, good or evil. A certain aim must be achieved at all costs, and to this one aim everything must be subordinated. And thus, it often happens that people or nations who sincerely strive to establish the rule of justice and humanity on earth adopt the methods of that evil against which they are struggling. The dictates of conscience and the moral sense are overridden or ignored until the return of more normal circumstances may afford us leisure to attend to them. As one so often hears people say in these days: Let us first win the war, afterwards we shall deal with such luxuries as social justice and a better chance for all, etc., etc.",
                "This brings us back to the old controversy: do ends justify means or not? Are we allowed to put on one side justice and truth and humanity for a while, until we have created the circumstances—never mind by what means—in which these ideals may be established as the governing force in national as well as international life, or are we not allowed to do so?",
                "It is a problem with which every nation is confronted in times of peril, the problem which Israel had to face for the first time when it was girding on its strength for the conquest of the promised land. It was a critical moment. It was war. The land had to be conquered, the future of the people was in the balance, for everything depended on the success of this martial undertaking. At the same time, there were heavy handicaps under which Israel was labouring. There was the Torah, there were commandments, the heavy burden of laws and statutes, there was a definite way of life prescribed by God. Should they not postpone all this—Judaism, the Law, the commandments of God—until after victory and conquest? Just as the commandment of the First-Fruits depended on the peaceful possession of the Land, was not the whole of the Torah obligatory only in normal times, in times of peace, but not in times of a great national emergency?",
                "The answer of Judaism, however, is: “… fulfil this commandment … ”, yes even this commandment of the First-Fruits, of which you think that it can only be fulfilled after the conquest of the land, fulfil it now, even now whilst you are preparing for the conquest. It is true there is no land, no temple, no first-fruits as yet. But this commandment is not a mere formality, some superstitious ritual which is to be performed with a basket, some fruits, and a priest in a temple. There is sense in it, there is a purpose behind it. Offer the first-fruits of your land as a symbol of your acknowledgment of God as the supreme Lord over the land on which we live as tenants only. As He said: <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">* Leviticus <small>XXV</small>, 23.</i>“… for the land is mine; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me”. The idea, the intention of the commandment is eternal. There may be no land, no temple, no fruits, the symbols may wither away; the principle remains. And because of this: fulfil it now! Now is always the right moment. Show it now, without fruits, without the land, before the conquest, yes at this critical hour prove that you are prepared to accept the sovereignty of God. Now is always the right time. For ends do not justify means. Truth must not be shelved, morality not deferred, and God cannot be postponed until the danger has passed and the emergency is over. Laws and statutes, moral codes and ideals, are no mere luxuries with which one may dispense in times of danger. On the contrary, they are the life-blood that sustains us during the battle and gives us strength and perseverance until the very end.",
                "Now is the right moment; in the merit of Now will you inherit the land. Evil cannot be fought with its own methods; evil is contaminating. And the Promised Land cannot be conquered without keeping alive those very ideals to which we intend to dedicate it after we have taken possession.",

                "The Jewish nation and our communities are confronted with innumerable tasks to-day. All the old foundations of Jewish life have disappeared. We have to rebuild Judaism, both materially and spiritually, all over the world. All over the world, I say, and not only in Poland or Germany or Rumania; here too, in this country and in America and in Australia—everywhere. There is chaos everywhere, and not only in the occupied countries of Europe. There is chaos here and in America. There is chaos in our communal organisations, chaos in our religious life, in Jewish education, in our national aspirations, chaos in the heart and the mind of the modern Jew, chaos or emptiness. Wherever you turn, there is always the same lack of principle, the same lack of knowledge and humility. But when you point in detail to the sore spots in Jewish life, when you suggest certain remedies, when you ask for something that should be done, the usual answer is: there is a war on, we must wait, first we must conquer the promised land, then we shall offer “First-Fruits”. Jews think that Judaism can hibernate for the duration. We postpone Judaism, and do not realise that from Judaism alone can we derive the strength that we need to survive and to enter the promised land.",
                "Most of these “there-is-a-war-on” replies, when urgent and vital tasks of Jewish life demand our attention, are but the excuses of laziness and self-indulgence, of irresponsibility and indifference. Now, if ever, is the time for deepening Jewish consciousness, for spreading Jewish knowledge, for safeguarding traditional Jewish life, and for planning and preparing the Jewish future with all our remaining spiritual and material resources. Now and not to-morrow!",
                "In these days of Elul let us remember the old Jewish word <i>T’shuvah</i>. What is needed is repentance and return; return to God and His word all over the world. And the very essence of repentance and return is “Now”. Return cannot be shelved. He who returns to-morrow has not returned. Repentance to be carried out in the future is no repentance. The man who returns cannot postpone the change of his ways until to-morrow. He is urged to act now. “Now” is the secret of life, it is the safeguard of to-morrow."

                "T<small>HE</small> story of David and Jonathan offers us one of the most noble examples of comradeship in world literature. Many circumstances in the lives of these two men seemed to conspire to keep them apart. There was first the difference of social status—Jonathan, a prince, loved by the King and the people; David, only the youngest son of a humble family in Israel, the keeper of his father’s sheep. Then later there were the opposing ambitions of the two men, which normally should have made them enemies for life. Jonathan was the crown prince, entitled to the succession to the throne; and David an unknown adventurer, emerging from the common herd and grasping at kingship in Israel. And lastly, there was the bitter hatred of Saul, his warnings to his son against David, the menace to the dynasty.",
                "Yet all this could not separate the two men. The spirit of comradeship in which they were united triumphed over differences of social status and personal ambitions, as well as over dynastic interest and <i>raison d’état</i>.",
                "I use the word “comradeship” intentionally. David and Jonathan were united in comradeship and not only in friendship. It is important to remember that David and Jonathan met on the battle-field. At the critical moment in the history of Israel, when Goliath challenged the armed might of Saul, in the battle with the Philistines the prince and the shepherd became friends for life. Comradeship, born in the hour of danger and uniting men in despite of all divisions and boundaries that would ordinarily separate them, is one of the redeeming and encouraging by-products of that evil thing war. This fine spirit which has the moral power to overcome differences of social status, of religion and race, is a surprising phenomenon in our world, which is torn with hatred and prejudice and in which people and nations find it so very difficult to understand each other.",
                "The comradeship of the trenches and the battle-field requires an explanation. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">*Mishnah Abot <small>V</small>, 16.</i>Jewish tradition offers us one. The comradeship of David and Jonathan was lasting because it was “Love that did not depend on Thing”. And the same dictum continues: “Whenever Love depends on Thing, with the passing of that Thing Love too passes away; but when Love is not dependent on Thing, it will not pass away for ever.”",
                "What is this “Thing” on which so much stress is laid in this saying of our Masters, upon which so often Love does depend and upon which Love should not be dependent?",
                "The Thing is social status, business and profession, money and material success. The Thing is not the person, it is not the man. And this is not self-evident. Unfortunately, there is great need for stressing this point, for the Thing is very often mistakenly thought of as the person. In times of peace a man is judged not so much by what he is as by what he has. The Thing, be it money or social influence, position or possession—the Thing, which one holds in his grasp, determines the status of a man on earth. In our civilisation too much depends on the Thing, too little on the person. A man is clever if he has success; he is respected if he holds office; he is trusted if he possesses securities. We have too much faith in the Thing, too little in character and personality.",
                "It is the Thing that determines human relationships too. People associate in families, societies, and organisations—so we believe. In reality, however, it is one social status that associates with another of the same level, one group of interests with another, one bank account with another bank account of a similar weight and importance; in short—one Thing with another, but not one man with his fellow men. We have built up the power of the Thing. We believed that the more of it we held in our grip the more powerful we would be. And now the Thing dominates us. It counts more than man himself. Friendship, love, honour, and influence are to-day all dependent on the Thing, on what a man has and not on what he is. The Thing has enslaved man.",
                "The Thing stands between man and man, it separates nation from nation. Thanks to ingenious inventions distances are continually shrinking in our days; the distance between one man and another does not diminish. It happens very seldom that man meets man, that one heart turns to another, that one mind reveals itself to another, that person associates with person. The Thing stands between us and renders understanding between human beings almost impossible. Our associations of friendship and love are seldom lasting; they depend too much on the respect in which we hold the Thing and too little on the appreciation of the human personality.",
                "Comradeship, however, is different. It emerges in circumstances in which nothing else counts but the man, and in which everything depends on character and courage, reliability and faithfulness. Out there in the trenches a man is judged by what he is and not by what he has. There the power of the Thing, the false magic of material possession and material success is broken. There, especially in the hour of danger, man meets man. Out of this meeting a lasting understanding arises that may well be called: Love independent of the Thing. In comradeship the dignity of man triumphs over the enslaving power of the Thing.",
                "But comradeship should not be limited to service-men only. It is a message of the front line to the world. It is a programme for mankind. To-day I feel that the world is better prepared to accept the message and the programme than at any other moment in the history of man. After the last war, service-men on returning home were often disappointed. In the trenches they had learned that the standards of society are often false and meaningless. They came back with a vague conception of new values, with a deeper insight into what should really count in the world, but the world at large had little understanding for the new ideas which were born in the hours of danger at the border line between life and death. Thus comradeship had to be confined to such comparatively small organisations as the Legion. There was comradeship between ex-servicemen, there was none, or only very little of it, in the world at large. To-day, the situation is different. It is one of the things giving hope for the future that comradeship is no longer limited to ex-servicemen. This total war has pushed the front-line as far back as the bomber can reach. Wherever a bomb can drop there is the front. Men, women, and children have learned to share the dangers of the battle-field and in the hour of trial they have re-established the moral dignity of man in a great new comradeship, the comradeship of the Blitz. The comradeship of the people of London in the long, dark months of the Blitz and the same noble spirit of mutual aid in which the other communities have met the trial of fire and blast in this country are among the most encouraging portents of a better day to come for all men. The comradeship of the Blitz has restored our faith in man. It has proved that man can be good, reliable, and faithful, that he can be a comrade.",
                "Servicemen returning from this war will find a community that understands them, that understands the message of comradeship because having experienced the dangers of a total war it will have experienced the need for comradeship in its own body. Comradeship must become a programme for all mankind; it must become the great creative and progressive force on earth. Comradeship is a necessity of peace just as it is a necessity of war. Without it wars are lost; without it the peace will be lost too. Without it we are bound to fail. With it we shall overcome all the obstacles that stand in the way of world-wide understanding and harmony.",
                "Comradeship alone can turn the brotherhood of worldwide suffering of our days into the great creative brotherhood of all men and all nations, working hard but not without success for a new dawn on earth."

                "S<small>UCCOT</small> is called “the season of our joy”. It used to be a happy time of rejoicing. The hard work of a whole year done, the harvest brought in, the rich blessings of nature well garnered, man could relax. He could thank God with a contented and satisfied mind. But what is the season of our joy to-day? Where are the great harvests that used to make people happy? There is little “Simchah” left in a world in which Death has become the richest harvester. We have forgotten the meaning of joy. It is, however, important to realise that it is not only this war, with its small and great tragedies or the overpowering martyrdom of Israel in its wake, that has caused us to forget the meaning of joy. Long before its outbreak, true joy had left our hearts. Joy, happiness, harmony, contentment and peace left this world long before the present catastrophe. The generation of those born not many years before 1914 has never really known of these blessings of life. During the two decades between the two wars the world was in a fever. Many people worked, others were workless. Many fought for things which they could never achieve; for many there was success—in a sense. But the place of “Simchah” was vacant in the world. Where joy should be in the life of men there was emptiness, disillusionment and boredom. When people were not working and not busy chasing the mirages of their ambitions, they were not at peace, not happy, but bored. Mere entertainment took the place of joy, entertainment that one buys for money and that is an efficient means of killing time and making a man forget the void within him. A whole entertainment industry had to be produced in a world that, not knowing genuine joy, was bored.",

The Midrash supports Rabbi Joshua’s view by quoting the verse: “Thou gavest my heart joy”, adding the gloss that joy is wisdom, as it is said: “Be wise, my son, and my heart will also rejoice.”",

Man would no longer have to toil and to drudge from early morn till late in the evening for his piece of bread. The Machine would become his great help-mate. With its assistance the needs of all would easily be satisfied. A world of plenty was at hand. Bread for all, leisure for all, peace and contentment for all were within the grasp of man.",

Instead of securing leisure for millions, it made them workless and miserable; instead of creating a world of plenty, it has produced slums in a world of artificially manufactured scarcity. To crown all, in the present war the ingenuity of the human mind, the great achievements of science and progress, have had to be devoted to producing weapons of destruction.

                "The Midrash quoted above seems to provide the explanation of these contradictions. According to Rabbi Eliezer the source of wisdom is the head, according to Rabbi Joshua it is the heart. Both are right in a sense. There are two kinds of wisdom: that of the head and that of the heart. And this is the difference between the two: with our head or intellect we create the practical means of living, with the heart we conceive the values of life.",

Of the values of life we know with our heart, and if the heart does not know of them, our intellect is never able to create them for us. On the other hand, the practical means of living are devised by the wisdom that has its source in the head. When man first produced a piece of bread, he did it with his brains and not with his heart. When the first machine was invented, man consulted his intellect and not the wisdom of his heart. But if man wants to know what to do with the bread, so intelligently produced, whether he should eat it himself or offer a piece of it to a fellow-man who is hungry, he must ask his heart. Once one has the machine, devised by human ingenuity, and wishes to know the purpose for which to use it, one has always to turn to the heart. We use the machine for a purpose that we desire, that we wish to see achieved in life, and we desire and wish and aspire with our hearts.",

Next comes the turn of all mankind in the same way. All the deeds of all the individual beings of all nations are added together, and judgment is passed on all of them as one unit; for better or worse all share in the same sentence.",

Whether it is just or not, we are witnessing day by day how the sins of individuals do affect whole groups, how the crimes of small groups are visited on nations, or even on the whole world. The innocent, the righteous, are punished together with the guilty. And the guilty, though on much rarer occasions, often benefit from the good deeds of the righteous.

                "In the same way, people may be relatively guiltless as a nation, as the Czechs were in the critical days of 1938 and 1939, as the peoples of Norway and Denmark were in 1940, as we Jews have been guiltless <i>as a nation</i> for the last 2,000 years, and yet they cannot but be involved in the guilt of the world around them.",
                "We all live our own life in this threefold capacity—as individuals, as members of nations, and as members of mankind.",
                "Individuals may be innocent, but theirs is also the destiny of their nation. Nations may be innocent, but theirs is also the destiny of humanity.",
                "Our old traditions are right. We are judged as individuals, we are judged as nations, we are judged as mankind; and happiness or suffering, good or bad fortune, are the balance in hand that remains after the various destinies which are ours have found their equilibrium.",

                "Judaism sees mankind as one organic unit, constituted by the smaller units of the individual personality, the nation, etc., whose own life purposes must be in harmony with the purpose of the whole. And if this is so, the basic principle of all human relationships, of social, national, international, universal relationships, must be common responsibility. Being a constituent part of the whole makes me responsible for the whole; it makes whatever I do affect my fellow-men, the nation, the whole of mankind. The good that I do is to the benefit of all, the evil that I perpetrate is to the disadvantage of all.",
                "And because of this, owing to the common responsibility in which we are bound to each other, ultimately we are all responsible for all the guilt, for all the sin in the world; just as we have a right to claim a share in all the merits of the world. In other words: National-Socialism and Fascism became possible owing to the common guilt of mankind, owing to the evil that is in man—in all of us. But, on the other hand, Roosevelt, Lease and Lend, the awe-inspiring heroism of the common people all over the world, are due to the goodness that is in man, in us, in every one of us.",
                "Whether I shall have a good year or not does not depend on me alone, whatever my merits may be; it depends on you too. Whether we all together in this Synagogue shall have a happy New Year does not depend on us alone, whatever our merits may be; it depends on the next congregation, the next and the next. And whether we in all our congregations shall have peace and happiness in the coming year does not depend on our congregations alone, but also on what is being preached at this very moment in that church there across the road, and the next one, and the next. And so on, until the circle has been closed and all share in the destiny of all. In a deep and secret sense, all our neighbours, all our fellow-men, all mankind, are in us, and we are in them. As every cell of the human body in a mysterious way carries the mark of the whole personality and is in its own turn represented in the personality of the whole, so is the whole of mankind mirrored in every one of us and every one of us is depicted in the canvas of the whole.",

                "In the life of the individual or the community or the nation it means that every one of us is the keeper of his brother. The sorrow of the brother, his pain, his hunger, his agony, his lack of happiness, his lack of freedom, his lack of friendship, his loneliness, accuse us and make us guilty.",
                "In the life of the nations, in international relationships common responsibility means that neutrality is immoral, that non-interference is guilt and isolation a crime; for they all represent various forms of the refusal to shoulder common responsibility, they all are artificial attempts at splitting the organic unity of mankind.",
                "The terrible tragedy of this war has come upon us because people and nations refused to acknowledge in their actions the principle of common responsibility; because artificial barriers were erected between man and man, between one nation and the other; because individuals, groups and nations thought of themselves as independent, sovereign, self-contained units. There is no happiness, no peace, no comfort in this world because everyone thought only of himself, of his own happiness, of his own peaceful and comfortable life; because people and nations lived in the Cain-attitude of “Am I my brother’s keeper.”",
                "“Yes, you are the keeper of your brother!” This is the message of Rosh Ha-shanah to-day to this tortured world, the message of the Day of Judgment on which we stand before our Heavenly Father as individuals, as nations, and as one humanity.",
                "“You are the keeper of your brother” is the great message of God that reaches us through the catastrophes of our days. In all the awe-inspiring events around us one truth is illustrated again and again: the interdependence of all life on earth. This war is one terrible object-lesson in the theory and practice of common responsibility. And it can have but one end: a deepened sense of unity, of brotherhood, and at least the beginnings of a New World based on the realisation of common responsibility.",
                "The ephemeral new lords of unhappy Europe who deny all this will be overthrown. And terrible will be the plight of those who stand in the way of the intentions and purposes of God.",

And yet a little while, and the wicked is no more; yea, thou shall look well at his place, and he is not. But the humble shall inherit the land, and delight themselves in the abundance of peace” (Psalms xxxvii, 9-11)."
