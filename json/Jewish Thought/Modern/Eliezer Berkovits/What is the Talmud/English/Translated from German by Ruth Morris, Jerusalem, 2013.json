            "Not long after Hitler’s coming to power in Germany, the Nazi government asked Rabbi Avraham Yehoshua Heschel to prepare a book explaining the Talmud. The object was to preserve a document which would describe the source of those characteristics which, in the Nazi mind, dictated the necessity for the annihilation of the Jewish people. Heschel declined the request, and recommended giving the assignment to Rabbi Eli Ladislau Berkovits, later world-renowned as Rabbi Prof. Eliezer Berkovits, then a communal rabbi in Berlin. The two young rabbis, in their twenties, were both in Berlin at that time, and on friendly terms.",
            "The result of Berkovits’ work was published in 1935, entitled “Was ist der Talmud?” It was Berkovits’ first book, except for his doctoral thesis on the subject of Hume. The book, published by Erwin Löwe Jewish-Book Publishers, Berlin, is said to have been burned immediately upon its publication. Several copies nevertheless survived, and the book was published a second time by Ner-Tamid Publishers, Frankfurt am Main, in 1963.",
            "In the two publications in German, two appendices written by Berkovits were excluded: Chapter VII, Was steht in Talmud? (What is written in the Talmud?), and Chapter VIII, Was steht nicht in Talmud? (What is not written in the Talmud?), were omitted at the suggestion of the publisher. Chapter VII is a selection from the many ethical and moral principles discussed and enunciated as law in the Talmud. Chapter VIII contains a refutation of accusations hurled at the Jewish people by the non-Jewish world throughout history, ostensibly on the basis of the Talmud. The publisher argued that their inclusion would arouse the anger of the Nazi censor, and would result in the immediate incarceration of both the author and the publisher in a concentration camp.",
            "The original typescript of the book has been discovered among Eliezer Berkovits’ papers. Thus the two missing chapters could be included in the present English language edition, published for the first time. A Hebrew first-time translation of the book is soon to be released. This too will include the two missing chapters.",

                "<b><i>1. Bible and Talmud</i></b>",
                "Letters and complete words are symbols which must be interpreted and explained. Reading always involves interpretation and explanation of the written material. However, we are not always aware of this, because today reading has become a universal everyday occurrence — an activity which, because we are so practiced at it, poses no difficulty for us whatsoever.",
                "But this soon changes when the written text is not straightforward, or if it is a “symbol” of some chain of reasoning, an expression of connections with which the reader is unfamiliar or which, because of their complexity and profundity, cannot be readily grasped at first sight. Then we no longer talk about reading, but about research, studying, learning. To read is to explain, to read means to learn.",
                "All written material requires a commentary. The first reader is always also the first commentator. The Bible is the written teachings (the so-called Written Law, or <i>Torah Shebichtav) </i>of Judaism — the Book as compendium. That is why it is inconceivable without commentary. Like any teachings, it must also be explained, and as everywhere, in the case of the Bible as well, explanation begins with reading. To read the Bible is always to explain the Bible. However, to explain the Bible means to study the Bible. The process of studying and its outcome are designated by tradition in the language of the Bible by the word Talmud. (Lamod = Heb. learn; “Talmud” is an abbreviation of Talmud-Torah study of the Torah.)",
                "The Talmud begins with reading the Bible. The first Jew to read the Bible was the first Talmudist. Indeed, it might even be said: Talmud is simply the special way in which for thousands of years the Jewish people read — and are still reading — their Bible . Since Talmud is <i>reading</i>, it is essentially <i>oral teachings</i>.",
                "Irrespective of the way that the Bible is read, the reader will always encounter major difficulties in it. “Questions” will be asked. Asking questions is the dynamic strength of the Talmud. It is an integral part of the text. The Bible is text — but above all, it is teachings (<i>Torah</i>); yet answers are part of teachings. The provider of the text left questions unresolved. The provider of the Teachings must also have provided the answers. The Talmud consists of question and answer. From all of this it follows: The Jewish people received the Talmud together with the Bible. Written and oral teachings cannot be separated from each other. Both come from the same source. The Talmud is as old as the Bible itself.",
                "This can be shown clearly by the following discussion. Moses was undoubtedly the first reader of the Bible in the world. When he reached the place in the Torah where it directs that in the case of a divorce, “He shall write her a bill of divorcement,” (Deut. 24:1) he must have asked: What is a bill of divorcement? How is it written? What should its contents be? The question must have been answered, because the Bible’s rules were to be valid laws. Moses could not just teach the text of the law; at the same time he had to provide the explanation of the law, the “implementing regulations.” But who taught Moses the explanation; who provided him with the implementing regulations? The same authority which gave him the Law, God himself. The “Halachah le-Moshe mi-Sinai” — the Oral Teachings (the Oral Law or <i>Torah Shb’al Peh</i>) transmitted to Moses at the source of Sinai — is not a dogma, but historical necessity, that is, historic truth. Oral Teachings must have been provided together with the Written Teachings. Moses taught the law, and consequently he had also to teach its explanation and application. Moses was the first Talmudist."

            "2 The Talmud and the life of the nation": [
                "<b><i>2. The Talmud and the life of the nation</i></b>",
                "For the Jewish people, the Bible was never a historical document which belonged to the past. The people always saw it as the eternal book, transcending time, of the eternally valid “Teachings.” The Jewish individual read the Book of Teachings (<i>Sefer Torah</i>) from a dual standpoint: as a book, and as teachings. And this means that the person was seeking for an answer to two questions. First of all to the question: What does the book, the word, the text, mean? And then: What does the teaching want, what does it demand of the person? Jewish individuals are not satisfied with understanding the <i>text</i>; rather, they want primarily to understand the consequences for their lives that follow from the Teachings<i>.</i> This is what constitutes the special nature of the Jewish reading of the Bible, and hence the very essence of the Talmud. This double formulation of the question, with which the Jewish individual approaches the Bible, is already Talmud, just as the answer identified in response to the two-part question constitutes the most comprehensive part of the Talmud. The Talmud explains the text, and also shows how the teaching is put into practice in life.",
                "a) The understanding of the text is the prerequisite for the fulfillment of the Teachings; a person who does not understand the text is incapable of comprehending the teaching. Hence there is a path that leads from word to saying, from statement to statutes, from “Sefer” to “Torah.” It is the path of philological exegesis or — in the language of the tradition — the path of <i>p’shat</i>, the “simple explanation.” One who follows this path to the end, who not only understands the words but also hears the saying that calls people, binding them, one who through the explanation of the text attains teachings which require performance in life — that person will soon find that, in addition to the “simple explanation,” there must be another one with an equal claim to recognition. The Teachings that are attained through <i>p’shat</i> play a vital role among the people; they permeate the reality of the people’s existence as a valid part of legislation, as a binding norm of Jewish social and public life, as the quintessence of the Jewish lifestyle. In this way they become a living spiritual and intellectual force, whereby the Teachings are revealed as a unified body which can then go back to the Biblical saying, so as to “interpret” the individual passage on the basis of the intellectual and substantive content of the living whole.",
                "In addition to philological exegesis, which takes the reader of the Bible from the text to the Teachings, there is also interpretative exegesis, which leads the person putting the Bible into effect from the living Teachings back to the written word. The significance of <i>d’rash</i> — “interpretation” – is equal to that of <i>p’shat</i>. <i>P'shat</i> explains the semantic meaning of a word, while <i>d’rash</i> elucidates the deeper intellectual sense. When, for example, among its provisions on civil damages the Bible, discussing the ox which in a particular case has killed a man, says: “The ox is to be stoned, and its owner is also to be put to death,” (Ex. 21:29) philological exegesis has complied with its task once it has explained a number of words. It is now in a position to translate this sentence according to its semantic meaning. However, the deeper teachings, which should define this provision in legislation as a norm, cannot be satisfied with the “literal” translation, because from the spirit of the Teachings, which is deduced from countless other passages in the Bible, and has thus become legislative practice, it emerges that “you can sentence him to death when he has killed, but not for killing done by his ox,” (Sanhedrin 15a) and therefore the interpretation which is applied is that: “The owner is also guilty of the death” means: “Monetary compensation.” The spirit of the Teachings can only require damages, which in this case are to be settled in terms of monetary value. What is deduced from the Biblical text using the method of <i>d’rash</i> is called Midrash.",
                "The fundamental difference between philological and Midrashic exegesis cannot be expounded in detail here. However, attention must be drawn to two main points in this connection. Firstly: contradictions; secondly, superfluous passages, words, letters, and so on. Contradictions cannot be resolved by philological-scientific exegesis — only recorded; however, Midrashic exegesis must resolve them, because although contradictions may be possible in a text, they are insupportable for teachings which are to be put into effect in life. The living Teachings which are the starting point of the Midrash require the elimination of contradictions arising from semantic meaning. Here too the procedure followed is that of the general Midrashic rule: semantic meaning is interpreted through spiritual meaning. (On the logical principle which applies when resolving contradictions, see Section II, 2 below.)",
                "A similar approach is also adopted to what appears from the plain sense to be superfluous. This could be an entire precept if, for example, it already follows from another passage. It could be words, letters, if they are superfluous for grammatical reasons, and so on. There is nothing that philological exegesis can do with these passages: it can take note of them or, if it has great courage and little conscientiousness, it can even delete them; the Midrash <i>must</i> interpret them. For the Teachings must be a unified whole, in which everything is necessary, sufficient and accounted for, to which “nothing may be added and from which nothing may be diminished.” The Teachings cannot contain anything superfluous; that which belongs to the Teachings necessarily belongs to them. Since according to the Talmudic premise the text of the Teachings is of divine origin just as much as the Teachings themselves, it must be just as perfect as they are. The text must in all respects be homogeneous with the Teachings, and must correspond to them. It must be possible to turn every word and every letter again into teachings. Hence the frequent Midrashic question: “What does it teach me?” The text must contain as little superfluous material as the Teachings themselves. What turns out to be superfluous according to the semantic meaning must be interpreted on the basis of the intellectual meaning of the entire system of the Teachings.",
                "Interpretation (Midrash) is a consequence of the living teachings. It is initially a compulsion to interpret — a compulsion which, however, turns into interpretive or exegetical law as a result of the fact that the interpretative possibility given in the text is not handled arbitrarily. Interpretation always grows necessarily out of the living reality of the Teachings. This necessity is for the most part logically provable (see Section II, 1, 2 below). However, even when this is not the case, when the Midrash, as often happens, does not proceed in its method with satisfactory logical necessity, even then it can be recognized as the organic evolution of the Teachings. The Midrash always possesses this <i>organic necessity</i>, which is why it is, quite simply, a truth of the living teachings.",
                "<i>P'shat</i> is Biblical exegesis as a response to the question concerning the meaning of words and text. <i>D'rash</i> (or common Midrash) is also exegesis — from the viewpoint of the other question regarding the obligatory meaning and intention of the Teachings. Since the Talmud raises both these questions, in Talmudic exegesis <i>p’shat</i> and <i>Midrash</i> exist on a par with each other.",
                "b) Talmudic exegesis is the preparation for the real subject of the Oral Teachings, which we can express as follows: putting the Written Teachings into effect in everyday life.",
                "As the standard of performance or norm for the Jewish individual, the Teachings are law, and like any statute book the Bible, too, can only contain the basic rules in an extremely concise form. However, as soon as an “instance” or case arises in real life, the wording laid down in the legal code is insufficient, and the law must be explained by means of its “implementing regulations.” Its standard of performance as specified in writing is always accompanied by the knowledge of its practical implementation as well. As with any other statute book, therefore, even for the legal teachings of the Bible a supplement in the form of this knowledge of the practical application is indispensable. And this is the source of the necessity of the Oral Teachings, which are also simply the methodology of the application and the fulfillment of the written Torah. (On the “Oral,” see Section 1 above.)",
                "Honor your father and mother, keep the Sabbath, do not covet — all these commandments are worded clearly and concisely, but without detailed explanation of the concepts underlying them, they cannot serve as a guiding principle for human behavior in the practical experience of life. Simply reading them raises countless questions. How far does the duty of honoring parents go? What if the father and mother do not deserve any honor because of their way of life? How does one keep the Sabbath? Where is the boundary between wanting, coveting, and envy? When is coveting sinful? and so on and so forth. Even such unambiguous and clear laws as the Ten Commandments are not applicable in life without “implementing regulations.” The purpose of the Oral Teachings is to explore the law’s forms of application and fulfillment. Whole sections of the Talmud and voluminous tractates are often simply the implementing regulations of a few, concise words of the Teachings. The Talmud shows how the Teachings are applied in the “given case.”",
                "Now as long as these cases were explicitly foreseen by the law-maker, the application of the law is relatively simple and self-evident. It then normally goes back to direct transmission or tradition, which at its core at least is as old as the law itself. For the provisions about its implementation must also be just as old as a law’s entry into force. The application of the law becomes a problem when “new cases” arise in the life of the people which the law-maker did not explicitly foresee. Life changes and evolves, but the law of the Teachings is immutable. The immutable teachings must always shape changeable life. The eternally valid law must also decide on the “new cases.” But how is this possible? The question is not a specific problem of the Oral Teachings, but a general problem of legal philosophy. For every code of law outlasts the circumstances of life which constituted the condition and reason for its development. No law-maker can possibly foresee the plethora of “cases” which will occur in practice. Nevertheless, it is also possible to decide new cases as well according to the older law. Not, of course, according to the subjective will of the law-maker, who can no longer be questioned, but according to the objective intellectual meaning of the law, which is ever-current. This is precisely how the Talmud proceeds, too. With the help of exegetical and strictly logical rules, the intention of the Teachings is deduced also for those cases which could not be foreseen by the law-maker in person. The application of the law then no longer means the straightforward execution of the law, but the creative unfolding of the spirit inherent in the Teachings. In this process, what comes to the fore is above all the productive nature of the Midrashic method of interpretation, which again and again seeks the intellectual meaning in the text. The application of the law in all the innumerable “new cases,” which ever-changing life brings with it, is therefore inconceivable without interpretation of the law, that is, Midrash.",
                "Life asks its questions in those “cases” which must be resolved. The Teachings must answer. It is in this dialogue between life and Torah that the Oral Teachings, the Talmud, unfold. “Thou shalt!” commands the Bible — “How?” asks life — “Like this!” answers the Talmud. The Talmud is as old as the “Thou shalt” of the Teachings, as young as the question of the present day ; it is eternal, just as the Teachings and life are eternal. The Talmud is the bridge across which the Teachings proceed into life. The Bible without the Talmud is like a soul with no connection with the body — eternal but not of this world. It is because of the Talmud that the Teachings “are not in heaven.”",
                "Since the application and execution of the law can be called a commentary from the point of view of fulfillment, Talmud is commentary on the Bible in the broadest sense of the word; written by the Jewish people in the course of the ages of Jewish history."

                "The close relationship between the Talmud and the life of the people also determines the relationship between the Talmud and science, a relationship which because of space constraints we can only briefly review here.",

                "The question that the Talmud asks is: What does the law require in this specific case? This is a practical question, not a scientific or theoretical one. The Talmudist is right in the midst of his people’s life, a position in which he is beset with innumerable questions, to which he seeks the answer by drawing conclusions from the Teachings. The Jewish people has no literary document which is as true to life as the Talmud. Talmud studies are not a sophistic and theoretical form of hairsplitting, but the nation’s rigorous and consistent will to mold its life according to a clearly defined and objective approach, based on the eternal teachings.",
                "The Talmud is an outgrowth of the life of the people, which is why it begins with a specific “case.” In contrast, science starts with a concept. The Talmudic case which is to be decided is a question involving real-life issues. In contrast, science’s questions are problems. A problem is solved by means of hypotheses, whereas questions require answers. Hypotheses need only be possible, whereas answers must be conclusive. Science thinks, whereas teachings must know. This is the reason for the Talmud’s lively discussions, which cannot be brought to an end until a particular answer has proved itself conclusive or, as a great contemporary scholar put it during a discussion at his yeshiva: “It could be said” — is not an answer, “It must be stated as follows” — that is the answer.",
                "The Talmud is not science: like the Bible itself, the Talmud is a body of lessons or teachings for life. The fundamental difference between science and teachings is probably shown most clearly by the pairs of opposites — case/concept, question/problem, answer/hypothesis.",
                "It should, however, be borne in mind that, even though the Teachings are not a science, they nevertheless require scientific knowledge. (Medical consultations would be impossible without clinical research. The practice of judicial authority must be preceded by theoretical legal knowledge.) Without previously addressing the relevant underlying concepts in a scientific fashion, Talmud as the Teachings of how to put the Torah into practice is an impossibility. In this setting the issue is not whether the Talmudist is aware of his scientific performance, but only that he should think through the concepts and problems which precede the Teachings in a scientifically rigorous fashion. Even before Plato and Aristotle, it was also possible to think logically in unambiguous, abstract terms. Midrashic rules of interpretation are the scientific outcome of a highly developed logic which is not only taught but also applied in the Talmud. A large number of postulates and theoretical principles appear in the Talmud as axioms about which no further discussion takes place: the discussion focuses only on the possibility of applying them to the “case in question.” However, the fact that they can be readily applied proves that their basic nature has already undergone theoretical elucidation. Let us take an example. Just as in epistemology we find the problem of “presumption of validity of phenomena,” the Talmud too has a concept of “presumption,” which it calls <i>hazaka</i>. In the Talmud, however, “presumption” is not a problem but a principle, which can be expressed roughly as follows: A circumstance which has been observed <i>holds true</i> as long as it continues to exist, until we have convinced ourselves of the opposite. This principle and many others of a similar nature are applied in the Talmud; however, such application must be preceded by the philosophical explanation of the concept.",
                "Since the Teachings are not the same as science, it must be expected that their systematic structure will not be interchangeable with the systematic of a scientific discipline. By approaching the Teachings with scientific prejudices one would fail to find the Teachings too.",

                "This summary is the central element of a rigorously scientific methodology of Midrashic exegesis. It must, however, be noted that these hermeneutic rules were not discovered by Hillel. Rather, Hillel, found them already present in the Teachings; he identified them from the cases to which they had been applied in the centuries before him, and summarized them. To what end? Not in order to teach the theory of the Midrashic method; nor in order to prove the logical correctness of the rules. There was nothing here which needed to be proved. These rules applied for hundreds of years before Hillel. Even with this summary, which is simply formal logic, without which it cannot be understood, the Talmud expresses no scientific interest. The reason for compiling the rules was so that they could be applied with greater confidence. It is practical interest which is decisive; science serves the Teachings."

                "As we have already shown, interpretative exegesis was primarily applicable when “new cases” arose in life —- cases which the law-maker could not have specifically solved previously, but which nevertheless had to be decided in the spirit of the Teachings. But how could the spirit of the Teachings be determined so that it would not simply be viewed as an individual’s subjective opinion of the Teachings, but rather so that it must be seen as the objective — and hence also valid — intention of the Teachings? There was only one way of making sure of this: inferring from the known to the unknown X. But since the Teachings never manifest themselves in the form of concepts, but instead as individual cases, in which they determine action or behavior, conclusions had to be drawn from one individual case to another individual case — or, to use the terminology of logic, from one particular to another particular. How did the Talmud proceed here? We will illustrate this by means of an example.",
                "a) In Tractate Pesachim (66a), it says: It came to pass once that the eve of the Festival of Passover fell on the Sabbath, and it was not known whether the Passover sacrifice could be offered on the Sabbath, since the offering is associated with certain types of labor otherwise forbidden on the Sabbath. Neither the Bible nor the Oral Teachings contained any provision about this, but this case too had to be decided on the basis of the Teachings. Now Hillel taught: We know that the daily sacrifice must be offered on the Sabbath too. Of the daily sacrifice it says: it shall be offered “in its due season.” But of the Pesach sacrifice it also says: it is to be given “in its due season.” However, this justifies my inferring: Just as “in its due season” for the daily sacrifice means: even if this time is a Sabbath, so the same expression for the Pesach sacrifice will mean: “in its due season” — even on a Sabbath. Reduced to a logical formula, the reasoning runs as follows:",
                "The daily sacrifice supersedes the commandment relative to the Sabbath",
                "The daily sacrifice is similar to the Pesach sacrifice (because of the similarity of the wording determining the time in the Bible)",
                "Hence the Pesach sacrifice supersedes the commandment relative to the Sabbath.",
                "All this amounts to is a logical inference by analogy, where the formula is as follows: M = P; S and M are similar to each other; therefore S = P. Since inference by analogy in the Talmud is almost exclusively based on identity of the expression in the Biblical text, its name in the Talmud is “<i>g’zerah shavah</i>,” that is, an “analogous expression” or verbal analogy (cf.

                "However, no inevitable — that is, completely reliable — conclusions can be reached on the basis of similarity. All that analogy can do is to substantiate with probability the similarity between M-like S and M-equals P. Analogy always justifies a supposition only. However, it is not possible to decide about issues in the Teachings on the basis of suppositions. The theory of probabilities can only be a method of science, not a satisfactory method of the Teachings. Whether or not the Pesach sacrifice can be offered on the Sabbath must be categorically known. Which is why the Talmudic verbal analogy (inference by analogy), the “<i>g’zerah shavah</i>” — a decision of law — requires further safeguards. Probability should prevail. How can it do so? Logic replies as follows: The probability inferred on the basis of analogy can become applicable on the basis of those experiences which confirm it. But the role that (empirical) experience plays in science is occupied in the Teachings by tradition. This is the reason behind the principle that the Talmudic inference by analogy applies only when it is confirmed by a tradition. Generally this involves the “<i>g’zerah shavah</i>” having been handed down from generation to generation, from teachers to students.",
                "Or, as Hillel puts it: “Nobody may independently draw up a conclusion by analogy,” meaning: Nobody may make decisions of law on the basis of a verbal analogy if unsupported by any tradition (cf. Pesachim 66a). This is not a dogma, but the scientific consequence of the analogy. Analogy can only produce a probability; but probability cannot be an answer to questions of the Teachings.",
                "b) Hillel also shows us another way to decide the above-cited question about the Pesach sacrifice. We can disregard verbal inference. The assumption is: We know that the daily sacrifice supersedes the Sabbath commandment. We know that, while the punishment of <i>karet</i> (= excision or premature death) applies to any omission of the Pesach sacrifice, this punishment does not apply to omission of the daily sacrifice. The law-maker must have attached greater importance to the offering of a sacrifice to whose omission the <i>karet </i>penalty is applied, than to the offering of a sacrifice for whose omission this harshest of punishments was not specified. Hillel now teaches the conclusion: If the offering of the daily sacrifice, for whose omission no <i>karet</i> penalty is imposed, already supersedes the Sabbath commandment, then how much more must the Pesach sacrifice, whose omission is punished with <i>karet</i>, supersede the Sabbath commandment. Reduced to a logical formula, this can be expressed as follows: Because of the relationship between the different nature of the penalties in the case of omission, the following is established:",
                "The offering of the Pesach sacrifice exceeds in significance the offering of the daily sacrifice",
                "The offering of the daily sacrifice is so significant that it supersedes the Sabbath commandment",
                "Therefore, the Pesach sacrifice also supersedes the Sabbath commandment.",
                "In the Talmud this conclusion is known as “<i>kal va-homer</i>” (<i>a fortiori</i>); originally in the sense of “(deduction) from a minor to a major case in terms of religious law,” or to put it more generally: “From the particular to the more comprehensive particular,” so that one might say: What A contains must also be contained by the more comprehensive A1. Unlike the verbal analogy of the <i>gezerah shavah</i>, this conclusion is mandatory; consequently, it needs no other confirmation than that of logical necessity. <i>Kal va-homer</i> is always applicable even if unsupported by any tradition. Or, as the Talmud puts it: “Everyone has the right to infer a <i>kal va-homer</i> on his own.” (ibid.)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Adolf Schwarz, whose basic work we followed in the section’s presentation of “logical inferences” and “exegetical rules,” although we differ from him on all essential points concerning the “inferences” (at this juncture we can only report on the exegetical rules on the basis of Schwarz A., “Der Hermeneutische Syllogismus in der Talmudischen Litteratur\", Israelitisch-Theologischen Lehranstalt, Vienna, 1901) holds that <i>kal va-homer</i> is equivalent to a syllogism. This is not correct. There are countless syllogisms in the Talmud, but never in the form of <i>kal va-homer</i>; on the other hand there are a number of <i>kal va-homer</i> which can only be reduced to a syllogism with great difficulty. In my experience the nature of the <i>kal va-homer</i> has been correctly explained only by my esteemed teacher, Dr. I.I. Weinberg, Rector of the Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary in Berlin, who has re-established the <i>a fortiori</i> inference in <i>kal va-homer</i>. The special wording of the <i>kal va-homer</i> can be ascribed to the fact that the conclusion at the same time contradicts a possible objection to the identity to be inferred, that is, always in how it is shown: the point on which A and A1 differ from each other only strengthens the inference on the basis of identity, since the present in A, on which the identity is based, must — on the basis of the properties which are cited as differing — be present in A1 to an even greater degree.</i>",
                "c) Another case should enable us to gain an insight into the nature of a third exegetical rule. In the Bible we have four basic types of damage accompanied by liability for damages or liability to make good a loss. 1. A goring ox. 2. A pit which is dug or left open in the public domain. 3. An ox that grazes on someone else’s field. 4. A fire which starts out in a hearth and spreads. In the concise, catchy and graphic language of the Oral Teachings, they are designated by means of the terms: 1. The horn, 2. The pit, 3. The tooth, 4. The fire (cf. Bava Kama, Mishna 1:1). In defining the nature of these kinds of damage, it is determined that all damage caused by physical objects can be reduced to these four basic types. The tractate of Bava Kama (p. 6a) discusses the following question: Some-one had placed “his stone, his knife, his load” on a roof; they fell down during a normal wind (which should therefore have been foreseen), causing damage to something. Is the owner who laid them on the roof liable for damages or not? No decision was available in such a case, whether in the Bible or in tradition. An attempt is now made to determine to which group of damages the falling object belongs: 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, it turns out that this case cannot be placed anywhere; for in its nature it is not identical with 1, nor with 2, 3, or 4. However, although 1, 2, 3, and 4 also differ from each other, nevertheless in all four cases, the owner or party responsible is liable for damages. However, if the same applies to 1, 2, 3, and 4, the reason cannot be the points on which they differ (unequal causes having unequal effects), but rather the points on which they correspond. The “common factor” (<i>ha-tsad hashaveh</i>) to be found in them is: All four “are in the habit of causing damage, and must be guarded” — and this is therefore the cause of the provision: “The owner or party responsible is liable for damages.” The conclusion drawn from this is: Everything that has the property of “being in the habit of causing damage and needing to be guarded” carries with it, in the case of damage, an obligation on the part of the owner or the person responsible to pay damages. However, these properties apply also in the case in question to the “stone”; the owner or person responsible is therefore liable to pay damages. Reduced to a clear, logical formula, the conclusion can be worded as follows:",
                "The “horn,” the “pit,” the “tooth,” the “fire” have the property: “they are in the habit of causing damage, and must be guarded”",
                "The “horn,” the “pit,” etc. require the person responsible for them to pay damages.",
                "Everything which has the property of “it is in the habit of causing damage and must be guarded” requires damages to be paid.",
                "The “stone” has the property: “In the habit of causing damage and must be guarded”",
                "Therefore, the “stone” requires damages to be paid.",
                "However, this conclusion is simply the combination of an induction and a syllogism. The first part, the induction, is the well-known Aristotelian progression from the particular to the general. However, once the general is obtained, it can be used to infer an unknown particular from the general, as a super-proposition to the familiar syllogism: all M is P, S is M, therefore S = P. (The reader trained in logic will be able to recognize independently the importance of this combination for the disclosure of the relationship between induction and syllogism.) In the Talmud, this combined conclusion is called “<i>binyan av</i>” (basic rule, law or precedent); “<i>av</i> = father” means the type, the kind, the general as such, and “<i>binyan</i> = building” is what builds up the type, namely the particular with the distinguishing feature, as a result of which it is classified under the <i>av</i>. First an inference is drawn from the <i>binyan</i> particular to the general<i> av</i>, then back from the <i>av</i> to a previously unknown particular.",
                "The task of ruling on new cases using the laws of logic and in accordance with the spirit of the Teachings has ben brilliantly solved by these three principles for inferring from the known to the unknown: The verbal analogy in the <i>g’zerah shavah</i>, the <i>a fortiori</i> inference (based on identity) of the <i>kal va-homer</i> which at the same time disproves a possible objection, and lastly the inference of the <i>binyan av,</i> deduced from induction and syllogism. Independently of Aristotle, and centuries before him, the scientific thinking of our great masters reached a level on a par with the greatest logicians of all times."

                "<b><i>2. Exegetical rules</i></b>",
                "While the three types of inference deal with determining the unknown in the factual instance, in other words in real life, the purpose of the remaining four rules of interpretation is to explore the unknown X in the text. These are exegetical rules, which can, however, readily be turned into analytical rules of logic. The first deals with contradictions in the Bible and is called “<i>shneh ketuvim”</i> — “two verses” (which contradict each other). Since the Teachings are true, they cannot contain any contradictions; the truth cannot stand in contradiction to itself. If the proposition A is B is correct, then it cannot be true that A is not B. This is the postulate of contradictions, with its corresponding exegetical rule: If contradictions are found in the Bible, then they must be resolved. However, resolution is only possible as a result of distinction — establishing a difference between two passages which apparently contradict each other. This is a rule which the Talmud follows in countless instances.",
                "The most important of the exegetical rules is the last one, which bears the Talmudic name of “<i>davar ha-lamed mi-inyano</i>” — “a conclusion (something learned) from its context.” This rule takes us “deep down into the very innermost heart of the Torah, because it shows us that in fact, many things which appear superficially to be outwardly just strung together in a disjointed or separate fashion, deep down turn out to be inextricably intertwined with each other.” (Schwarz) Deriving an “inference from the textual context” is the “syntactic examination” of the Biblical word; “…because the individual word has one meaning if it is taken out of its context, and another if it remains in the framework of its sentence; and because similarly the individual sentence has one meaning on its own, and another if it appears as a link in a self-contained chain” (Schwarz). The same applies to entire sections and chapters; in order to completely understand a Biblical saying, the “setting,” the “milieu,” is always of great importance.",
                "One of the most frequent formulae in these rules is the “<i>hekesh</i>,” the comparison or analogy, which results from a juxtaposition in the text. An example: “… it is taught: Rabbi Meir used to say: What is meant by the verse: ‘According to their word, a decision is to be reached on every dispute and every leprosy’ (Deut. 21:5)? Now what do disputes and leprosy have in common with each other? — Rather <i>disputes are compared with leprosy</i>: just as leprosy (must be examined) during the daytime, as it is written: ‘On the day on which it appears,’ (Lev. 13:14) so disputes are (adjudicated) only during the daytime … Similarly, <i>leprosy is compared with disputes</i>: just as disputes are not (adjudicated) by relatives, so leprosy must not be (examined) by relatives.” (Sanhedrin 34b.)",
                "This inference from the textual context can be readily turned into a logical rule (Schwarz). The textual juxtaposition draws attention to an internal analogy.",
                "As a result of the logical laws which contain the seven hermeneutic rules, the Bible has in the course of Jewish history proved itself to be “living teachings” which can be consulted anew at any time and in any situation. The exegetical rules have expanded the Bible, making it more profound. They have shown that every generation can find the solution to its problems in the Bible. And in the process, the dogma of the eternal nature of the Teachings has become a historical truth."

                "<b><i>3. “S'vara” — the principle of “common-sense”</i></b>",
                "The principle of “<i>s’vara</i>” (s’vara = opinion) constitutes a triumph of the Talmudic method in solving unknown cases in accordance with the rules of the Torah. <i>S'vara</i> establishes the apparently self-evident but weighty principle: “Common sense prevails\".",
                "In certain instances questions arise to which the exegetical rules cannot provide any answers: that is to say, when the Teachings contain nothing similar. For example, there is a clear-cut <i>halachah</i>: If somebody is threatened by death unless he kills a particular person, he may not save his own life by murdering a third person. The Talmud asks (Pesachim 25b): How do I know this? (What is meant is: A murder is indeed a sin, but in the case of mortal danger, it is in other cases permitted to violate a provision of the Law.) And the answer is: It is a <i>s’vara</i> (that is, common sense tells one). The following is recounted as an authority: A man came before Rava and said to him, “The ruler of my city ordered me, ‘Go and slay So-and-so. If you do not, I will slay you.’” Rava replied, “Let yourself be slain rather than slay. What makes you think your blood is redder than his? Perhaps that man’s blood is redder.”",
                "This precept, which does not appear anywhere in the Bible, is implemented as if it were explicitly included in the Bible. It constitutes the foundation for one of the seven exegetical rules with which a verse in the Torah is explained, in order to deduce the intention of the law-giver from this disposition, not foreseen in the Bible, in a case described by him in person. This view, based on <i>s’vara</i>, prevails as the view of the Bible, and is just as “known” as if it were explicitly expressed somewhere in the text. Basically, it is even better known; the expression is often used in the Talmud: “Why should I (use) the verse (in order to say something)? After all, it is a <i>s’vara</i>!” (e.g., Bava Kama 46b) Or the frequent question: “How do I know it?” is answered: “If you wish, it is a verse (of the Bible, from which this follows), and if you wish (that is, if the verse does not convince you), it is a <i>s’vara.</i>” (e.g., Sanhedrin 30a) What follows from the <i>s’vara</i> may not be in the Bible, since it is known even without the Bible, and therefore it does not need first to be taught by the Bible. Contained in the text, it would be superfluous. The <i>s’vara</i> has the same binding force as the Teachings revealed on Mount Sinai.",
                "However, all of this is a consequence of the nature of the Teachings themselves. The only reason that the Teachings are applicable is because they are the truth. <i>S'vara</i> is also truth, and hence must also be applicable. In this chain of reasoning too, however, what is perceived is the application of one of the exegetical rules of the Talmud — the <i>a fortiori</i> inference in the <i>kal va-homer</i>. The difference is that the <i>kal va-homer</i> always infers from the individual case of the Teachings to another individual case; while here an inference is drawn from the Teachings as a whole to the <i>s’vara</i>, as follows:",
                "The Teachings are truth",
                "The <i>s’vara</i> is truth",
                "Therefore, the <i>s’vara</i> is teachings.",
                "Therefore, the conclusion is: The <i>s’vara</i> is not applicable if it is not identical with the Teachings, that is, if it conflicts with them. Not because the truth needs additional support in the Teachings, but because the conflict of a <i>s’vara</i> with the Teachings is proof of the error in the <i>s’vara</i>. The Teachings are objective truth; in contrast <i>s’vara</i>, “common sense,” is subjective, and hence liable to error. The Teachings constitute the negative check on the <i>s’vara</i>; that which conflicts with the Teachings cannot be the truth. (This idea of the identity between teachings and truth, from which the “Biblical validity” of the <i>s’vara</i> follows, is incidentally the central idea of Maimonides’ philosophy. Maimonides is concerned, not with the reconciliation of belief and knowledge, but with the following insight: All knowledge which has a right to truth <i>is</i> Torah. For example, it is in this sense that he includes mathematics too, in Torah. <i>S'vara</i> is Torah — this Talmudic idea dominates Maimonides’ philosophical system.)",

                "Anyone who studies the Talmud in somewhat greater depth, one of its Orders, or even just one of its tractates or sections will soon inevitably reach the conclusion that what is said there about the great theme of human life from the point of view of the “teachings” is often of varying character and unequal importance. For example, when the first Mishna in Bava Batra teaches: “If neighbors wish to make a partition in a (shared) courtyard, they will build the wall in the middle (each one must give up half of the space for the wall), in what locally is the normal fashion for building…,” in form and content this basically differs from the observation of another Mishna, e.g. in Avot 5:10, informing us: “There are four character types among people: (a) One who says: ‘My property is mine and yours is yours,’ is an average character type, or, some say, this is characteristic of Sodom (selfishly refusing to do a kindness); (b) ‘Mine is yours and yours is mine,’ is an unlearned person (unfamiliar with the concept of ownership); (c) ‘Mine is yours and yours is yours,’ is scrupulously pious; (d) ‘Yours is mine and mine is mine,’ is a rascal.” And even less can it be compared with a passage in Tractate Brachot 32a, which tells of Moses’ importance: “And the Lord spoke to Moses: ‘Go, get thee down!’ (Exodus 32:7) What is the meaning of: ‘Go, get thee down’? R. Eleazar explained: The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moshe: Moshe, get you down from your greatness; it was only because of Israel that I bestowed such greatness upon you; but now that Israel have sinned, what need have I of you?!”",
                "The first quotation could be part of a code of law, the second belongs in a manual on “practical” ethics, while the last one might appear in a literary treatise on the idea of national leadership. Innumerable other examples could be quoted; in each case, new subjects will need to be established in order to clearly distinguish one from the other. In the Talmud itself everything is presented side by side. Without the slightest attempt at systematic separation, the most diverse topics alternate, overlapping and intersecting with each other. However colorless and drab it may appear, for the person capable of reading a printed page of Talmud, it turns into a vivid and colorful ancient Oriental fabric, full of movement and lively splendor. Imagination, religious experience, poetic vision, ethics, politics, law, stories and anecdotes, fables, legal provisions, historical, philological, philosophical, legal and other insights are all there, side by side, “weaving” the “page” in the Talmud. Nowhere is there even the slightest hint of monotony and tedium; a wonderful intellectual zest fills each and every page. It would be an enormous task to scientifically and rigorously separate from each other all the different intellectual powers involved in the development of the Talmud — a task which could only be handled by an entire academy of scholars.",
                "The Talmud makes a division of an entirely different nature by separating all the material of the Oral Law into two main groups of differing character: Halachah, and Aggadah. Halachah (derived from <i>haloch</i> = to go) means the existing legal provisions by which people are to “walk,” while the term Aggadah (which comes from <i>hagged</i> = to inform, recount) designates all of the content of the Talmud which is not of a legal nature and hence is not binding on anyone. That the distinction between the two is not the common one, so familiar to the layman, that of reason, as opposed to emotion, can be readily seen from the fact that, on the one hand, much in the stringently mandatory Halachah is determined by feeling, while the broad scope of Aggadic material can in no way be ascribed solely to that which is determined by intuition and effect. “Emotion” plays no more a part in the emergence of the Aggadah than does reason or any other intellectual powers. Countless <i>aggadot</i>, providing us with an in-depth view of the connections between different walks of life, attest to this. Aggadah and Halachah are the expressions of two contrasting trends in Judaism. The most beautiful and important <i>aggadot</i> originate with the most important teachers of Halachah. The greatest Halachists were the greatest Aggadists, and the Aggadah of the Aggadists has also come down to us only because of the Halachists.",
                "However paradoxical it may sound, the difference between Aggadah and Halachah cannot be understood by looking at that which distinguishes them.",
                "Aggadah and Halachah do not appear as separate kinds of Talmudic material. Understood in this way, only Halachah would be unambiguous as law, the standard of performance, as well as comprehensive with respect to its intension. But Aggadah cannot be described as report or account, because only a small portion of the non-Halachic material in the Talmud can be called report or account. In no way can the non-Halachic part of the Oral Teachings be adequately characterized as story, fable, fairy tale, fiction, fantasy, and so on. Certainly, the Aggadah contains all of these factors, but its nature is in no way defined in by such terms, nor even approximately determined in its scope. Just as the literary works of the nineteenth century cannot be divided into statute books and novels, with the latter necessarily meaning the non-legal, so it is impossible to systematically divide up the Talmud into its various constituent parts of Halachah and Aggadah.",
                "Only if that which unifies is perceived can one understand the significance and also the correctness of the classification into Halachah and Aggadah. That Halachah and Aggadah really belong together can best be seen where they first appear, that is, in the Bible. In the Bible itself we find Halachic material as a binding standard of performance and valid law, and Aggadic material in the form of accounts and reports. What unites the Halachah and Aggadah of the Bible is the Torah — the “Teachings.” The report is not an end in itself, for the Bible is not a novel; nor is the law the goal, because the Bible is not just a code of law. The Bible is Torah, and both Aggadah and Halachah point beyond themselves — to the Teachings. They lead to the Teachings. Halachah is not the ultimate end, but a means of education for the Teachings, and the same applies to Aggadah as well: they only differ in method.",
                "This can best be grasped by not simply explaining the two words from their grammatical roots, but by going back to the substantive contexts in which they originated. It is quite impossible to explain the two concepts in purely “grammatical” terms. To derive Halachah = law from <i>haloch</i> = to go, because people “are to walk according to the law” is itself a bit of Aggadah — homiletics. Life — reality — does not put concepts together in this way. Halachah comes, not from “haloch,” but from a verse in the Bible which is frequently repeated in a number of variations and which always contains a reference to the “way of the Eternal” or the “path which the Eternal One, Your God, has commanded you” (Deut. 5:30) and along which every individual “should go.” The law is called Halachah in respect of this concrete “path” and this “going” which is indeed required by the Teachings. Nor should Aggadah or Haggadah be “grammatically” derived from <i>hagged</i> = to recount, but rather philosophically from such Biblical expressions as: “ve-higadeta le-vincha bayom hahu — and you shall tell your son on that day” (Exodus 13:8) or: “Sha’al avicha ve-yagedcha — ask your father and he will tell you” (Deut. 32:7). In both instances “Haggadah” means “communication, narration,” not fiction, legend, fantasy, and so on. The “share-it-with-your-child” does not impose the duty on the father of telling his child “stories” on Passover Eve, but <i>history</i> (as <i>his</i> story). The child is to be taught about the historical connections and interrelations which led to the commandment of Pesach, to the Halachah of Pesach. And what Aggadah does the other quotation refer to? One can take the Bible and read (Deut. 32:6): “Is He not your father, your creator, he who made you and established you? Regard the days of ages-past, understand the years of generation and generation ago; ask your father, he will tell you, your elders, they will declare it to you!” Clearly what is meant is the historically experienced confirmation of the Halachah — “He is Your father…,” or in other words: the historically experienced truth of the mandatory and binding entity — Judaism, the confirmation, experienced by the generations of Jewish history, of the entire Halachah, of the “path which your God has commanded you to go along.”",
                "Only if we start here can we determine the nature of the Haggadah and its relationship to the Halachah. The Aggadah is the life experience of the generations, turned into worldly wisdom and practical philosophy: it is the wisdom of the times, the “father’s communication to the child,” the Teachings which have <i>come about</i> for man in the course of his life; in contrast, Halachah is the Teachings <i>given</i> to man, “God’s communication to man.” The Aggadah is like “teachings from below,” it comes about in the course of time; Halachah — the “teachings from above” — is for eternity. However, both mean the same — the Torah; Halachah requires it, Aggadah leads to it. Halachah commands, Aggadah teaches. Halachah lays down outward behavior, Aggadah creates an inward willingness. What does Halachah mean without Aggadah? – Only established outward behavior without inward willingness, in other words — drill. What is Aggadah without Halachah? – An inward willingness without any outward resoluteness, in other words something impossible, or if it is passed off as possible — mere words, a fallacy.",
                "Aggadah leads to Halachah and Halachah presupposes Aggadah.",
                "This, and concomitantly the internal relationship between Aggadah and Halachah, can be expounded as follows: Aggadah, as the “wisdom of the times,” which proceeds from people, is subjective; Halachah, given by God, is objective, it holds true. Because Aggadah is subjective, it cannot constitute a valid standard of performance. It is not binding, and nevertheless in a certain sense it is “valid” and holds true. As the wisdom of the times it is valid in time as a subjective knowledge of the truth for the subject. It always holds true in some sense in the “now.” The Aggadah is always subjective Halachah.",
                "However, every subjective experience of the world strives for truth, that is, for objectivity, for general validity. The wisdom of the times strives for eternity, Aggadah for Halachah. As Aggadah, developing and completing itself, draws closer to the truth, it sheds more and more of its initial subjectivity, it objectivizes itself, thereby gradually becoming Halachah, so that we can say: Halachah is objectivized Aggadah. As soon as Aggadah reaches its acme, it must be possible to turn it into Halachah. Halachah constitutes the highest stage, the ultimate consequence of Aggadah.",
                "This close relationship between Aggadah and Halachah can be illustrated by means of a number of examples.",
                "a) Genesis, Chapter 18, recounts the story of how Avraham fed the “three men.” This is an <i>aggadah</i>, a statement from the lives of the Fathers, an episode reflecting a particular lifestyle of the Fathers, placing nobody under an obligation, not “applicable” to anyone, but nevertheless molding and “teaching” everyone. For Avraham himself, feeding the men was not an <i>aggadah</i>: for him, it was an obligation, a precept, an inner law. We see before us the typical example of an <i>aggadah</i> which is subjective Halachah. It applied to Avraham, but it did not have to be binding on his son Isaac. This <i>aggadah</i> of “hospitality” developed further, and an important part of its continuation is to be found in the Talmud tractate of Kiddushin (32b). There it states:",
                ".”…It once happened that Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Zadok were at the wedding feast of the son of Rabbi Gamliel, and R. Gamliel stood over them and served drinks. He handed a cup to R. Eliezer, but he would not take it; then he offered it to R. Yehoshua, who did take it. R. Eliezer said to him, “How can we allow this, Joshua? We are seated while Gamliel Berabbi is standing over us and serving us drinks!” R. Yehoshua replied: “In Scripture we find one even greater than he who served others. Abraham was greater than him, and he served others. Abraham was the greatest man of his generation, yet of him it is written, ‘And he stood over them’ (Gen. 18:8) …Why should not R. Gamliel stand over us and serve us drinks?”",
                "The Aggadah of hospitality is nearing its completion; it already “applies” to others. Thousands of years after Avraham it becomes a commandment for Rabban Gamliel. The insight is gradually accepted: <i>this </i>is the way to entertain one’s guests. This is recognized by Rabbi Yehoshua, who would act precisely the same way in the given circumstances. But then the text continues:",
                "“Now R. Zadok spoke up: “How long will you disregard the honor due to God and concern yourself with the honor due to human beings. The Holy One, blessed be He, causes winds to blow, clouds to rise, rain to fall, and the earth to sprout, and before each and every one of us He sets a table, and why should not Gamliel Berabbi stand and serve us drinks?”",
                "We see how the Aggadah is removed from the subject, from Abraham, and there is an advancing towards the nub of the matter, the truth. The Aggadah objectivizes itself, and it is entirely possible that one day it will become the Halachah: A person entertaining guests is always obliged to serve them himself. This would then be the Halachah, which is nothing other than Aggadah objectivized.",
                "b) Another example:",
                "God speaks to Cain: “The bloods of your brother cry out to Me” (Gen. 4:10, literally translated). The Sages comment on this: “It does not say: the blood of your brother, but ‘the bloods’ — his blood and the blood of his descendants… This teaches you that every individual who destroys a human life will have his action adjudged as if he had destroyed an entire world.” This too is an <i>aggadah</i> — but one of the most sophisticated <i>aggadot</i>, an Aggadic high point. And now the source itself must be looked up. It is to be found in Sanhedrin (37a): “How are the witnesses in a capital case threatened? They are led in and threatened (by the following words): Perhaps you are saying this as conjecture, or as hearsay, or (you know it) from the mouth of other witnesses … or perhaps you do not know that we will later subject you to investigation and questioning. You should know that in capital cases things are different from financial cases; in financial cases compensation can be made and expiation achieved, whereas in capital cases the blood (of the person who is executed) and the blood of his (possible) descendants adhere until the end of the world; for this too is how we find things with Cain, who slew his brother, as it says: ‘The bloods of your brother cry out…’, it does not say: the blood of your brother, but: the bloods of your brother, his blood and the blood of his (possible) descendants.”",
                "The Aggadah therefore applies here — it must apply to everyone, hence to the witnesses too; it has objectivized itself and its consequence is Halachah. All the Halachic differences between “dinei mamanot” (laws governing monetary matters or civil law) and “dinei nefashot” (laws governing capital cases or criminal law) are the result of this <i>aggadah</i> about the importance of a single human life.",
                "True, Biblical-Talmudic Halachah differs from every other “Halachah” inasmuch as it did not become philosophical. Rather, through the Revelation on Sinai God emanated as compatible with Aggadah. By “giving” us the Torah, God anticipated the final consequences of Aggadah. While we perform and fulfill the Teachings through the “given Halachah,” we endeavor in the developing Aggadah to understand those teachings in their entirety, and thus to accept that which is “given.” As long as it is not accepted, it is the “law” ordained externally. Once we have accepted it, it becomes the set of internal laws which regulate our life. Halachah without Aggadah is the route of march; it is only through Aggadah that Halachah becomes the path of life."

            "3 The psychological structure of the Oral Teachings": [
                "<b><i>3. The psychological structure of the Oral Teachings</i></b>",
                "We have already discussed the basic outline of a systematic for the extensive material of the Oral Teachings (see Section III, 1). It comprises the “six Orders,” Shishah S'darim, or from the Hebrew abbreviation — <i>Shas</i>. Every order is divided into individual tractates or <i>masechot</i>, which like the Orders themselves are named after the “cases” with which they predominantly deal with, for example “B'rachot — Benedictions,” “Shabbat,” “Gittin — Bills of Divorcement,” and so on. Each tractate is divided into chapters or <i>p’rakim</i> which, like the weekly portions of the Bible, instead of having a title are always called by their initial words. The chapters are then further divided into subsections, each introduced by individual sentences of the Teachings, the Mishna.",
                "This structure was probably never viewed by the authors of the Talmud as a special task; nor can it be viewed as the result of a special systematizing achievement. Rather, it results automatically from the diversity of the material and is often even determined by its scope. Thus one tractate was, for example, divided up into three independent tractates simply because it was exceptionally long. It can be considered the external scheme which relates to the actual systematic of the Talmud in the same way that a factory building relates to the inner organization of the business. It is the framework, not the centerpiece, of the systematizing operation. Besides the external structure, attention must primarily be focused on the inner structure.",
                "In the traditional literature, the Talmud is often referred to as “yam ha-Talmud” — the Talmudic sea, and in order to cope with this sea one must attain some understanding of swimming. To the lay person, the internal structure of the material must appear “unsystematic.” In fact, a great deal of diligence and effort is required in order to be able to hack even the narrowest path through this jungle of intertwining problems, thoughts, questions, reports, and so on. The division into Orders, tractates, and chapters has not in fact been made in any consistent fashion. Every Order frequently contains a repetition of the many varied topics of the other Orders. No tractate deals solely with those questions which belong to its principal main topic. An explanation about criminal law may be interrupted, for example, by a disposition concerning the rules on sacrifices or a provision about social taxes. A legal question can often be answered by citing decisions on purely religious issues and vice versa. In one and the same section the most varied topics alternate with each other or are even dealt with jointly. As a result, nowhere is there a clear-cut separation; every tractate and every section reflects the diversity of the whole. In schools of Talmud, typically a certain tractate is known as the “little Shas” — the “six Orders in miniature” — because of the diversity of its content.",
                "Anyone who has had but one opportunity to observe how the chain of reasoning develops when elucidating an individual question in the Talmud, anyone who has experienced, just once, the unerring sagacity with which a discussion in the Talmud is conducted, the rigorous, almost inexorable systematic with which an individual topic is constructed, will be amazed by the “jumble” that can often be found on just two pages of Talmud. He would guess perhaps that this “confusion” cannot be explained by a chance lack of systematic structuring. Such a lack of order and clarity of structure among the authors of the Talmud could not have come about accidentally. In reality, this apparent confusion is simply the disappointment of readers who expect a very specific systematic, which is just not present in the Talmud. What looks to the beginner and layman like “muddle” is the necessary inner structure of the Talmudic material — an inspired systematizing work of the most unique nature, as matchless as the Talmud itself. Any other arrangement would not only have failed to achieve its purpose, but would have changed the very nature of the Talmud.",
                "The Talmud is a body of teachings; by their very nature, teachings are characterized by uniformity. The same will, the same intention must permeate all its parts. It is the same knowledge, namely the truth, that achieves its fitting and consistent expression in the most diverse walks of life. The subject matter may change, but the inner substance must remain the same. What applies to one point must apply to all points. In other words: that which is the truth for ritual legislation must also be the truth for criminal law, matrimonial law, or the rules for the Sabbath. At the very least there must be no contradictions in the entire body of the Teachings. This means that the nature of the “teachings” resists any systematization based on the diversity of the “themes.”",
                "Imagine that the sciences had achieved perfection and had all managed to arrive at the absolute truth: then any division into “faculties” would only be possible on an external level. Whatever holds true for philosophy would also have to hold true for medicine; and the truth of the natural sciences could not conflict with its legal counterpart. It would be entirely possible for a mathematical problem to be examined through a knowledge of poetics. There would be no “experts,” because every individual interested in understanding the nature of this “absolute truth” would have to study all its forms of expression. (As everybody knows, at the time of writing as the development of modern scientific research proceeds apace, the limits between faculties are gradually becoming blurred.) The “faculties” would be the model for the literary portrayal of the scientific results; the actual elucidating scientific work would, of course, not be able to comply with this model.",
                "The Talmud as teachings, whose very essence comprises “unity,” does not recognize any faculties. The Talmudist does not specialize in a particular “subject” — nor would this be possible, since every subject comprises all subjects. The division into the six Orders is only possible in literary terms, and only where the results of the Teachings are summarized, in other words in the Mishna (see Chapter IV), but not where they are elucidated — in the Gemara. The division into the six Orders does not apply to the “discussion.” What matters is not the diversity of the “material”; the subject matter includes everything to which the same principle applies. Thus it is possible for a legal question to be decided by a provision about “seeds,” and vice versa. As long as the Teachings are “in motion” and have not crystallized into rules, what applies is the inner systematic of the principles which may take the external form of the most diverse “topics.” This does not hold true for the external systematic of the material.",
                "The subject matter of the Talmud is always determined by a content which relates to principle, not to subject matter.",
                "It must, however, be said that this applies only to the individual topics. The Teachings as a whole had to be subject to a different systematic, as determined by their oral character. For centuries the Talmud was taught and transmitted orally. There is even a requirement that the Written Teachings must not be presented from memory, nor the Oral Teachings written down. (In this chapter we shall refrain from any speculation as to the reason for this rule. We refer the reader to what is said about the oral factor in Section I.1 on “Bible and Talmud”. Pursuant to this, it is strictly forbidden to write down the Oral Teachings, because that which is written down can itself only be read correctly as a result of additional oral teachings.) As a result, the Teachings were in serious danger of being condemned to oblivion. What had to be done was to systematize the content so as to protect it against this danger as much as possible. It therefore became necessary to arrange all the material according to mnemonic rules in order to make it easier to remember. In such a mnemonic-based systematic, “logical coherence” does not always matter. The chance juxtaposition of the most diverse topics, whether described jointly or consecutively, is sufficient if such juxtaposition makes it easier for the memory to “retain” them. In addition to the rigorously logical systematic of the individual topic, the Talmud is also characterized by the psychological systematic of the subject matter in its entirety.",
                "One of the most important rules followed by the “psychological systematic” is that of association. It may be intellectual, or based on a chronological factor, such as the well-known “on that day” on which a number of different controversial questions were decided, which from then on are always taught together. Often it is the space, the “same” location which forms the basis of the association. Decisions which are independent of each other in terms of content, but which were made at a particular location, are taught as a “package” and thereby protected against the danger of becoming forgotten. A name may also determine associative juxtaposition. If, for example, in the course of dealing with a topic, reference is made to a scholar’s relevant statement, the Talmud may continue along the following lines: “and the person concerned said further…” when an entirely different question is involved. It is nevertheless referred to in order to draw the memory’s attention to the association provided in the name of the “same” author.",
                "The frequent repetitions in the Talmud also hark back to the oral character of the Teachings. If, for example, a question — already decided on — has certain consequences for a problem in another tractate or even just another chapter, then the decision and often the accompanying discussion, already concluded, must be repeated. In the Oral Teachings it is not possible to say “see page such and such.” Only the written word can refer to itself: spoken words must be repeated.",
                "It is not possible here to give a detailed account of the inner structure of the Talmud. To sum up, all we can establish is that the Talmud is the spoken word, and hence must not be confused with a “book.” The systematic of the spoken word is quintessentially different from that of the written word. A book must be constructed logically; in contrast, that which is handed down orally can only be arranged in psychological terms, or it will be lost. It is only because we are accustomed to the systematic of “books” that it is so hard for us to identify the psychological systematic of the spoken word in the Talmud.",
                "Even after the prohibition on writing the material down was breached, and the Talmud was recorded in writing, the form in which this was done was such that it maintained its oral character. Even after being written down, the Talmud did not become a book (see Ch. V). It remained a body of oral teachings. (The extent to which this was always borne in mind is typified by the uniform page numbering of all editions of the Talmud. On any page of any tractate, in all Talmud editions, the same section is to be found. All editions have the same numbering. This is another way of supporting the memory through a visual associative factor, as it were.) The first person to understand this and grasp the consequences was Maimonides. The significance of his Halachic contribution lies, not in his thorough compilation of the rules on individual topics scattered throughout the entire Talmud, but in the fact that he was the first to reorganize the psychological systematic of the Oral Teachings into the logical systematic of the written word. Maimonides’ Mishneh Torah is the first Halachic “book” in the history of the “teachings.”"

                "The Oral Law we are addressing is divided into Midrash — interpretation (of the Bible), Mishna — repetition of the Teachings, and Gemara — completion or explanation (of the Mishna).",
                "The Midrash always starts from the Bible: in it, a word, a sentence, or a rule from the Bible is always interpreted. The Mishna is the repetition of the Torah, in such a form that it teaches how the laws of the Torah are to be put into effect. The Gemara always follows the Mishna; it explains and shows its possible applications. The explanation is crucial, because the Mishna, in the form of a code of law, generally contains only the rules, without their supporting grounds. Just as Midrash is explanatory interpretation of the Bible, so Gemara is explanation and interpretation of the Mishna.",
                "The concluding editor of the six Orders of the Mishna was Rabbi Yehuda Hanasi (c. 200 CE). He examined the entire oral teachings of his time, and removed doubtful customs, repetitions and detailed explanations, thereby investing the traditions summarized in the Mishna with great authority. The material which was removed was, however, also preserved in the form of “<i>Bareita</i>” — that which “was left out” (scattered throughout the Talmud) and in the collection of “<i>Tosefta</i>” or “Additions.”",
                "While there was only one Mishna, which came into being in Palestine, the Gemara developed in two main versions — in Palestine and in Babylon. In Palestine it was concluded as early as around 300 CE, while in Babylon it continued to develop, only being declared finished in 500 CE after thorough redaction. The Mishna together with the Gemara which came into being in Palestine is called the Jerusalem Talmud, while the same Orders of the Mishna and the concomitant Babylonian branch of the Gemara form the Babylonian Talmud.",
                "It is obvious that these generally standard particulars, which could be elaborated upon at will, provide not even the sketchiest indication as to the history of how the Talmud developed. This can be seen most clearly from the example of the Midrash. True, we have available to us a number of Midrash collections, which in part have even been ascribed to specific authors; but it is more or less impossible to say anything precise about the age of the Midrash itself. In the view of authoritative scholars, in its origins the Midrash is older than the Mishna. But when did it begin? A date will probably never be given. And when was it concluded? Never. The Midrash is a method, and can never designate a historical period of the Oral Teachings. Everyone who reads the Bible in accordance with Midrashic rules is increasing the Midrashic material. And even the homiletic interpretations of Biblical passages by the most recent rabbis should often, justifiably, be called Midrash. There is no dissimilarity in nature, only a difference in authority.",
                "A very similar situation applies to Mishna and Gemara. While we also know that Rabbi Yehuda Hanasi concluded the Mishna, it is just as certain that he, no more than any one of his contemporary colleagues, cannot be designated the author of the Mishna. He was the last to edit the available material; but the Mishna is much older than its last editor. It can also be safely assumed that the division into the six Orders does not originate with Rabbi Yehuda Hanasi either.",
                "The Talmud speaks variously of a Mishna of Rabbi Akiva (around 130 CE), as opposed to a “Mishna Rishonah” (first Mishna). How old is this “First Mishna”? There was certainly a “proto-“ or primary Mishna,” which was significantly older than, for example, the scholars Hillel and Shammai (around 10 BCE). The disputes between the teachers of the Mishna (Tanna’im, singular: Tanna) are, essentially, simply differences of opinion about the explanation and application of a Mishna, which was itself so old that it already needed an explanation. Thus even the oldest teachers of the Mishna are not authors, but interpreters of a proto-Mishna.",
                "However, this also raises the question of the historical beginnings of the Gemara. It cannot have begun with Rabbi Yehuda Hanasi’s conclusion of the Mishna. Since Gemara is, essentially, the explanation and exploration of the possible applications of a Mishna, the interpretation of the proto-Mishna by the “teachers of the Mishna” is already Gemara. Strictly speaking, the work of Mishna as transmitted to us by Rabbi Yehuda Hanasi consists of a proto-Mishna and a Gemara explaining it. Gemara is already contained in the “Mishna.” It therefore follows that the Midrash is older than the Midrashic collections, the Mishna is older than the teachers of the Mishna, and the “Gemara” — as method — is older than the Gemara.",
                "However, what follows from all of this is that the various “beginnings” are just as problematic as the “ends.” The Midrash as a method can always be applied afresh — including in our time. The Mishna of Rabbi Yehuda Hanasi already contains Gemara, so that it was concluded “late.” And since, moreover, Gemara is explanation in the broadest sense of the word, it is very hard to grasp how its conclusion could have taken place in structural terms in the year 500 CE. Irrespective of the time in which it originates. every explanation of the Mishna, to the extent that it is logically correct and does not contradict the Teachings, is essentially <i>gemara</i>."

                "In the context of the present work and in light of the current status of scientific Talmud research, we can only briefly touch upon the major lines of development and the forces which lay behind them.",
                "For us, there is no doubt whatsoever that the history of the Oral Teachings (the Oral Law) began with the reading of the Bible (see Sections I.1 and I.2). Merely reading correctly involves oral teachings, requiring as it does the explanation of the text. No written teachings are possible without their oral counterpart. The written word is inflexible and dead: the only way of bringing it to life is through the spoken form. The written word is never anything other than a “symbol”: it needs an “interpretation.” The spoken word is the outer “form” of a thought, it needs only to be “demonstrated.” The oral teachings are the key to the written form. The need for this key was further accounted for by the legal character of the Teachings. At any time the law can only say <i>what</i> is to apply, but not <i>how </i>it is to apply. The execution of the law is an essential part of the Oral Teachings (see Section I.2).",
                "Since the Torah wished to be taught and put into effect, it always needed the “oral” supplement. When Moses first read and taught the Bible, the history of the Oral Teachings began. This is the reason why the Sages say: “Moses received the Torah on Mount Sinai and handed it down…” (Avot 1:1) The handing down of the text from master to student involves the teaching of its correct reading — commentary in the broadest sense of the word. Such “transmission” is “Oral Law.” It was in this sense that the Talmud was originally called: “masoret me-ha-Avot” — handing down or transmission from the Fathers. But what the Fathers handed down is “Kabbalah — that which is received” for the children. (Not to be confused with the later meaning of this word, which generally denotes Jewish mysticism.)",
                "Even if material which is handed down undergoes certain expansions and transformations over the generations, it essentially always refers back to the first person who performed the handing down. In the case of the Oral Teachings and in the language of the Talmud, that is, therefore: Moses. “That which is handed down” always has one author only, and since this person does not need to be named (since, after all, he is known), the result is anonymity. The heart of the Talmud, which is this anonymous transmission of material which has been handed down, can be called the proto-Talmud, and today can still be completely separated out from the Talmud as a whole.",
                "In the proto-Talmud there are no differences of opinion, no arguments between scholars — only tradition unified. At first no difference of opinion could occur over the “tradition.” The proto-Talmud was not only handed down in the houses of learning. Since Torah was to be turned into a reality, it was also handed down in the daily life of the people. In all cases of doubt, therefore, it was possible for the accepted practice of legal implementation to be consulted about the correct tradition. In other words: at its outset, the tradition was unambiguous and clear, since it was accompanied by a practical experience which remained constant.",
                "Today, it is no longer possible to determine how the proto-Talmud is to be chronologically delimited. It is not possible to gauge a development from it; everything in it is of the same age. Indeed, the “tradition” has no instant of development — it does not come into being, it is there.",
                "But what puts the tradition, initially quiescent, into motion? How does a development of the Teachings come about? It occurs through two facts: through the eternal transformation of life, and through the major catastrophes of Jewish history. The transformation of life brings about new conditions of life; new questions are asked to which there are no answers that have been “handed down.” The first level of the “handing down” covers only those conditions of life to which the Bible itself refers specifically. The answers and decisions in a changed time must be deduced from all the Teachings available in their entirety, from the Bible and the proto-Mishna. A broadening of the “teachings” occurs.",
                "A similar expansion of the Teachings can also be caused by major national catastrophes, as a result of which what was initially a constant and unequivocal tradition breaks off at a certain point. As a result of wars, famine, exile — the destruction of the normal basis for the nation’s life — there occurs a shattering in the continuity of putting the law into effect and the handing down of the Teachings. As a result of such fissures in the chain of transmission from teacher to students, father to son, the people forget. On many points, the tradition loses something of its unambiguity. It is not possible to examine the accepted practice of law, since this was itself convulsed in the general chaos and partially lost. That which was forgotten must therefore be reconstructed from the Teachings still in existence.",
                "In both cases — whether the changes in the foundations of the nation’s existence lead to a narrowing of the tradition, or whether its destruction causes a breaking off of the tradition — the same task exists: to deduce the unknown (or that which has been forgotten) from that which is known (or not forgotten). This task can only be carried out by logical and scientific thought. Thus Kabbalah, the “transmitted” Oral Teachings, is accompanied by the second basic force of <i>s’vara</i> (opinion, common sense), the “deduced” Oral Teachings. As <i>s’vara</i> finds its way into the area of the Teachings, the history of the development of the Teachings begins. This is also the origin of the “differences of opinion.” Many people can have many “opinions” about the same topic. In this context, admittedly, one can hardly talk about a development in the conventional sense of the word. <i>S'vara</i> is not allowed to contradict a Kabbalah (see Section II, 3). There must be no conflict between the handed-down and the deduced teachings. That which is deduced is contained in that which is handed down. The <i>s’vara</i> does not supersede the Kabbalah: it can only supplement it. The Teachings develop. The driving force behind this development is the <i>s’vara. </i>As soon as the Kabbalah no longer satisfied the demands of ever-changing life, <i>s’vara</i> got to work in order to include that which is fundamental in the Teachings and thus be able to apply it in all of life’s situations. The postulate of the immutability of the Teachings contradicts the concept of a development. It is, however, immaterial whether as an outsider one accepts this postulate or not. It was a prerequisite of the Oral Teachings, whose method and nature were determined by this postulate. Pursuant to the assumption of the eternal validity of the Teachings, every <i>s’vara</i> which contradicted a tradition had to contain a logical mistake; because the task of the <i>s’vara</i> was simply to use logical necessity to deduce the consequences of the Teachings.",
                "The Kabbalah as the unequivocally transmitted intention of the law-maker supplements the Bible in an authoritative fashion. It is valid and cannot be contradicted, and tradition constitutes its sole grounds. This is how it is, because of the way it has been handed down in this fashion. In contrast, the <i>s’vara</i> expounds all of the Bible’s immanent content with logical necessity. It applies only when it is not contradicted, and can become law if it is logically compelling. Consequently, it cannot assert as does the Kabbalah; it must prove. “This is how it is” — is not adequate, the reason “why” must also be stated. This is the reason for the frequent expression in the Talmud: “If it is a Kabbalah, we are prepared to accept it; but if it is a <i>s’vara</i>, there is a response to it.”",
                "The Kabbalah, which chronologically follows on immediately from the Bible, the unambiguous and clear authoritative tradition, should be considered the original form of the Mishna. It is the proto-Mishna, it being irrelevant to the nature of this identity when the term “Mishna” first emerged. Both sources — Torah and proto-Mishna — were available to the <i>s’vara</i>, which at a later time had the task of developing the Teachings. As it began the explanatory interpretation of the Torah while performing this task, the Midrash came into being, and inasmuch as the <i>s’vara, </i>devoting itself to the same task, started from the proto-Mishna, the Gemara came into being. Since the Midrash and the Gemara have the same origin (the <i>s’vara</i>), it is obvious that they do not “fundamentally” differ from each other. The Midrash explains and interprets — the Bible; the Gemara also explains and interprets — the proto-Mishna. The difference between them is stylistic in nature, following the difference in style between the Bible and the proto-Mishna.",
                "Admittedly, nothing definite can be said about the age of the applied <i>s’vara</i>, the Midrash, and the Gemara. Since the need for the <i>s’vara</i> to find its way into the Teachings originated in the constant change in the circumstances of the nation’s life, here too — as everywhere involving organically caused lines of development — no “beginning” can be traced. Only retrospectively can it be ascertained: it came into being. But on the basis of the connection between applied <i>s’vara</i> and the change in the foundations of the people’s existence (as a result of development or catastrophes), the expository rule may be established: The most important turning points in Jewish history must also be turning points in the history of the Oral Teachings. Those epochs in the political history of Jewry, which are characterized for example by the headings: 1. Destruction of the First Temple and return from Babylon; 2. The Maccabees and the degeneration of the Hasmonean dynasty; 3. The destruction of the Second Temple; 4. The Bar Kochba uprising and the subsequent persecutions, correspond in the history of ideas to the names: 1. Ezra; 2. Hillel; 3. Rabbi Yochanan Ben Zakkai; 4. Rabbi Akiva and the generation of his students (Rabbi Meir et al.) up to Rabbi Yehuda Hanasi. The Babylonian exile and the harsh persecutions of the Pharisees in the time that the Hasmonean dynasty was gradually degenerating were principally major periods of oblivion. Ezra and Hillel in the main reconstructed the Teachings.",
                "When the actual Diaspora — life without home and Temple – began, following Rome’s destruction of the Jewish State (70 CE), it was Rabbi Yochanan Ben Zakkai who applied the eternal teachings to the completely new circumstances of the nation’s life; not adapting the Teachings to the circumstances, but shaping life itself by deriving the consequences from the Teachings. The epoch which began with Rabbi Akiva (around 100 CE) and ended with Rabbi Yehuda Hanasi was of completely different importance. The great masters of this epoch also played a part in the further development of the Teachings; but their historical task involved something else. Since Trajan’s cruel persecutions, which also triggered the Jews’ desperate and heroic war against Rome under Bar Kochba’s leadership, the Jewish center in Palestine had been in permanent decline. The danger of oblivion was greater than ever before. Also to be feared was the disappearance of all sources of scholastic authority, until then upheld by the chain of the living tradition, only rarely broken, and when broken soon re-established. Two things therefore had to happen:",
                "1) the compiling of the Oral Teachings, their delimitation and arrangement in accordance with a uniform system which would be accepted in all schools. Previously there were multiple arrangements, each master teaching according to his own method. In this way, by using a uniform teaching method, the danger of oblivion would be averted. (Today, the issue of whether the prohibition on writing the material down was already breached during time, is still a subject of controversy among scholars.)",
                "2) But then it was necessary to safeguard the endangered scholastic authority. This was dealt with by carrying out a rigorous critical sifting and examination which accompanied the compilation and ordering of the Teachings, thereby separating the chaff from the wheat. In this way, the personal scholastic authority of the masters was transferred to the Teachings themselves, which thus became their objective authority of the Teachings. The compilation, in the definitive redaction of Rabbi Yehuda Hanasi and generally called Mishna, does not constitute a pedagogical unit which came about through evolution. After all, it consists of the transmitted proto-Mishna and the concomitant proto-Gemara of the “teachers of the Mishna,” beginning at the very latest with Hillel and Shammai. It is rather a unit of authority. The conclusion of the Mishna is not a boundary point in terms of evolution, but a break in authority striven for with a particular objective in mind. After the conclusion of the Mishna, there could be no more contradictions between it and later pedagogical developments. As a result, the overall Mishna definitely acquired the significance of a Kabbalah. For the coming generations the disagreement between Hillel and Shammai about the explanation of a proto-Mishna constituted authoritative tradition requiring an “either — or” decision. A third possible explanation was excluded from the outset as non-authoritative, just as the proto-Mishna had itself once been for these scholars.",
                "This is the essence of the problem of the “conclusions” which we raised by way of introduction. In the Teachings, there are no conclusions whatsoever which have come about organically. The possibility of perpetual development has its roots in the nature of the perpetuity of the Teachings, just as the never-ending changeability of life determines the necessity of perpetual development. And even the view of the latest contemporary Talmudist may also be considered the Talmud, just like the view of the oldest representatives of the tradition, provided it has been proved by the Teachings as a whole. The difference is based only on a difference of authority. Even after the “conclusion” of the Mishna around 200 CE, the Teachings continued to develop in the actual Gemara — in both Babylon and Palestine — just as they had in the time of the teachers of the Mishna and in earlier times. Just as the Tanna’im once explained the proto-Mishna and explored its possible applications, so in the centuries from 200 to 300 CE in Palestine and from 200 to 500 in Babylon the masters, who now called themselves Amora’im, that is, spokesmen or interpreters, explained and explored the proto-Mishna as expanded by their predecessors’ <i>s’vara</i>. The relationship between teachers of the Mishna and proto-Mishna is the same as between Amora’im and Mishna. Similarly, the “conclusion” of the Gemara (by Rav Ashi in Babylon), just like that of the Mishna, is also not an end point to a process of organic development, but rather a break in authority brought about by the abnormal circumstances of the nation’s existence. As was the case in the Mishna of the <i>s’vara</i> of the teachers of the Mishna, so in the Gemara the <i>s’vara</i> of the interpreters of the Mishna became Kabbalah for future generations, and the resulting Halachah authoritatively determined the further unfolding of the Teachings.",
                "We therefore distinguish between various layers of tradition: the Bible and that which was originally handed down, or proto-Mishna; the <i>s’vara</i>, which became Kabbalah, of the teachers of the Mishna; and in addition the <i>s’vara</i> of the Amora’im, which became Kabbalah, or the real Gemara. The law that applies here is: increasing distance in time from the original epoch in which the Torah and the proto-Mishna were handed down means a reduced degree of authority. Why? Because this is not about the development of something new, but the unfolding of something ancient, everlasting, the Torah. The closer one lives to the sources of the teaching, the more reliably will the <i>s’vara</i> meet the intention of the law-maker as the Teachings unfold. This is the reason why the teachers of the Mishna must not conflict with the proto-Mishna, the Amora’im must not conflict with the Tanna’im, and the generations following the conclusion of the Gemara must not conflict with the Amora’im.",
                "In this way the sequence of tradition and authority could continue to our times; for the Teachings are everlasting, they flow forever through the millennia, accompanying the people on all its paths through all the countries of its tragic destinies. It cannot be concluded, and it will only be brought to an end if the Teachings themselves are brought to an end. The “conclusions” of Mishna, Gemara, Maimonides, Shulchan Aruch and so on simply mean the channeling, caused by the historical terrain, of this powerful river, so that — despite the anomaly of Jewish history — it remains aligned with the fountainhead of its beginnings."

                "<b><i>2. The Commentaries</i></b>",
                "The claim to authority, which is enjoyed by individual epochs to varying degrees, means that the Jewish scholar of all times has the same task: to write a commentary on the authoritative tradition. Hence the developmental history of the Oral Teachings can be defined as a history of commentaries. The proto-Mishna comments on the Bible, the Mishna of the Tanna’im is a commentary on the proto-Mishna, just as the Gemara itself explains the Mishna, and so on. It is in this constant commenting by all generations, a commenting which ultimately seeks only to explain the Bible, that the Teachings unfold. This is made possible by two factors: firstly, that each generation provides its commentary from a different basis to its life; and secondly, the very real and unfathomable profundity of the Teachings. The interaction of these two factors means that every generation can become aware of a new statement by the Teachings, which is nevertheless the age-old eternal word.",
                "The full significance of the Teachings can only be “lifted” layer by layer. For each generation there is a particular layer which could not be uncovered previously, because it was not even visible until it could be seen from a very specific situation of life. The ever-changing spirit of the times draws people’s attention to new correlations, and the equally ever-changing basis of man’s life constantly creates new angles of observation which constantly make visible new depths of the Teachings. An individual can often experience the way in which words of the Bible, familiar from earliest childhood, appear in a new light at a certain moment, acquiring richer meanings. In this way a new layer of meaning is opened up, but only because this person has changed as life has brought about greater maturity, or as a result of some deeply felt experience, and therefore reads the Teachings from a different perspective. But when this happens, there will always be the feeling that what is new is really not new at all, but rather the only correct meaning of the ancient word. This feeling is the sole criterion for the new, in reality being nothing other than a layer of meaning contained in the eternal word of the Teachings since the beginning of time. No commenting can take the unfolding of the Teachings further unless the commentator can be convinced: that all of this was transmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai. The only decisive factor in this is that God also revealed this special layer of meaning in the “word.” The fact that this has only become comprehensible at a certain time makes no difference at all to its nature as revelation.",
                "“Turn it and turn it again, for everything is in it” (Hagiga 15b) is the meaning of this uninterrupted activity of commenting. Every commentary should be a new “turn” or change, which reveals new “content” of the Teachings. God has put “everything” into the Teachings; it is up to us to lift everything out of them again; which is why the activity of commenting is a creative feat, again and again revealing new truths to us.",
                "Hence, if the activity of Talmud scholars since the conclusion of the Talmud has amounted to nothing more than commentary, this represents nothing fundamentally new. The break in authority around 500 CE expanded the “tradition,” enlarging the material to be commented on; but the nature of the commenting remained the same. As always in the history of the Teachings, the same questions have been asked since the conclusion of the Talmud: What does the text mean? What do the Teachings require? — And as always in the history of the Teachings, since 500 CE as well, new factors and correlations are revealed as these questions are posed afresh, on the basis of a hitherto unprecedented form of human existence. Which is why in our days too, commenting still means the creative unfolding of the Teachings.",
                "The question as to the meaning of the text is answered by those commentaries which basically relate directly to the text, that is, the explanation of Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaki, (known as Rashi), the most important Talmud commentator and translator of all times, without whose work it would for centuries have been impossible to read the Talmud. Rashi’s commentary was supplemented by “additions” (<i>tosafot</i>), primarily by his students. There are various bodies of writings which try to elucidate the ever-topical requirements of the Teachings:",
                "1. The extensive body of responsa literature, belonging to the oldest post-Talmudic literary genre of the Oral Teachings, which deals predominantly with the ever-recurring “new cases,” growing more voluminous from generation to generation and making an overall view practically impossible today;",
                "2. Those works which summarize the Halachic (that is, normative) result of the Talmud and responsa literature, such as the “Rif” by Rabbi Yitzhak Alfasi, Maimonides’ <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, and Rabbi Yosef Caro’s <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>.",
                "The process of “commenting” is never over. Questions are always being asked afresh about the meaning of the text and the obligations imposed by the Teachings in the “present,” because the present is always something new, and answers must be given from scratch, again and again. In this way, they also lead to new breaks in authority. “Discussion” goes on between two such breaks, each of which covers an epoch; between two epochs, each of which is separated from the other by a break in authority, the discussion turns into “commentary.” Thus commentary follows commentary: but everything focuses on the same eternal core — the Torah. Thus in the course time revelation is “revealed” to us by the “commenting.”"

He tries the poor man to see whether he can accept suffering without grumbling, as it says: “May pursued misery lead to your house.” (Is. 58:7) If the rich man is steadfast in his trial and is charitable, see how he enjoys his money in this world, and the credit shall stand him in good stead in the next world, and the Lord shall save him from trial in hell, as it says (Psalms 41:2): “Happy is he who considers the poor; the Lord will deliver him in the day of evil.” If the poor man endures in his time of trial and does not act willfully, he will receive twice as much in the next world, as it says (Psalms 18:28): “For you shall help the poor.” From whom can you learn this?

            "V. STYLE",
            "It was inevitable that the systematizing examination of the Oral Teachings which began in Rabbi Akiva’s time would gradually lead to a breaking of the writing-down ban. To this day, when this happened has not been settled definitively. In the view of many scholars, the Mishna was already written down by Rabbi Yehuda Hanasi, while other no less distinguished figures believe that it was only together with the Gemara that it was recorded in writing. Whatever the situation, like so much in the history of the Oral Teachings, the breaking of the ban on writing them down was undoubtedly caused by the tragic destinies of the Jewish people, in the course of which neither masters nor disciples had the requisite leisure or trouble-free existence which enabled them to continue teaching and studying the entire body of the oral tradition by heart. In order to counter the danger of oblivion for all time, the oral teachings were written down. However, since this constituted the violation of a strict rule, permitted only in the interests of the Teachings themselves and out of factual necessity, the Teachings were only written down to the extent actually required. The style of the Talmud shows us that there was always an awareness of this state of affairs: the Teachings are written down — not in order to provide written expression of the “oral” material, but only with the intention of ensuring that it was not forgotten. The oral character of the material was to be maintained despite being written down. This was achieved by means of a method in which the spoken words were written down as they were actually uttered, altering nothing in them in the writing-down process. This is what gives this written recording of the Teachings its characteristic flavor.",
            "The spoken and the written word are two fundamentally differing forms of expressing thought, feeling, and so on. One and the same thought needs to be represented differently according to whether it is uttered or “written out.” The spoken and the written word are independent of each other, both always relating directly to the inner content which is to be expressed. If now, with the breaching of the ban on writing down, the spoken word was written down unaltered, this means: this operation did not create the written form of expression for the content of the teaching, only the written notes of the oral form of expression. That which is written down — the notes — is not the written word of the Teachings, but the recorded “spoken word.” It was not the Teachings which here acquired a written expression appropriate to and hence intrinsically associated with them; rather, their oral form of expression was technically recorded. Thus the record became what it should have been — a mnemonic aid designed to make it impossible to forget; but the Teachings remained what they were — oral teachings. The Talmudic style is the style of the spoken word, not the written.",
            "This record of the spoken word is, however, characterized above all by two “shortcomings.” By its nature the spoken word is shorter than the written because it does not need to say everything itself. It is always spoken in a very specific situation which “has its own say,” expanding on the content of the words. In a conversational context, the slightest movement accompanying a word can intimate an entire sentence. And in the conversation of the scholars at the Talmud academies, the question “why?” or “how is this known?,” when uttered by certain people at a certain moment, could be so full of meaning that, when expressed in writing, it would require additional explanation. When the spoken word is transcribed, its contextually determined wealth of meaning is not recorded. The word becomes impoverished, or alternatively it becomes too limited for its original substantive content: it becomes a “keyword.” Furthermore, the characteristic form of recording the Oral Teachings is incapable of expressing another essential characteristic of the spoken word: its intonation. The same word can mean different things; depending on the tone of voice in which it is uttered, it may be meant ironically or seriously, be a question or an answer, express hope or resignation, amazement and doubt. What the speaker can say with a gesture, a particular tone of voice, must often be explained by the writer in a lengthy treatise. It is only the word which is written down, stripped of its rhythm, its intonation. Hence the spoken word which is recorded in writing in the absence of its intonation and its “melody” is nothing but a keyword for the speaker. Yet these two “shortcomings” made possible an inspired breaking of the ban on writing down: the Oral Teachings were reduced to writing, and yet the Teachings were not written down. The spoken word which was written down was the keyword of memory.",
            "What this means, however, is: a memory must always be present, that is, the Talmud always had to be taught orally according to its record, handed down from masters to students. The keyword had to be re-resolved into the spoken word. Just as the knot in the handkerchief is only a reminder to the person who has tied it, so the mnemonic writing down of the oral form of expression of the Teachings could only be turned back into the spoken word by those whom it reminded of something, in other words by those people who, like the generations before they were written down, received the Teachings in the houses of study from their masters and then only needed to review them on the basis of the written recording. Basically, nothing in this scenario has changed to this very day. The “knot language” of the record can only be understood by the person whom it “reminds” of something already learned. The real importance of the fundamental Talmud commentaries, which for the most part are founded on tradition, lies in the fact that they try to explore the didactic content in the oral form of expression of the Teachings. Resolving the written-down material into the spoken word, however, continues to remain the task of the person studying. Above all, “oral teachings” have remained this changing of the “notes” back into the “word.”",
            "The Talmud cannot be “read,” it must be “spoken.” This is also the reason for the Rashi commentary’s characteristic expressions about certain sentences: “bitmiya,” that is, “this is to be expressed with the intonation of a question,” or: “benichuta,” meaning: “this is to be uttered with an intonation of ‘gentleness’ (e.g. the reply, a confirmation, etc.).” The traditional sing-song with which the Talmud is studied, the <i>niggun</i> of studying, is the original Talmud commentary; it is the conversion of the recorded spoken word into the living word of the Oral Teachings. (The Talmud has no punctuation, because speaking also has no punctuation. The <i>niggun</i> of studying is at the same time an “acoustic punctuation.” So one can say in French: C’est le ton qui fait le Talmud. (It is the intonation which makes the Talmud.)"

At first, only individual tractates were printed; in Italy, by Soncino, and in Lisbon. It was not until after Pope Leo X, in the course of the struggle between the Dominicans and Reuchlin, expressed his wish for the work to be printed that the entire Talmud was able to appear in print. The “editio princeps” was published from 1520-1523 in Venice by Daniel Bomberg, the Christian owner of a printing works from Antwerp. Works by Maimonides, Nachmanides, the Aruch and so on had already appeared previously.",
            "Besides the Bomberg edition, for all later editions the version by Justinian (Venice, around 1550) was of major significance. The later editions retained the pagination of the Justinian copy. Hence today all Talmud editions have the same page numbering.",
            "The censored Basel edition appeared from 1578 to 1581. With its additions and textual corrections, the Frankfurt am Main edition (1720-1722) became a model for all later copies.",
            "Apart from countless individual tractates, well-known editions of the entire Talmud were published in Lemberg (Lvov), Constantinople, Salonica, Cracow, Amsterdam, Frankfurt an der Oder, Berlin, Sulzbach, Dierenfurt, Sitomir, Vienna, Vilna, and elsewhere.",
            "Although we have so many printed copies of the Talmud, only occasional Talmud manuscripts have come down to us.

Because it is said: ‘My daughter I gave to this man as his wife.’ Why [is it said] ‘this’? — It is required for what R. Jonah taught. For R.

If she says, ‘I am married’, and then she says, ‘I am unmarried’, she is not believed, but if she gives a plausible reason for her words she is believed. And so it once happened with a great woman, who was great in beauty, and men were eager to betroth her, and she said to them, ‘I am betrothed’. After a time she became betrothed.

                "In our opinion it is impossible to judge the attitude of Talmudic Judaism towards the non-Jewish environment, using primarily a random collection of quotations. This question can only be answered within the framework of a scientific investigation of the entire Talmud. Unfortunately we are still in the beginning stages of such an enquiry.",
                "As a consequence of the intensity of the controversy surrounding the Talmud it was impossible to prevent misunderstandings, inaccuracies and mistakes from taking root, especially in the anti-Jewish literature of quotations from the Talmud. These inaccuracies are being repeated over and over today, and it may be presumed that in many cases this is done in good faith. We do not intend to continue the controversy on the subject, and even if we may discuss some well-known quotations from the Talmud later on, it will not be by way of apology.

                "<b><i>1. “You are called man”</i></b>",
                "In which context was the above sentence mentioned? Eisenmanger quotes (I,15) from Bava Metzia 114b, as follows: Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai says, the graves of gentiles or other non-Jews do not confer impurity, since it is said (Ezekiel 34:31): You are my sheep, my flock, you are men. You are called men, whereas the other nations of the world are not called men, but animals.",
                "The above passage was quoted nearly correctly, with the exception of the two words “but animals”. This is an addition made by Eisenmanger himself, and it is found neither in Bava Metzia nor in any other place in the Talmud. Yet it seems that even without the aforementioned addition the passage is serious enough. Therefore, the falsification raises even greater suspicion. Another inaccuracy is the use of the plural “men”. The passage in Bava Metzia says: “You are called man (human)” in the singular. In Yevamot (60b and 61a) we learn first of all which halachic definition is being discussed. There the same saying of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai is quoted in a more exact manner, as follows: “And so Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai says: It is clear that idolaters do not defile an enclosed space as it is said, ‘and you are my flock etc.’ (as quoted above from Bava Metzia)”. From Yevamot we learn first of all that what R. Shimon ben Yochai said was not accepted by the Sages; they do not distinguish between Jewish and non-Jewish graves. In Halachic practice a “majority” opinion is accepted over the opinion of that of the “individual”. (See Schulhan Aruch,Yore Deah, sec. 372). It is also clear here that the issue is not one of impurity due to contact with a corpse. In this instance, even the “individual opinion”, R., does not distinguish between Jews and non-Jews. Surprisingly, on this point there is no difference between Jews and gentiles even according to R. Shimon ben Yochai, and the impurity caused by contact with a gentile corpse is of the same degree as that caused by contact with a Jewish corpse; this is in no way comparable to the impurity caused by contact with a dead animal. R. Shimon ben Yochai speaks only of “impurity within the tent”, that is, the impurity caused by being present together with a corpse in the same enclosed space. Had R. Shimon ben Yochai seriously considered gentiles as not being “man” or human, he would have made the same distinction that he does in the case of “impurity within the tent” in the case of impurity caused by physical contact.",
                "R. Shimon ben Yochai’s intention, when he said “You are called man” can only be explained by the saying of Ravina which is connected to it. Ravina said (Yevamot, ibid.): “When the Torah excludes (the non-Jew) from impurity within the tent, as it is written [Bamidbar 19:14], a person who dies in a tent (enclosed space), does it also exclude him from impurity caused by contact? – In other words: regarding impurity within a tent it is said: a person who dies in a tent – any dead person in a tent. In the quotation above, from Ezekiel (ibid.), the expression “man” should be read in connection with “you” – you are man. R. Shimon ben Yochai deduces from this that in every instance that the text uses the term “man”, this does not refer to all men, but only to Jews. This is a Talmudic analogy based on an identical term in the text, which was discussed in Section II, 1; in the text before us it should be interpreted thus:",
                "In the book of Ezekiel the term “man” refers to Jews.",
                "The same term “man” appears in the issue of “impurity in a tent”.",
                "Thus the term “man” used in the issue of “impurity in a tent” refers only to Jews.",
                "This analogy between “man” in the book of Ezekiel and “man” in Bamidbar is necessary for the only reason that the word “man – human” includes non-Jews as well. However, they wanted to prove, by the use of an analogy that certain laws of purity refer only to Jews, since the sentence in the Biblical text “if a man should die in a tent” means: If one of you should die in a tent…here there is no general rule regarding non-Jews, rather a legal determination of the usage of the term “man” in the Biblical text.",
                "This interpretation of words, which is determined legalistically by the use of analogy, appears often in the Talmud. Professor Hoffman<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi David Zvi Hoffman (1843-1921) was a decisor and Biblical commentator. He was a student of Rabbis Moshe Schick and Azriel Hildesheimer. Upon the latter’s death he succeeded him as head of the Rabbinical College in Berlin. He was a researcher and teacher of the Talmud. After the establishment of the “Agudat Yisrael” party he became a member of its Council of Sages.</i>, in his book (“Shuhan Aruch”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The complete title: Der Schulchan-Aruch und die Rabbinen ὒber das Verhἂltniẞ der Juden zu Andersglἂuben [The Schulhan Aruch and the Rabbis on the attitude of the Jews towards other religions]. This book was written after the appearance of the books Judenspidgel of Dr. Justus (Aron Israel Brimann, see above) and Der Judenspiegel im Lichte der Wahrheit [The Mirror of the Jews in the Light of Truth, by Jakob Ecker], which contained false laws from the Schulhan Aruch in order to prove the racist character of Judaism.</i>, Berlin 1885) has already called attention to several examples, well-known to those well-versed in the Talmud. In order to illustrate this legalistic interpretation of words we will just mention the following: In Menahot (10:1) it is written: “A finger means only the right finger”, since in one instance in the text it is written: “the right finger” (Levit. 14:16). In Talmudic style one could render the sentence quoted above like the statement of R. Shimon ben Yochai, and then it would read: The fingers of the right hand are called fingers, and the other fingers are not called fingers. No one would even consider that this was the generalization as to fingers of the left hand. The same is true of the sentence: “You are called man”.",
                "The proof: Besides the term “man” there are several other terms in the Hebrew language for “man/human being” such as “enosh – human being”, “ish–man/person” etc. Nowhere is it found that these words are not used for non-Jews. On the contrary, in several places it is emphasized that these expressions are so broad, that they refer to non-Jews as well. In Tr. Gitin (47a) it is written: “Rava said, although idolaters cannot purchase (land) in Eretz Israel in order to exempt in from tithes, as it is written “because the land belongs to Me” (Levit. 25:23), i.e., the holiness of the land belongs to me, yet the idolater may dig wells, pits and caves, as it is written: The heavens belong to the Lord but the earth was given to man (Psalms 115:16)”. Hence we see that the expression “man” proves that the sentence speaks not only of the Jews, but for all mankind, that is, non-Jews as well. As to the prohibition of cursing G-d, it is written in Tr. Sanhedrin (56a) “The sages learned ‘man’ (written once, Leviticus 24:15, in connection with cursing G-d, and that would have been enough) but it was written twice; ‘a man, even a man’ meaning “anyone”. This is to warn idolaters as well as Jews that this is prohibited. We could assume that since the Torah was given to the Jewish people that the meaning of “ish-man” was intended solely for a Jewish man. However, from the repetition of the term “ish-man” we deduce that it means: everyone – that is, non-Jews as well.",
                "The manner in which the aforementioned sentence of R. Shimon ben Yochai was distorted, out of ignorance and an outburst of hatred, arises from the following: Like R. Shimon ben Yochai, R. Meir also thinks that the word “man” in the Torah applies only to Jews, as it is written in the book of Ezekiel: “You are my flock, my grazing flock, you are men” [also in Ezekiel 34, 31]. However, the same R. Meir has stated in many other places (Tr. Avodah Zarah 3a; Sanhedrin 49a; Bava Kama 38a): “How do we know that even an idolater who is steeped in Torah is like the High Priest? We learn from (Leviticus 18:5) “if the man performs them (the commandments) and lives by them – Priests, Levites and Israelites; it states “the man”, the article “the” indicating that even an idolater who is steeped in Torah is like the High Priest”. The aforementioned quotation clearly shows that R. Meir, like R. Shimon ben Yochai, sees the word “man” as referring solely to Jews, and there was nothing further that he could say than: Gentiles are not considered as people. (The generality of the expression “the man” means that the Biblical text refers in this specific instance to all men, that is also to gentiles.)",
                "In the words of R. Meir here there is no internal conflict whatsoever. According to the literal interpretation it is determined that: The Biblical text refers to Jews when it uses the expression “man”. However, such interpretations can only be used if the expression is exactly the same. If we determine that according to the literal interpretation of the word, “man”, which actually includes all humanity, is used in the Biblical text only in reference to the Jews, then this will only be valid as to the form “man – that is: any person”, but not to any other grammatical form, for example: “the man” using the definite article. In the aforementioned quotation R. Meir bases his argument on the text: “which the man will do” – that is: the man who acts according to them (the commandments). The parallel meaning of the word “man” – any man, is not applicable to “the man” – with the definite article, and so the word returns to its original meaning of man in general, including the non-Jew. (The issue becomes clearer if one remembers that the literal interpretation is based on Talmudic analogy. Yet the analogy forms the underlying condition for this, namely the identity of the expressions.",
                "Thus it is absolutely clear: only when dealing with the word “man”, and only in this grammatical form does R. Shimon ben Yochai say that when the Bible uses it, it is referring to Jewish men and not to gentiles. However nowhere in the Talmud is it found that one cannot use the term “man” about humanity as a whole. Therefore the translation of R. Shimon ben Yochai’s sentence should be as follows: “You are called ‘man'” [without the definite article] (In the Biblical text, that is, the Bible relates to you when using this word), while the other nations of the world are not called “man” [without the definite article]; the use of this word in this grammatical form is not intended for them).",
                "In order to show just how far the Talmud is from perceiving the nations of the world as inhuman, several further examples will be presented. Many more examples could be added. On the basis of Tr. Berachot 58a, the Schulhan Aruch (Orach Haim 224:7) rules: “Whoever sees sages of other nations who are wise in the ways of the world should say the blessing – Blessed art Thou Our G-d Lord of the Universe who has given of His wisdom to [one of] flesh and blood.” Similarly it is ruled that when one sees gentile royalty, one must say: Blessed art Thou Our G-d Lord of the Universe who has bestowed of His Glory to (a person made of) flesh and blood”. As for respecting the aged it is written in Tr. Kidushin (33a): “Isi ben Yehuda says, one should stand up before an elderly person (Leviticus 19:32), even an elderly gentile (ibid. 32b). R. Yochanan stated, the law is according to Isi ben Yehuda.",
                "R. Yochanan would stand up before aged Amorites, saying “How many troubles have passed over these folk?” Rava would not rise, but gave them respect; Abaye would give a hand to the aged (in support). Rava would send his servant; Abbaye would send his eunuchs.",
                "In Tr. Berachot 17a one reads: A favorite saying of Abbaye was – A man should always be prudent, from fear of Heaven. A soft answer turns away wrath (cf. Prov. 15:1), and one should always strive to be on the best of terms with his brothers, his relatives, and with all men, even with a non-Jew on the street; so that he be beloved from above, and well-liked below, and popular among men. It is told of R. Yochanan ben Zakkai that no-one ever managed to greet him first even a Gentile on the street. (R. Yochanan ben Zakkai lived through the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE, was the great reorganizer of Jewish life in Yavneh, and was the undisputed leading personality of his generation. Abbaye, born in Babylon in 280 CE, is a typically representative Talmudist. In common jargon, “To learn Abbaye and Rava” (his colleague) simply means to study Talmud.)",
                "So also the Shulhan Aruch (Yoreh Deah 244:7): “You should respect even an aged idolater (meaning: you should address him respectfully, be considerate of his age while conversing, etc.) and you should extend a hand to support him”. On the drowning of the Egyptians in the Red Sea it is written in the Talmud (Sanhedrin 39b): “At that time the ministering angels wished to sing praises to the Lord (as they did every day). The Lord said to them, ‘My creations are drowning and you wish to sing praises to me?'”. One can compare this Talmudic Aggadah, which is not halachic, with a determination in the Schulchan Aruch (Orach Haim 490:4), according to which one does not say the Hallel in its entirety on the intermediate days and on the last day of Passover. According to the explanation of the compiler of the Schulchan Aruch in his commentary for the Tur there, this was decided because on the seventh day of the festival the Egyptians drowned, as is written, “At the downfall of your enemy do not rejoice” (Prov. 24:17), and this sentence refers also to the aforementioned passage in Sanhedrin.",
                "In the Yalkut Genesis, sec. 76, the following saying is found: “G-d said (to Moses), there is no bias before me between an Israelite and a non-Jew, between a man and a woman, between a male slave or a maidservant. Keep a commandment and receive its reward as it is said: Your justice is as the mountains of the Lord etc. (Psalms 36:7)”. And only the continuation of this idea is in Eliyah Raba (10:9) where it is said: “I bring the heavens and the earth on me a witnesses, whether a man or a woman, a gentile or a Jew, a slave or a maidservant, everything depends upon a man’s actions”. In Avodah Zarah (10b) is written: “(The idolater Antoninus asked R. Yehuda HaNasi): Will I enter the world to come? He answered him: Yes! Said he, But it is written (Obadiah 1:18), There will be no remnant of the house of Esau. (and received the answer) This refers to one who follows the acts of Esau, as we have learned…This is in line with the Talmud in Tr. Sanhedrin (105a), where the argument between R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua was decided in accordance with the Mishna in favor of the opinion of R. Yehoshua, that only the evil gentile (like Bilaam) will have no place in the world to come, but this is not so for the gentile who is not wicked. This principle is also laid down (according to Talmudic sources) by the Rambam (Laws of Kings 8:11), and it was unanimously accepted by all the commentators and decisors who came after them (see the commentary of Bet Yosef on the Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 367, and many others). Just how alive this principle is in Judaism is proved by the fact that this principle is well-known to anyone who is well-versed in the Talmud in the words: All the righteous of the nations have a portion in the world to come. However, as far as we know the contents of this statement are not formulated in these words in any Talmudic source. The source of this formulation is evidently Jewish folklore."

                "<b><i>2. The discriminatory laws</i></b>",
                "What of the discriminatory laws or “judgments lacking in equality before the law”? What about “double standards” in the Talmud? – As we have already mentioned in the introduction we are unable at this time to answer this question in a convincing manner. Research into the Talmud cannot yet answer this question. For now we can only try to turn our attention to a number of important points.",
                "In the Talmud there are a large number of terms for non-Jews, such as gentile – a stranger, Goy — nation (son of a different nation), Samaritan – a dweller in Kuta, Akum – star-worshiper (an acronym for worshipers of the stars and constellations). To any intelligent person it is clear that one cannot substitute one appellation for another at random. But it seems that today it is nearly impossible to find anyone who can define the exact differences and possible nuances between the various names. The lack of clarity on this issue increased due to the censorship in the Talmud, and lead to complete confusion. They changed the terms “gentile”, “stranger” and “goy” indiscriminately for “Akum” or “Samaritan” with the intention of removing from the Talmud any unpleasant reference which could perhaps be applied to Christians as well. (Using the terms “gentile”, “stranger” or “goy” it would be possible to include the Christians, but it would not be possible if they used the term “Samaritan” – a son of the city Kuta, or “Akum” – an star-worshiper. This was the rationale of the censors.)",
                "However, it is clear that the distinction between Jews and non-Jews can be made by at least two criteria: by the social-political criterion and by the religious criterion. The latter includes the term “Akum” (general term for idol worshiper), and the former the term “gentile” – stranger, just as one would not interchange the term “stranger” [a son of a different country] with the term “barbarian” which denotes a certain level of culture.",
                "a. The gentile – stranger",
                "The term gentile-stranger presupposes the existence of a Jewish State or an autonomous Jewish society. The gentile is one who does not live permanently in such an autonomous Jewish society, and whose laws do not apply to him. That is, not the gentile himself, but more precisely: the “stranger” [a son of another country] the non-Jew. (See Deuteronomy 29:21: “and the stranger who comes from a far-off land…”; Samuel II 15: 19-20 “And the king said to Ittai the Gittite, Why should you go with us,? Return and stay with the king because you are a stranger, an exile from your place. Yesterday you came to us and today I should trouble you to go with us?” Or quite clearly in the prayer of King Solomon at the dedication of the Temple, Kings I 8:41-43: “And even to the stranger who does not belong to the Jewish people, and who has come from a distant land for Your name’s sake…You will listen (to his prayer) from the Heavens…”)",
                "On the other hand, a non-Jew who has settled [permanently] in an autonomous Jewish society is called a “ger” or literally: a resident, guest – that is: not a native citizen.",
                "Certain laws served to regulate the relationships between the “gentile” – “stranger” [a foreign resident] and the Jewish society. The most well-known law of the all is the prohibition of charging interest or “The Law of Usury”,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The German expression is: Wuchergesetz. The word Wucher meaning “increase”, “abundance” originally had a positive meaning, but over time the term acquired a negative connotation, due to the prohibition of the Church to the charging of interest.</i> as it is called. The relevant instruction in the Biblical text is generally quoted in mistranslation: you may take exorbitant interest from a non-Jew, and it is forbidden to take exorbitant interest from your fellow-Jew (Deuteronomy 23:21). The correct translation of the sentence is: It is permissible to take interest from the stranger (that is: whoever is outside a conceivable autonomous Jewish society), but it is forbidden to take interest from your fellow-Jew. The Jewish-Talmudic law does not differentiate between usury and interest. Even the smallest consideration on the loan is forbidden, for the lender to give and for the borrower to take. (The sages of Talmud even forbade gifts which might be construed as “interest”, and there is even a Talmudic instruction which forbids greeting the lender in an unusually polite manner, since this could be construed as “interest in the form of words”.) Such a law, which is more like a social convention, diverging considerably from principles of justice, is only valid if there is reciprocity. If I am forbidden to take interest, then I should be able to take a loan without paying interest. However this reciprocity existed only within the framework of Jewish society. The “stranger” certainly was not aware of the stringent prohibition of taking interest, so it would be illogical in a legal sense, since while this law is binding on all “fellow-Jews”, it does not obligate the “stranger”. The stranger was permitted to take interest, therefore it was also permitted to lend to him with interest.",
                "The same thing is true of a lost article belonging to a non-Jew. In Talmudic law there is no obligation to return the lost article to him. The basis for this instruction was the fact that the stranger did not accept the Biblical precept concerning the return of lost property, not because of hatred of the Jews, but because in non-Jewish society, as it was known at that time, there was no such instruction. Again the reciprocity which was the only basis for such laws was non-existent.",
                "The proof: According to the law in the Talmud one is obligated to return lost property only if the owner has not lost hope of retrieving it. If it was certain that the owner would have given up hope of retrieving his property, then the lost property would be considered ownerless, and the finder would be permitted to keep it. However, in Bava Metzia (24b) it is told: A person who found a bundle with four zuzim (coins) which had fallen into the River Biran, came to R. Yehuda, who told him, “Go and publicize it.” But is this not the same as though it had been cast into the sea? The River Biran is different: Since the bundle was stopped on the way, the owners had not lost hope of retrieving it, and the majority there, were strangers. Hence we learn that the law is not according to R. Shimon ben Eliezer, even if the majority were non-Jews. No (replies the Talmud), the case of the River Biran is different because the Jews dammed it and dredged it. Since the Jews dammed it, the bundle must have fallen from a Jew, and since the Jews dredged it the owners had not despaired of finding it. That is, since the workers were Jews, familiar with the laws of returning lost property, the Jewish owner did not give up hope. However if the workers had been non-Jews, the Jewish finder would have been permitted to keep the lost property. Since the Jew who lost the property would have to take into account that workers who might find it would be under no obligation to return it, he would lose hope of having it returned to him.",
                "From the above passage from Bava Metzia we see also that there is no obligation to return lost property found in a city where the majority of its residents are non-Jews, even if it were known for a certainty that a Jew had lost it, since the Jewish loser would take into account that a non-Jew would find it, and so he would give up hope of having it returned to him. (See also Shulhan Aruh, Hoshen Hamishpat 259:3) From this it is clear that they have established the principle: In the matter of a “stranger”, who does not acknowledge the obligation of returning lost property, there is therefore no obligation to return his lost property.",
                "The same is true for the rest of the few “discriminatory laws” regarding the stranger. The status of the “stranger” in Jewish-Talmudic law is determined only by specifically legal considerations, all of which are based on one principle, the principle of reciprocity. (Note: This is the basis in theory. In actuality there was the hope for a different approach, even towards the stranger. In Bava Metzia 60b for example, it is written: “Whoever increases his wealth by taking interest or profit from the poor, amasses it for another, who will be kind to them” (Proverbs 28:8)… Rav Nachman said: Huna explained to me, There is no need for this verse except on behalf of idolaters. On this Rava assailed Rav Nachman: “You shall cause the stranger to deal in interest” (Deut. 23:21). What does “deal in interest” mean? Not “take interest”? No, “pay interest!” And so also in Makkot 24a: His money he did not lend in interest (Ps. 15) – even to idolaters.",
                "On the Mishna which says that those who lend with interest are not qualified to be witnesses in court, Tr. Sanhedrin 25b states: Regarding loans with interest, both the lender and the borrower (are disqualified). And when are they reinstated? When they tear up their documents and make complete repentance. It is forbidden to charge interest even from a gentile.",
                "Regarding the law for lost property, see the note on p. 91.",
                "b. Akum — idolater",
                "We can see from the following example how exacting the Talmud was in its use of this principle. This example brings us from the political-social term – stranger – to the religious-cultural term – Akum. We come to distinguish between the relation of the Talmud to the “stranger”, which is based on the law, and its position towards the Akum – the idolater, which is determined from the religious-cultural point of view.",
                "In the Mishna, Bava Kama (37b), it is written: “If an ox belonging to a Jew which gores an ox dedicated for Temple use, or if a dedicated animal gores one belonging to a layman it is exempt (from payment of damages), as it is written (Exodus 21:35) ‘his neighbor’s ox’ and not a dedicated one. An ox belonging to a Jew which gores one belonging to a Canaanite is exempt (from payment of damages), while one belonging to a Canaanite which gores one belonging to a Jew, whether it was not known previously to be dangerous or had gored in the past, must pay the full value.” It is clear that one should not translate the term “Canaanite” as a general term for non-Jew. It would appear that the source of this instruction was from a period when the memory of the Canaanites living in Eretz Israel was still fresh. The Jews lived in a state of war with the Canaanites during the capture of the land at the time of Joshua, and for many years thereafter. From this we can understand the enactment of discriminatory laws concerning the Canaanite. But the Gemara, whose function it is to explain the Mishna, does not leave it at that. The Gemara framed the problem (Bava Kama 38a) in sharper and clearer legal terms than did all the Eisenmengers and Rohlings: “Make up your mind. If ‘neighbor’ is specific, then a Canaanite’s ox which gores a Jew’s ox should also be exempt. And if ‘neighbor’ is not specific, then we must convict the ox of a Jew which gores that of a Canaanite as well.” Said R. Abohu: The Bible states (Habakuk 3:6), ‘He stood and meted out the earth; He saw and caused the nations to wander.’ He regarded the seven Noahide commandments; because the nations did not observe them, He arose and released endemnity of Israel (towards them).",
                "Thus a new element entered the discussion. The legal principle of reciprocity is cancelled by the religious principle, meaning: the principle of reciprocity is not applicable concerning those who do not observe the seven Noahide laws. And so the Talmud states clearly: only in similar cases is this particular Mishna applicable, according to which a Jew is not liable to pay restitution, while the Canaanite is liable. In this manner the historic character of the “Canaanite” has become a type of person who does not observe the seven Noahide laws. As for all other non-Jews, the principle of reciprocity is applicable, as was clearly stated by the Talmud. (See also the interpretation of the Meiri [at the end of the 13th century], which is quoted by the Shita Mekubetset.)",
                "What is the meaning of non-observance of the seven Noahide laws? – The seven Noahide laws (Sanhedrin 46a) deal with the following issues: a. Justice (the obligation to set up a legal system); b. desecrating G-d’s name (the prohibition on cursing, using the name of G-d); c. the prohibition of idolatry; d. the prohibition of incest (including adultery); e. the prohibition of bloodshed; f. the prohibition of theft; g. the prohibition of eating meat cut from a live animal. While, according to Jewish perception the Torah was given originally only to the Jewish people, and no non-Jew is obligated to observe it, and it is even forbidden to force him to keep its precepts (see Rambam, Laws of Kings, 8:9), the aforementioned precepts are obligatory on all mankind. All non-Jews who recognize these commandments and keep them diligently, are considered from the Jewish perspective as “Righteous among the nations” and have a place in the world to come, as we stated above in paragraph 1 (See also Rambam, Laws of Kings, 8:11). In all of the Talmud there is not one law which discriminates against them. (If they are ‘strangers’ – then the principle of reciprocity also applies to them, it being legally justified.) On the other hand, discriminatory laws do apply to non-Jews who have rejected the Noahide Laws in principle, or have shown by their life-styles that they do not acknowledge them. These are the ones whom the Talmud calls Akum. The discriminatory laws concerning the Akum are of a relative minor scope. The Akum was never without legal rights or considered outside the Jewish law. In fact, in the Talmud there are differences of opinion as to whether it is permissible or forbidden to steal from an Akum. It was decided unequivocally (Bava Kama 113a-b) that it is forbidden to distinguish between a Jew and an Akum. (As for a stranger who is not an Akum, there is even no argument. This is so self-evident that the prohibition applies as it does to a Jew.) This is true also as to theft and cheating. (See Hulin 94a): “And because of two things they [the Sages] said one does not sell carrion and non-kosher meat to idolaters. One reason is that you are misleading the Akum who believes that the meat was slaughtered in a kosher manner.” And further: “As Shmuel said it is forbidden to deceive people, even idolaters.",
                "“Shmuel’s ruling was not stated specifically, but was deduced from the principle: Shmuel went on a ferry. He told his assistant, Pay the ferryman. When he paid him, Shmuel became angry. Why did he become angry? Abbaye said, He had a non-kosher fowl which he gave it him as one that had been slaughtered in the kosher manner. Rava said, It was a goblet, and he told him to give the boatman a drink. Whereupon he give him mixed wine.",
                "This may be compared to the Rambam who states:",
                "“It is forbidden to cheat people in business or to deceive them; and both an idolater and a Jew are equal in this matter” (Laws of Sale 18:1).",
                "Anyone who steals money worth a pruta or more breaks a negative commandment (a prohibition); as it is written, You shall not steal. We do not administer flogging on this prohibition, for it can be repaid, and the thief is obligated by the Torah to repay (the theft). And the law is the same whether he stole money from a Jew or from an Akum, or if he stole from the rich or the lowly (Laws of Theft 1:10).",
                "“One who does business either with a Jew or with an Akum, if he measured or weighed short of the correct amount, he has transgressed a negative commandment and is obligated to make restitution. One is also forbidden to cheat the Akum as to the price, but one must be precise with him; as it is written, and he shall reckon with his client (Lev. 25:50): even if he is your subordinate. All the more so if he is not in subjugation to you. Such a one comes under the category of “All those who do these things are an abomination before the Lord (Deut. 22:5) – whoever does such a thing, no matter where.” (Laws of Theft 7:8). In the Shulhan Aruh, Hoshen Hamishpat. (All of the above examples are merely a summary of the various Talmudic principles.)",
                "By which principle did they behave towards the Akum? We can see this best by summarizing the main discriminatory laws:",
                "1. “Rav Bibi bar Gidel said in the name of Rav Shimon Hasidai, stealing from a Canaanite is forbidden; taking what he has lost is permitted.” (That is, there is no need to return property that he has lost.)",
                "2. “Shmuel said, one is permitted to take advantage of his mistake” (There is no obligation to bring his mistake to his attention.) (Both quotations from: Bava Batra 141b)",
                "3. According to Avodah Zarah 20a the decision in the Shulhan Aruh, Hoshen Hamishpat 248:2, it is forbidden to give gifts to an Akum (with the exception of the poor or acquaintances).",
                "4. “Idolaters and shepherds of sheep or goats (including Jews, since they are also categorized as thieves, since they allow their flocks to graze on others’ pastures) you do not help them up (if they fall into a pit) or put them down (into a pit)” Avodah Zarah 26a.",
                "What is common to all these laws, including those mentioned which refer to compensation for damages: in matters of the Akum passive behavior is mandated. This sentence contains the principal concept. One can base all the discriminatory laws towards the Akum upon it (In addition to those mentioned above there are only a few more isolated categories.); the significance is a sort of social ostracism against people, who, by their non-observance of the most basic laws and commandments of human morality, put themselves outside society. The principle is expressed in a positive manner, and its intention is that it is forbidden to help the Akum without a special reason. Here a religious principle which appears in various places in the Talmud comes into play, a principle which the Shulhan Aruh (Hoshen Hamishpat 266:1) articulates in the following words: “ …He who returns (a lost object to an Akum) transgresses, since he is giving support to a transgressor”. (The fact that we are dealing here only with a general religious principle is clear, since the prohibition of assisting a transgressor is applicable to Jews as well; see the example in paragraph 4 above.)",
                "On the other hand, there is not a single law which permits actively causing injustice (cheating, stealing, robbery and of course murder). Here there is no distinction between the Akum and the Jew.",
                "(Note: From the following examples it will be clear how hard the Talmud tried to implement this passivity of practice, which is basically theoretical, in a benificent manner: as regards presents see what was written in paragraph 3 above; as to lost property it is written in the Talmud Yerushalmi (Bava Metzia 2:5): Shimon ben Shetach supported himself trading in linen. His students said to him, ‘Rabbi, forget this business; and we will buy you a donkey, and you will not have to work so hard.’ They went to buy him a donkey from a Sirkai, and a pearl was found hanging around its neck. They came to their Rabbi and said to him, ‘From now on you won’t have to work hard anymore.’ He said to them, ‘Why?’ They said to him, ‘We bought you a donkey from a Sirkai, and it has a pearl hanging around its neck.’ He asked them, ‘Does the owner of the donkey know about this?” They answered him, ‘No.’ He said to them, “In that case then go and return it to him.” They replied, ‘This is not what Rav Hunah Bibi bar Gozlon said in the name of Rav, While we were sitting before Rabbi we raised the following: “Even according to the one who holds that robbery from an Akum is forbidden, nevertheless keeping his lost property is permitted.” Why then do you command us to return his lost property?” He answered, ‘Do you think that Shimon ben Shetach is a barbarian, that he has become a grabber, and is in a hurry to become rich? That is not so! Shimon ben Shetach would rather hear “Blessed is the King of the Jews” than all the riches in the world.’",
                "And from which occurrence did he learn this? From this story of Rav Hanina’s, about some old men who took a load of wheat from some soldiers, and found inside a bundle containing dinars, which they returned to them. The soldiers praised them and said, “Blessed be the G-d of the Jews who commanded them to return lost property, and they believe in Him and observe His commandments.’",
                "Abba Oshaia of Troy was a launderer, and the queen came to bathe there. She lost her jewels and gold ornaments there, and he found them and returned them to her. She said, ‘These belong to you, because you are entitled to them.’ He answered, ‘Are any of them important to me? I have many and better ones. Furthermore the Torah has commanded that we return lost items.’ She replied, “Blessed be the G-d of the Jews”.",
                "Rav Shmuel bar Sosretai traveled to Rome, where the queen had lost her valuables and jewelry – and he found them. A proclamation was issued in the city: ‘Whoever returns them (the lost items) within thirty days will receive such and such a reward. But if he returns them after thirty days, he will be beheaded.’ He heard the proclamation, but delayed until after the thirty days. She asked him, ‘Were you not in the city?’ He replied, ‘Yes.’ She asked him, ‘Did you not hear the town-crier?’ He answered, ‘Yes.’ She asked, ‘And what did the town-crier announce?’ He said, ‘Whoever returns them to the queen will receive such and such a reward. But if he returns them after thirty days he will be beheaded.’ She asked him, ‘And why did you not return them within thirty days?’ He replied, ‘So that no one would say that I returned them out of fear of the proclamation, but out of the fear of G-d.’ At which she said, “Blessed is the G-d of the Jews”.)",
                "c. “Even the best of gentiles — you should kill”",
                "While concerning the “stranger” only a principle of reciprocity applies, and concerning the “Akum” only passive behavior is required, while all active harm to his person or property is forbidden – how can we explain the infamous sentence: Kill even the best of gentiles?",
                "We have already quoted above (section 1) the saying in the Talmud concerning the drowning of the Egyptians [in the Reed Sea], and the ruling of the Shulhan Aruch which arises from this as to the recitation of the Hallel prayer (a song of praise). We are of the opinion that what is said there will suffice to convince any objective person that such a sentence could not possibly be found as a law in the Talmud. What we have clarified now regarding theft and robbery of the Akum reinforces this. If it is forbidden to steal from him, how much more forbidden is it to murder him. First of all it is clear from the law which we just discussed: “Idol worshipers and shepherds of sheep and goats we neither help them up nor put them down” that this is a direct contradiction to any such law. For it clearly states:”…and do not put them down”. The Tosephot on this passage (Avodah Zarah 26b) were already aware of this contradiction, and solved it by turning to the Talmud Yerushalmi (at the end of Kidushin). According to the Yerushalmi the law which states one should kill even the best of gentiles is applicable only in times of war. Based on this the Tosephot are of the opinion that: the law “do not put them down” applies only to peace-time. In this manner the contradiction is solved, but at the same time the law is limited by the Yerushalmi (which was sealed in the year 330) to war-time.",
                "However we believe that a priori the Tosephot’s dilemma was ill-founded. There never was a contradiction, since the sentence “idolaters and shepherds…do not help them up or put them down” is law, but the saying “the best of the gentiles….” is not.",
                "The infamous sayings were written in the following context (Sofrim 9:6) [in Amsterdam Press edition 15:10]) …Rabbi Yehuda said in his own name: “Donkey drivers are generally wicked, seamen are generally righteous men, the best of doctors are destined for Hell, and the most kosher of butchers is a partner of Amalek, …most sons resemble their mother’s brothers.” We learn that Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai said, “Crush the head of the finest of snakes, the most worthy of women uses witchcraft, happy is he who fulfills the will of G-d”. – Anyone expert in the Talmud will notice the following things: Firstly, the subject here is a general evaluation of various professions, and of the characteristics of different types of people. In this context what connection does this strange law have here? Secondly, what brought the author, Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai, to include this law together with the statements “crush the head of the finest snakes” and “the most worthy of women uses witchcraft” in one sentence? Only an approach which interprets the text in a uniform manner, and answers both questions, can be justified.",
                "In order to clarify the question, especially concerning “the best of gentiles…”, we find in the first source of the statement, the Mehilta (Exodus 14:7): In the words of the Biblical text: “And he (Pharaoh) took six hundred chosen chariots” (in order to chase after the fleeing Israelites), it is written: “To whom did the animals which pulled the chariots belong? If you say they belonged to the Egyptians, is it not already written (concerning the ten plagues, Exodus 9:6): ‘All the cattle died in Egypt’? And if you say they belonged to Pharoah, is it not already written there (Exodus 9:3): ‘Behold the hand of the Lord is upon your cattle in the fields’? And if you say that they belonged to the Israelites, it is already written (Exodus 10:26): ‘Also our cattle will go with us, not a hoof shall remain’. So to whom did they belong? They belonged to those of Pharoah’s slaves who feared the word of G-d (Exodus 9:20). Hence we deduced that those who feared the word of G-d were the cause of misfortune for Israel. From this Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai said: The best of the gentiles in Egypt – kill, crush the head of the best of snakes.”",
                "Thus, Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai’s statement originally referred to Egypt. Based on the text from which it was taken, the statement could not have referred to any other people. But the fact that the statement did not include a law which mandated killing the best of the Egyptians arises from the fact that in the 2nd century, when Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai lived, there was no reason for such a law. The Egyptians of Biblical times no longer existed then; Egypt no longer had a role in Jewish history. The enemy was Rome. The source in the Mechilta proves to any intelligent person that we are only dealing with an Aggadic (not legalistic) interpretation of a sentence in the Biblical text, which means approximately this: From the fact that the Egyptians who feared the Lord were prepared to hand over their beasts to Pharoah in order to pursue the Jews, one can see that their fear of the Lord was not sincere. It was impossible to rely even on those who feared the Lord. (And so the formulation: the best of the Egyptians….) The sentence: “The best of the Egyptians — kill” is an aphorism and an adage in its intention, which only expresses the idea that even the best of the Egyptians should not be relied upon – as long as he lives, he is insincere. Therefore, the previous sentence is followed by the other one: “Crush the head of the best of snakes”, a saying which undoubtedly was a saying expressing the duplicity of the tamest of snakes. (We must remember that the Egyptians of the Bible text were, in Jewish tradition, compared to snakes because of their duplicity (See Isaiah 27:1, with the Targum). Both sentences are just two different phrasings, metaphores, for the lack of trustworthiness of the nature of the snake.) Thus one must understand the fact that in Tr. Sofrim the following words were added to the saying: “The most worthy of women uses witchcraft”. Similar to the two first sentences, here there is a condemnation of the lack of trustworthiness and lack of sincerity, this time directed at the character of woman.",
                "However this closing sentence has no place in the Mechilta, because here we are dealing with Aggadic interpretation of a sentence in the Biblical text which discusses Egypt. On the other hand it does belong in Tr. Sofrim, where there is a collection of general folk sayings about different types of professions and people. Like the sentences which appear first (in Tr. Sofrim), the threefold aphorism of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai constitute metaphores (therefore, like all the sentences before them, are phrased exaggeratedly and sharply) which point up character traits of people, and of certain animals. Egypt, snakes and women were classed together because the three of them were characterized as having one fault in common – duplicity. This is the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai – that is, of one single sage. To what extent can we see in this opinion the official opinion of Judaism and the Talmud – that is another question. At least as regards women, there are innumerable expressions in the Talmud which perceive their worth and character traits in a significantly different manner. (See above section 6:3)",
                "From the Mechilta we learn that the phraseology in Tr. Sofrim, “the best of the Akum” or “…among the nations” is inaccurate, since the text upon which the sentence is based allows only for it to be applied to the Egyptians of the Bible. The version in Tr. Sofrim came about as either an error in copying, or an inaccuracy in the traditional text. The fact that in the consciousness of the people the specific term “Egyptians” was exchanged for the general term “Akum” is understood by anyone who is conversant with the history of the Jewish People in ancient times. In principle it was difficult for the Jew to distinguish between Pharoah and Titus, Domitian, Trianus, Hadrian. All this does not change the fact that the sentence in question, even in the version in Tr. Sofrim, is not a commandment, but rather a general estimate of a certain group of nations who were the historical enemies of the Jewish People. Based on the Mechilta there is also justification for the Yerushalmi’s limiting of the sentence to times of war. At the moment when Pharoah pursued the people who had already left, a state of war existed between the two nations. Therefore the judgment of the Egyptians, or the “strangers”, essentially expresses the following: In times of war it is not possible to trust even the best of Egyptians (“strangers”)."

                "<b><i>3. Quotations</i></b>",
                "a. “Property of an idolater is considered ownerless” (Bava Batra 54b)",
                "Although this sentence is written approximately thus in Bava Batra, what is the context? Let us read it in the original source: “Shmuel said, property of an idolater is like a desert; whoever holds it owns it. What is the reason? As soon as the idolater receives his money he renounces his claim of ownership on the field. For a Jew there is no ownership of the field until he has the bill of sale in his hands. If that is so, the issue here is that a Jew paid the Akum money in exchange for his field. He wanted to buy it from the Akum with money, but the bill of sale had not yet been written. According to Jewish law the field became “ownerless” – “desert”. Since upon receipt of the money the Akum had relinquished his right of ownership, meanwhile the Jewish purchaser, who can buy the land in this case only by a bill of sale, did not become the owner of the property merely by giving the money to the Akum. Therefore anyone has the right to take possession of the land, just like desert land.",
                "To expand on the clarification we can compare the Talmudic discussion on this statement: “Abbaye said to Rav Yosef, Did Shmuel say this? Shmuel said that the law of the land is the law (to be observed). And the king decreed that land can be bought and sold only by contract, not by seizure of the land. He answered: I only know of a case in Lower Dura, of a Jew who bought land from an Akum, and another Jew came and executed an act of acquisition. He came before Rav Yehuda, who gave it to the second Jew.\"",
                "“Rav Huna bought a field from an Akum. Another Jew came and did some work on the land. He went beforeo Rav Nahman, who decided in favor of the second Jew. He said to Rav Huna, What is your opinion? Did not Shmuel say that property of the Akum is like the desert (ownerless)?” It is clear that the injured party from the principle that the property of an Akum becomes ownerless, is the Jewish buyer who already paid the Akum; but since the purchase was not completely formalised, another Jew can contest the ownership and seize the property even though the first Jew had paid for in full.",
                "b. Testimony against non-Jews",
                "In Bava Kama (113b) is written: “A Jew who has evidence on behalf a non-Jew, who has not called him to testify, but goes and testifies in a matter of the non-Jew against another Jew, is excommunicated from the community.” When the statement is quoted in this manner, it seems to be a clear proof of a double standard in the Talmud, but unfortunately it represents only the first part of the Talmudic statement, which continues: “Why? Because they reward damages on the testimony of a single witness. We did not say it was forbidden except for a single witness, but not for two (permissible as in a Jewish court of law). And we did not say one witness except for in a rural court of law; but in an urban court of law it is permissible, because they swear in even a sole witness. According to the Jewish legal percepts one may not bring a verdict against an accused to pay a fine on the basis of testimony of only one witness. Therefore it is forbidden to testify in non-Jewish courts as the sole witness, unless summoned by the court. However there is no such prohibition if the judgment is given on the testimony of two witnesses. In such a case a Jew is permitted to testify in a law court of non-Jews against a Jew in favor of an Akum, even if he is not summoned by the court. The restriction that he should not appear before the court as a sole witness without being specifically required to do so by the court applies only as regards a rural court, but not in an urban court. From this we understand that we are dealing with situations where we cannot rely equally on all public courts. It is sufficient to peruse books dealing with the history of the justice system, and to take into consideration that the Talmud was sealed more than 1400 years ago, to understand the Talmud’s careful approach."

                "Legal rights of the Ger in Jewish Law",
                "In order to understand just how far hatred of the stranger is from Judaism, and therefore also from the Talmud, one should examine the legal and social standing of the “Ger”, the stranger who dwells in the Jewish state, or in an autonomous Jewish community. (The entire passage which follows concerns the “ger toshav”, that is a stranger who has settled in a Jewish area, and not the “ger tzedek”, a stranger who has been persuaded to convert to Judaism.) According to the Torah the stranger has equal rights. In Leviticus (24:22) it is written: “You shall have one law, for the stranger and for the citizen: because I am the Lord your G-d”. Besides this, it is forbidden to force or put pressure on the stranger, and in the same breath there is the commandment to love him (the stranger) “as yourself”. “And when a stranger lives among you in your land – you must do him no wrong. The stranger who lives among you should be treated as one of your own, and you should love him as yourself – because you were strangers in Egypt; I am the Lord your G-d” (Leviticus 19:33-34). Compare also with Exodus 22:20;23:3; Deuteronomy 24:17-18 and also when the whole people are assembled at Mt. Gerizim and Mt. Ebal to hear the blessings and the curses in Deuteronomy 27:19: “Cursed is he who perverts justice due the stranger, orphan and widow; and all the people said Amen”.",
                "All these laws and statutes in the Talmud are equally as valid as are the commandments of the Torah. However, not every stranger was able to settle permanently in the Jewish state. In Tr. Avodah Zarah (60b) there is a debate as to whom it is permissible to grant the right to residence. In the opinion of the sages, and also according to the decreed law, the stranger would be obligated to recognize and abide by the seven Noahide laws. That was the only condition. In reference to the residence of the stranger it is written (Tr. Gerim 3:4): “Do not make him dwell in the periphery, and not in a bad quarter but in a good area, in the center of the Land of Israel, at the place where he has his work, as it is written: (Deuteronomy 23:17): ‘He shall dwell in your midst in a place of his choosing.’”"
