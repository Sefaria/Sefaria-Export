And the angel said to her, \"Take your son, your only one, that you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah and bring him up there as a sacrifice.\" And Sarah said, \"No, for a mother shall not slaughter her son.\" And in the morning she rose early. Sarah was shaken because the lad was not there, nor was his father, Abraham. She raised her hands to God in the Heavens and said, \"Master of the universe, I know that the end of one who slaughters his son in the name of God is that he has neither a son nor God. Please forgive Avraham, who erred in this thing. Please remember that it did not cross the mind of the mother to sacrifice her son, and save the lad from his hand!\" At that time, Abraham moved his hand towards the knife to slaughter his son. But the angel of the Lord called to Abraham and said, \"'Do not move your hand towards the lad, since I now know that you fear God' (Genesis 22:12), even though you did not hold back your son.\" And that is why it is stated, \"Everything that Sarah tells you, listen to her voice\" (Genesis 21:12). Hence, \"your offspring will be known through Isaac.\" "

For it is stated, \"I will sing to the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously.\" Rather it is that Miriam knew a song that Moses did not know.<br>What was the song of Moses? Moses called, \"I will sing to the Lord,\" which is the song of the isolated individual, which does not combine itself to the aggregate of choruses, voices and melodies. Moses sought to extract the voice from everyone and redeem their song.<br>But the song of redemption was still incomplete.<br>And what was the song of Miriam? \"Sing to the Lord,\" an expression of the plural.<br>Miriam had learned, \"These words the Lord spoke to your entire assembly at the mountain from the midst of the fire, the cloud, and the fog, with a great voice, and did not add to them\" (Deuteronomy 5:18). \"A great voice\" - for the sake of what? Because it includes within it a great multiplicity of voices, accents, languages and tones. For the voice is the voice of God and the image is the image of God - constructed from all of humanity, from all of their different faces and opinions. Hence she called, \"Sing to the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously,\" which combines all of the voices completely and connects the personal, I will sing,\" to the communal and multifaceted song.<br>Miriam said to them, \"Sing to the Lord,\" and remind yourselves of the image of God within you, constructed of seventy faces, seventy languages and seventy melodies. \"Sing to the Lord, bless His name\" (Psalms 96b) - when you sing to him, you are blessing His name.",
