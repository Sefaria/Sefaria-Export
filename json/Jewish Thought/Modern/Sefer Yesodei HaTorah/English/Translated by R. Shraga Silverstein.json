                "\"Religion\" came to the children of Israel as an inheritance from their fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and not as a teaching from Moses. As Moses said to them when he came to them (Shemoth 2:15) \"The L-rd, the G-d of your fathers, the G-d of Abraham, the G-d of Isaac, and the G-d of Jacob, sent me to you.\" What was that religion? Moses did not apprise them of it explicitly, there being no need of his doing so for the men of his generation, who already knew it. But for the benefit of future generations, he apprised us of its <i>nature</i> by recording within it [\"by word of G-d\"] events from the lives of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and his sons. From these, we see that they believed in One G-d, Possessor of heaven and earth, Judge of all the earth, Shield of those who fear Him, bestowing upon them goodly reward, and requiting the evil with the work of their hands. From there we see that they believed in signs and wonders, and angels, and prophecy, and that they were concerned about where they would be buried (whence we infer that they believed in the eternity of the soul and in the resurrection of the dead.) We find them praying to G-d in all of their tribulations — for others as well (e.g., Abraham for Avimelech). They vowed unto Him, and when He saved them, they thanked Him and offered sacrifices to Him. \"The way of the L-rd\" commanded by Abraham to \"his children and his household after him\" was \"to do righteousness and judgment\" (viz. Bereshith 18:19)."
            ],
            [
                "After Abraham through his own understanding and in the uprightness of his heart abandoned the idols of his fathers and believed in one G-d, the L-rd chose him, revealed Himself to him, and blessed him. All this, \"because he commands his children and his household after him to keep the way of the L-rd.\" That is, He did not choose him for himself alone, but to be the father of a holy people. And so that his seed not assimilate with the other peoples, who were idolators, He commanded him concerning circumcision, which, (at that time) was the only Divine precept in that religion. After some time, the children of Israel took upon themselves the stringency of not eating the thigh sinew in commemoration of the miracle performed for their father Jacob, at which time the honorific title of \"Israel\" was conferred upon him, (viz. Bereshith 32:29-33)."

                "This religion sufficed for the children of Israel as long as they were only one family. But when they became a great nation and the time arrived to bring them to the land that the L-rd had sworn to their fathers to give to them, He saw that they required teachings and judgments, learning and proper guidance, whether for character improvement towards the well-being of society, or for the preservation of this religion, that they not abandon it and adhere to the ways of the nations around them or be left without religion at all. It is for this reason that He gave them this Torah, which Moses placed before the children of Israel."

            [
                "The first foundation, the means specific for character improvement, is compassion. The trait of compassion was implanted in a man from the beginning of his creation, and it is the root of his love, his lovingkindness, and his uprightness. It is that alone which leads us to the doing of good not in order to receive reward, neither naturally or unnaturally, neither in this world or in the world to come. For the trait of compassion is reward in itself. For the compassionate one suffers in the suffering of his friend and is not at peace until his friend's break is bound and his wound is healed."

            [
                "The Greek sages and the other philosophers who followed in their footsteps thought to found character improvement on many factors other than this (compassion); but they simply spouted words and produced no fruit."

                "Some sought to teach men that the pursuit of lust results in no enduring good, but only in what is illusory and transitory and ends in affliction and in suffering. And all this is true. But the knowledge of this thing is powerless to enable a man to overcome his lusts! For the flame of desire will not allow him (especially one in the vigor of his youth and the heat of his temperament) to think in his heart how the thing will end. And there are also many others, who, though they know that in the way that they go they will not achieve peace of mind and tranquility of soul, still, a life of turbulence, tumult, and tempest saturated with delight and desire is choicer in their eyes than a quiet life devoid of tempests and great pleasure; and the chastisements of wisdom will not aid or avail them. For in truth, the L-rd did not make all men in the same mould, and His wisdom did not decree that one thing should afford equal satisfaction and pleasure to all. And just as it is not to be expected that all men ply the same trade, so it is not to be expected that they all choose one life style. And just as some choose to be land dwellers and other to spend most of their days on the open sea, and just as some choose to dwell in peace and security and others exult in weaponry and rejoice in the trumpet blast of war, so it is in the nature of man that some choose the tranquility of silence amidst a modicum of joy, trouble, and sorrow, and others a life replete with tempest and turmoil and the bread of toil tinctured with lusts and delights. And those sages who would have all men walk the path of wisdom and understanding run counter to nature — that is, to the will of the Creator. And that is why most men do not pay heed to them."

                "Others taught that the welfare of society dictates that its members walk the just path, wherefore it follows that each man should do so and seek the welfare of society. And this is doubtless true. But how will this effect the character improvement of each individual? Is there not room for the \"adversary\" to contend: You, the philosopher, tell me that all the members of society should improve their deeds. For if they fail to do so, their aggregate will suffer and each individual will \"swallow the other alive.\" See, now, your words are good and right. How good and pleasant it would be if all men, like brothers as one, would \"pursue righteousness and love truth and peace!\" But as far as I can see most of the men in my circle are bent on their own profit! If I alone were to cling to righteousness and justness, woe unto me! \"The righteous one would go lost in his righteousness!\" And even worse than this is the reaction of those wicked men who justify with their mouths the words of the aforementioned sages and parrot with their lips that righteousness and justness are the mainsprings of society, but who in the recesses of their hearts counsel evil to make themselves exceptions to the rule and to deviate from the ways of justness whenever it suits their purpose to do so. And if the (aforementioned) sages attempt to convince them that the good of the individual cannot be served at the expense of that of the community, their words are to no avail. For \"a man believes only what <i>his</i> eyes see.\" And if in his heart he really believes that what is to the detriment of society is to <i>his</i> good and welfare, how can he be expected to heed his teachers and despise what in his own mind is to his good — especially when the very essence of the teaching of his masters is that one must seek the good of society <i>to advance his own good</i>!"

                "Others made their criterion the equality of men, saying that what is permitted to Reuven should be permitted to Shimon. For both being human beings, one should enjoy no advantage over the other. Accordingly, if theft, robbery, and murder are permitted to Reuven, they should likewise be permitted to Shimon. And so long as Reuven acknowledges that these are forbidden to Shimon, he should likewise acknowledge that they are forbidden to him — unless he can prove that Shimon is not a man as he is. And this, too, is true. But \"the gates of repentance\" are not closed to the evil inclination. For the churl can say in his heart: This \"equality\" is a figment of the imagination. For nature has differentiated one man from another as to strength and to intellect. And since nature has desired that I be strong and my neighbor weak, that I be a sage and my neighbor a fool, it follows, likewise, that it desires that my lot be superior to his and that the same lot not befall both of us. If so, if I steal or rob from him and gain the upper hand over him in all ways, I do not thereby exceed my bounds or breach a border or break a fence, but I simply enjoy the goodly gift vouchsafed me by nature in its graciousness to me. And if it were as the sages say, that power, strength, and wisdom do not accord more rights to one man than to another, how can it be that all the nations of the world agree that in the event of a conflict between one nation and another their <i>right</i> is to be affirmed by bow, sword, war, and strength of arms!"

All that is becoming to its doers and evocative of the admiration of others.\" This precept is, indeed, effective for external enhancement of character, but not for inner enhancement. For it is well known that not all the deeds of men, nor even most of them, are visible to the public, and very often a man is guilty of wrong and violence or negligent in the doing of good without this redounding to his shame or humiliation. And there are many men who glory in their craftiness and cunning, notwithstanding which their ways are not good and their hidden deeds, ugly and detestable. "

And if he is corrupt in his deeds, he thereby undermines society and its framework and defies the dictates of nature. But what does the wicked one say? What is this? Why should I heed the precepts of the universal nature and cast those of my own nature behind my back! When I steal, and philander, and kill, is it not my own nature that does this? And if I desist from doing this, is it not my own nature that I defy? And the ordeal that I undergo in overcoming my inclination — is it not chastising me for defying the will of nature?"

Would he not find it demeaning to concern himself with their affairs as he finds it demeaning to tend to his own? And, furthermore, it is not likely that such a man would be gentle to others and good and beloved by them, their being lowly in his eyes and he alone lofty and exalted — all of them \"beasts,\" and he alone a man."

Clear proof of this: We find that the \"hard of heart,\" who are far from charity and who spend their days in reveling and tippling keep at a distance from themselves the poor and the indigent and all who are \"smitten by G-d\" and afflicted. Why is this so? Because the sight and the sighs of these unfortunate ones dampens their joy and brings to their hearts (against their will) sadness and sorrow, whether more or less. Why is this so if not for the fact that compassion is natural to all men and felt even by the hard of heart! It cannot be denied that many chance factors can weaken this compassion and mercy in a man and render him cruel and hard-hearted, but all this is chance and not nature. If we have seen or heard of men becoming mercilessly cruel to their friends, this was only because of hatred, wrath, and vengefulness, which may unbalance a man and drive him out of his mind or because of some sudden impulse to attain their desire. But it is not to be denied that even those who seem the most hard-hearted of men are sometimes compassionate and merciful."

For if one is pained by the pain of his neighbor and by his distress, there is no doubt that he will not cause harm to him, but, to the contrary, he will exert himself to be kind to all men and to be of help to them in rescuing them from evil. And from compassion, there stems, too, the love of righteousness and justice. For when I see two men unknown to me, I am equally compassionate to both of them, wherefore I will not do good to one which will result in the other's harm, but I will aspire to the equality of their lot. And if I see one of them stealing from the other, I will desire to \"snatch the prey\" from his mouth and restore it to his neighbor."

And this, in both speech and deed. For just as if we habituate him to seeing acts of cruelty and hearing the praises of the stout-hearted, there is no doubt that compassion will wane in his heart, and little by little the child will become a hard man, bold of heart, so, if we habituate him to seeing acts of compassion and lovingkindness and to hearing the praises of lovingkindness and compassion and the denunciation of bold-heartedness and hard-heartedness, there will grow in his heart the trait of compassion and mercy and the child will grow to be a man of compassion and mercy, righteous, just, and faithful."

                "Now this Torah, which Moses set before the children of Israel, guides us in the path of compassion and graciousness: by its commanding us to leave <i>leket</i> (gleanings, viz. Vayikra 19:9), <i>shikchah</i> (the forgotten sheaf, viz. Devarim 24:19), and <i>peah</i> (the corner of the field, viz. Shemoth 22:27) to the poor and to the proselyte, to the orphan and to the widow, by forbidding us to take interest or increase from the indigent or to enter his house to take his pledge (for our loan to him), by forbidding us to take in pledge mill or upper millstone or the garment of a widow, and by commanding us (Shemoth 22:25) \"If you take as a pledge your neighbor's garment, return it to him before the sun sets.\" Reflect upon what follows (Ibid. 26) \"for it is his only clothing, his covering for his skin. In what shall he sleep?\" Now if a creditor has lent his neighbor money and sees that the time (for repayment) has passed, and he has not been paid, it is his right to take a pledge. And if the debtor gives him nothing else as security, he may take his garment. And if every evening he must return it to him, there is no question that he will not be repaid. (The creditor thinks to himself:) \"If he asked me for it as a gift, perhaps I might have given it to him. But he borrowed on condition to repay, and now that he does not repay, he is a deceiver, who seeks to rob and defraud his friend. And now that I have taken his garment as a pledge, why should I return it? How shall I otherwise get back from him what I have lent him? What concern is it of mine in what he shall sleep?\" Thus will the creditor think. And all the philosophers and proponents of honor will agree with him. But the Torah teaches compassion and kindness and says to the creditor \"In what shall he sleep?\" Similarly, since the Torah has commanded the remission of debts in the seventh year (shemitah), there is no question that every man with common sense should take care not to lend his money at the end of the sixth year, knowing full well that one who borrows at that time has already resolved not to repay it. And who is the philosopher or proponent of honor who would condemn a man for not lending at that time? Yet what does the Torah say? (Devarim 15:9-10) \"Take care lest there be in your heart a base thought, saying: 'The seventh year is approaching, the year of remission,' and your eye be evil against your needy brother and you not give him… Give shall you give him, and let your heart not be narrow in giving him.\""

(Shemoth 21:2) \"When you acquire a Hebrew slave, etc.\" All know of the status of slaves in those times. They were the property of their owners, they and their children, like oxen or asses, and the master was permitted to beat or kill his slaves without fear (of reprisal). Yet the Torah in the beginning of (the pronouncement of) its judgments, called out liberty for the Hebrew slave, that he not labor for more than six years. And it was forbidden to kill even a Canaanite slave or to strike him cruelly. And it commanded that if his master beat him and he died under his hand, vengeance was to be taken. And if he maimed his eye or knocked his tooth out, he was to be set free. And it commanded, too, that his slave rest on Sabbaths and Festivals. The Torah was compassionate even to female captives of war, commanding that they be allowed a month of days to bewail at will their fathers and mothers; and it was forbidden to sell them after cohabiting with them."

Of this type are (Devarim 25:4) \"Do not muzzle an ox in its threshing\" and (Ibid. 22:10) \"Do not plow with an ox and an ass together.\" For (as Ibn Ezra says) the strength of the ass is not equal to that of the ox. Similarly, (Vayikra 22:28) \"And an ox or a lamb, it and its son you shall not slaughter on the same day.\" Similarly, the commandment that one's beasts rest on the Sabbath. And the Torah commanded us to respect the merciful one and to be compassionate to him — even to a beast or a bird. As we find in the mitzvah of sending away the mother bird (viz. Devarim 22:6-7). For the mother bird lying on its fledglings or eggs could easily have flown away and rescued itself upon seeing or hearing a man approaching. Why did it not do so? Out of compassion for its young. If a man were permitted to take her, it would be impressed upon him that compassion is rash and foolish, causing harm to those actuated by it.

And even though, since it is permitted to slaughter the goat, what difference does it make to it and its mother in which liquid they are cooked? In any event, this act engenders an evil streak in the soul of the doer and the seer. Imagine one's making of his father's bones, spoons; and of his skull, a dish, and eating from them.

And if it is possible to satisfy his want to the injury of his neighbor, compassion will not generate enough power to keep him from his evil design. Therefore, the Giver of the Torah saw fit to add a second foundation to character improvement — hope of reward and fear of punishment. For reward and punishment, in that they relate to the very self and fiber of a man, make a deep impression upon him, stronger sometimes than that made upon him by his lacks and lusts, with the result that he desists from satisfying them out of fear of punishment and hope of reward. And the reward and punishment which He established as the foundation for character improvement is not at the hands of man, who sees only (what is open) to the eyes, from which many things are concealed, but at the hands of G-d, who sees to the heart, from whom nothing is concealed.

And He established the festival of matzoth and the sanctification of the first-born as a remembrance of the exodus from Egypt.

And every woman will borrow of her neighbor and from the woman in whose house she dwells, etc.\" There are some who take exception to this, saying: Even if in truth the Jews deserved to receive from the Egyptians the wage for serving them all those years as an exchange for the houses and the wares that they left them in leaving (Egypt), still how could the L-rd command that they do such a thing? The Egyptians believed that the purpose of their leaving was only to sacrifice to their G-d and to return — wherefore they lent them. And, conversely, when Israel \"borrowed\" the vessels from them, they had already resolved not to return, so that their \"borrowing\" was outright guile and deceit. This command of the L-rd, then, (that they borrow) left a negative impress upon them, for they would thereby learn to speak deceitfully and to corrupt their ways. Could the L-rd not enrich His people without resorting to such stratagems?",
                "This reservation is a formidable one to the mentalities of the men of <i>our</i> generation, but completely foreign to the mentalities of those who left Egypt. For those who suffered under the hands of Egypt and who were sentient of their evil deeds — when they were commanded to do this thing (i.e., too borrow), and when they fulfilled this command and borrowed from the Egyptians as Moses had taught them in the name of the L-rd, no negative impress was made upon their souls for the sanctioning of deceit and guile. But, to the contrary, the impress made was that the L-rd pays a man in accordance with his deeds and punishes the wicked who are cruel to their fellows. For they did not do this thing of their own will, and it is possible that in their eagerness to distance themselves from their oppressors and from the land of the devourers of their children, they would never be moved to do such a thing. They did so only because they were commanded to do so by their leader, who spoke to them in the name of the L-rd. What <i>did</i> impress itself upon their souls is that the L-rd hates men of wrong and saves the oppressed of spirit and pays them goodly reward. So that what <i>was</i> impressed upon their souls is that if they, too, in the time of their success would oppress others, the L-rd would take revenge for the oppressed ones and place the spoil of their oppressors in their hands, just as Moses exhorted them several times afterwards to remember that they had been slaves and the L-rd had redeemed them. Witness to all this is that in three places (Shemoth 3:21; 11:3; and 12:36) the Torah explains that it was <i>from the L-rd</i> to place the favor of the people in the eyes of Egypt so that they be moved to lend them. That is, the Jews recognized, and Moses their leader taught them, that the Egyptians, their oppressors, would never lend them their precious vessels if not by the will of the Almighty, miraculously. And for this reason it is written (Ibid. 12:31) \"And the children of Israel did <i>according to the word of Moses</i>, etc.\" to teach that it was not from their hearts and from their own motivations that they did this, but to do the will of their leader in the name of the Almighty, their Savior by signs and wonders…"

                "And as with the borrowing of the vessels from the Egyptians, so is it with Israel's being commanded to cut off the men of Canaan. Even though it is not withheld from the Almighty to give His people an inheritance of field and vineyard without such violence and cruelty as cutting off nations which did them no harm, the Blessed One desired that they cut off those nations so that they take <i>mussar</i> (\"chastisement\") and see how the L-rd punishes doers of evil. As Moses said to them (Vayikra 18:27) \"for all of these abominations were done by the people of the land which were before you\", (Ibid. 25) \"and the land vomited out its inhabitants\", (Ibid. 26) \"And you shall keep My statutes and My judgments, etc.\", (Ibid. 28) \"so that the land not vomit you out by your making it unclean, as it vomited out the nation that was before you.\" And it is for this reason that the Torah foretold in the L-rd's words to Abraham (Bereshith 15:16) \"And the fourth generation (of the Egyptian exile) shall return here (to Canaan), for the sin of the Emori would not have been consummated, (justifying their being driven out of the land) until then.\" All this, to apprise us that those nations were cut off only because of their wickedness, Israel being powerless to take the land from their hands until their \"measure\" (of wickedness) had been consummated. And, likewise, from Moses' telling them (Devarim 9:9) \"Do not say in your heart, when the L-rd your G-d thrusts them from before you: In my righteousness did the L-rd bring me to inherit this land, etc.\", it is seen clearly that this was the inclination of their hearts, that the success of every nation was a result of the Blessed One's decree and providence, and not of chance as those who came after them assumed. And it follows from this that when they cut off the Canaanites, no negative impress was made on their souls which would run counter to improvement of character, but, rather, it was deeply impressed upon them that those nations were liable to destruction because of their abominations, and that <i>they</i> were only acting as the emissaries of the L-rd. And this belief was strengthened in their hearts by witnessing the signs and wonders wrought for them by the L-rd when they came to conquer the land, by crossing them over the Jordan on the dry land, by their warring against the men of Canaan as He pelted them with great stones from the heavens, and by His causing the sun to stand still in the midst of the heavens. And if the \"wise ones\" (those filled with compassion and kindness to the distant and the dead) would arise and say: \"How could the L-rd command the destruction of an entire nation — men and women, young and old, sucklings and nurslings who did not sin?\" you, in kind, \"dull their teeth\" and say to them: \"And when the earth quakes and trembles, and houses fall on their dwellers, or if it come to pass in a land that half its inhabitants are cut off and perish, did the L-rd not command it?\" It is not for me to defend the Almighty. It suffices for me if I have demonstrated clearly that what the L-rd commanded to Israel, both as regards the borrowing of the vessels from the Egyptians and the annihilating of the dwellers of Canaan did not leave in their hearts a negative impress which vitiated their character, but, to the contrary, strengthened their belief in providence and in reward and punishment."

                "Comparable to this is the coupling of the commandment to cut off Amalek with the exhortation (Devarim 25:10) \"You shall not forget.\" All this, to render despicable in the eyes of Israel the act of deceit, the act of Amalek. For he had no complaint against Israel, and Israel was not coming to wage war with him. But he sneaked up from behind them, when Israel was weak and fatigued, and without compassion or fear of G-d killed those who straggled behind. For this reason, after Moses exhorted them against deceit in weights and measures, concluding with (Ibid. 16) \"For the abomination of the L-rd is … all who do wrong,\" he mentioned Amalek; for he, too, was guilty of wrong and deceit, Moses epitomizing Amalek's turpitude in (Ibid. 18) \"who met you upon the way and cut off all who straggled behind you when you were weak and weary and (he) did not fear G-d.\" And He set Amalek up as a sign and an omen for \"the sons of deceit,\" commanding to cut him off without forgetting or relenting. From this they (Israel) would learn how despicable to the L-rd was every man of perfidy and how sore his punishment at the hands of the L-rd. And, beyond a doubt, this commandment, too, did not leave any negative impress on the heart of Israel, but, to the contrary, availed to distance them from repugnant acts when they saw how much the Almighty despised them and punished their perpetrators."

How much more so in those days, when the destruction of peoples was a commonplace in wars, and they would lay open pregnant women and crush their infants upon a rock, the command to cut off the Canaanites and Amalek would not sound as unthinkable as it does in our days. Do we not find that when Saul and the people were \"compassionate\" in the war with Amalek, to whom were they compassionate? To the old people, or to the women, or to the pregnant women, or to the sucklings? Not so. They were \"compassionate\" only to Agag (the king) himself and to the choicest of the flock and the herd. Is this, in truth, compassion? They let the king live only to gain glory thereby and they kept the choicest of the herd and the flock alive only so that they could eat their flesh. And it was for this reason that the L-rd was wroth with Saul. For He knew that it was not out of compassion that he defied His word, but only to indulge himself and his people and for the glory of his name."

To the people in general — for open transgressions; and to each individual — for those committed in secret. For the will of the Giver of the Torah was to make all of Israel responsible for one another, this being a potent means of impeding the spread of subversion and corruption in the people. For, G-dly retribution being to the people collectively, it follows that if one sees his neighbor corrupting his ways, he will not say \"What business is it of mine?\", but he will reprove him. And if he continues sinning, he will testify against him in <i>beth-din</i>, which will punish him. \"And all the people will hear and fear.\" Therefore, the blessings and curses (in the Torah) are to the nation in general. And it is only concerning those sins which are normally committed in secret and concerning the non-performance (in secret) of positive commandments (as per Rashbam, Ibn Ezra, and Ra'avan [Even Ha'ezer 45]) that it was said \"Cursed is the <i>man</i>.\" And the L-rd desired that when they come to the land, the Levites proclaim to all the people the blessings and the curses, (\"And it shall be if you will hear\" — Devarim 28:1; \"And it shall be if you will not hear\" — Ibid. 15), in order to impress upon them that they are all responsible for one another. For reward and punishment are for the people collectively. But before the blessings and the curses (vis-à-vis the people collectively), the L-rd desired that the Levites proclaim \"Cursed is <i>the man</i> who sins in secret\" (viz. Devarim 27:15). And this, for two reasons: The first, that the sinner in secret not say in his heart: \"Since the majority of the people are upright, if I sin what of it? Shall one man sin and He be wroth with the entire congregation?\" And second, that the people not despair and say: \"We are lost; all of us are lost. For perhaps one or many will sin in secret and His wrath will be against the entire nation.\" But they will know and remember that (Devarim 29:28) \"the hidden things are for the L-rd our G-d to punish\" and \"the revealed ones for us and our children\" to punish the sinners. So that the proclamation of \"Cursed is the man who sins in secret\" is a blessing for the people in general, that it will not be punished for the secret sins (of the others). And this is the intent in <i>Joshua</i> 8:33-34 \"… as Moses the servant of Israel had commanded to bless the people first.

Bamidbar 35:33) — wherefore, since the slayer is not known to them and they cannot bring him to justice, the heifer is broken instead of him and the elders wash their hands (over the heifer) as a sign that they and their senders are innocent and their palms were not sullied by the blood of the slain one, and 2) (in the strength of their conviction in the punishment adverting to the land for the blood spilt in it —) that they not come to kill an innocent man suspected of that murder without incontestable proof and clear testimony. For though they knew that all of the people were not responsible for one who slew his neighbor in secret, they might think that this was so only when the slain one was not known (i.e., when he has not been found), but in our instance, where the corpse <i>has</i> been found, they might think that all the congregation <i>would</i> be punished unless they exerted themselves to find the killer."

The rationale for the prohibition of adultery is self-evident — to prevent the violence, the contention, and the murders that would result therefrom. And even if a man would acquiesce in this and permit his wife to a man of wealth, it is forbidden because of the corruption that would affect the people as a whole. The rationale for the prohibition of relations between man and beast: they run counter to nature, and if they were permitted, marriage with women would diminish. Illicit relations between kin: they are forbidden for the good of the family, amelioration of character, and the welfare of society. For living with one's mother, his father's wife, his father's sister, or the wife of his father's brother runs counter to honoring his father and mother, which, in turn, causes corruption of character and family disorganization. Similarly, one's son's wife is analogous to one's daughter to her in-laws, so that if her father-in-law lives with her, this will demean the honor of both in-laws and the father and the son. Similarly, taking a woman and her daughter creates equality between them and demeans the honor of the mother. The (rationale for) the prohibition of living with a woman and her sister is implicit in the word \"<i>litzror</i>\" (\"to be rivals,\" viz. Vayikra 18:18) \"And a woman together with her sister you shall not take, to be rivals\"), that is, to breed envy and hatred between them, when it is their <i>nature</i> to <i>love</i> each other. And it is well known that hatred among lovers is deeper than hatred among strangers, for as deep as the former love is the hatred that follows in its wake — the result: corruption of character and great dislocation of the family unit. Similarly, living with one's brother's wife leads to envy and hatred between the brothers. And even after his brother's death, if he left over children and his brother takes his wife in levirate marriage (yibum), this will foment hatred between himself and his brother's children, as it will between his children and his brother's children, and it, too, will result in corruption of character and dislocation of the family unit.

                "<i>Tumah</i> (ritual uncleanliness) is divided into two types: <i>tumah</i> whose cleansing involves the bringing of an offering and <i>tumah</i> whose cleansing does not involve the bringing of an offering. We shall begin with the <i>tumah</i> of leprosy (tzara'ath), the most severe of the <i>tumoth</i> of the first type. Many have conjectured that the distancing of the leper is due to his being contagious. Now aside from the fact that this is not agreed upon by the doctors, it seems to me that if the Torah was concerned about contagion, there are other contagious diseases for which the Torah prescribed no remedy. Why, (for example) did the Torah not legislate for pestilence? It would seem to me (in seeking the rationale for the Torah's enactment regarding leprosy) that change in appearance of the skin was regarded by the ancients as a sign of G-d's rebuke and that the leper in their minds was being afflicted by G-d as punishment for a severe sin that he was guilty of, wherefore they separated from him as from a man anathematized by G-d. Similarly, a change in the appearance of a garment or a house was to them a sign of G-d's rebuke, as if the afflicted garment or house were hated by G-d by reason of some severe sin that had been done in them. And since all this abetted the belief in providence and reward and punishment by G-d, the Torah sustained this belief and commanded the distancing of the leper, the burning of the garment, and the razing of the house where the plague-spot was found, and the sprinkling and the cleansing of the house. And it likewise commanded that one healed of leprosy bring a sacrifice, so that as soon as there departed from him G-d's rebuke and anathematization which distanced him from appearing before Him, he come to the house of the L-rd and humble himself before Him and thank Him for having again drawn him close to Him and beseech Him not to rebuke him again and distance him from Him. This is the rationale of (Vayikra 14:18) \"And the Cohein shall atone (for the one to be cleansed) before the L-rd.\" For through the offering G-d is reconciled with him and reposes His lovingkindness upon him. And it would seem that the two birds, the cedar wood, the hyssop, the crimson, and the sprinklings are all a sign and intimation of atonement of the sin, to make it known that the leper is no longer anathematized by the L-rd. The crimson intimates transgression, transgressions being symbolized by redness, as in (Isaiah 1:18) \"If your sins be as crimson, etc.\", symbolizing the spilling of blood, the worst of the transgressions. Cedar and hyssop intimate great and small, respectively, as in (I Kings 5:13) \"from the cedar that is in Levanon until the hyssop that emerges from the wall\" — so that cedar and hyssop and crimson intimate grave and lesser transgressions respectively. The blood of the slaughtered bird signifies great cleansing, i.e., cleansing from a great sin, for man atones by (the blood of) life. And the living waters signify lesser cleansing, i.e., cleansing from a lesser sin. The two birds are the atonement for the leper and his \"exchange.\" One is slaughtered and its blood atones for his life. The other lives and is connected with his transgressions (cedar wood, hyssop, and crimson) and it is dipped in blood and in water, which is sprinkled upon the leper, intimating that his transgressions have been atoned and he has returned to his state of cleanliness. Afterwards, the living bird is sent over the face of the field, this signifying that the leper is no longer quarantined outside the camp, but has emerged from his sequestration and may go wherever he wills."

The <i>niddah</i> (a menstruant), however, was not obligated to bring an offering, the Torah being solicitous of the daughters of Israel and not requiring them to exert themselves to travel from their place and come to the house of the L-rd every month. And it is not to be contended that her not being required to bring an offering is due to the improbability of her imploring the L-rd that she not revert to her <i>niddah</i> state, for there <i>is</i> a probability of her imploring that, when she does revert to it, her <i>tumah</i> not extend so long as to render her a <i>zavah</i> (a woman with a \"flux\" [viz. Vayikra 15:25]). Along the same lines, a woman after childbirth required an offering, not in order to implore that she not beget again, but to implore that in her (next) birth she not die. For blood issuing from a woman in childbirth is a sign of death, of which all women in childbirth are in danger."

                "Those <i>tumoth</i> cleansing from which does not entail the bringing of an offering are dead-body <i>tumah</i>, carrion <i>tumah</i>, and semen <i>tumah</i> in the absence of sickness. These do not entail atonement, for they do not descend from Heaven but are contingent upon the will of man. If he wishes, he becomes <i>tamei</i>; if he does not wish it, he does not become <i>tamei</i> (But the Torah does not legislate separately for exceptional cases, for which reason there is no special enactment in this regard for one on whom someone has died suddenly and the like [viz. Bamidbar 6:9-11]), so that the aforementioned <i>tema'im</i> (unclean ones) cannot be perceived as \"anathematized <i>by the L-rd</i>.\" But the dead body and carrion <i>convey</i> <i>tumah</i>. For death is G-d's rebuke, than which there is nothing more severe. And if the leper and the <i>zav</i> convey <i>tumah</i> to those who touch them, being anathematized by the L-rd, how much more so a dead body! And because of the gravity of dead-body <i>tumah</i>, the toucher, too, was anathematized for seven days and required sprinkling with the waters of purification. But a slaughtered beast is not <i>tamei</i>, for its death was not at the hands of Heaven and by way of rebuke, but by man and for the benefit of man. A slain man, however, even though he is slain by man, is <i>tamei</i>. For a man is more subject to providence and reward and punishment than a beast. Therefore, if a man dies, even at the hands of man, still, his death is perceived as decreed by G-d and by His rebuke. The same is not to be said for a beast slaughtered (for consumption) or killed. The rationale for the <i>tumah</i> of semen is respect for the Temple and its holy objects. That a man not come to the house of the L-rd and eat holy flesh on the day when he indulged in (non-essential) bodily pleasure (as opposed to eating and drinking) along the lines of the command preceding the giving of the Torah, (Shemoth 19:15) \"Be ready in three days. Do not draw near to a woman.\" This prohibition exalts and uplifts in the mind of the entire congregation the honor due the sanctuary and its holy objects, as it does in the minds of the Cohanim the service which they perform, all of this being of great avail in magnifying the fear of G-d in the hearts of the Cohanim and the people. The sprinkling of the purifying waters symbolized the removal of sin; the red heifer, in its redness, symbolized transgression; and thus, the cedar wood, the hyssop, and the crimson symbolized transgression, greater and lesser; their being burnt together, the nullification of transgression, as did the ashes — wherefore its sprinkling purified one from dead-body <i>tumah</i>, the gravest of all. But although the transgression was burned, it was not entirely nullified, for the remaining ashes retained some of it, wherefore they imparted lesser-degree <i>tumah</i> to the toucher — which was removed through ritual immersion. And it is not to be wondered how the red heifer cleansed the <i>tamei</i> and rendered <i>tamei</i> the clean, removing grave <i>tumah</i> and imparting lesser <i>tumah</i>. An analogy: A copper vessel (to be ritually cleansed) must first be scoured with sand, which removes what rinsing in water did not suffice to remove, after which it must again be rinsed in water to remove the sand stuck to it, as it is written (Vayikra 6:21) \"It shall be scoured and rinsed in water.\" The scourer, too, must rinse his hands because of the impurity cleaving to them. In the same way, the ashes of the red heifer effect strong \"scouring\" and remove the graver <i>tumah</i>, after which (ritual) immersion is required for those occupying themselves with the waters of purification as well as for the waters sprinkled upon him."

For a man cannot conduct himself with his G-d other than he does with a king of flesh and blood. And when they came to offer a gift to G-d they could find no other way to do so than by burning it with fire. For by doing so, they took it out of their domain and out of the domain of other men and out of the domain of beasts, animals, and birds. Also, as it was burning and its smoke ascended on high, it seemed to them as if it were ascending to G-d.

For if the Torah apprised the people that the L-rd does not desire burnt-offerings for sacrifices, they would say \"Why does the L-rd desire that we be righteous and what profit if we mend our ways?\" and since one of the foundations of the Torah is that G-d is providential with men and loves doers of good and hates evildoers it was essential that G-d not be perceived in the quintessence of exaltation, in His true eminence, but that His eminence be \"lowered\" somewhat, as it were, so that He be perceived by men as a great king who is attuned to all of their deeds, who hears their outcries, and who receives their gifts. And this necessity existed not only for that generation; but it exists equally for all generations. And, if in place of sacrifices G-d would command prayer and song, reading of the Torah and listening to words of <i>mussar</i> (chastisement), and He would not command the offering of sacrifices, the majesty of G-d and His fear would not be impressed upon the multitude. For it would seem to them that the gods of the nations, whose servants <i>did</i> sacrifice before them were greater and more to be honored than our G-d, whose service is only with words alone. For this is the way of the multitude in all generations. And not only the way of the multitude alone, but that of most individuals. Whom do they honor? One who honors and aggrandizes himself. One who is self-effacing and does not seek grandeur for himself is of no consequence to them.",

The \"fruit\" of the sacrifices offered by the congregation in the Temple was this: It was impressed upon the heart of the multitude that a great G-d and king dwelt in their midst, that they were beloved by Him and that He commanded them to perform the (sacrificial) service desired by Him, and that by performing this service as commanded they are reconciled to Him each day and perpetually draw His love down upon themselves."

For if the entire people had one (central) sanctuary, they would all gather together in one place, their hearts would be bound in brotherhood, they would always be unified, and each tribe and family would not be a people unto themselves. But if everyone built a <i>bamah</i> for himself, it would suffice him that G-d be well disposed to <i>him</i> and receive <i>his</i> offerings, and he would not be concerned at all for the rest of his nation — when the will of the Torah was that reward be collective and that all of Israel be mutually responsible. It is also possible (if everyone had his own bamah) that the sacrificial service would be undermined by a family or a tribe and they would alter its provisions. And little by little they would adopt the statutes of the nations and customs that are detestable to the Blessed One, to the point of sacrificing their own sons and daughters.

And this would not be impressed upon the hearts of the multitude without a tangible emblem of this, wherefore it was necessary that the Temple resemble a king's palace, that there be in it a table and a menorah, that there be on the table a display of bread and the vessels appertaining to the table, its dishes and its spoons. And since it was customary to present to G-d a gift of edibles, it was fitting to bring before our King things that betokened eating and drinking: the sacrifices, for eating, and the libations, for drinking. And it was necessary that the king have palace servants who pay attendance upon him — the Cohanim: one of them beholding the face of the king, sitting first in the kingdom — the high-priest. And it was necessary that the sanctuary and its vessels and the Cohanim and their vestments be resplendent and majestic to impress upon the populace the grandeur of the King dwelling in the Temple and so that His fear be \"upon their faces\" that they not sin. And though in the beginning, when everyone built a <i>bamah</i> for himself the service was relegated to any man or to the first-born, now that the sacrifices were offered in only one place it was necessary that the service be relegated to one family who served in the name of the entire people. And it was fitting that this family devoted to the service of G-d be freed of other labors and services. And since its service was in the house of G-d in the name of all the people, it was fitting that its sustenance be provided by the people. However, since it would <i>not</i> be fitting that <i>every</i> Cohein and Levite receive a fixed stipend, the <i>tzaddik</i> and the evildoer alike, the Torah left it to the discretion of each Israelite to give his gifts to any Cohein and Levite that he desired.

(Vayikra 19:19) \"You shall not mate your beast with <i>a diverse kind</i>\" (kilayim), \"your field you shall not sow with <i>diverse seeds</i>\" (kilayim), \"and a mingled (kilayim, [interwoven]) garment, <i>sha'atnez</i>, shall not come upon you.\" For the idolators would ascribe a charm and a benefit to the intermingling of diverse species, believing that in this way there would be unified in one bond the diverse gods appointed over each of these species respectively. All of these constitute denial of the Oneness of G-d and are deserving of distancing by the Torah."
