These are people who go to war not out of necessity, when they have no other choice, but rather as if going to a dance. Only in war do find a place where they can show off and highlight their power and being. ",

Amalek was granted a greater share of the sword than other peoples; and Israel of the book, and one can only be built from the destruction of the other. When one is ascendant, the other falls; therefore there is a perpetual war between Israel and Amalek.",

After all, in our day, with our own eyes we have seen a “commanded” war of that type, The Great War that fought under the banner of “a war to end all wars.” The consequences of this war are all too well known to everyone. ",
                "Indeed, under Jewish procedural law, the prosecutor can become an advocate, evil cannot be uprooted from the world using evil itself, we cannot remove terror from the world by using terrorism on the other side, and therefore we do not fight a mighty arm with a mighty arm, or the sword with a sword.

When we, God willing, will sit at the Seder in another few days, we will see the cup of Eliyahu before us. The door will open, and the honorable Eliyahu himself will come in as we greet him with, welcome! Then he hears our gut-wrenching and heart-breaking prayer, \"Pour your wrath upon the nations that did not know You and upon the kingdoms that did not call upon Your Name! Since they have consumed Yaakov and laid waste his habitation (Psalms 79:6-7), etc.\" And it is not only the holiday of Passover, but rather also Shabbat Hagadol (the Shabbat before Passover) that is dedicated to Eliyahu the prophet. So in that day's haftara, we speak only about him. But why. ",
