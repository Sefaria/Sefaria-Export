        "Preface": [
            "In 1965, Karl Popper published a now-famous essay called “Of Clouds and Clocks” to describe two kinds of problems. To oversimplify his thesis, clocks are precision instruments that measure time. A clock problem for Popper is one that has a definite answer, like the question: what time is it? Cloud problems are different. They are amorphous and complex. In Popper’s words: “My clouds are intended to represent physical systems which, like gases, are highly irregular, disorderly, and more or less unpredictable.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Karl Popper, <i>Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach </i>(New York: Oxford University Press, 1979), 207.</i> Popper did not regard problems of science as clock problems alone. Many dilemmas are cloud problems and are, therefore, more elusive and beguiling.",
            "Leadership has very few clock problems and a bewildering number of cloud problems. In contemporary leadership literature, cloud problems are often called swamp problems, to use yet another aspect of nature. A swamp is a wetland characterized by low elevation and widespread areas of water that house decaying vegetation. A swamp problem is one that is messy and confusing and defies an easy technical solution. The term was coined by Donald Schon, a professor at MIT and an expert in organizational structures. Schon understood that research and technical knowledge are usually incubated at high elevations, like university laboratories and libraries. But take that research into the trenches where the challenges of reality push on knowledge and abstraction, and suddenly you find yourself in a swamp. It’s not easy to stand in a swamp. It’s also not easy to get out of one.",
            "This book trades in the cloud and the swamp for another leadership metaphor from nature: the desert, or more precisely the <i>midbar</i> or wilderness of the ancient Israelites. This is a leadership book set against the backdrop of the ancient wilderness. Early on in our journey, we received a set of commandments designed as a moral and spiritual constitution to determine and shape the character and commitments of a nation. They offered us reason through a process of revelation. The rules had to be lived to test their worth and our mettle. Strangely, we received the Ten Commandments in a desert and not in our homeland; they came to us in transition and not at a time of stability. Our experience in the wilderness surfaced critical tensions in the struggle for moral leadership and competency in an unforgiving landscape. The rules were not protocols intended for a particular place or situation. Receiving them in a place of transition, we were to understand that rules we live by transcend any limited boundaries. They were given to us to shape a future that would always be precarious and unknown. As a result, the fourth book of the Pentateuch, the book of Numbers, is just as relevant for leadership today as it was in days long past.",
            "The wilderness is an excellent metaphor for contingency leadership, leadership that depends on flexible skills to confront unexpected dangers and unanticipated dramas – which encompass most of leadership today. Nature may be indifferent to its travelers, but our ancient travelers were not indifferent to nature. They were awed by its beauty, its dangers, and its provocations. In these narratives, rocks spat water and withheld water; the earth offered up giant fruit yet swallowed up rebels. Animals spoke while human beings were often at a loss for words. Enemies blessed us, and friends betrayed us. Ascetics grew their hair while tempers ran short. At every turn, the ground was carpeted with the bones of sinners and recidivists. As a result of the constant tumult, leaders in Numbers faced a breakdown of authority, the decay of trust and faith, and the near anarchic rabble-rousing of those beset by discontent. Leadership conflict is thus unavoidable as we read its pages. The leadership lessons are lodged within its details. A surface reading alone will not yield its insights on how leadership broke down and how it was slowly rebuilt.",
            "The word “<i>midbar</i>” is full of contradictions. It is used, according to <i>Desert and Shepherd in Our Biblical Heritage</i>, to signify arid places with very little rainfall.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nogah Hareuveni, <i>Desert and Shepherd in Our Biblical Heritage</i> (Neot Kedumim: The Biblical Landscape Reserve in Israel, 1991), 27.</i> In the spirit of incongruity, “<i>midbar</i>” is used elsewhere in the Bible to identify grazing spaces, places on the margins of human habitation that provided food. The root word of “<i>midbar</i>” is D-V-R, a word or a thing. A place of silence was filled, over the course of the journey, with language: the language of complaints and murmurings and voices unseen. But the wilderness was also filled with painful silence, the silence of unanswered questions and riddling doubts. Ultimately, words mattered little. Broken promises littered the desert floor. The translation of the word “<i>midbar</i>” in the King James Bible apparently takes 110 different forms. Scholars understand its usage to refer not only to words but also to that which comes after or that which comes as a consequence of something else. A <i>davar</i> is both that which exists and that which has yet to exist. It is a place of being and a place of becoming.",
            "In the spirit of becoming a nation, lengthy and arduous travel forced people to move only with that which they could carry. The wilderness stripped away the accidental and left our ancient ancestors burdened only with what was essential. This process of stripping away made them challenge every preconceived assumption about their relationships with God, with Moses, with self, and with other. Eventually, it stripped a nation of its three most illustrious leaders and most of its followers. No citizenship is required to live in the desert. It was, for us, our <i>tabula rasa</i>, our empty canvas, our blank slate. The book of Numbers tells the story of one of the great ironies of Jewish history: the ancient Israelites entered an uncivilized place to create a civilization. In so doing, the ancients created a leadership path for us to follow by laying bare their failures and eventually repairing them. But it also exposed us to only one form of leadership – prophetic leadership – where we would one day have others: priest, judge, or king. Our prophets railed against priests and kings for their exploitation of power. Because no one paradigm of leadership was ever effective or ethically sustainable, we traded one for another, or badgered the current leadership for alternatives. For this reason, we must begin our journey by exploring the attitudes to leadership that underline the Bible generally and then turn to Numbers to narrow the challenges. Leadership is an inevitable necessity of life within any group or organization – especially portable communities – and it will always be fraught with deep moral chasms and fissures. We will examine some of these together: the impact of the landscape on its inhabitants, the attitude we had to ascetics and strangers, the role of animals and symbols, and the changing relationship that Moses, Aaron, and Miriam had with each other and with their followers. We will put ourselves in the ancient Israelites’ windswept sandals to learn at their feet.",

                "In <i>The Art of Travel, </i>the philosopher Alain de Botton discusses, among other things, the way that travel disorients us.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Alain De Botton, <i>The Art of Travel</i> (New York: Pantheon, 2002).</i> The moment we change our environs, they begin to change us. We may find ourselves reverting to a more childish, less independent self. We may regress emotionally or question who we are existentially. Alternatively, this very questioning may bring about necessary character changes and open up new vistas. We may feel energized and invigorated in a foreign landscape or feel enervated and out of sorts. This transformation often begins with the body and travels to the soul. Our eating and sleeping are not the same. We may find the weather conditions physically challenging or a welcome change. We know that the travel experience, which is often for vacation, is supposed to help us rest and recoup. Yet often the change in our surroundings exhausts us, even when we have voluntarily chosen to travel.",
                "<i>The Art of Travel </i>assumes that there is an art to making a journey and that we can somehow script the experience. But not all travel is self-selected, and very few travel experiences are controlled enough to make an art of them. More often they are full of surprises and unpredictable turns, even when we choreograph each day. Strange languages, smells, tastes, and behaviors fill our senses and generate wonder at how other human beings live, and how changes in demographics and topographies contribute to those differences.",
                "On the surface, the Israelites should have mastered the art of travel in the wilderness. They were the recipients of daily food that came in predictable amounts at predetermined times. They were protected by fire and a cloud. They were told when to go forth to their next location. Their leader regularly communicated with God, the God who saved them from the entrapment of slavery. Yet all of these factors seemed only to contribute to their alienation, rather than to their salvation. They experienced the emotional dizziness of a strange combination: they were free from slavery in a place that was entirely unfamiliar, thus forcing dependency and diminishing any hard-won autonomy. They complained that they could not be self-determining, when they were actually desperate for direction and leadership.",
                "In this regard, the wilderness experience is not unlike organizational structures that constrain individuals for the sake of a collective mission. People fight against hierarchies, but simultaneously need them in order to locate themselves in relation to sources of power. Erich Fromm argued elegantly in <i>Escape from Freedom</i> that people join all kinds of institutions to limit their autonomy, since this will also limit their accountability.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Erich Fromm, <i>Escape from Freedom </i>(New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1969).</i> We say that we want freedom when we really want the liberty to make choices that actually restrict our exercise of freedom. This creates a losing situation for most leaders, since people want to be told what to do while arguing that they should not be told what to do. Anyone who has raised adolescents understands this tension inherently. The leader must offer firm direction in order to fulfill the criteria of leadership – to have followers – but the act of leading will, by virtue of the imposition of power on others, create resistance. The leader continuously negotiates this, aware that he or she will never experience sustainable victory, just minor triumphs along the path to exhaustion.",
                "Situations of ambiguity put additional pressures on this dialectic tension. In familiar surroundings, people take ironic comfort in hierarchies and may experience agitation when others break accepted boundaries or protocols. But in unfamiliar situations, once-reliable infrastructures and accepted divisions can break down. Perceived leaders with established authority who cannot negotiate change often cede their power unwillingly to leaders who can step into the breach and make their way in the dark. Leadership is unpredictable enough without changing the landscape.",
                "<b>Changing the Landscape</b><br>The wild – the <i>midbar</i> – is a place of anarchy, unexpected hardships, and harsh physical conditions that can bewilder and swallow visitors. When the Israelites finally fled Egypt, God said that Pharaoh would come after them precisely because they were going to the wilderness: “They are astray in the land; the wilderness has closed in on them” (Ex. 14:3). Pharaoh did not think they could go far, imprisoned as they would be by nature. The wilderness closes in on people. The Hebrew term in the verse, “<i>sagar</i>,” implies a place that treacherously imprisons inhabitants. The landscape locks people in, and they do not come out. God used the very same rationale in having them enter the wilderness in the first place: “God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, although it was nearer, for God said: ‘The people may have a change of heart when they see war and return to Egypt.’ So God led the people roundabout, by way of the wilderness” (Ex. 13:17–18). In the wilderness, the Israelites would suffer disorientation and would, therefore, not be able to find their way back to Egypt even if they were to change their minds in fear. Remorse and regret have no place to lodge because the wilderness constrains its inhabitants, punishing them with its sameness, blinding them to exit routes and clarity.",
                "In Hebrew, we call the fourth book of the Pentateuch “<i>Bemidbar</i>” to reflect this chaos, but everything about the book of Numbers is enigmatic, even its title. In English, Numbers is so called because it begins with a census and is even referred to in rabbinic literature as the “Book of the Count.” A census is one way that we organize our world, show responsibility for it, and make an accounting. To confront chaos, humans do the only thing that they can do. They organize themselves and prepare for the uncertainty that they face. The census provided two critical pieces of information: the number of those men between the ages of twenty and sixty who could perform army service, and the number of Levites between the ages of thirty and sixty. The census was not only a way to account for the group; it was also the mechanism by which the human protection and the spiritual salvation of the encampment were enumerated. Numbers are used to categorize, measure, evaluate, and keep track of that which matters. As the Israelites began the second month of the second year of a forty-year journey, God commanded Moses to count them. They were counted multiple times during their desert trek. The leader must make, at regular intervals, a full reckoning of all of his followers.",
                "The Israelites were counted several times before the end of Numbers. Every time such a count is made, we wonder what occasions it; indeed, our intrigue was shared by Bible commentators throughout the ages. In the wilderness, the survival of the morally fittest was worthy of observation. “When the plague was over, the Lord said to Moses and to Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, ‘Take a census of the whole Israelite community’” (Num. 26:2). Twenty-four thousand people had been killed in a plague in Shittim, the site of Israelite idol worship under the seduction of Moabite women. Such a count was necessary after the plague to assess the casualties of this war against immorality. Indeed, if we scan the book of Numbers, we find that tens of thousands of Israelites had been killed in various plagues and skirmishes, and, as Abraham Ibn Ezra comments, the number of Israelites was depleted nearly by half from the time of their Exodus from Egypt. Looking back, this sea change in population was important to note. It is the most tragic commentary on poor followship (the act of following).",
                "Most commentators, however, relate to the census not as a reflection on the past, but as a signal of what was about to happen in the near future: the children of Israel would soon arrive at the borders of the Promised Land. This event required a count of arms-bearers to ensure a secure army presence. In addition, the Land of Israel was about to be apportioned into plots according to tribes, and the number of individuals in any particular tribe would determine the size of land received. This explains why the verse also included the clause that individuals be counted, “by their ancestral houses” (Num. 26:2). The census assured the Israelites that they were still strong in number and represented a large enough population to settle the land.",
                "The message of a census is that numbers rather than individuals matter. Although a large grouping can create a sense of strength and vitality in an otherwise desolate place, a census often imparts the feeling that individual worth is less significant than tribal affiliation or military might. Rashi, citing a midrash, takes a different view, and it is one that makes the census seem more humane. He first explains, as earlier observed, that the plague had a devastating effect, and the Israelites needed a recount to assess their numbers.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi, Numbers 26:1.</i> He uses a parable to explain. When a shepherd realizes that wolves have found his flock, he counts each and every sheep to see which are left. Rashi’s second explanation continues the theme of the parable. When the children of Israel left Egypt and were trusted to Moses’ care, they were counted. When Moses himself was on the cusp of death, he had to count his sheep again before handing them back to their Creator. Instead of an activity void of names and feelings, the census becomes, in the words of Rashi, an act of love, affection, and accountability on the part of God or Moses or both.",
                "Traveling through the words of commentators, we find that the census was either prompted by a need for salvage after a plague, an act of preparation before entering the Land of Israel, or the last testament of a leader acknowledging that his time had come and that it was time to return the gift with which he had been entrusted. Underpinning all three of these explanations is the idea that counting people takes place before or after a seismic shift. It is, then, in the face of great and uncertain change, that numbers again become important. They provide a physical anchor, a sense of solidity in a time of potential havoc. Numbers need not be regarded as impersonal or irrelevant to the narrative. In <i>Once Upon a Number</i>, John Allen Paulos makes the argument that numbers and words serve each other. “Describing the world may be thought of as an Olympic contest between simplifiers – scientists in general, statisticians in particular – and complicators – humanists in general, storytellers in particular. It is a contest both should win.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">John Allen Paulos, <i>Once Upon a Number </i>(New York: Basic Books, 1998), 16.</i> Our numbers help tell the story of leadership.",
                "Numbers ground leaders in reality. But wilderness – <i>midbar</i> – defies all that the word “numbers” signifies. One book has two titles that wrestle each other and reveal two contradictory faces of the biblical text.",
                "Order. Anarchy. Numbers. Fear. Freedom. Hunger. Independence. Loneliness. These struggles and others are present in the <i>midbar</i> – a place of beauty, escape, and self-destruction – and are everywhere imprinted on the pages of the Hebrew Bible. The wilderness is a place of liberation, expansiveness, passion, contemplation, and divine protection. In the book of Nehemiah, God’s grace peaked in the wilderness:",
                "<small>You, in Your abundant compassion, did not abandon them in the wilderness. The pillar of the cloud did not depart from them to lead them on the way by day, nor the pillar of fire by night to give them light in the way they were to go. You endowed them with Your good spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold Your manna from their mouth; You gave them water when they were thirsty. Forty years You sustained them in the wilderness so that they lacked nothing; their clothes did not wear out, and their feet did not swell. (Neh. 9:19–21)</small>",
                "In this depiction, the Israelites were not lost, but were offered careful guidance in both light and dark. All of their material needs were tended to, and all of the usual problems they might have anticipated on such a journey were avoided. Harsh weather did not eat away their clothes, even as the years passed. Seemingly endless perambulation did not swell their feet. Every provision was divinely provided. They were in good spirits for decades. They experienced no longing. They had utter dependence on a God who nurtured them with intimacy. A midrash that supports this reading describes the Israelites in the wilderness as if they were walking in a spiritual dreamscape: “They looked as if in a state of ecstasy.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bava Batra 74a, attributed to Rabba bar bar Hana.</i>",
                "This portrait, however, does not corroborate with large swaths of the Numbers narrative. In the text, the wilderness was also a place where nutritional sources were limited and cravings went unsatisfied. The Israelites had no idea where they were or how long they would be there. The desert snared its travelers, who found themselves lost and meandering, without the assiduous direction-setting described in Nehemiah’s revision. Feet <i>did</i> ache. Throats <i>were </i>parched. Hearts were wracked with the weight of failure. Bodies were consumed with despair. Leaders wept in hopelessness.",
                "Out of the three seminal protagonists who forged the Exodus – Moses, Aaron, and Miriam – two died in the book of Numbers, and all three died in the wilderness. Moses died alone, buried in a valley overlooking a place of Israelite debauchery. Miriam’s death catches us completely by surprise in the opening of Numbers 20 and merits only a clause in one verse: “and the people stayed at Kadesh. Miriam died there and was buried there. The community was without water, and they joined against Moses and Aaron” (Num. 20:1–2). There is no recorded communal burial. It is as if the sands quickly covered her, as the Israelites marched on, complaining insensitively about their unquenchable thirst to two fresh mourners.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The well-known midrash that opens the account of Miriam’s death in Numbers 20 spins the narrative into a positive reading of what sounds like an ignominious end, by juxtaposing Miriam’s death with the lack of water, crediting a well in Miriam’s honor that disappeared when she died. But even this “consolation prize” cannot distract the reader from the brutal reality of the text. No one but her brothers mourned her; the Israelites were too self-absorbed in their physical needs to notice. The woman who, as a young girl, watched over the Israelites’ chief savior and ensured his early nurturing, the woman who led the women in joyous song later as the Israelites crossed the sea, suffered a cruel death of indifference. The wilderness even devoured human compassion.</i> As death became a looming reality, the grieving brothers barely picked up their heads at the loss. Miriam was one of many, an entire generation who disappeared into oblivion. The text informs us of the fate of tribes who were poised to conquer the land: “Among these there was not one of those enrolled by Moses and Aaron the priest when they recorded the Israelites in the wilderness of Sinai. For the Lord said of them, ‘They shall die in the wilderness’” (Num. 26:64–65). Tens of thousands died in the <i>midbar</i>, fulfilling God’s prediction: “Say to them: ‘As I live,’ says the Lord, ‘I will do to you just as you have urged Me. In this very wilderness shall your carcasses fall’” (Num. 14:28–29). The verse offers a visual shock: littered on the desert floor were the bones of those who once journeyed to freedom. Carcasses fell in the wilderness without name or marker, affirming the observations of one scholar: “The omission of particular, discrete sites of burial has the effect of turning the wilderness <i>in its entirety</i> into a vast and terrible burying ground.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Adriane B. Leveen, “Falling in the Wilderness: Death Reports in the Book of Numbers,” <i>Prooftexts</i> 22, no. 3 (2002): 262.</i>",
                "Bible scholar Robert Cohn notes that in the wilderness texts, there was not one single birth recorded.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Robert L. Cohn, <i>The Shape of Sacred Space: Four Biblical Studies</i> (Chico, CA: Scholars Press, 1981), 16.</i> And we wonder as we read this fact how we did not notice this before. Contrast this with the introduction to Exodus, which records the Israelite population growing with reptilian fecundity:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Avivah Gottlieb Zornberg in <i>The Particulars of Rapture</i> (New York: Doubleday, 2001), 19, on the almost unnatural growth in the first chapters of Exodus, encapsulated by the verse’s choice of verb, “<i>vayishretzu</i>” (they swarmed): “This can mean the blessing of extraordinary increase; but it connotes a reptilian fecundity, which introduces a bizarre note in the description of human fertility…‘<i>vayishretzu</i>’ is a repellent description for a family fallen from greatness.”</i> “The Israelites were fertile and prolific [<i>vayishretzu</i>]; they multiplied and increased very greatly so that the land was filled with them” (Ex. 1:7). Oppression only augmented their numbers in the first real fulfillment of the Genesis promise to be fruitful and multiply: “But the more they were oppressed, the more they increased and spread out, so that they [the Egyptians] came to dread the Israelites” (Ex. 1:12). It is hard to imagine in any subsequent period of Jewish history that a host country would fear the Jews because of their numerical strength. Yet the punishing conditions of Egypt did not serve as an obstacle to fertility in the only biblical text to make good on the Abrahamic promise to make the Israelites “too many to count.” Egypt, a place regarded in the Bible as one of sustenance, sexuality, and plenty, stimulated a commitment to birth, even as Pharaoh’s decree was designed to minimize the national growth spurt. The <i>midbar</i>, a place regarded in the Bible as a desolate wasteland, shriveled the Israelites into a fraction of their count in a place of relative freedom. In the Korah rebellion, the earth actually swallowed the mutinous, and in an almost dismissively brief postscript to the Moabite seduction of Numbers 25, the text concludes: “Those who died of the plague numbered 24,000” (Num. 25:9). In a space large enough and expansive enough to hold a nation, the Israelites gradually shrunk in size until not one of the generation who left Egypt – except for Moses (who completed the journey but was denied entry), Joshua, and Caleb – made it out alive. Desolation breeds isolation.",

                "<small>1. <i>Prepare for uncertainty while accepting the insecurity of transitions.</i> Every transition involves loss. Transitions are, by their very nature, unstable and temporary. The best way to make them tolerable and help followers sustain patience is to prepare the people to control what they can, and offer a vision of the future that is as specific as possible. Leaders can help followers understand the perils and insecurity of uncertainty. Instability is normal. The leader must articulate this.<br>2. <i>Anticipate the breakdown of leadership.</i> The leader must prepare to be challenged. This development may take years but, once it surfaces, it can swallow leaders almost immediately. Even leaders who can create a viable picture of the future may find themselves questioned by the very followers who once offered support if the vision takes too long to materialize. When abstract promises do not soon yield real dividends, people begin to protest, and the unrest can devolve into violence. Forty years of waiting and walking represented the outer limit of any personal or collective patience, even though radical social transformations often take a generation or more to come to fruition.<br>3. <i>After transition, leaders need to rebuild and reestablish trust.</i> Trust is fragile, but it can be regained by renegotiating the relationship of leader with follower. Without trust, there is no real future for the leader. The leader must help followers understand the negative costs of impatience and reinforce the vision in the wake of a leadership breakdown. The leader must be able to show followers his or her capacity for both survival and flexibility. In times of transition, the rigid leader is the failed leader. The future is usually built by those executing the vision <i>and</i> those resisting it. </small>",
                "The process of leading in times of uncertainty can involve a change of followers or leaders or both. Many leaders are unwilling or unable to lead differently as leadership needs evolve. The vision overtakes them or followers protest to the point of overturning the leader’s authority. Many followers resist leaders until they make themselves irrelevant. The vision is actualized but with a new set of followers who are more disciplined and future-oriented. Transformation efforts of all kinds require adaptability and the capacity to be nimble while not compromising on the integrity of the end point. It is hard to find this in a leader. It is harder to find this in followers. But when we do, we just might find ourselves on the edge of the Promised Land."

                "The book of Numbers begins with an organized group of travelers who become, by the book’s end, a windswept ragtag collection of complainers, most of whom die. This descent is, in part, attributable to the landscape. It is precisely because the landscape element has been so long neglected that the book of Numbers has been ignored or misunderstood. Rarely does a biblical text demand such a conscious and deliberate focus on the topographical backdrop. In the Hebrew Bible, geography and the conditions of nature can be central to the winning or losing of a battle, as we find with Deborah’s astonishing victory in Judges. The enemy’s plan to overtake the Israelites with chariots toppling down a mountain would have been an impressive show of force – until it rained, and the iron wheels got stuck in the mud. Changing weather conditions are not only a matter of luck. Understanding the context in which one leads is critical to success, or at least to avoiding failure. No one leads in a vacuum of abstract theories and formulas. All leadership is situational. As we will see, the book of Numbers offers up nature as a leadership challenge that must be negotiated well, as if to admonish Moses and the elders: Pay attention to the context of leadership. If you do not, it may swallow you whole.",
                "It is odd to treat the landscape as a central character in and of itself, yet in Numbers, the land is as much a biblical protagonist as is Moses, Korah, or Balaam. The land was actively engaged in this journey, sometimes as friend, more often as foe. The landscape holds the key to understanding the unraveling of all of the good intentions that the Israelites set out with during their journey and it helps explain the breakdown of organization. The wilderness required not only preparation for its encounter, but also extreme vigilance to manage every step. Its intensity demanded extremes of human response: the twinning of careful organization and the abandoning of control. Fighting the reality of submission to the landscape led to the collapse of nationhood in Numbers. This black hole of desert must be treated as a character in the book of Numbers because it propels the story forward and explains the narrative texture of events. It is complex and inviting, confusing and stoic.",

                "The wilderness, from the earliest chapters of Genesis, was also regarded as a place of primitive freedom and refuge. In Genesis 16, Hagar was punished by her mistress, Sarai, and fled into the wilderness. Sarai, emotionally scarred from a surrogacy plan she herself devised, afflicted her Egyptian handmaid Hagar in a frustrated attempt to return her now-pregnant servant to her previous lowly status.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Phyllis Trible’s brilliant analysis of the Sarai/Hagar battle for status in <i>Texts of Terror </i>(Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1984).</i> Hagar ran to the wilderness as a refuge.

The spring in a place that is usually dry and desolate boded well, a sign that Hagar’s future would get better. It was there that she received a blessing parallel to Abraham’s: her offspring were to be too numerous to count. And yet, to receive this future, Hagar would have to return to Abram and Sarai’s household and submit to the difficulties ahead. The promise would be for her children’s freedom. This was a wager she willingly made.",
                "Hagar repeated her wilderness venture in Genesis 21, when she and Ishmael were banished from Abraham’s house. Abraham and his wife acquired new names and a new stature through their own son, Isaac. To protect Isaac’s future as heir, Sarah believed that Ishmael and his mother must be removed from the picture. Hagar was given limited food and resources and got lost, a typical outcome in wilderness travel. Yet the angel of the Lord found her once again and provided the necessary water and salvation that became associated with her wilderness incursions. She had run out of water and out of the emotional strength to battle this new foray into the unknown. About to leave her son to die near a bush, the angel reprimanded her and God told her to open her eyes. A well was there, but in her distress she had not seen it. Where Abraham had struggled for decades to make sense of God’s command to raise a nation of countless number with an infertile wife, Hagar was willing to give up on the same promise for a lack of water. The wilderness was an apt place for creating a nation of free men from a son whose “hand would be against everyone, and everyone’s hand against him” (Gen. 16:12). He would be, as the angel promised, a wild animal of a man, suited to the liberation of the wilderness. For Hagar, the wilderness was the one place of solace and respite. Leadership will arise from this child of the wilderness, she was told. This time, Hagar did not return. Later, in a reversal of this story, when the Israelites were enslaved to the Egyptians, Moses led an oppressed people to the wilderness in a bid for their freedom.

They boarded a small dory in the Kenai Peninsula and set out for Fox Island, one of several small islands in Resurrection Bay. Their host, an elderly Swedish goat-herder, was the only other person to inhabit the island. Kent kept a journal of his seven months in the brutal winter of Alaska, and it was in this wild that the artist – as have so many others – found himself. “It seems,” Kent wrote, “that we have…turned out of the beaten, crowded way and come to stand face to face with that infinite and unfathomable thing which is the wilderness; and here we found <i>ourselves</i> [emphasis in the original] – for the wilderness is nothing else.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rockwell Kent, <i>Wilderness: A Journal of Quiet Adventure in Alaska</i> (Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1996), xi.</i> For Kent, the wilderness was a window to the self, where human beings are forced to see themselves as the mortal beings they are, unable to escape the majesty of a landscape which dwarfs them in its size and power.

He thought that pioneering was “fun” and found that the work he did on his own cabin offered him control over the wilderness: “To be in a country where the fairest spot is yours for the wanting it, to cut and build your own home out of the land you stand upon, to plan and create clearings, parks, vistas and make out of a wilderness an ordered place!”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12 </sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kent, <i>Wilderness</i>, 16.</i>Kent went to Alaska to come to terms with some powerful inner demons for a limited time.

Herein lies the leadership conundrum. Many leaders believe that they can control, change, and shape what others have not been able to conquer. Without this instinct and confidence, they would probably not qualify as leaders. The drive and ambition for success and the belief in the impossible has characterized most heroic leaders for centuries. And yet, entering situations that push back against the best of leadership intentions puts us in Ghosh’s rubber tree orchard. You determine a course forward while everything pushes you backwards. As a leader, you cannot decide if you’ve been a realist or an optimist in taking on a challenge. Cultivating a garden requires constant vigilance just to keep it the way that it is and grow it incrementally: sowing, weeding, pruning. A garden is a limited swath of the landscape. The wilderness presents few visible boundaries. Vigilance and resilience are critical to leadership, but even these traits can fail when the wilderness is deep and convoluted.",

                "<b>The Wilderness of Numbers</b><br>Numbers begins with the organization of the camp, the neat and orderly way that the Israelites prepared for a journey into the unknown, and concludes with the collapse of leadership. Moses pleaded with God in Numbers 11 to take his life lest he have to continue leading a rebellious and contentious people. Miriam and Aaron challenged their brother’s leadership in Numbers 12. The scouts of Numbers 13 undermined God’s vision and generated intense fear in the people. God, in Numbers 14, was prepared to rid Moses of this cantankerous and stiff-necked lot. In Numbers 15, the text narrows in on a man who broke the rules of the Sabbath, spurning God’s holy day. In Numbers 16, Korah and his band of 250 Israelite leaders confronted Moses and Aaron and tried to usurp the leadership. Miriam and Aaron, Moses’ siblings and leadership partners, died in Numbers 20. In Numbers 22, the leader of the Moabites, King Balak, wanted the Jews cursed and immobilized. In Numbers 25, at a time when Israelite men were accused of chasing Moabite women, an Israelite leader had illicit relations with a Midianite woman in public view and was speared by Pinhas, another Israelite leader. By the last chapter in Numbers, the Israelites were depleted by tens of thousands of members who died in plagues and punishments. What went so tragically wrong that a book that begins with enthusiasm for a journey descended into the chaos that emerges by its end?",
                "At no point in the Hebrew Bible was leadership more critical. Leadership was a matter of keeping the organization of the camp intact despite nature “fighting back,” while at the same time keeping the human, existential anxieties of being neither here nor there under control. It was not a balance that came naturally to Moses. He floundered and his temper flared. Since the wilderness is indifferent to humans, it could have taught Moses not to personalize the challenges. It was not Moses who failed; anyone in his place would have found similar unruly territory. Indifference can be a result of callousness or it can be an aspect of resilience. Moses showed his vulnerability at times and his resourcefulness at others. He was a leader who needed other leaders to shore up the faith of the camp when belief dwindled. But Moses did not have the requisite leaders for such an enormous task. Try as he did, he, too, became engulfed and ensnared in the wilderness’s many torments. He survived the book of Numbers. His sister, brother, and most of the generation did not. They remained eternally in the wilderness, part of the human and physical landscape that they could not sufficiently conquer. Moses’ small victories and immense drive kept the flagging energy going until the journey’s end. But the Israelites as a nation would never be the same again, and Moses’ own failure to cross the Jordan was a direct result of his troubled leadership in Numbers.",

As the journey stretched, so did the collective patience of the children of Israel. The sense of being forlorn and exhausted without respite permeates the biblical text.",
                "The wilderness narratives easily transform from a geographic challenge to an apt and compelling metaphor for leadership. Leaders usually position themselves for change from a point of optimism and with highly manicured organizational skills. Those who lead begin with a desired outcome. They create strategic plans as methods to achieve outcomes and pursue goals, neatly defined objectives and metrics to evaluate – only to find that leading quickly becomes unpredictable, unmanageable, and often unbearable. The conditions can be perilous. Problems can feel intractable. The rewards are hard to identify. Criticism abounds. Outcomes are not anticipated. Unexpected surprises become the norm, and change is resisted with brute force, aggression, and even violence at times. Leaders like to exhibit and take control, but not every climate and landscape can be tempered by human control. Some environments seem impenetrable to any human intervention.",

                "The role of preparation and organization in facing uncertainty cannot be underestimated. We all want formulas for tackling the unknown. We believe that the only way to face uncharted territory is with a map and a compass. And we believe that the owner of the map and compass is the leader. It is not only that we trust in the leader to take us through uncertainty unscathed. The leader also gives us someone to blame in place of ourselves in the event of failure. And failure in situations of high risk is always an acute probability. Former CEO of General Electric and leadership expert Jack Welch claims that “an organization’s ability to learn, and translate that learning into action rapidly, is the ultimate competitive advantage.” It was a competitive advantage the ancient Israelites would not have because they refused to turn difficult situations into learned wisdom.",
                "In Exodus 15, the Israelites looked behind them and saw the Egyptian army drowned on the shores of the Reed Sea. They broke out in exuberant song, finally confident in their faith in God and in Moses. But only three days beyond the splitting of the sea, they began to complain about the water. They needed Moses to solve their most urgent and inescapable problems immediately. They framed their woes in tragic terms. Had they realized the conditions, they would never have left Egypt. The wilderness could have been a difficult obstacle course to achieve independence. Instead it was Moses’ expansive courtroom, where he was judged and found guilty again and again.",
                "To understand what went wrong and learn from it, we need a comprehensive understanding of the structure of Numbers and the radical shift that takes place approximately midpoint in the book. The geographic context of the narratives also offers a critical key to unlocking the deeper mysteries of these wilderness texts. When these two elements are juxtaposed, what emerges is a leadership chasm both profound and disturbing.",
                "Along with Numbers and <i>Bemidbar</i>, this book was also known to Jerome (a Roman Christian priest of the fourth century and author of the Latin translation of the Bible known as the Vulgate) as “<i>Vaydaber</i>,” the first word of the book, which translates as “and he spoke.” Using the first word as the title is common in Bible referencing but, interestingly, this title did not have staying power with Bible readers. The first event of the book and the topography clearly had more resonance over time, perhaps because speech, Moses’ lengthy farewell, is a stronger framework for Deuteronomy than for Numbers. The organization and travels of the camp are more characteristic of its content and also contribute to its breakdown into larger segments. In that spirit, most Bible scholars divide the book into three sections:",

This section also includes laws of oaths and a listing of the encampments to date.",
                "This relatively loose rubric, when taken at face value, offers a simple thematic segmentation but does little to explain the intense transition in chapter 11 for which we as readers are completely unprepared. The organization of the camp begins in the first chapter, with a census to determine its fighting force; the text then offers us the placement of tribal units around the Tabernacle, the use of flags to demarcate tribes, and the division of Levite labor in relation to Tabernacle service and transportation. The organization of the camp also includes the rules for those who, for one reason or another, must live outside the camp either permanently or temporarily or break the conventions of encampment life: the leper, the adulterous woman, and the nazarite (who did not live outside the camp physically but spiritually, in a manner of speaking). Chapter 6 concludes with the priestly blessing and by the end of its verses, readers sense that the Israelites were fully prepared, both physically and spiritually, to launch an adventure of magnitude with the proper logistics in place, and set into motion through the blessing of its religious leaders.",
                "Part of the establishment of the camp was determining who was in the camp and who fell outside the camp. Thus, Numbers 5 begins two chapters of instruction of how to determine who is to be counted. “The Lord spoke to Moses, saying, ‘Instruct the Israelites to remove from the camp anyone with an eruption or discharge and anyone defiled by a corpse. Remove male and female alike; put them outside the camp so that they do not defile the camp of those in whose midst I dwell,” (Num. 5:1–3). This initial barrier to membership, ritual impurity, is explained by the fact that God’s presence dwelled in the camp. If God’s presence rested within the camp, then impurity as defined by biblical law could not be tolerated in the same place.",
                "It is not purity alone that determined who resided outside the camp on a temporary basis. There were a host of other factors that pushed someone outside of the camp’s parameters. Wrongdoing was central to the equation. “The Lord spoke to Moses, saying, ‘Speak to the Israelites, When a man or woman commits any wrong towards a fellow man, thus breaking faith with the Lord, that person realizes his guilt, he shall confess the wrong that he has done. He shall make restitution’” (Num. 4:5). Living within the close confines of a camp was a social challenge made more difficult in the absence of civility and the respect of the property of others. Stealing or harming another put one metaphorically outside of the camp. Stealing descended into adultery only a few verses later. God asked Moses to speak to the Israelites and warn them of the perils of infidelity: “If a man’s wife has gone astray and broken faith with him…the man shall bring his wife to the priest” (Num. 4:11). The particulars of this case are laid out in the open. A married woman had relations with a man other than her husband consensually, but without a witness to see her. Her husband, paralyzed by jealousy and anger, had to determine her status and her loyalty. He relied upon the high priest to help him and brought her to the priest for “ritual testing.” The case in question is less relevant to our study than are its underlying assumptions. An individual who cannot remain faithful within her own home may endanger the social fabric of the camp, as the text concludes: “the woman shall become a curse among her people” (Num. 4:27). Certain behaviors undermine the morality of the camp.",
                "As we move to Numbers 6, we find another variation of the outsider status. Like the infidelities of the woman whose behavior placed her outside of the camp, the next category is the nazarite who willingly and voluntarily made a decision to be an ascetic. While such behavior did not remove him from the physical encampment, it did move him away from the norms of the camp and separated him by choice. His distinctiveness was most apparent through the visible manifestation of his oath. Nazarites had to grow their hair and not cut it for the duration of their abstinence vow. When a person takes a vow of Jewish asceticism without specifying a time frame, the Talmud understands that the vow lasts for a month. In a month, hair cannot grow too long and would not change the appearance of a person, but over an extended period of time, the growth of hair, as will be discussed in a later chapter, made a noticeable change in the appearance of the nazarite.",
                "The idea that this vow is considered a separation from the standards of the community set in chapters 1–5 is apparent from the very beginning of chapter 6: “If anyone, man or woman, explicitly utters a nazarite’s vow, <i>to set himself apart</i> for the Lord, he shall abstain from wine and any other intoxicant” (Num. 6:2–3). The notion that a nazarite sets himself apart is central to the decision of the nazarite. While the vow not to drink wine or any of its by-products can be a private decision without any visible manifestations, the biblical text demands that a “no razor shall touch his head” (Num. 6:5) of anyone who makes such a choice. The concluding words of chapter 6 mention the blessing that Aaron and his sons offer the Israelites. The last verse that follows this priestly blessing, uttered today in traditional synagogue services, mentions the reason for the blessing: “Thus they [the Israelites] shall link My name with the people of Israel and I will bless them” (Num. 6:27). This completes the chapters of preparation. The next chapters focus on transportation, the camp in motion.",
                "Beyond discussing who was included in the encampment, the text also sets forth guidelines regarding the structure of the encampment itself. Each tribe had to have a flag or banner to demarcate itself: “The Israelites shall camp each with his sign, under the flags of their ancestral house; they shall camp around the Tent of Meeting at a distance” (Num. 2:2). One medieval commentator proposes that the demarcations on each flag – or literally “letters,” as the Hebrew translates – are the letters of the names of the ancestral tribes that should appear on each flag. Rashi, citing a midrash, suggests that each tribe had to pick a colored cloth: “Each flag should have a different sign, namely a piece of colored cloth, each distinct from the other. The color for each tribe should match the color of its stone that is fixed on the breastplate.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This translation of Rashi is taken from Rev. M. Rosenbaum and A.M. Silberman, <i>Pentateuch with Targum Onkelos, Haphtaroth, and Rashi’s Commentary: Numbers </i>(Jerusalem: Routledge and Kegan Paul Ltd., 1933).</i> We read that the twelve stones on the high priest’s breastplate represented the twelve tribes; the color of each became associated with its respective tribe. “The stones shall correspond to the names of the sons of Israel: twelve, corresponding to their names. They shall be engraved like seals, each with its name, for the twelve tribes” (Ex. 28:21). The name of the tribe appeared on a gemstone in the plate; thus this garment signified the heavy weight that the leader carries for his constituents. Each tribe had a flag whose color resembled that of a gemstone on the plate. This explains the colors but not the signs of each tribe.",
                "Rashi writes that the word “signs” refers to the physical placement of each tribe and corresponds to the location of each son when carrying Jacob after the patriarch died. If, for example, Judah stood on the east side of the bier, then the tribe of Judah should be placed on the east side of the encampment. In other words, both in color and placement, the tribes should look for precedents from earlier biblical sources. Abraham Ibn Ezra, the Spanish poet and commentator who often disagreed with Rashi, disagrees with him once more here. He writes that each flag was distinguished by a sign from the blessings that Jacob gave his sons on his deathbed, a text we read at the end of Genesis. Judah, in Jacob’s blessing, is called a lion: “He crouches down like a lion, like the king of beasts who dare rouse him” (Gen. 49:9). The sign of the lion then became associated with Judah and appeared not only on this ancient tribal flag, but also on synagogue stained glass windows for centuries.",
                "In the beginning of Numbers, these basic elements – numbers, colors, and symbols – contribute to the creation of national identity. When we connect these signs to the breastplate or to the patriarch Jacob, we are, in essence, forging a memory of the past in these antecedents. Often national symbols and signs reflect a haphazard and unconscious development over time. But there are opportunities, found in the freshness and enthusiasm of new projects, to create deliberate emblems of a new entity, be it political or religious. Numbers tells us that something as important as national consciousness cannot be created by chance. Alexander Solzhenitsyn said upon the acceptance of his Nobel Prize, “Nations are the wealth of mankind, its collective personalities; the very least of them wears its own special colors and bears within itself a special facet of divine intention.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">From his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, which can be read online at http://www.davar.net/EXTRACTS/MISCL/SOLZNOBL.HTM.</i> In the wilderness, these special signs of distinction, paving the way to nationhood, would also become markers of order in the face of natural chaos. The preparations described in these first chapters are achieved largely through the taxonomy of separation: numbers, tribes, flags, deviant behaviors, and spiritual self-selection. All of these aspects were established in the setting up of the Israelite encampment. Physical readiness was paired with spiritual readiness. Physical deviation from the camp was paired with spiritual deviation from the camp. In or out, the camp’s parameters were set. Order was demanded.",
                "The breakdown of that order looms large at the end of Numbers. Midpoint in the book’s narration, we find a brief encounter that foreshadows the crumbling. The camp has to move forward. In that movement, the fissures of the camp become evident. But first, we must describe the complex way that Moses was ordered to move the people and the Tabernacle forward.",
                "<b>The Call to Movement</b><br>Another critical aspect of organization lay in the coordinated movement of the encampment. The first six chapters of Numbers established the parameters of the desert community at rest. A larger organizational challenge lay in maintaining the integrity of the camp in motion. Numbers 9 offers us a glimpse at the art of Israelite travel, at both the way the actual encampment was established and how it moved.",
                "<small>On the day that the Tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the Tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, and in the evening it rested over the Tabernacle in the likeness of fire until morning. It was always so; the cloud covered it, appearing as fire by night. And whenever the cloud lifted from the Tent, the Israelites would set out accordingly; and at the spot where the cloud settled, there the Israelites would make camp. At a command of the Lord, the Israelites broke camp, and at a command of the Lord they made camp; they remained encamped as long as the cloud stayed over the Tabernacle. When the cloud lingered over the Tabernacle many days, the Israelites observed the Lord’s mandate and did not journey on. At such time as the cloud rested over the Tabernacle for but a few days, they remained encamped at a command of the Lord and broke camp at a command of the Lord. And at such time as the cloud stayed from evening to morning, they broke camp as soon as the cloud lifted in the morning. Day or night, whenever the cloud lifted, they would break camp. Whether it was two days or a year – however long the cloud lingered over the Tabernacle – the Israelites remained encamped and did not set out. On a sign from the Lord they made camp and on a sign from the Lord they broke camp; they observed the Lord’s mandate at the Lord’s bidding through Moses. (Num. 9:15–23)</small>",
                "The passage is lengthy, almost repetitively so. In nine verses, the word “Lord” appears eight times. The “cloud” is referenced eleven times. The “camp” (including the verb “encamp”) appears eleven times. The repetition of words mirrors the repetition of ideas. It is abundantly clear from the passage that the cloud rested above the Tabernacle in the Israelite camp and that when the cloud moved, it was a divine sign for the camp to move, day or night, after a lengthy or brief stay. When biblical commands or acts are repeated, the repetition often indicates an emphatic desire to contradict what should typically be understood or expected in any given situation. The Israelites were unsure of how to go from one destination to another. They may have repeatedly doubted Moses’ sense of direction. They may have regarded a cloud as too ephemeral a sign by which to chart the direction of tens of thousands of people. No doubt, the Israelites knew that the distance between Egypt and Canaan was not years, but a journey of days or weeks; an inherent mistrust of the camp’s leadership emerged as a result of the wilderness circumlocutions. The text, at such times, must break and state that this was all part of a divine, master plan. Part of establishing a routine in the wilderness was holding fast to a travel pattern that stayed the same, for a few days or a few months. God was a constant travel companion, visible in the heat of fire and the protective cloud. The Divine Presence was manifest in every movement.",
                "The choice of the cloud as a sign and a compass is an interesting one. It is opaque, diaphanous, mysterious, and lofty. These qualities would well associate the cloud with God. But the cloud is also a substance without substance, like an unfulfilled wish or an impossible goal, an unattainable dream. It cannot be touched. It can only be seen, and even then it passes. The cloud is a see-through cushioned paneling that enclosed the Israelites as it gently contoured and softened the wilderness’s unyielding harshness. Normally, it can only offer limited protection. The cloud is part of nature and the desert landscape, but here it transcends the landscape and becomes the sign of God’s presence, giving the Israelites the confidence to act independently and protect themselves, while maintaining an aura of mystery.",
                "There is also an inflexibility about the description in this passage, highlighting the rigidity of the desert dynamic, partly through repetition of that which we already know and partly through use of direct terms. We are told that this pattern was never-changing; “it was always so,” as if no deviation from this pattern or rule was tolerated. Again and again the text lets us know that this is the Lord’s mandate and that it was observed. This fixed set of protocols receives attention as early as Numbers 1 where we learn the steep price to be paid for any variation.",
                "<small>When the Tabernacle is to set out, the Levites shall take it down, and when the Tabernacle is to be pitched the Levites shall set it up; any outsider who approaches it shall be put to death. The Israelites shall encamp troop by troop, each man with his division and each under his standard. The Levites, however, shall camp around the Tabernacle of the Pact; that wrath may not strike the Israelite community; the Levites shall stand guard around the Tabernacle of the Pact. The Israelites did accordingly; just as the Lord commanded Moses, so they did. (Num. 1:51–54)</small>",
                "In a climate of uncertainty, there must be hard and fast laws that are clear, repeated, and understood by every member of the camp. Without them, anarcy would reign and the camp would be directionless. Chapter 9 offers a stark and rigid processional. Leaders, to manage change and surprise, must have certain steadfast guidelines that are immutable. Yet because the wilderness is a place of unpredictability and contingency, it is hard to imagine that the rules were always observed. And they were not. Although chapter 9 presents the ideal framework of movement, the narrative that unfolds in later chapters shows that Israelite travel was hardly linear and rule-oriented.",
                "Rather than the tedium of typical lists, Numbers offers a travelogue of a journey punctured by problems, pushing the reader into the trek’s complexities and challenges so that he or she experiences the hunger, monotony, and anxious feelings of rebellion with its original participants. Bible scholar George W. Coats tackles one of the most evident literary difficulties in Numbers: the itinerary that is offered is often non-linear, contradictory, or just plain geographically impossible.

Itinerary notices were a common form of chronicles in days past to mark hunts, travels, military victories, and the general advancement of a group. Itineraries are a way that texts communicate progression. Yet, this generality does not hold true for the itineraries of Numbers, which, more than anything, tell of hardships and lapses, failures and losses. B.E.

Where did our ancestors go wrong? One small incident indicates that the reigning order of the encampment against the chaos of the <i>midbar</i> would not last long. There was a wink of doubt. In chapter ten, the camp’s marching orders were delineated with the soldiers grouped in flanks. The passages close with a statement of that order: “Such was the order of the march of the Israelites as they marched troop by troop” (Num. 10:28). A brief narrative interruption of four verses clouds what has otherwise been a conversation-free ten chapters.",
                "<small>Moses said to Hobab, son of Reul the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are setting out for the place of which the Lord has said, ‘I will give it to you.’ Come with us and we will be generous with you, for the Lord has promised to be generous to Israel.” “I will not go,” he replied to him, “but will return to my native land.” He said, “Please do not leave us, inasmuch as you know where we should camp in the wilderness and can be our guide. So, if you come with us, we will extend to you the same bounty that the Lord grants us.” (Num. 10:29–32)</small>",
                "Hobab is a word that indicates friendship. It may well have been an honorific or a title that signified closeness, indicating the nature of the relationship that Moses enjoyed with his brother-in-law. The fact that Moses invited Hobab to join him is no surprise given the relationship that Moses had with his father-in-law, whose counsel he had relied upon in setting up the governance structure of the camp. It is only when Hobab indicated that he was not part of Moses’ people but must return to his own that we get a glimpse of an ancient leader’s panic: “Please do not leave us, inasmuch as you know where we should camp in the wilderness and can be our guide.” For all of Moses’ prodigious leadership talents, navigating uncertain territory was not on the list. This was not a polite request for companionship, but a desperate plea for guidance. The translation of “guide” for the word “<i>enayim</i>” in 10:31 is misleading. Moses was looking for another set of eyes (<i>enayim</i>), eyes that could see what he could not in a place he could not navigate. In the event that Hobab’s refusal was based on the insecurity of being a non-Israelite, Moses assured him that he would benefit from any bounty or privilege that the Israelites received. But this was not enough to change Hobab’s mind. He disappeared from the text, and Moses’ request for leadership in this vast, alien terrain remained unanswered. When Hobab left, Moses lost more than a trusted friend. His compass left.",

Alternatively, others translate this verse to mean that the Ark is returned to Israel’s myriad of thousands who, no doubt, are not as whole in its absence.",
                "With the dramatic flourish of the Ark’s movement, the chance encounter with Hobab is passed over. Chapter 11 begins immediately thereafter and reports the most painful complaints of the Israelites to date. By the middle of the chapter, there is a breakdown of the whole camp: “Moses heard the people weeping, every clan apart, each person at the entrance of his tent” (Num. 11:10). Moses himself asked that his life be taken rather than lead this people. By the chapter’s end, God sent a severe plague and thousands of Israelites who complained about the lack of meat in the wilderness died with quail meat between their teeth. The camp fell apart.",
                "Moses’ conversation with Hobab is the first indication of real leadership insecurity, of a fissure in the mission. God moved through the camp as a cloud of glory by day and a pillar of fire by night, but the Israelites were seeking a human source of guidance. They were in great need of advice. Moses asked twice in four verses for Hobab to stay and reap the benefits of the Promised Land with them. In ten chapters of organizational direction, only four lines indicate that the choreographed structure was not enough to battle the wilderness. The chaos of the <i>midbar</i> would soon reign.",
                "<b>Reflections</b><br>Without the constraints of slavery, in a place that even powerful kings negotiated only with difficulty, the Israelites finally broke the shackles of servitude. In the wilderness, they also found primal love and dependence on God. Without the boundedness of oppression, in the chaste, monochromatic landscape of the desert, the ancient Israelites discovered God for themselves. Much later, the prophet Jeremiah, in trying to revivify Israelite love for God, reminded the people of their early days of utter dependence in the wilderness: “Thus said the Lord, ‘I remember the devotion of your youth, your love as a bride, when you followed Me into the <i>wilderness </i>in a land not sown’” (Jer. 2:2). In Eliot’s empty wasteland, the Israelites experienced the rewards of chastity and fidelity to God. There was nothing else. In a place stripped bare of luxury, human beings found their essential selves. What matters most can only be truly discovered where there are few distractions.",
                "But this idealized portrait could only be sustained if the Israelites maintained trust in their leader through the material hardships of the wilderness. They could not. When Moses asked for Hobab’s help, he also revealed the chink in his own leadership armor. He did not know where to go. He saw the long-term vision, but could not navigate the short-term challenges. He asked for another set of eyes. They were denied him.",

                "Along this line of interpretation, some scholars believe that the nazarite showed affinities with the biblical notion of a warrior. The “spirit of the Lord” (Judges 14:19) that traveled through Samson, a nazarite and a warrior, emboldened him, and he was aware that he was not like others as a result of it. “War in early Israel was a holy enterprise, and while on active duty the warrior was in a state of sanctity marked by a special pattern of conduct (Deut. 23:9–14, I Sam. 21:4–6, II Sam. 11:11–12).” <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See J.C. Rylaarsdam under “Nazarite” in <i>The Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible</i> (New York: Abingdon Press, 1962), 526.</i> This conduct set him apart for special tasks, treatment, and regard from the rest of the community. Amos linked the prophet, priest, and nazarite as leaders who occupied a special place within society: “‘And I brought you up from the land of Egypt and led you through the wilderness forty years, to possess the land of the Amorite. And I raised up prophets from among your sons, and nazarites from among your young men. Is that not so, O people of Israel?’ says the Lord. ‘But you made the nazarites drink wine and ordered the prophets not to prophecy’” (Amos 2:11–12). God stated, through the agency of the prophet, that He gave the Israelites leaders from among their own, but that they abandoned that leadership by going against the strictures that made their leadership both meaningful and functional. Amos declared these individuals to have a special vocation, but one whose “role has been frustrated.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibid<i>.</i></i> It is not coincidental that Amos mentioned wilderness and the nazarite in the same breath.

                "The priest and the nazarite also shared the prohibition to drink, even though the priest’s transgression was only service-related. The nazarite, like the priest, was not allowed contact with the dead, even those in his own immediate family. The nazarite in Numbers 6:11, like the priest in Leviticus 21:6, was considered consecrated to God: “He shall be holy.” Both the priest and the nazarite sacrificed sin offerings. The nazarite’s vow was marked by growing his hair. Similarly, the act of anointing a priest drew attention to the priest’s head: “Take the anointing oil and pour it on his head and anoint him” (Num. 29:7). The head of the priest, while also a place of spiritual focus and clarity, was not a place of attention for the Jewish public.

                "The priest and the nazarite had different hairstyles because they had different lifestyles. The priest took on an inherited responsibility to serve in a spiritual capacity for the people as a life obligation. His spirituality was directed outward and bound to public service. His robes and accessories distinguished him so that those in the Temple precincts knew to whom to offer their sacrifices and from whom to receive blessings. His uniform indicated to others that he was available as a spiritual mentor or intermediary. The nazarite’s visibility, however, was to highlight a temporary commitment that was deeply personal. The hair served a purpose somewhat opposite the priest’s. It set the nazarite apart and told others to keep their distance, not to tempt the nazarite away from the course of behavior he selected to repair himself. In the words of Bible scholar Nehama Leibowitz: “Previous inability to control and discipline his desires, within the bounds imposed by the Torah, had made it necessary for the person concerned to restrict himself even further and vow himself to abstinence. The nazarite vow was thus a necessary but extreme medicine for spiritual ills.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nehama Leibowitz, <i>Studies in Bamidbar</i>, trans.

                "<b>The Nazarite Locks</b><br>A number of medieval and modern Bible interpreters point to the Hebrew root word N-Z-R as a crown, the word used in Numbers 6 to signify the title. Abraham Ibn Ezra explains in his commentary that whoever is free from desire is likened to a king who has a crown and royal diadem on his head.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Abraham Ibn Ezra, <i>Sefer HaYashar</i>, Numbers 6:7. See also Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch: “Just as ‘<i>nezer</i>’ means the royal diadem which marks the person whose head it surrounds as being set apart and inaccessible, so here ‘<i>nezer</i>’ designates a regime of living and striving that raises the person who vows of his own free will to undertake it”; Samson Raphael Hirsch, <i>The Pentateuch with Translation and Commentary</i>, trans. Isaac Levy (Gateshead, England: Judaica Press, 1976), 80 (Numbers 6:3).</i> In other words, the nazarite crowns himself, distinguishes himself, through the look of his head. Subsequently, the nazarite’s mind must be protected from influences that would obstruct clarity of thought and contemplation. Thus, not only is he not allowed contact with impurity, he must not even cut his hair. Others around him must see his head as the most prominent demonstration of his religious commitment. It is left alone, untainted and untouched, as a symbol of the mind his hair covers. As the biblical text expresses it: “hair set apart for his God is upon his head” (Num. 6:5). The fascinating use of the expression “his God” shows how personal and private this state is. By allowing his hair to grow, others around him will recognize that he has dedicated his mental life to God, if only for a limited time. The nazarite’s hair is like the nun’s habit and the Buddhist monk’s saffron robes. It is a visible sign of the spiritual force field that surrounds the ascetic and tells others in the community that he is different. They too must not compromise his vows.",
                "“Want a drink?” an ancient Israelite says at a party. Then, out of the corner of his eye, he notices the flowing tresses of the man standing next to him. “I take back my offer, sir. You’re a nazarite!” The nazarite’s hair was a self-defining limitation. In growing his hair, he was ostensibly asking others to help him keep his personal demons at bay without having to verbalize the tensions fighting within him. He did not need to speak or to embarrass himself. He let his hair tell his story. According to one exegete, Rabbi Solomon Astruc, the sin offering the nazarite brought was not over choosing asceticism in a religious climate of moderation, but because his vow was in response to a specific sin: “For that which he sinned: for the fact that his passions got the better of him, until he was driven to abstain from wine to subdue his material desires and bodily wants and to deny himself the legitimate enjoyment of wine that makes glad both God and man.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As seen in Leibowitz, <i>Studies in Bamidbar</i>, 57.</i> Wine is at the center of religious events and is deemed in Psalms to be the source of great human joy. Under ordinary circumstances, a person is allowed and often obligated to drink alcohol in Jewish law. But the nazarite disallows himself in response to personal sin that may have led him to lose control. The nazarite vow is controlling because the transgressor in question asks to be controlled and may be angry with himself for losing control. The vow itself is like a confession; it tells others that there is a problem that can only be excised in an extreme way.",
                "That hair should play a role in the nazarite’s oath is, however, contextually puzzling. In Numbers 5:18, the chapter that precedes the nazarite laws, a woman accused of infidelity, a <i>sota</i>, was brought to the high priest, and he was to “bare her head.” Commentators there understand this act of dishevelment as one that would make her look guilty of the sin for which she was being accused. Long, unbraided tresses were the mark of the adulteress. Her flowing hair made her seductive and enticing. In fact, the rabbinic ligament between the <i>sota</i> and the nazarite – which follow each other in the biblical text – is that if a person saw a woman in such a state, he would immediately take an oath of abstention to keep away from any intoxication that could lead to such immoral consequences.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sota 2a.</i> Abraham Ibn Ezra, who not incidentally wrote sacred poetry in the days of heady Spanish wine and garden parties, observed that “most transgressions are rooted in wine.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibn Ezra, <i>Sefer HaYashar</i>, Numbers 6:2.</i> He continues in his comments to note that, in his reading, a woman who did not fix her hair appropriately would not be wanted by her husband. Her loose hair would have been a sign to him that she was a woman of loose morals. Why then demand that the nazarite grow his own hair? How can the hair be both a sign of adultery and a sign of abstention as it is for these two texts living in the same neighborhood?",
                "There seems to be a subtle intimation in the proximity of the biblical texts that these two are to be compared and not merely contrasted. If we understand that the nazarite’s primary reason for taking an oath and offering a sacrifice is to meditate on his sins and to rectify them by pulling to another extreme, then the act of growing the hair may actually be regarded as an extension of the look of sin. This is ultimately rectified by the sacrifice where the nazarite burns his hair on the altar. In other words, to answer our question we must look not only at the hair growth but at the <i>haircut</i> as integral to the nazarite ritual. In the biblical text in Numbers, nine out of the twenty-one verses discussing the nazarite ritual are devoted to the sacrifice that <i>ends</i> the vow. The nazarite grows out his hair, creating an imaginary extension to a state of sin; in burning his hair, he returns to his earlier state of innocence before his transgression. The offering is integral to the nazarite procedure and is not only a symbolic mark of its cessation.",
                "<b>The Nazarite’s Sacrifice</b><br>The sacrifices that the nazarite brought to end his vow led to conflicting views in rabbinic literature as to how one regards the ascetic. Maimonides, an advocate of the Aristotelian golden mean, believes that the nazarite included a sin offering because, in order to achieve spiritual heights, he needed to act outside the norms of Jewish law, which advocates moderation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Maimonides, <i>Mishneh Torah</i>,<i> Hilkhot De’ot</i> 3:1.</i> Nahmanides, the medieval Spanish Bible commentator, radically departs from this view, suggesting that the nazarite brought a sacrifice not for leaving the path of moderation, but for knowing his own spiritual proclivity towards asceticism and, despite this, ending his vow. He should have remained in this state, created and proscribed by Jewish law for individuals of his religious constitution.",
                "The most curious aspect of the sacrifice is not how one explains its purpose, but how one explains its details. The traditional sacrificial elements are present: two lambs and a ram, unleavened cakes of choice flour, and unleavened wafers in oil, all of which are presented to the priest. However, in an often-neglected detail, the nazarite then himself contributes to the presentation of the offering: “The nazarite shall then shave his consecrated hair at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and take the locks of his consecrated hair and put them on the fire that is under the sacrifice of well-being” (Num. 6:18). An integral part of transitioning the nazarite back to ordinary life was not only the cutting of his hair, but also the offering of his hair on the altar as part of the sacrifice itself. He had to watch his own hair, the most prominent aspect of his ascetic commitment, go up in heavenly smoke, creating the mental readiness to rejoin the world of distraction and mental static. Watching his hair burn created total recognition that his break from the often-banal world of human engagement was over. Similarly, God commanded Ezekiel to take a razor and cut the hair on his head and beard and then divide the hair into sections to mimic the takeover of Jerusalem which was to be segmented after a conquest: “Take also a few [hairs] from there and tie them up in your skirts. And take some more of them and cast them into the fire. From this a fire shall go out upon the whole House of Israel” (Ezek. 5:1–4). Like the nazarite, the prophet must burn his own hair to place himself in the drama of a moment. He set fire to part of himself. Burning hair creates an unpleasant stench. In the talmudic Tractate Shabbat, in a discussion of material that can serve as wicks for Shabbat lights, the use of hair is prohibited because it does not burn; it scorches.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shabbat 21a.</i> Thus, in sight and smell, the hair offering must have given the nazarite pause.",
                "It seems, and this is corroborated by the <i>Targumim</i> – ancient translations of the Hebrew Bible into Aramaic – that there was an oven or blaze under the sacrificial altar that held a separate fire. This explains the expression at the end of the verse, the fire that is under the sacrifice. The nazarite placed his hair in these flames. Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch has a beautiful observation on this moment:",
                "<small>His life as a nazarite was only to have been a preparatory provisional training. If letting the hair grow was a sign of a sanctifying separation and withdrawal into oneself, the complete shaving is the expression of thenceforth ceasing this separation and thenceforth completely entering again the whole social life of the community. This completely [sic] entering into the whole social life of the community is not merely something permissible, it is a mitzva, duty. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hirsch, <i>The Pentateuch with Translation and Commentary</i>, 95 (Numbers 6:18).</i></small>",
                "The sacrifice that was offered at this time was the <i>shelamim</i>, which means whole or perfect. By giving his hair and thus symbolically returning his head to the community, he was becoming more perfect or whole. His removal from the community of normative practice when he took the vow was reversed when he burned his hair and reentered the very same faith community he had left. Thus, Rabbi Hirsch contends that the nazarite state is not the ultimate one, but a preparatory one for those who find themselves unable to live within communal precincts. They follow their inclination in an exaggerated form until they rid themselves of their need for religious isolation. The personal burning of the hair is not a sad act of departure from the life of the spirit, but an act of wholeness as one reenters humanity with all its complexities.",
                "In “The Rape of the Lock,” eighteenth-century poet Alexander Pope highlighted the drama of fallen hair:",
                "<small>Fate urged the shear, and cut the sylph in twain<br>(But airy substance soon unites again)<br>The meeting points the sacred hair dissever<br>From the fair head, forever and forever! </small>",
                "Pope magnifies the sense that the cutting of hair signifies a change in identity. People seeking an identity change or who have one forced upon them often begin with a change of hair length or style. The military creates uniformity among its servicepeople by insisting on short hair. Fashion models and actors or actresses change the look and color of their hair as they metamorphose into other characters. Victims of illness resulting in hair loss often share the fact that this, sometimes more than any other aspect of their sickness, causes them to feel different and almost dislocated from a former, healthy self. What Pope cleverly does in these lines is to bracket reality. While people may perceive that they have undergone a complete change of identity with a change of hair length or style, in actuality, their hair will once again grow back. At that moment of great self-consciousness, it seems that one’s hair will never grow back. It always does.",
                "This fact gives the impression that external identities and the internal dynamics they conceal and reveal are as malleable as one’s hair. This, indeed, is the case for the nazarite. Watching his burning hair may have given the nazarite the impression that his sanctity was lost forever on altar fires. It was not. Just as hair grows and changes, so too, do our spiritual proclivities and actions. This particular crop of hair may have signified one’s retreat from the world, and burning it one’s reentrance, but with it another chapter of religious life opened. The nazarite humbled himself by watching the vainglory of his exploits – just as much a part of his identity as his hair – go up in smoke. The paralysis of such a moment was a jarring statement of the futility of most vows. We are, in the end, the same people. Changed internally, perhaps, we remain the same outside to others.",

Samson did not benefit from the typical genealogical introduction awarded most biblical characters. We are told that Samson’s mother was infertile, but unlike the heroines of other infertility stories in the Bible, she did not protest this state. She was awed by the presence of an angel who informed her that she would have a son who would one day “begin to save the Israelites from the Philistines” (Judges 13:5). She had to take a number of precautions regarding her own food and behavior during the pregnancy and make sure that a razor would not touch the child’s head upon his arrival.",

His father, Manoah, questioned the angelic identity of the “man” who appeared to his wife with the miraculous annunciation of his birth; doubting the presence of an angel demonstrated Manoah’s own spiritual limitations. There was a struggle between human drives and religious leadership, alien forces versus homegrown habits. Samson did destroy the enemy as predicted, but only by living and operating within enemy territory. Samson loved foreign women; he lived among them and was even handed over by his own people to the Philistines, who regarded him as a security threat. Samson cried out in his darkest moment, “Let me die with the Philistines” (Judges 16:30), as the pillars that he was tied to were pushed apart and the temple housing numerous Philistine leaders toppled upon them.",
                "Samson was riddled by contradictions and was, himself, a riddler. He told riddles at his wedding party and played word games that held all in suspense. He understood that the secret of his strength lay in his locks. It was his private riddle. But when Delilah teased it out of him, he admitted as much:",
                "<small>Finally, after she nagged him and pressed him constantly, he was wearied to death and he confided everything to her. He said to her, “No razor has ever touched my head, for I have been a nazarite to God ever since I was in my mother’s womb. If my hair were cut, my strength would leave me, and I should become as weak as an ordinary man.” (Judges 16:16–17)</small>",
                "Delilah wasted no time:",
                "<small>She lulled him to sleep on her lap. Then she called in a man and she had him cut off the seven locks of his head; thus she weakened him and made him helpless; his strength slipped away from him. (Judges 16:19) </small>",
                "The problem with the Samson story is that his hair was the one part of him that was hardly a secret. A nazarite for life would have had extremely long hair; it would have been his most distinctive feature. The biblical narrative teases the reader much the way that Delilah teased Samson. It was not hard to figure out his secret. The ominous impact of nagging in the text is that through it, “he was wearied to death.” This foreshadow of his real death by the end of the chapter shows us the thoughtlessness of his enemies: they could not figure out on their own the most obvious “secret” about Samson. His visual distinctiveness also provides a sociological comment on the nazarite status. Looks are deceiving. There are those who take vows and look the part but may themselves be riddled with contradictions and temptations. Perhaps it is these very temptations that push an ordinary individual into assuming extraordinary status.",
                "The relationship of Samson’s narrative to chapter 6 of Numbers is one that pits the proscriptive and descriptive parts of Jewish law next to one another. This textual diptych – hardly discussed in biblical scholarship – demonstrates that law and living do not always go hand in hand. There are complexities and exigencies that are not considered by the dramatic minimalism of legal writing. Studying Pentateuchal law alongside prophetic narratives shows how legal accounts can be trim and unbending, and are aided by narratives that demonstrate that life is hardly as rigid and didactic. “And if any person turns to ghosts and familiar spirits and goes astray after them, I will set My face against that person and cut him off from among his people,” bellows Leviticus 20:6. This law was followed strictly. King Saul even strengthened it during the course of his leadership (I Sam. 28:3). But when Saul was losing in battle and his leadership was ebbing, he called to his courtiers: “Find me a woman who consults ghosts, so that I can go to her and inquire through her” (I Sam. 28:7). Saul visited the famous witch of Endor, disguised in “different clothes” (I Sam. 28:8). The exceptions to the rule demonstrate that Jewish law and Jewish living are not the same thing. The law is there to set the golden standard, a bar of ethical or theological excellence. The exceptions in prophetic literature illustrate that law is followed by flawed human beings.",
                "A nazarite struggled with the weight and repercussions of sin, either his own or that which he witnessed. His behavior was an extreme response. Samson, as a nazarite, did not escape from sin through his vow. He was consecrated as a nazarite for life, indicating that his whole life was a battlefield of human temptation against human virtue. And the sacrifice of burning one’s newly grown hair, the crown of the nazarite oath, in Samson’s character was the cutting of his hair at the hands of the Philistines. Their temple became his altar. His sacrifice was ultimately himself. Samson, the lifelong nazarite, was just that. He gave himself up on the altar of sacrifice, but he did so as a young man. Samson’s alarming story illustrates the point made earlier, namely that changing one’s identity is as easy as cutting off one’s hair.",
                "Turning back to Numbers 6, we find that the wilderness did strange things to human beings. It contorted reality and surfaced deep human hungers and weaknesses. It brought out extremes of behavior, and it is, not surprisingly, the place where the only permitted form of asceticism in the Hebrew Bible is presented. The nazarite was the spiritual gadfly of the ancient Israelite camp, provoking in his or her encounter with the other, the spiritual longings and fears that draw certain personalities and repel others. In the restraint of his passions, the nazarite prompts us to question our own.",
                "Leaders, to be successful, must understand how to lead those who are not natural followers. By delineating the camp, those who are outside it, and those who are inside and outside at the same time, the book of Numbers helps us understand that leaders rarely choose their followers. They usually inherit them. And in that inheritance, there will be a sampling of all types, those who play by the rules and those who do not. The nazarite did not break the rules of the camp, but did challenge the ethos of those rules. As such, his presence was always a challenge. But if the nazarite was a spiritual gadfly who responded to the wilderness landscape by mirroring its minimalism in some way, then the task of the leader is to ensure that the diversity of the camp is protected. All have a place. More than that, the leader must create the necessary conditions for the nazarite to return whole into the camp when he is ready. Leaders should be judged, in part, by how they manage those on the margins of their jurisdiction, on the place they create for dissenters and the most vulnerable, and on how they welcome them into the community when they are ready to join or come back."

                "Countries are defined by their borders, the vein-like thin lines on a map that indicate who is a member of one nation and who is not by virtue of pure geographic location. But more than mere geography filters into the status of a resident or an alien. There are human boundary conditions, acts and behaviors that are deemed acceptable, and those deemed beyond the pale, that determine citizenship in the literal or metaphoric sense. There is accidental membership. I happen to be born in a particular country and, therefore, am a citizen and subject to the laws of that place. There is also intentional membership. I want to become a member of a place, so I engage in certain behaviors and fulfill particular requirements that enable me to qualify. In addition, that intentionality may involve loyalty and allegiance or overt demonstrations of affiliation. The changing nature of human status also signals transition. For example, most Jews today can easily identify a number of friends and acquaintances who have converted to Judaism. Fewer can identify those who have converted out of Judaism. If we were to gauge this same change two hundred years ago, the transition would have been reversed. This trend may say something about a people, something about the context in which people live, and something about changing conditions that allow for the fluid constitution of the collective.",
                "In the wilderness, there were no imaginable geographic boundaries that generated an understanding of community. Other boundaries existed. We studied the nazarite in the previous chapter; the nazarite was a “stranger” by virtue of a spiritual decision to separate from others ascetically. The <i>sota</i>, a suspected adulteress, was a moral stranger to the camp. The<i> ger</i> was a convert into the camp. The <i>ger toshav </i>was a different kind of stranger, one who lived among the Israelites but was not of the Israelites. The lack of such known boundaries and the very nature of being between two countries and not a member of either was a source of irritation and confusion. Demands like the census, the flags, the positioning of tribes relative to the Tabernacle, and the role of the Levites were all attempts to scrape together some minimal scaffolding. Rules about those who were entitled to live within the camp and those who could not enhanced the inclusionary/exclusionary nature of this odd desert grouping. The leper lived outside the camp, as did one who was ritually impure. The riffraff of Numbers 11 made trouble on the periphery of the camp. There is a continual return to the theme of belonging and estrangement throughout Numbers. The very difficulty of determining “citizenship” in this boundary-less era helps us understand why the text keeps returning to explore it. The matter is not limited to rules and regulations, but touches the heart of existential identity. The inability to live with the identity tension of not being Egyptian slaves, but neither living as Israelite freemen and landholders was too much ambiguity for many to tolerate. The faith that this struggle would soon be resolved was fragile.",
                "To address this conundrum, the midsection of Numbers presents a legal digression on the participation of the resident alien or the protected stranger in acts of personal and communal sacrifice. It is a passage about transition and identity in a time of challenge, and its appearance here is not hard to understand. As the Israelites sojourned and came in contact with other nations, some sought to skirmish and a number of foreign residents felt compelled to join them; consequently, laws were needed to clarify the standing of such individuals. Thus, the text must pause and offer some legal guidelines about the <i>ger toshav</i>, the resident alien. In creating a desert society, there were rules that applied to those living clearly within the community, those outside of it, and those on its margins, whose status on the boundary lines must have persistently raised questions about identity. In or out? Obligated or exempt? Punishable or not? The legal position of the stranger within any particular society offers insight into the nature of the community being created and the posture of self to other that is promoted, citizen and stranger alike. With this in mind, we turn to Numbers 15:",

There shall be one law for you and for the resident stranger; it shall be a law for all time throughout the ages. You and the stranger shall be alike before the Lord; the same ritual and the same rule shall apply to you and to the stranger who resides among you. (Num. 15:14–16)</small>",

Offering sacrifices, in particular, had appeal because it was a means to achieve forgiveness and experience belonging. This longing may have been obstructed by the pain of being an outsider. The desire to join, to participate, and to dispense with self-consciousness in the joyful presence of others is part of the desire to join a common bond, and represents the longing to cleave to something. As a band of wanderers united by shared history and values, the Israelites may have constituted a magnet for those who observed them from a distance.",
                "Sacrifices generated community because many were offered on behalf of a group and were, in part, consumed by a group. The one sacrificing was often mandated to share the cooked ox or sheep remains with his entire household and the needy. Thus, one of the most basic mechanisms for creating community in Exodus and then later in Joshua was the offering of the Paschal lamb – a rite that only a foreigner with circumcision could observe (Ex. 12:47–48 and Num. 9:13–14).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The connection among the rites of circumcision, the Paschal lamb, and the entrance into the Land of Israel is highlighted in Joshua 5 and inferred in Exodus 4:24–26. The three commandments seem to be part of a continuum of covenant beginning with personal covenant represented by the act of <i>Brit</i>, which allows membership in the community that offers the Passover sacrifice, and finally the community becomes a nation with the joining of a people and its land. In Genesis 34, Dina’s brothers base their ruse to kill the Shechemites on the accurate principle that without personal circumcision, marriage into the broader society of Israelites is forbidden.</i> This desire to be part and parcel of a community is reinforced in the very same chapter of Numbers with regard to a communal sacrifice offered to account for a group error:",
                "<small>If this [sin] was done unwittingly, through the inadvertence of the community, the whole community shall present one bull of the herd as a burnt offering of pleasing odor to the Lord with its proper meal offering and libation, and one he-goat as an offering.

The whole Israelite community and the stranger residing among them shall be forgiven, for it happened to the entire people through error. (Num. 15:24–26) </small>",
                "The rule initially seems to be inclusive only of Israelites. The need to achieve forgiveness for an inadvertent error as a community is deep and pervasive. The whole community requires it and benefits from it. Yet suddenly, as the passage closes, the stranger is both mentioned and included. A need this intense should not disqualify those living among Israelites who may be guilty of this error themselves, or feel themselves swept up in the momentum of the group sentiment. Someone not well-acquainted with the rituals of a community may feel the need to be part of this sacrifice, tripped up as he or she might be by the correct behaviors – a ritual choreography not yet mastered – desiring all the while to be part of something larger than self.",
                "If the stranger can enjoy literal and metaphysical benefits such as atonement, what makes the stranger a stranger at all?

A poor gentile or <i>ger </i>was counted among the recipients of communal welfare (Lev. 19:10) and enjoyed the protections of the community as a relative equal (Lev. 24:22). Who, then, was the stranger, if during this period of transition there was no land from which to claim citizenship? Who was a stranger if we were all strangers? Furthermore, what made this individual alien if he was included in the community, such that both citizen and stranger were “alike before the Lord”?",

A resident alien conveys the conflict of identity in its rawest sense. The individual in question is neither totally part of a community nor is he or she foreign to it. Like the convert, he or she is both insider and outsider at the same time. Saadia Gaon, one of the great early medieval scholars, observes on Numbers 15:26 that the stranger is a convert who desires to bring a sacrifice to gain full acceptance in the Israelite community. In this reading, this act demonstrates the simultaneous insider and outsider appellation of a resident alien. The desire to belong is coupled by an act to gain acceptance. Where this individual was once a stranger, he or she has made a momentous leap into a different faith and should be called a Jew or a citizen like any other.",

Once an individual has chosen to become Jewish, he retroactively absorbs Jewish history as if it were his own. This fact is a remarkable testament to both the Jewish sense of history and Judaism’s willingness to integrate those who make the difficult choice to live Jewishly.",

We are commanded to teach the convert some major and minor laws, but predominantly to question a potential convert about Jewish history and identity. Is the convert willing to accept Jewish peoplehood, marred as it is by repeated persecution? Does the convert know about the trials that Jews as a people face? In essence, we are inviting the convert not only to affirm a decision by creed and deed, but also largely by a history that he may not have thought his own. The convert is a full-fledged member of the “tribe” only when he can accept the fate, and not just the faith, of the Jewish people.",

Acceptance of the law is not the same as being accepted by the other. Even when converts make the commitment to live by the legal confines of Jewish practice, they find that acceptance into the community is more tenuous. The convert’s personal prayers, according to Maimonides, must reflect the fact that this individual has been able to fully embrace Judaism in its totality as a statement of identity, not merely of behavior. It is both act and history. Yet those responsible for integrating the convert into Jewish life often cannot get beyond the sense of otherness that the convert represents.",

It is this drawing of negative space that offers the rest of the represented images an identity. The space that isn’t defines the space that is. In politics and literature, it may be the experience of exile. An exile defines himself or herself by where he or she is not, not by the place of current residence.

A person can feel an emotional sense of belonging, but fail to be accepted within a community; a stranger can, through outlined protocols, be technically accepted, but never feel himself or herself a full-fledged member.

They were in a place by nature transitional so that communal or national identity for them was, at its best, fragile and unstable.

It is odd for Abraham to make this identity observation at this juncture. Surely Abraham must have felt his outsider status most profoundly when initially entering Canaan with a mandate from God to start a nation in a land populated by others, as far back as Genesis 12. Yet he pursued God’s command with particular zeal, without hesitation or pause to reflect on the fact that he was a stranger to Canaan. The experience of death, of losing one’s second self and partner in the creation of a national vision, may have precipitated Abraham’s new self-awareness. When a man loses his wife and is living in a country not yet his own, he wants to own a piece of land for eternity. He needs to know that he can always be within proximity of those he has loved and lost. Imagine, and it is not difficult to imagine, that a man buries his wife in a country that soon thereafter exiles him and his community elsewhere.

As a result of his own perplexing place in the universe, Moses was suited to the task of moving people from one identity state to another, from slave to landholder, from powerless to powerful, from subject of Pharaoh to object of God, from pyramids to Sinai. This responsibility may have come easier to him precisely because he was someone who slipped from one external environment to the next, carrying his existential distance with him wherever he traveled. He was also driven by the strongest desire of the stranger, to find home, even if it required years of homelessness and wandering. As a stranger, Moses could assist others who were strangers to a homeland. Ultimately, however, Moses would never become a resident or citizen of the land he desired, despite his stubborn commitment to ushering others to a different horizon. He would forever stay on the side of otherness. Moses died alone, inspiring Martin Buber to write of the prophet’s last hour, “And now Moses ascends Mount Nebo, solitary as he has always been; more solitary than he has ever been before.” <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Martin Buber, <i>Moses: The Revelation and the Covenant</i> (New York: Harper, 1965), 201.</i> Dislocation was not only the name he gave his son; it was a description of his existential condition, from birth to death.",
                "<b>The Leader and the Stranger</b><br>What role does the leader have in relation to the stranger? Is there a way in which the leader must act in relation to the stranger? We have just seen that Moses’ lack of connection to people or place offered him a unique stance in the world to assist others in their search for place. Paradoxically, only one who suffers alienation can recognize it and create salvation from it for others. It was the priest in the Bible who diagnosed the leper and set him outside the camp, and it was the high priest who ushered the leper back into the camp, letting all know that the person on top of the spiritual pyramid in society was not beyond escorting the one lowest in position. It was his very duty to accompany the leper and demonstrate through association the role of the leader.",
                "If identity is an internal state determined by acts and emotions from within and acceptance and isolation from without, then the leader is a critical figure in crafting responses to otherness and escorting the follower through these states.

If the leader alienates the stranger, even less can be expected in the commoner’s treatment of the very same person. If the leader, however, creates an environment of acceptance, welcome, and love, it will trickle down and shape the culture in which that leader moves and operates. To that end, Goleman and his coauthors stress the quality of empathy in the emotionally intelligent leader, the capacity to read others and understand their inherent stance in the universe:",

                "Abraham had every reason to identify as a citizen. He walked to the land on a divine promise. God told him in no uncertain terms that he would possess all the land upon which his foot stepped: “Up, walk about the land, through its length and its breadth, for I give it to you” (Gen. 13:17). Abraham had children in that land, fought its battles, and dug its wells, an ancient act that conferred land ownership. But Abraham lacked the internal presumption to claim citizenship. Abraham came to Canaan at seventy-five. He lived a good portion of his life outside of its borders. Its existence predated him, and he approached his neighbors with the humility required to understand that you can live in a place for decades and still be a stranger. This Genesis text also reminds us that perception of outsider status is generated within and without, by the self and by the other. While Abraham may have regarded himself as an outsider, the Hittites were quick to remind him that he was an insider because God had conferred that status upon him. Status is not only where you are born but also where you give birth to your own identity. The Hittites accepted Abraham with a willingness that was mirrored in Abraham’s own acts of kindness to strangers.",

We moved from one location to another and became transformed in the process. But we also stayed in a posture of detachment as <i>ivri’im</i> because we were constantly in transition. The passage about the resident alien in Numbers 15 may be a plea to treat the stranger as citizen and not to let the demarcations of the past create separations. Indeed we are told in the text that this is a law that applies throughout the generations. Identity wrestling gave rise to the flexibility of a formula for determining boundaries. Even in the Promised Land citizenship is not guaranteed, but shared with other inhabitants. Once living within an Israelite camp, the stranger is regarded as an integral part of the Jewish landscape with regard to compassion and equality.",

                "<i>A noble man compares and estimates himself by an idea which is higher than himself; and a mean man, by one lower than himself. The one produces aspiration; the other ambition, which is the way in which a vulgar man aspires.<br>Marcus Aurelius</i>",
                "In Hebrew, the word for transition is “<i>maavar</i>,” which also means “bridge.” Since Hebrew is a relatively economical language when it comes to root words, the relationship between the two words makes fine sense. A bridge is an instrument or transitional passage that connects two otherwise unconnected places, usually two bodies of land. The bridge allows for smooth passage and is also usually the most efficient way to get between two otherwise separate locations. We also use the term to indicate other objects, ideas, and people who are able to bring otherwise disparate objects or concepts together. The problem with every bridge is answering the question “where is it?” with any precision. Were you to stand in the middle of a bridge between two countries it would be difficult to determine an exact address. You would be aware that you were not in one place and not in another and that you would never have an exact address unless you picked a side. No one who sets out to cross a bridge just stays there. Such is the problem with all transitions; they require both a cognitive and an emotional understanding that the transition is not the destination. The competent leader will help motivate people to make the crossing and show people why they could or should not stay in the place they left while creating an inviting picture of the landing. No leader should sell people a bridge.",

We crossed the Reed Sea and the Jordan River. We are facile at making changes and at adaptation. We understand that to be in transition is not the same as meandering aimlessly. And yet, even though we are named for our flexibility, in the wilderness we displayed a great deal of rigidity, the kind of small-mindedness that became an obstacle to getting to the other side of any dilemma.",
                "What does a leader need to do to inspire followers who are stuck on the bridge?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Portions of this essay were excerpted from the author’s essay “Food in the Wilderness,” <i>Le’ela</i>,  (December 2001): 3–7.</i> Most people today would use the loose term “vision” to answer the question, actually believing that a word that is so hard to define would somehow be appealing and lofty enough to satisfy eager listeners. In actuality, the word may buy the leader more time to come up with a concrete answer. “A vision of what?” might be a more appropriate response. But vision is a popular word in leadership literature. In the index of Warren Bennis’s classic, <i>On Becoming a Leader</i>, the word “vision” enjoys more citations in the book than any other idea or concept. Bennis, one of the most popular thinkers today on the subject of leadership, believes that vision is the “first basic ingredient” of leadership. “The leader has a clear idea of what he or she wants to do – professionally and personally – and the strength to persist in the face of setbacks, even failures. Unless you know where you’re going, and why, you cannot possibly get there.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Warren Bennis, <i>On Becoming a Leader</i> (Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1994), 39–40.</i> Bennis reminds us of the wisdom attributed to Alice’s Cheshire cat, “If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will take you there.” In this picture, without a guiding vision, leaders meander and get lost quickly.",
                "The problem with this otherwise logical piece of advice is that leadership is rarely so linear or logical. As we established in earlier chapters, leaders meander and get lost predominantly because when they enter the messiness of leadership, all of their carefully made plans must get rethought. The path is not straight; the destination is not always realistic and the leaders may have conveniently forgotten about all the politics they would have to navigate and negotiate along the way. No one wants to stand up and say the truth: “I need to be honest with you. I actually don’t have a clear vision, but I manage well. I need to spend time here and see where I can really take this place or these people incrementally or if that is even possible. I’ll get back to you.”",
                "No one wants to articulate the murkiness and uncertainty of what most leaders really do confront when they set out in the world as change agents. Add to this the problem of time, and the formula becomes untenable. New CEOs and executive directors inherit a long list of problems that they probably had nothing to do with yet are expected to fix while setting out a plan for the future. One leadership thinker likened it to changing a tire while driving sixty miles an hour. Volunteer leaders on nonprofit boards typically take terms for two or three years. By the time they figure out the ambiguities and the possible open doors, they are usually handing the reins over to someone else. Public officials may get a little more time, but it is rarely enough time to institute lasting change because within what seems to be the blink of an eye, they have to put aside some of the energy usually used to get things done so that they can campaign for reelection.",
                "We want our leaders to have vision and to share it broadly with us and motivate us to join them in seeking higher ground. We want them to speak and believe that leadership is a science, even when it seems more like a combination of art and glorified babysitting. Some stubborn types do buckle down with a singular aim and pay attention to very specific objectives with laser-like focus. These leaders may get there and actualize their vision, but it often comes at the extreme cost of putting everything else that had to be done to the side. It may come without the sincere ownership or buy-in of those the leader must serve. Such leaders often get criticized for being myopic and narrow, even though they let their followers know that they did not set out to change the world, only one little sliver of it. It is no surprise that leaders, especially those in the public eye like politicians, often have their campaign goals played back to them with videotape-like accuracy when they fail to achieve their stated goals in office. “Read my lips. No more taxes.” Did we really believe that any realistic picture of a future included no more taxes? Many of us did. It was not reality speaking. It was hope talking.",

Because the Israelites were in a transitional place, they needed a transitional food. The manna, first mentioned in Exodus 16 in response to Israelite cries of hunger, must have been regarded as a divine and irresistible present, and yet it stirred controversy again and again in biblical texts.

                "Manna’s strange properties extended beyond this. Moses told them the amount of manna they were entitled to collect and that one person could gather it for all those in his tent. The Israelites went out; some collected much and others collected little. Unlike bread, the gathering of this new substance was urgent and immediate. It could not wait another day. “And Moses said to them, ‘Let no one leave any of it over until morning.’ But they paid no attention to Moses; some of them left it until morning, and it became infested with maggots and stank. And Moses was angry with them” (Ex. 16:19–20).",
                "Later, the rabbis of the Talmud read much into this daily deliverance of manna as a test of faith. This food generated obedience and repentance. Knowing that their food came once a day, the Israelites had to behave daily in a way that made them worthy of its receipt. And yet before the Sabbath, they were told explicitly by Moses to collect two shares for the day to come. Having seen the maggots once, they did not trust Moses and went out to gather on the Sabbath. No manna arrived, and God became despondent and said to Moses: “How long will you men refuse to obey My commandments and My teachings?” (Ex. 16:28). This almost Pavlovian mechanism for teaching the Israelites about this new food eventually worked and came to symbolize wilderness life. To be a transitional food, the manna could not look like anything the Israelites had ever eaten. So unusual was this manna that Moses commanded Aaron to make a keepsake of it: “‘Take a jar, put one <i>omer</i> [biblical measurement] of manna in it, and place it before the Lord, to be kept through the ages.’ As the Lord commanded Moses, Aaron placed it before the Pact to be kept” (Ex. 16:33–34). Imagine opening a large box with an archeologist’s curiosity to find in it two tablets of stone, two broken tablets of stone, and one small jar of strange white material the Israelites called wilderness food. The text is followed by a historical observation, namely that the Israelites were sustained by this manna for forty years until they reached the border of Canaan.",
                "The peculiarities of the manna outlined above beg the question: Why did God give them this particular food in this particular way? What underlying symbolism drove this culinary oddity? Manna was to be associated only with the wilderness trek. It appears nowhere else in the Bible and could not be replicated by human endeavors. Only in contrast to normal eating patterns does the true significance of this manna come to light. When the Israelites crossed the Jordan, the manna stopped: “The manna stopped the day after they ate this food from the land; there was no longer any manna for the Israelites, but that year they ate of the produce of Canaan” (Josh. 5:12).",
                "In Deuteronomy, the manna is not portrayed as a food of wonder but is itself a test of faith: “He [God] subjected you to the hardship of hunger and then gave you manna to eat, which neither you nor your fathers had ever known, in order to teach you that man does not live on bread alone, but that man may live on anything that the Lord decrees” (Deut. 8:3). The purpose of this food was to enhance the sense of transition and to curb the human pleasure of eating for more transcendent goals; ultimately, the Israelites needed more than physical nourishment to endure. Ironically, the purpose of the manna was not so much as food, but to teach less dependence upon food. Receiving manna daily from heaven would force the Israelites to merit and deserve this gift, as the Talmud records the question of a group of students to their teacher, “Why did not the manna come down to Israel once annually?” The teacher responded with a parable:",

                "<b>The Food of the Future, the Dream of the Future</b><br>Returning to the aspiration postcard of the future, Moses offered an image of food: “a land of wheat and barley, of vines, figs and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey; a land where you may eat food without stint, where you will lack nothing” (Deut. 8:8). The pleasant images utilized in this verse are a far cry from pungent slave foods or from manna’s barely tolerable sameness in the complaints of the Israelites. Deuteronomy’s promise is not one of flesh, but one of agrarian riches, returning us at once to the Garden of Eden’s heady pleasures. It is not one of stinging and acrid vegetables, but of sweet and abundant fruit grown over time. The root vegetables they asked for in the middle of the wilderness were just that. They came from the ground and symbolically represented their desire to stay in one place, yet this root produce would only last them one season. After one harvest, its benefits were gone. Planting trees takes longer and requires the capacity to see what is not yet in existence. The oft-quoted and beautiful talmudic parable of a traveler and a tree comes to mind. The traveler saw an old man planting a tree that he would never live to see flourish. When the traveler questioned why he was planting, the old man responded: “I did not enter a desolate world. Just as those before me planted for me, thus will I plant for those who come after me.” <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Taanit 23a.</i> This is the ultimate statement of stewardship: to see a future not yet visible and prepare it for others whom you will not see.

Patience on the part of the Israelites would solve their problems in a much more munificent way than even they had imagined. You must be patient when you plant a tree.",

The contemporary Israeli botanist, Nogah Hareuveni, contends that the foods of Deuteronomy 8 are linked with the image of milk and honey mentioned in Exodus 3:8 and Deuteronomy 26:15.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nogah Hareuveni, <i>Nature in Our Biblical Heritage</i> (Kiryat Ono: Neot Kedumim, 1980), 11–22.</i> The causal relationship between the two is clear. The more vegetation was produced, the more date honey was produced. The more vegetation generally, the easier it was to graze cattle that would, in turn, produce greater quantities of milk. Thus, the promise of milk goes hand in hand with bountiful crops. The more vegetation there was in a given area, the greater the likelihood of flowers and the greater the chances of honey production. However, Hareuveni also alerts us to a more negative image of milk and honey contained in Isaiah:",
                "<small>Cream and honey shall everyone eat who is left in the [desolated] land. And it shall come to pass on that day that every place where there has been a thousand grapevines worth a thousand pieces of silver shall be covered with briars and thorns. (Is. 7:22–24)</small>",
                "Cream and honey are not only the symbols of habitation and agrarian success. Here, they are signs of desolation. Hareuveni argues that in the Pentateuch, milk and honey are images of anticipation and nurturing but, in the prophetic books, they are also symbols of wasteland. Honey is depicted in several places in the Bible as a product of uncultivated land. The promise of the Land of Israel was of uncultivated land as a gift for the Israelites to farm and work. It was a new frontier. Once the Israelites inhabited the land, the same image of uncultivated and wild tracts of space became anathema to the settled farmer as well as a warning: do not let the land that God gave you lie fallow for too long lest it be overrun by untamed vegetation and not properly settled.",
                "In contrast, Michael Walzer, using Exodus as a backdrop for other stories of revolution, claims that milk and honey were emblematic of the material promise given to the Israelites, paired with the spiritual promise that they become “a nation of priests” (Ex. 19:6). The land will be “the opposite of Egyptian bondage: free farming instead of slave labor.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Michael Walzer, <i>Exodus and Revolution</i> (New York: Basic Books, 1985), 101.</i> The only difficulty with this interpretation is that the expression “milk and honey” is also used in a rebellion against Moses to describe Egypt: “Is it a small thing that you bring us out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness?” (Num. 16:13). To this Walzer responds by explaining that Egypt and Israel were not all that different in terms of the material promises they held. The main distinction was whose material gain and whose milk and honey it was:",

Perhaps you will mistake the milk and honey of the place of your servitude with the milk and honey of freedom. It is easy enough to confuse the two when the struggle for freedom gets difficult. Becoming an independent landowner has its own spiritual perils, one of which is the fear that the reliance upon God as provider in the desert can turn to self-sufficiency and forgetfulness of the divine once on the land. Such is the warning offered in Deuteronomy describing God’s nurturing in the wilderness and the impending change that may take place when the desert journey is over:",

                "The wilderness of the ancient Israelites tells a story of change through narratives of food intertwined with narratives of leadership. The food recalled from Egyptian days was associated with slave labor, with bitterness, and often with carnality. The food of desert life was reflective of the landscape, monochromatic in color and taste and a test of faith for those who ate it. The manna was a transitional food between dependence and independence. The promises of the future evoked food of land ownership and control, of bounty and human effort. The hard work required to tame uncultivated land and to produce the olive groves and vineyards of Israel created expectation rather than frustration in the hearts of the ancient Israelites. As slaves, they were accustomed to manual labor. Their future life in the Promised Land may not have changed in terms of the physical effort required to sustain themselves, but the literal fruit of their labors could now be enjoyed in freedom. Psalm 78 includes a passage about hunger and the transition from slave to free man:",

                "In this psalm, the image of the feast in the wilderness is not a test of God’s faith in man but of man’s faith in God’s ability to provide. The psalm offers the reader a human window to view ancient Israelite needs. In this sense, the manna was not only a test for the people. It was a test of God. God passed this test. Most of the Israelites could not because they lived with the taste of the past, handcuffed to images of bondage and bitterness that they revised in their collective imagination of Egypt.",
                "Creating an aspiration postcard begins with finding the image that will best inspire followers to take a leap of faith in a leader. It is an image that is just as important to followers as it is to leaders. A vision must resonate not only with those who create it but with those who must actualize it. Because food was so central in the complaints of the Israelites during their wilderness journey, it was natural to focus on food as a way to shift the culture. Shifting food associations by creating a food vision of the future that resonated with the Israelites helped transport them to another place not yet seen. Some who could not let go of food images of the past died with meat in their teeth. Food, because it is so primal and urgent a need, spoke to the immediacy of Israelite experience on the one hand, but also created a different kind of yearning. The kind of food dreaming that needed to take place would not only satisfy the stomach. It sated the heart and mind of one generation who dreamed about the next. Moses understood that underneath the dreams of cucumbers and melons lay an associative world of yearnings and desires that had to be channeled and directed.",
                "Part of the conflict stemmed from the fact that the destination postcard was so late in arriving. By the time the Israelites were “in the book of Deuteronomy,” there were far fewer of them to enjoy the portrait of a land without stint that Moses had created for them. One only wonders what the wilderness experience might have looked like had Moses offered an image of gushing water, sweet fruit trees, and hills replete with minerals at their first sign of thirst in Exodus 15. Visionary leadership involves more than creating in the present a picture of an unimaginable future. It is also about when to unleash that vision so that the dream does not seem too far away."

Authority can break down from the inside out when a leader is strangled by self-doubt and insecurity. It can also break down from the outside in when constant complaints and vociferous criticism wear down a leader’s resolve and commitment to a mission. In the worst-case scenarios, leadership authority is decimated by both internal and external forces like rust that, over time, creates a layer of corrosion so deep that it goes from minimizing an object’s efficiency to preventing its functioning altogether. It is here that we begin to experience the leader’s darkest and loneliest hours. Unable to keep followers from advancing and unable to satisfy the immediate and constant needs that come from confusing the journey for the destination, the leader’s self-worth dissolves into a puddle of self-pity and hopelessness. It is here that flagrant acts of rebellion take place in front of the leader as a flaunting of the leader’s powerlessness. It is this stage, when unchecked, that can be the leader’s undoing if the relationship between leader and follower is not radically altered. It is here that Moses pleaded with God to take his life."

                "Failure is another word for growth; it just doesn’t seem like it at the time. Leaders with ambitions to change others or confront convention often find themselves stymied and alone, wracked by mistakes and unsure of the future. They nurse their leadership wounds in private, struggling with alienation. Unable to motivate others to buy into their vision of the future or their commitment to change, they label themselves as failures. They feel misunderstood and suffer the strange paralysis of believing that there can be no realization of their deepest desires, that there is no one who shares their dreams. But sometimes, in the black sea of confusion, failure precipitates innovation. The leader sheds one layer of thinking that defies reality in search of another way to actualize a vision, and in that primal shedding discovers another, stronger leader packaged inside the first. Like Russian matryoshka dolls that hold hidden treasures within them, leaders with resilience learn to manage themselves differently with every anguished encounter, revealing a more robust and determined version of themselves than they knew possible. In order to do this, they must be able to acknowledge that the transition they are in and the breakdown in authority they are beginning to experience do not represent failure. It is a place of painful experimentation.",
                "On the surface, Moses confronted leadership failure throughout his tenure. He was rejected continuously by the people he was committed to serve. Early on, Moses’ eyes took in dilemmas that he subsequently positioned himself to confront. Thus, after successfully killing an Egyptian taskmaster who beat a Jew, we are somewhat surprised to see that Moses’ next leadership activity met with unmasked contempt.",

Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?” Moses was frightened and thought: Then the matter is known. (Ex. 2:13–14)</small>",
                "Naturally, there is irony in a stranger who just killed a man asking others to refrain from violence, yet what stuns the reader most is the way in which the angry Hebrew captured, in very few words, the sentiment that characterized all of Moses’ subsequent leadership: who made you chief and ruler over us? It foreshadows the challenges, doubts, and anxieties that surfaced in Moses’ leadership in nearly every narrative in Numbers. It was the question people kept asking of him and perhaps the question he kept asking of himself. Even when this question had a divine answer, it did not stop the Israelites from asking variations of it for the next four decades of Moses’ leadership. Not regarded as a trusted insider by the Hebrews, Moses was identified by Yitro’s daughters as an Egyptian man. Later, as we saw, when he had a child with Yitro’s daughter Tzipora, he summed up his acute emotionally disjointed background in the name he gave his son, Gershom: “I have been a stranger in a foreign land” (Ex. 2:22). We are unsure as to what land Moses was referring, but it almost makes no difference. The existential crisis and the alienation of the leader emerged with all of its accompanying anguish. Moses had no people, no tribe, no nation to call his own. Helper to all, he became friend to none.",
                "These words foreshadowed the resistance to his leadership that he experienced over his lifetime. From a populist standpoint, Moses failed from the outset. And yet, Moses had the gift of articulating his humility and his wretchedness. Rather than withholding his feelings of failure, he articulated them in language both lyrical and depressing. Throughout the Hebrew Bible, Moses gave voice to his inner darkness, signaling God for assistance in resolving the most intimate crises of faith in his followship. Too often, the independent streak in leaders prevents them from getting the help they need to overcome helplessness. Rejection is a harsh admission for anyone. For the leader, it is harder still.",
                "Moses was born to greatness and, according to Rashbam (Rabbi Samuel ben Meir), his birth is recorded with the very words used to frame the pristine world God created in Genesis – “<i>ki tov hu</i>” – “and it was good.” He was good, his mother observed. He would one day make life good. He was somehow different from others from the start. He never suffered enslavement, and midrashim of his time in Pharaoh’s palace chronicle a star-studded lineup of scholars who inducted him into the world of universal ideas. He was born to parents who are not named in the text; rather, each is described only as a Levite. He then went to live in the house of Pharaoh and, as a fugitive, went to Midian to live in the house of Yitro, a priest. His early biography fails to name those who raised him: his mother, his father, his sister, Pharaoh’s daughter, and Pharaoh himself. Martin Buber observes that the names are not significant; rather, the text notes that he was exposed to one model of leader after another: Levite, pharaoh, priest. Moses’ early days of personal development were quickly followed by three acts that merited him future leadership greatness: killing an oppressive taskmaster, breaking up a conflict between two Hebrews, and assisting young women who were harassed by shepherds. These acts shaped the person who would merit a vision of a burning bush and a redemptive future for his people.",

In a contemporary reading of “<i>kevad peh anokhi</i> ” – “I am heavy of speech” – Moses complained to God that he could never lead the people because he was unable to make small talk. He was preoccupied with heavy, weighty matters. He lacked sympathy for the petty concerns of the small-minded, a problem that would continue to haunt him in days of Israelite thirst and hunger. In a striking midrash on the death of Moses in Deuteronomy 34, the sages identified one small word that highlighted his inability to access the favor of the Israelites: “And the Israelites bewailed Moses in the steppes of Moab for thirty days” (Deut. 34:8). Mourning the death of Aaron, who was regarded as a leader of the people, the Bible says of the Israelites, “<i>All</i> the house of Israel bewailed Aaron thirty days” (Num. 20:29). The small addition of the word “all” indicated to the sages that Aaron was a popular, beloved leader while Moses was an important, but tolerated one.",
                "Leaders who are prepared to take people to a place they have not been before face the pushing away of love for the sake of purpose.

Although Mordecai worked for the good of his people, he was regarded highly by most of his brothers, but not by all of them, if we interpret “<i>rov</i>” as the majority rather than the many. Commentators here acknowledge that leaders are never fully loved by the people they serve, even beneficent and altruistic leaders. The mere position of authority over others makes one subject to dislike and criticism, feelings Moses contended with continuously.",
                "As a visionary, however, Moses incrementally advanced in the direction of his dreams in chapter after chapter, book after book. Distracting and difficult to manage, the Israelites may have presented obstacles to this progression, but never really waylaid Moses from his singular focus. Leaders often complain that they could accomplish their goals if only those they served would simply get out of the way. Serving people often involves helping them get out of their own way and pushing them to achieve something that they continually resist. Perhaps no other leader in recorded history faced this irony more than Moses. Herman Wouk, at ninety-seven, published a book called <i>The Lawgiver, </i>a novel about Moses. Wouk, who is a fictional character in his own novel, is asked to write a screenplay about Moses for a movie and is told that he is the right person because he understands Moses. Wouk objects and barks in reply: “<i>Nobody</i> [emphasis in the original] understands Moses.” To this, the pushy agent replies, “See, I’m right. You’re the man for the movie. Who else understands that nobody understands Moses?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Herman Wouk, <i>The Lawgiver</i> (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2012), 14.</i>",
                "From his earliest days as a justice fighter from the window of Pharaoh’s palace, Moses stepped into difficult situations that others avoided. The repeated term “<i>vayaar</i>,” to look, in Moses’ narratives, helps us understand his capacity to turn towards rather than away from that which he did not understand and that which appeared beyond his control. He looked at injustice but also looked directly at a wondrous burning bush that was aflame but not consumed. This offered a remarkable symbol of leadership for Moses: something aflame with passion could make a profound impression without burning out. It provided the inspiration for resilience. Exodus 3 indicates that God specifically called Moses to leadership because he turned to look at that bush, curious rather than intimidated by the mystery: “When the Lord saw that he had turned aside to look, God called to him out of the bush, ‘Moses, Moses!’” (Ex. 3:4). God looked at Moses looking. He gained God’s respect and admiration. He earned his leadership by fighting against human injustice, on the one hand, and responding to the wonder of transcendence on the other. Unlike Abraham and a whole host of other biblical leaders and prophets who were called to greater responsibility without any textual explanation, Moses’ early days highlight a person restless with goodwill, filled with the tremors of indignation, and stopped cold by the sight of a small miracle.",
                "God’s selection of Moses and God’s support were, of course, fundamental to Moses’ eventual success. But Moses’ failure to attract Israelites to his cause must have worn away Moses’ determination. From the very outset, Moses probed God about how he was to persuade and motivate them, anticipating rejection from Pharaoh (“Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh?” [Ex. 3:11]) and the people (“What shall I say to them?” [Ex. 3:13]). In that sense, his role as speaker and leader was also in transition. Leading the fight against Pharaoh required different skills and language than pushing against the people’s resistance. In contrast to Harold Bloom’s anxiety of influence, Moses suffered the anxiety of noninfluence: “What if they do not believe me and do not listen to me, but say: ‘The Lord did not appear to you?’” (Ex. 4:1). Moses pegged his future constituents. Their stubborn refusal to pursue freedom from slavery, their constant complaints about material deficiencies, and their mutinous arguments made the journey cumbersome and exhausting. God’s help was just that. God did not take over Moses’ role. Help lies in assisting others to their goals, not absolving them of the work or taking over with the heavy-handedness of ultimate authority. With each positive resolution to Israelite needs and complaints, Moses’ leadership was confirmed. Initially, he even skillfully managed to control his own emotions, despite the whining and bitterness of the Israelites. He was able to keep his anger in check.",
                "Through the trials of the Exodus, Moses’ role as chief interpreter of God’s wrath in the form of the plagues created a distant hero figure for the Israelites and one who incrementally won their trust. Until the Israelites crossed the sea, they were still ostensibly led by Pharaoh as residents of his empire. But after the crossing, when they landed in a desert free of Pharaoh’s constraints, Moses became their chief advisor and the human representative of divine will. The biblical text records that only once they crossed that sea did they truly “believe in God and Moses, His servant.” But three days after their salvation through water at the Reed Sea, the Israelites complained about the bitter waters of Mara and turned to Moses for the solution. Moses was deputized by God to throw a piece of wood into the waters to sweeten them. In this act, God effectively turned Moses into the troubleshooter for a nation. One chapter later, the people brought him a hunger crisis that was resolved with the introduction of manna. Moses and Aaron heard the people grumbling but did not see their complaint directed at themselves; rather, it appeared to them that it was directed at God:",
                "<small>“For who are we that you should grumble against us? Since it is the Lord,” Moses continued, “who will give you flesh to eat in the evening and bread to eat in the morning to the full, because the Lord has heard the grumblings you utter against Him, what is our part? Your grumbling is not against us but against the Lord!” (Ex. 16:7–8) </small>",
                "Although Exodus 16 presents a human confrontation, Moses reframed it as a challenge to God, rather than his own authority. He maintained his relationship with the people while prodding God to meet their demands. There is something almost uncomfortable about the way in which Moses distanced himself from God, while God, in parallel, tried to position Moses as a leader. Moses redirected the conflict, putting the blame for any dissatisfaction clearly at God’s doorstep, as if to say, “I did not bring you here. I did not create or deny your provisions.” Even as Moses shifted responsibility to God, the Israelites continued to see him as the primary – or at least the initial – address for their unhappiness. In the thick of chapter 17, Moses understood the consequences of this dilemma:",
                "<small>The people quarreled with Moses, “Give us water to drink,” they said; and Moses replied to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the Lord?” But the people thirsted there for water; and the people grumbled against Moses and said, “Why did you bring us up from Egypt to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?” Moses cried out to the Lord, saying, “What shall I do with this people? Before long they will be stoning me.” (Ex. 17:2–5)</small>",

He knew – even at this very early stage in the journey – that he could not provide for their needs, even the most basic of them. Moses cried out to God. God once again manufactured a temporary solution to thirst by having Moses strike a rock that brought forth water. This location, a place that should have communicated redemption, brimmed with unhappiness. “The place was named <i>Masa U’Meriva</i> [trial and quarrel] because they tried the Lord, saying, “Is the Lord present among us or not?” (Ex. 17:7). Their thirst is not presented as a human need for water in the desert, but rather as a human need for leadership.

                "Moses begged for intimacy with God and the recognition that even after the heinous sin of idolatry, there was still a role for his leadership. If Moses had indeed been singled out for leadership, then he needed to know God. Moses was willing to accept the next stages of his calling only if God could make Himself familiar. It is not an odd request. The greater the demands placed on Moses, the more he required assurances. In days past in Egypt, Moses had the ready affirmation of the plagues; he could point to them to show that God was visibly behind the mission. But the wilderness provided too many hiding places for God. Coming on the heels of the Golden Calf incident, his request was even more poignant. Leadership had become harder, the people more recalcitrant. The meager rewards of leadership must somehow become greater, or at least more obvious. Not a friend to the people and not an intimate with God, Moses became stuck in a no-man’s land of remoteness, a distance that slowly eroded his energy to lead. God, in response, strangely granted Moses his request and allowed Moses to experience slight exposure to the Divine Presence. More than knowledge, this visibility offered the lonely leader solace.",
                "Moses also needed to know that both God and he shared the belief that the Israelites were still God’s nation. In another midrash on Exodus 32, words were put into Moses’ mouth that do not appear in the original biblical text: “‘When they sin they are not Mine’ [said God]. ‘No,’ said Moses, ‘They are Yours, and repent of this evil against Your people.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus Rabba 41:7.</i> Moses, even at this low point in his leadership, held God accountable for partnering with him in the covenantal fate of the Jewish people.

This request was beyond possibility and, more than any other, it spiraled Moses into a profound descent. The Talmud understood, as mentioned earlier in the chapter on manna, that their desire was not actually meat. Their request was a test to see who could provide the impossible. Moses decided, at this point, that he could not.",

Did I conceive all these people, did I bear them that You should say to me, ‘Carry them in your bosom as a nurse carries an infant’ to the land that You have promised on oath to their fathers? Where am I going to get meat to give to all these people when they whine before us and say, ‘Give us meat to eat!’ I cannot carry all this people by myself, for it is too much for me.

                "God’s anger at the sight of this breakdown of unity was not the same as Moses’ despair. God, again and again in the text, reciprocated the challenges to divine leadership with untempered wrath. This time, God’s anger was manifest in a glut of quails, demonstrating that providing meat was not beyond God’s capabilities, but also using the people’s desire as the instrument of their downfall. A plague swept through the camp in response to their childish, ungrateful tears and consumed thousands with quail meat still in their teeth. Numbers 11 offers us a vicious, graphic image of avarice at the hands of a God emboldened by Israelite greed.",
                "Moses, however, did not see the request for meat as a criticism of God but as a rejection of his own leadership. Going from tent to tent and hearing the cries of his people again and again weakened his resolve and his motivation to lead. His was not the emotion of anger directed at others, but the stench of personal failure directed at himself: “Why have You dealt ill with Your servant, and why have I not enjoyed Your favor, that You have laid all the burden of this people upon me?” Moses believed that God was punishing him for a sin he could not identify, by placing the onus of leadership on his unworthy shoulders. The people were a burden he could not lift. “I cannot carry all this people by myself, for it is too much for me. If You would deal thus with me, kill me rather, I beg You, and let me see no more of my wretchedness.” Nowhere else in the text does Moses make this plea for death. He had reached his breaking point. He knew with greater clarity than at any other point in his leadership that he could not match the unrealistic expectations thrown at him by the Israelites’ fanciful imaginations.",

                "Samuel’s integrity was sandwiched among leaders whose corruption was the subject of public spectacle. As a child growing up in Eli’s household, he was no doubt aware that Eli’s sons were abusing the priesthood, just as Samuel was being mentored for a leadership takeover:",
                "<small>Now Eli’s sons were scoundrels; they paid no heed to the Lord. This is how the priests used to deal with the people: When anyone brought a sacrifice, the priest’s boy would come along with a three-pronged fork while the meat was boiling and he would thrust it into the cauldron or the kettle or the great pot or the small cooking pot and whatever the fork brought up, the priest would take from it…. [But now] even before the suet was turned into smoke, the priest’s boy would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, “Hand over some meat to roast for the priest, for he won’t accept boiled meat from you, only raw.” And if the man said to him, “Let the suet first turn into smoke, then take as much as you want,” he would reply, “No, hand it over at once or I’ll take it by force.” The sin of the young men against the Lord was very great, for the men treated the Lord’s offerings impiously. (I Sam. 2:12–17)</small>",
                "The text oddly goes into great detail about the subtle way in which Eli’s sons profited from sacrifices. Eli’s sons were not the only ones who participated in these crimes; his grandsons were also guilty, with leadership credibility spilling over from one generation to the next. Priests were materially supported by the people who were obligated by Jewish law to provide portions of their own harvest and sacrifices to ensure that the priesthood was sustained with dignity. The young priest was entitled to take from a sacrifice already in preparation what could reasonably be carried off with his fork, enough for the immediate benefit of his family. But these novices pressured those who came to sacrifice their animals to give them raw meat, serving themselves before serving the Lord and also taking more than was their just entitlement. This not only angered God, but also created an unpleasant experience for the worshipper who came in earnest with an expensive gift for God, only to find that the House of God was led by unworthy servants who polluted the holiness of their encounter. One can only imagine the inconvenience and trouble of the pilgrim who took the time and money to travel to this holy site only to find it riddled with the small crimes and misdemeanors of those who represented spiritual leadership.",
                "Taking sacrifices, however, was not their only crime. When Eli finally chastised them for their behavior (only, the text records, as Eli was getting old did he hear reports of his sons’ injustices), he did not mention anything related to sacrifices, despite the textual emphasis on precisely this behavior. He criticized them for something else: “They lay with the women who performed tasks at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting” (I Sam. 2:22). It is harder to imagine this crime, public as it was at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. It strikes the reader as different in scale and impact from the fork-in-the-cauldron problem. No private location was sought for these sexual liaisons; the brazen disregard Eli’s sons demonstrated for the holy location of their crimes showed total indifference to the impact of such behaviors on the faith of their followers.",
                "Later, Samuel’s own sons were caught up in scandal: “But his sons did not follow his ways; they were bent on gain, they accepted bribes, and they subverted justice” (I Sam. 8:3). By the time Samuel defended his honor, he had a host of crimes encircling him at the hands of those close to him: his mentor’s sons and his own. It is no surprise that he had to distinguish himself from those associated with him but not worthy of him. The people acknowledged as much.",

                "This strange back-and-forth dialogue between a leader and his followers signals a moment in time when Samuel was advanced in years and looked back in a summative way on his leadership and his generation. He needed the public affirmation of his morality at a time when such could not be assumed of others in a similar position. In addition, Samuel was also securing a public referendum on the nobility of leadership.

This can sometimes create too much room for unchecked power.",

When he protested a change of leadership and then, eventually, defended his personal honor as a leader, he was subjecting himself to the critique of hypocrisy that, no doubt, was placed at his feet.

But in not defending himself, he may have unwittingly internalized the anger he felt towards the people until it erupted and ended in another dark hour for his leadership: the one that would ultimately bring about his death. Moses’ death warrant was wrapped up in the culture of complaint that he carried for so many decades. The people’s repeated offenses and their corrosive scratching of the leader’s skin until they reached his heart began in Exodus 17 and were repeated in Numbers 20, foreshadowing Moses’ last failure in a place named for conflict. In Numbers, Moses again appeared at a rock to purge it once again of water, but this time he failed to follow directions. In a place renamed “argument,” he hit the rock instead of speaking to it, and God punished him by denying him entry into the Promised Land.

In that one word, that act of name-calling, “<i>hamorim,</i>” rebels, Moses summed up years of pent-up frustration, but it was actually he who rebelled at that moment. Since the people routinely complained, there was nothing surprising or unexpected in their dissatisfaction. With that one word, Moses surfaced his feelings about his followers. He had changed to a point where God no longer felt Moses could successfully transition the Israelites to life in their new homeland. Moses lost respect for those he led. Educator Evan Wolkenstein observes that in using the word “rebels” in the text, Moses offered a label to the people that they wasted no time in living up to in the culminating chapters of Numbers. “Moses’ choice to define them according to their behavior has, it seems, only reinforced that behavior.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Evan Wolkenstein, “Dvar Tzedek on Chukkat,” American Jewish World Service website, July 5, 2008, http://ajws.org/what_we_do/education/publications/dvar_tzedek/5768/chukkat.html.</i>",
                "At the moment that Moses labeled his constituents and not only their behavior, he lost what every leader needs to continue at difficult times: the faith and trust in the ultimate goodness of those one leads. For leadership to work, followers must trust their leader and leaders must trust and believe in their followers. If one side falters, the covenantal partnership dissipates. Moses let go of his belief in the goodness of the Israelites and no longer regarded their behavior as an understandable lapse under the extraordinary pressures and challenges of the journey. At that point, he lost his soul, much as his followers lost theirs. Unlike earlier inflamed dialogue, Moses no longer fought God for the sake of the people. He was resigned to them as a fetter is chained to a prisoner. He had enough. There was no longer love or affection or joy.",
                "One of the greatest threats to effective leadership is losing faith in those you lead. The gradual breakdown of trust, the anger, and the disappointment chisel away at a leader’s energy and eventually lead to understandable paralysis. You cannot lead people you do not believe in because soon they will cease believing in you. If you have arrived at this point, you have betrayed your most fundamental role.",
                "Violence is power. Persuasion is influence. Moses needed to influence at this point more than ever. But he failed. He chose violence. He chose to strike rather than to speak: “And the Eternal spoke to Moses and Aaron: ‘Because you believed Me not, to sanctify Me in the eyes of the children of Israel, you will not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them’” (Num. 20:12). Decades of patience collapsed into the word that hit the people and the rod that hit that stone, the stone signifying all that was harsh and unyielding in Moses’ life. The violence of language presaged the violence of action. And when language changes, it is time for a new leader."

You sulked in your tents…. ‘What kind of place are we going to?’” (Deut. 1:26, 28).

All the people that we saw in it are men of great size; we saw the Nephilim there – the Anakites are part of the Nephilim and we looked like grasshoppers to ourselves, and so we must have looked to them.” (Num. 13:27–29, 31–33)</small>",
                "The produce was remarkable, and the land was thick with promise from the standpoint of natural resources. This report offers us the expression “a land of milk and honey.” And yet there were giants who occupied the land who would make it virtually impossible to conquer the land; the agricultural advantages were seemingly meaningless if there was no way to defeat the land’s enemies. Yet Moses was not asking for reviews; he was asking for news. In the middle of this report, Caleb offered his encouragement: “Caleb hushed the people before Moses and said, ‘Let us by all means go up, and we shall gain possession of it, for surely we will overcome it’” (Num. 13:30).",
                "The land they described was one bounded by subjective perceptions. The enemy looked insurmountable, and they saw themselves as defeated. Yet they made one more assumption based on this vision; if they felt small in their own eyes, surely the enemy would <i>see</i> them as insignificant. All of these assumptions were based on what they <i>thought </i>they saw. As a result, they arrived at conclusions that would result in particular actions. They influenced the group to “rail against Moses and Aaron” and decided to renege on the journey: “Let us head back for Egypt.” Caleb did not reject their fears, only their perceptions. He did not deny the size of the enemy but only the perception that the enemy was unconquerable.",
                "And yet, although Caleb silenced the people, as the text reports, he did not deny any aspect of the report. He neither addressed the fears of his fellow spies nor the people’s response to those fears that clearly ripped into the fiber of their once-optimistic cause. By shutting them down instead of gently persuading them, Caleb may inadvertently have caused more damage than good. He berated them instead of strengthening them. Leaders do not always acknowledge the abyss that exists between them and followers when it comes to information, commitment, and the cost of loyalty. If this is a text about the subjectivity of reality, then leaders must recognize the elasticity of subjectivity among followers. Leaders shape perception. They do it best when they understand and can openly address resistance.",

The scouts chose to report information primarily of a military nature. Of the six questions Moses had asked, only two were military in orientation. He also wanted to know about the population generally, the soil, and the level of forestation. These answers were not provided in the narration given. Instead, Moses was told once more of the presence of warring nations in Canaan. By using the terms “Anakites,” “Nephilim,” and “grasshoppers,” they heightened the presence of the other and diminished their own strength. They are giants; we are grasshoppers. Giants can step on grasshoppers and crush them. Anyone can crush a grasshopper. It does not take a giant. Compare this to an upcoming narrative.

Spies are supposed to bring back information, not opinions. Spies are also supposed to be objective in their reporting so that those they report to can make precise decisions about their next moves. In our narrative, neither is the case. This group returns full of opinions based on an exaggerated portrayal of the land’s strengths and weaknesses. The giant fruit and the giant inhabitants strike the reader as a little too giant for a realistic assessment.",
                "But the problem with the spies was far deeper than honest assessments. The problem lies in the very nomenclature used. These leaders were not asked to be spies, nor is the language of spies used at any point in Numbers 13 or 14. A spy in Hebrew is a “<i>meragel</i>.” We have a number of biblical narratives that employ this term, most often in connection with war. Spies are sent to reconnoiter land in order to best strategize a victory and deploy soldiers. Later in Numbers, this term is used in just this way: “So Israel occupied the land of the Amorites. Then Moses sent to spy out Jazer, and they captured its dependencies and dispossessed the Amorites who were there” (Num. 21:31–32).",
                "Numbers 13 uses either a verb or an adjectival clause to describe the activity of the twelve leaders instead of the noun “<i>meragel</i>,” preferring to depict behavior rather than role. The verb used instead is “to scout,” “<i>latur</i>,” as in God’s command to Moses: “The Lord spoke to Moses saying, ‘Send men to scout the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelite people; send one man from each of their ancestral tribes, each one a chieftain among them’” (Num. 13:1–3). The verb “<i>latur</i>” is used precisely in the quartering fashion described above, seeking out the best quarters for the Ark, the heart and epicenter of the Israelite camp. Once the campsite was determined, finding an appropriate place to situate the Ark and its contents was primary and took place several days before the Israelites themselves journeyed. Rashi, citing a midrash, remarks that the strange way this verse is constructed gives the impression that the Ark itself was determining its own resting place, as if the Ark itself was a scout:",

The language could not have been clearer or less ambiguous.",
                "<b>The Real Spies of the Bible</b><br>In the Hebrew Bible, we first encounter spying with Joseph’s wild accusation against his brothers. They came down to Egypt in search of sustenance and approached Joseph, the mastermind behind Egypt’s economic plan at a time of Middle East famine. Outrageously, Joseph accused them of being spies, a claim that he did not substantiate and that they vigorously denied.",
                "<small>Now Joseph was the vizier of the land, and it was he who sold all the people their land. When Joseph’s brothers came and bowed themselves down before him with their faces to the ground, Joseph saw his brothers and he knew who they were, but he made himself alien to them and spoke roughly to them, and he said to them, “Where do you come from?” And they said, “From the land of Canaan to buy food.” And Joseph knew his brothers but they did not know him. And Joseph remembered the dreams that he had about them, and he said to them, “You are spies; you have come to see the nakedness of the land.” “No, my lord, but to buy food have we come. We are all one man’s sons. We are true men; your servants are not spies.” And he said to them, “No, you have come to see the nakedness of the land.” (Gen. 42:6–12)</small>",
                "There is more than a touch of irony in Joseph’s accusation. The text goes out of its way to relate that Joseph knew the identity of his brothers but they had no idea who he was. They bowed and could not see his face. He adopted a harsh tone with them. Exegetes are shocked at the fact that none of the brothers recognized Joseph. Some say that Joseph donned a beard; others say he shaved off his beard. Some say he spoke in Egyptian to them through a translator. His language was different. His clothing was different. But more than anything else, Joseph was not expected to be alive, much less the second-in-command to Pharaoh. It was inconceivable.",
                "On the surface, they seemed to be spies because they came as ten men, an intimidating, rather than pity-inducing, sight. It is for this reason that they insisted that they were all sons of one father. But Joseph pressed on, “You have come to see the nakedness of the land.” This is a peculiar expression implying that they came on some military reconnaissance mission to find out the land’s secrets. But in this passage, the only holder of secrets was Joseph himself. His accusation was more a personal projection than anything else. It was Joseph who hid his identity in the quest to see their emotional nakedness, to test their transparency and to gauge if there had been any changes in this conflicted fraternity. Joseph was the real spy of the story. He used his concealed identity to find out who they really were through a battery of interactions that tested their brotherhood. If they did not pass these tests then Joseph would continue to conceal his identity; if they passed, then there was a chance that Joseph would reveal himself.",
                "This story sets an important context for the national spying in the book of Numbers. All of the Bible’s spy stories should ideally be studied together for the force of their meaning. In the Numbers narrative, the scouting incident was a test <i>about </i>them as much as it was a test <i>for</i> them. But unlike the spying that Joseph did which led to reconciliation, this trial revealed an ugly – though not entirely unanticipated – response from the ancient Israelites. They did not want to go to Israel. The size of the fruit mattered little. The size of the enemy mattered a great deal. Ultimately, they misunderstood the nature of the enemy. The enemy was within. The ironic task of the spy is to lie in order to make others understand – through an intricate web of lies and concealments – what the truth really is, a truth that only the spy can reveal.",
                "The narrative of the spies ends with a reluctant move forward. The people were roundly berated by God, Moses, and Aaron. They were told that their corpses would fall in the wilderness and that the number of days of their scouting mission would parallel the years it would take them to arrive at the Holy Land: forty. “And Moses spoke these words to all the Israelites, and the people mourned deeply” (Num. 14:39). A mission designed to speed up the journey by creating excitement for the end goal turned into yet another punishable offense. The people ambivalently accepted their shame: “Here we are, and we shall go up to the place that the Lord said, for we have offended” (Num. 14:40). There was no passion here, only bowed heads and a reluctant spirit. They charged toward the mountain before them, a last-ditch failed show of atonement, but their leader stayed behind: “And they strove to go up the mountaintop, and the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant, and Moses did not budge from the midst of the camp” (Num. 40:44). Moses stayed put, right beside the object that told his uncompromising story.

In order to reverse this process, God provided a command to train the eyes to follow a different course.

Today, they are not worn on any fourcornered garment, but are usually part of a separate piece of clothing. This detail is critical in the following talmudic story used both to illustrate the power of a single commandment to transform its observer, and as part of a discussion on the practice of adopting one commandment with particular stringency. In the story, a student of R. Hiyya heard about a prostitute some distance from his study hall.

She climbed to the top and lay down naked on the golden bed. Then he too climbed up to sit down opposite her in the nude. At this moment, the four fringes of his garb came and slapped him across the face. At this, he broke away and sat down on the ground. She too came down and sat on the ground. She said to him: “By the capitol of Rome! I shall not let you go until you tell me what blemish you saw in me.” Said he to her: “I swear I have never seen a woman as beautiful as you, but there is a commandment that God commanded us.

We all have moments of association where one thought leads to another. Suddenly, we pause and reflect. We are not always sure how we arrived at our mental destination. The Talmud acknowledges these meanderings by creating a reverse process out of transgression. <i>Tzitzit</i> generate another route, a route out of the mental mess we may have landed in through the random process of association. This trail of the eyes brings us to God. What we initially absorb with our eyes creates impressions that can lead to actions. This being the case, the starting point of vision is critical.

For <i>all</i> the community are holy, <i>all </i>of them, and the Lord is in their midst. Why then do you raise yourselves above the Lord’s congregation?’” (Num. 16:3).",
                "All were holy to the exclusion of none. Korah equated holiness with power. If all were holy, then all were of equal power. This fallacious comparison ended up hurting Korah precisely because, as a Levite, Korah participated directly in the hierarchy of holiness. Korah’s own position of authority as a Levite, however, was not sufficient for him. Consequently, he sought to minimize Moses’ control by positing that neither Moses nor Aaron were given any responsibility that should set them apart from or above any other members of the community.

Not only did Korah want to escalate his status, he also wanted to move outside the Tabernacle’s inner precincts to gain administrative control. Rather than merely ministering to altars and those who used them, Korah made a grab for more authority. Moses threw back to Korah the claims of abdicating communal responsibility for personal gain by questioning Korah’s love of power.",

                "In his wisdom, Moses did not escalate the confrontation by making it personal. Rather, he fell on his face to suggest submission to a higher authority. God would be the ultimate arbiter of justice, determining holiness <i>and</i> power. Moses did not need to review his selection. He made no campaign speeches. No one voted for him. He did not want his position. God singled Moses out against his will and would judge the competition accordingly.

The sincerity of each man was put to the test. One can only imagine hundreds of such small fires in competition with the lone pans of Moses and Aaron. It hardly seems much of a competition. But it served as a clever obfuscation and diffusion of tension.",

After Noah left the ark and offered a sacrifice to thank God for his and his family’s salvation, God took in the smell with satisfaction, which was followed by a revelation:",

So long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night shall not cease.” (Gen. 9:21–22)</small>",
                "The act of smell is immersive; smell can shape emotions and determine reactions. Imagine walking into a room and being overtaken by an awful smell; it is so overpowering that you cannot withstand it and have to leave the room. It influences every thought and impression that you have of the place. Smell is inescapable. The opposite is also true. When you are in a place that is infused with a good smell, like freshly baked bread, it has an almost tranquilizing appeal. A good smell can give the illusion of security and comfort, so seducing are its powers. In Noah’s case, the good smell of a sacrifice was the sign that God required to make a promise that life would return to its normal cycles despite the presence of evil. Evil would persist because of the machinations of human beings, but would not be able to overtake the pleasant and reassuring smells of love, compassion, and forgiveness.",

                "If these individuals had behaved acceptably, they would have died of natural causes, “the common fate of mankind.” But if God decided through this competition of incense that these individuals were guilty, something of great drama awaited.

A mere glimpse of these pans could make a grown man shudder.",
                "It is odd and somewhat disturbing that the altar, the place of sanctification, was corrupted with these instruments of sin and recalcitrance. They should have been thrown away or dropped into the chasm that swallowed Korah and his partners. Gone was the sinner and gone would have been the vessels used to prove Korah’s error of judgment. Instead, the fire pans are twice referred to as holy objects and – as a testament to their holiness – used in the construction of an altar already complete in form. With this addition, the altar’s status changed from a functional object used in worship; it now doubled as a memorial.",
                "Nahmanides was also troubled by the use of a holy object to remind the desert community of sin. He notes that while we are asked numerous times in the Bible to remember an act of evil or pain, this is not the same as incorporating physical reminders of such evil in a sacred place. Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch suggests that the fire pans do not represent Korah’s rebellion as much as Moses’ affirmation of leadership. “They remained dedicated to their original purpose, to prove what the true priesthood is, and, through this lasting decision, they belonged permanently to the most holy purposes of the Sanctuary they themselves became holy.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hirsch, <i>The Pentateuch with Translation and Commentary</i>, 288 (Numbers 17:1–3).</i> In the realm of sacrifices, it is not size or quantity that counts but intent. These two pans – simple metal objects – held the truth of God’s power, and as such, they were the most appropriate building materials for the altar. They were used to confirm the most earnest and sincere commitment to leadership. Sanctity emerges from authenticity, connecting <i>kedusha</i> to <i>emet</i>, holiness to truth.",
                "Korah’s rebellion left its physical and historical mark in a place of continued ritual use. The incorporation of physical pieces of the past on the stage of forgiveness and expiation, thankfulness and devotion, creates a much fuller picture of the altar’s significance. The altar was not merely a place where Israelites offered sacrifices to mark personal events and emotional states; it was a place that offered individuals meaning precisely because it carried the past of an entire nation: the joys, the deep pain, and the tears. Significance is not only attributed to the present acts that take place in sacred places; the sacristy of a place is a function of past history and complexity. That the altar could be a place both small enough to hold the gifts of paupers and large enough to hold the mistakes of past leadership was a tribute to its capacity to “contain multitudes.” In addition, that altar, to be a place of meaning, had to sanctify failure as well as success. Others could weep for forgiveness through its sacrifices because it represented some of ancient Israel’s greatest failures. These failures were not ignored; they were memorialized through a permanent structure. The complicated, hammered past is part of the ongoing present when past evil is blended with the continuing spirit of goodness and optimism.",
                "Korah becomes, in these narratives, the quintessential bad follower. His <i>ad hominem </i>attacks, his confusing criticisms, and his need to rally crowds to add to the drama all demonstrate insecurity fueled by power, the worst kind of challenge to leadership. Looking back to Lencioni, Moses was able to choose trust over invulnerability, conflict over harmony, clarity over certainty, accountability over popularity, and results over status. He knew that his leadership would not be measured by how well he got along with others in this transitional stage of Jewish history, but by whether he was able to forge through contention to get closer to the ancient finish line. And he was willing to sacrifice position and status, if necessary, to achieve his leadership goal, narrow and ambitious as it was.",

                "Other commentators noted the similarity between the early chapters of Genesis and this narrative in Numbers. Ibn Ezra, on the unusual word, “<i>seraphim</i>” or “fiery” to describe the snakes, wrote that this means of punishment was used because, like the complaining Israelites, snakes loosen their tongues to bite. Rabbi Obadiah Sephorno suggests that the parallel is not about the method of punishment, but the price of sin.

How might he have understood that his staff, the tool and symbol of his authority, could turn into a potentially venomous creature with the power to kill him?

                "The snake as a symbol for that which changes and can change others takes on a fascinating symbolic life in Numbers. As a manipulator, the snake turned into something unexpected. Our biblical snake tales fall into the trickster genre of literature; “trickster tales” is a term used by anthropologists and folklorists to refer to narratives about someone who is cunning but also lives by his wits. In the words of Dean Andrew Nicholas in <i>The Trickster Revisited: Deception as a Motif in the Pentateuch</i>, tricksters are often regarded as comical characters, “breaking social boundaries and using deception and trickery to survive.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Dean Andrew Nicholas, <i>The Trickster Revisited: Deception as a Motif in the Pentateuch </i>(New York: Peter Lang, 2009), 9.</i> The trickster character also, ironically, generates optimism for those on the margins of society, those who feel powerless or without access to power structures. He is the one who gives us hope that, despite the present reality, somehow the “bottom rail becomes the top riser.” Nicholas describes the paradox that the trickster is the one who creates “order through chaos, the underdog that overcomes.” He is the one who occupies “the liminal role, and all the dangers associated with it”; he is what, Nicholas says, “personified Israel.” <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nicholas, <i>The Trickster Revisited</i>, 100.</i> Somehow the trickster is the one who is not expected to succeed but does.",
                "This paradox is nowhere more striking than in Numbers where the wounds inflicted by snakes were to be healed by looking at a snake. The problem became the cure. Looking at that which terrified you saved you. God sent snakes to punish the Israelites for disobedience with the animal most associated with disobedience. The serpents were sent in numbers in response to another Israelite complaint, their oft-repeated contention that God and Moses took them out of Egypt to die in the wilderness, as if they were victims of nature rather than protected by God. God, on this particular occasion, decided to show them just how close they were to death, precisely because they did not believe in God as a protector: “The Lord let the serpents go against the people. They bit the people and many of the Israelites died” (Num. 21:6). Some translations of this verse fail to recognize the subtle difference in word choices and render the sentence as “God sent the serpents” instead of God letting them go, as if they were all penned up and ready to strike. Professor Nehama Leibowitz pointed out this discrepancy and explained the divine protection that the Israelites did not sufficiently recognize that brought them to this tragic place:",
                "<small>If the serpents had not bitten them till now, it was only thanks to Divine Providence which had been watching over them, leading them through that great and terrible wilderness and not allowing the serpents to touch them, just as He did not allow the drought to overcome them with thirst but drew then out water from the rock. The children of Israel, however, had spurned the Almighty’s supernatural intervention, not wishing to live in the bread He provided, but aspiring to lead a more normal “natural” existence.

The serpents were there as an immediate and sudden experience of what life would actually have been like had God not been there for them. Dangers were an ever-present wilderness reality. Snakes bite; it’s what they do. The fact that they had not been bitten up until this point was not fully appreciated until the divine force field was lifted, precipitating an urgent and immediate plea for help with the very next verse: “The people came to Moses and said, ‘We sinned by speaking against the Lord and against you. Intercede with the Lord to take the serpents from us,’ and Moses interceded for the people” (Num. 21:7). God suspended nature continuously, but let them experience its indifference to them in this instance because they had become too accustomed to a life of protection. The snake became an apt symbol for the slithering, pernicious sin of ingratitude that wrapped itself around these wanderers, strangling and choking their capacity for appreciation and wonder.",

                "The meaning and value of revulsion has been taken up by a number of philosophers who try to understand its nature.

Because we have a soul, we may deny the fact that we excrete and vomit and bleed. Disgust offers us a subtle boundary between that which we associate with life and that which represents our death and dying.",
                "Revulsion may have an evolutionary benefit in keeping us away from parasites and other contaminants, as it alerts us to the very physicality of all life.",
                "<small>The experience of the emotion, as opposed to those things which commonly induce it, is fairly primal itself: the visceral sense of revulsion, the slight feeling of nausea that unsettles the stomach, the worries about physical contact and contamination, the gaping facial expression that could tip into actual retching.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kelly, <i>Yuck!</i>, 1.</i></small>",

                "In the act of looking at the copper snake, the Israelites were, in effect, holding up a mirror to themselves. And they were disgusted by what they saw. In the wilderness, they had become every association they had with snakes: biting, strangling, duplicitous, and two-faced, believing in God and Moses when they received what they wanted but turning from them the instant their immediate needs were not gratified.

                "<b>Textual Healing</b><br>To understand the oddities of the tale, we turn to an unlikely source, a nineteenth-century German draughtsman, who drew a rendition of the scene that draws us into the primal terror and the appeal of confronting that which scares us. Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld renders Numbers 21 with characteristic drama. There are several people in the foreground who are struggling with violent serpents as the snakes ensnare their legs and arms. These men and women all have their eyes set on snakes unless their faces are bowed to the ground or are contorted with pain. The individuals in the background have arms raised to Moses, who stands majestically, graced with horns of light, and points to a serpent on a stick. This serpent is the source of healing and is larger and thicker than the more evil snakes that slither on the ground.",
                "Schnorr depicts multiple verses in this one biblical rendition: the sin and the punishment. Here, God’s forgiveness comes in the curious guise of another snake that Moses mounted on a pole. This snake was not real, but made of copper, and had a unique healing property. Anyone who looked at it would be cured. This would seem to be the first case of a symbolic antidote. The metaphoric venom of the snake was injected by looking at this figure of a serpent; those suffering from snake bites recovered. It is strange that the same animal that strikes fear in people’s hearts and leads to death would come to be used as a medicinal image, as it is today. It must have been difficult to focus one’s vision on an image so frightening in hope of a cure.",
                "Rabbinic literature contends that when Israel looked upward and served their Father in heaven they were healed, but if not, they were endangered. The Mishna addresses this paradox and resolves it by emphasizing intent: “The snake neither killed nor brought back to life, rather if those bitten were reminded to serve God by looking at the snake, they would remain alive.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishna Pesaĥim 4:9.</i> The Mishna takes a conservative approach to the copper snake’s healing capacity, perhaps because of the dangers inherent in such a powerful object. In II Kings 18:10, we learn that King Hezekiah had to destroy the copper snake because people began to worship it.",
                "There are many objects that have dualistic and contradictory properties. The hand that hits can also be the one that extends itself in friendship. The tongue that hurts can also become an instrument of praise. However, a snake by its nature, and certainly in its biblical associations, is generally not thought of with any redeeming characteristics.",
                "Perhaps there is, hidden in the concentrated and intentioned look of the snake-sufferer, another, more profound level of knowledge. Healing sometimes comes from where we least expect it. Sources of goodness are often concealed in places normally associated with evil or pain. The Israelites needed to face their pain directly. In this act, they not only confronted the instrument of their suffering, they perhaps learned not to make judgments about what might bring salvation. Returning to Schnorr’s illustration, we understand why he chose to merge both the scene of the punishment and that of recovery. As mentioned earlier, the people in the foreground were so distracted by the appearance of snakes that they looked away from the mounted copper snake so close to them in its proximity, the very source of their recovery. They needed only to look up, and they would be saved. But they did not. They focused only on the immediate pain and turned away. It is those in the background whose eyes and even arms are upturned who saw in the snake the cure. Solutions to some of the most pressing problems may be right in front of us, begging us to <i>see them</i>, but if our eyes are closed, they might as well be far from view. The text emphasizes that true healing only comes through open eyes. If acts follow from what we see then passivity can follow from what we do not allow ourselves to see. If there are consequences of action, there are also consequences of inaction.",
                "Looking back at the story as a whole, we see that danger can turn into something you least expect. Power can be used for good. It can turn to evil. Consequences can teach us how to live better by overcoming our mistakes or they can become an endless cycle of repetition from which we can find no relief. Often, it is the leader who can help educate us in the school of life by interpreting potentially transformative moments for personal growth. Moses, for example, held a staff that turned into a snake and back into a staff. He also held a copper snake that brought healing from snake bites that caused revulsion.

Balak sent messengers to the home of Balaam, a notorious leader in the magical arts, to ask him to curse the Israelites and minimize potential peril. With special words, he intended to “defeat them and drive them out of the land.” To that end, Balaam was Balak’s soothsayer of choice: “For I know that he whom you bless is blessed indeed, and he whom you curse is cursed” (Num. 22:6). The incredible talents and powers attributed to Balaam are integral to the story’s unraveling. Balaam, as we soon find out, lacked the requisite power to do anything to offend the Israelites, much less incapacitate their military might. We learn this not through the words of a powerful king or prophet, but through the words of a donkey.",

Balaam finally caved in to the king’s persuasion yet made clear, even as he agreed to the mission, that he was powerless in this instance. He could not change Israelite destiny. Nevertheless, he saddled his donkey. The donkey in the story appears as an incidental prop in the mounting drama.",

When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord, she lay down under Balaam; and Balaam was furious and beat the donkey with his stick.

                "The term “donkey” and other references to it or animals in the same family have been traditionally regarded as a human insult. To compare someone to a donkey implies one is worthy of ridicule. It can signal lewd or ridiculous behavior. It can also imply stubbornness and crassness. The donkey as a beast of burden makes it one of the lowliest animals in the animal kingdom. The snake is the shrewd animal; the donkey, the poor imbecile of an animal. Although common associations with the donkey make this beast into a dumb and foolish creature that could not handle anything more than simple transportation, ancient Jewish tradition regarded the donkey very differently. Its simple station made it the perfect conveyor of innocence and obedience, and not only in the book of Numbers. In Genesis, Jacob’s son Issachar was regarded as a “strong-boned donkey” in the blessings he received from his father. Issachar selected life as a farmer and was bound, as a result, to a life of patience, bowing his head to the burdens of the land and plow (Gen. 49:14–15). Later, in the prophetic work of Zechariah, the savior of the Jewish people is described as someone who will be “lowly and riding upon a donkey, even upon a colt the foal of a donkey” (Zech. 9:9). This notion of the messiah riding a donkey through the gates of Jerusalem and proclaiming a new era of possibility helps sanctify the ordinary. It offers hope to anyone in a low station that the spark of messianic glamour, generally reserved for the erudite or the aristocracy, may be within range. The donkey in this instance symbolizes the superiority of the poor, devoted faithful over the well-positioned elite. The image of the donkey bearing the messiah turns our notions of merit inside-out and upside-down.",
                "This image was not only reserved for swaths of prophetic texts. The image of a donkey bearing the seeds of redemption is also part of the subconscious world of dreams and dream interpretation. In Berakhot, we find the following statement in a list of animals that appear in dreams and hold special and specific meanings: “If one sees a donkey in a dream, he may hope for salvation, as it says, ‘Behold your king comes to you’; he is triumphant and victorious, lowly and riding upon a donkey.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Berakhot 56b.</i> Contrary to expectation, a dream about a donkey is not a sign that the dreamer is absurd or insignificant.

We know that many animals are exquisitely attuned to the weather and changes in climate. Many animals can see farther, are able to hear more acutely, or possess a more sensitive sense of smell than humans. Their sensual universe differs greatly from that of human beings, even when confronting the same set of circumstances. What is invisible becomes highly problematic. Unseen walls obstruct paths forward. Curses become blessings. Ancient seers fail to see anything. Simple donkeys hold the key to advancement and redemption. The story asks us to invert our notions of vision, justice, and merit and suspend our long-held views of those who are simple and unsophisticated.",
                "When we move away from the donkey narrative into Balaam’s prophecies, we find a different man, one filled with wise portents of the future. God filled Balaam’s mouth with words that suggest that no matter who or what stood in Israel’s way, Israel would, in the end, be triumphant. We read of this in Numbers 23:21, “No harm is in sight for Jacob, no woe is in view for them. The Lord their God is with them, and their King’s acclaim in their midst.” No king of flesh and blood could damage their success because Israel was assured divine protection from God. Several medieval commentators understand the expression, “No harm is in sight for Jacob,” as a statement of fact: God saw no wrong in the Israelites, nor did He have cause for concern about their future. Nahmanides translates “harm” and “woe” as different forms of sin and dishonesty that are simply not present in Israel: “No man can see in Jacob nor in any Israelite evil or deception.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nahmanides ad loc. (Numbers 23:21).</i> If God did not see these troubles besetting Israel, then certainly Balaam would not be able to find them and imprecate Israel on this basis.",
                "This cheery picture does not accord with God’s treatment of the children of Israel throughout their desert stay. Jacob’s children often did come to harm. Other commentators, Rashi and his grandson Rashbam among them, do not regard Israel as free of sin. They create a more nuanced view of God’s relationship with the Israelites. When Israel transgresses God’s word, God does not hold them entirely accountable; He overlooks their sins just a bit. This reading is comforting on one level, but disturbing on another. Rashbam follows this line of thinking, saying that God does not want to punish Israel even when they sin. He cites as support a verse from Job, “When He sees iniquity, He does not discern it” (Job 6:30). God turns the other way, trying to give the benefit of the doubt to His erring people. The rose-colored glasses that are used to view Israel’s behavior should be worn, through implication, by Balaam and all others who try to stand in Israel’s way. If God is predisposed to Israel’s goodness, then Balaam should be as well. Balaam, along with various kings and leaders, did not have an insider’s commitment to Israel; he, therefore, would not have felt this bias.",
                "God tried through repeated and ultimately successful attempts to have Balaam see Israel with different eyes. It is no coincidence, then, that the Hebrew Bible emphasizes Balaam’s eyesight several times; finally, he himself claimed that he spoke with the “word of the man whose eye is true” (Num. 24:3). With these eyes, he saw not a people worthy of curses but an encampment, “like palm-groves that stretch out, like gardens beside a river, like aloes planted by the Lord, like cedars beside the water. Their boughs drip with moisture; their roots have abundant water” (Num. 24:6–7). The rich, watery images are a contrast to the way the Israelites saw themselves, in a dry, arid climate stuck with the same dreary food that dried their gullets. God punished the Israelites for not counting their blessings, just as God instructed a foreign prophet to praise them rather than curse them.",
                "The ability to overlook faults cannot be the responsibility or privilege of God alone. The Israelites were not themselves prepared to wear rose-colored glasses. They continually found fault with their freedom, usually emphasizing short-term, immediate problems and losing sight of the long-term ends. Even after God forced Balaam to emit poetic praises of Israel, the Israelites went on to pursue Moabite women and idol worship. The imbalance once again led to dissatisfaction, death, and suffering.",
                "Our two animal narratives in Numbers, the biting snakes and Balaam’s donkey, both illustrate the power of sight to repulse and to edify. The Israelites in both the serpent and Balaam narratives were selective in what they wanted to look at, but eventually were forced to concede that the eyes take in the truth of the matter, despite what the mind or the soul may have wished to see. The animal in one Numbers story represents the lowest human self; the animal in the next sees beyond what any human can.

Leave that view for higher ground and look down on the scene, and the dance floor will look different from the balcony. Leadership demands that we take in both views.

Where the Israelites saw themselves as grasshoppers and believed that others saw them that way too, Balak described them as mighty oxen who lick up the grass.

The people partook of them and worshipped that god. Thus Israel attached itself to Baal-peor, and the Lord was incensed with Israel” (Num. 25:1–3). Peor was Balaam’s last stop, where he blessed the people against his own will, conferring upon them the praise that came from his observation of the way they lived together in their encampment.

And when you take wives from among their daughters for your sons, their daughters will lust after their gods and will cause your sons to lust after their gods” (Ex. 34:15–16). The alienation from the God of the Israelites was to be a gradual and incremental process, prompted simply by the initial invitation to eat that tumbled into greater social involvement and eventually marriage, and ended with Israelite sacrifices to false gods.

                "The Talmud explores the nature of this worship in the most deviant terms: Moabite women seduced the Israelite men and in the moment of passion, took out idols, requiring the men to worship before intercourse.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sanhedrin 106a presents a scenario where Balaam gave the Moabites advice on how to break the Israelites. He told them to install harlots in a market to sell linen garments, which the Israelites were wont to purchase. The women would induce the men to come to their stalls, offer them wine, and seduce them. At the moment that the “evil inclination” took over, the women would remove the idols nestled in their bosoms and demand that the men worship them. The Talmud cleverly makes sure that the Israelite men understood the nature of the crime by having the men retort to the Moabite women, “Am I not a Jew?” a statement that assures that they knew that monotheistic practice was the hallmark of their religious lives. When the women dismissed their concern and said that they would have it no other way, the men gave in to the desire that, the Talmud states, “burned” within them.</i> The idol worship, in this reading, was not genuine. It was an act, perhaps even an insignificant gesture, which licensed the men to envelop the women in the physicality of the moment. This may make the transgressive nature of the sin better or worse, depending on how you view idol worship. That they did it merely to permit pleasure makes their malfeasance more tolerable. Alternatively, that they were willing to abandon the most fundamental relationship they had in the wilderness for a moment of pleasure becomes a stubborn stain on their commitment. The god of Baal-peor was an agricultural god who needed to be propitiated with an act that signaled fertility and abundance. Sexual intercourse led to idol worship which led to fertility; sexual intercourse in this framing was a form of idolatry as a way to ensure fertility. Thus the prophet Hosea, in a later text, was told to mirror the acts of the sinning Israelites by marrying a prostitute and having children with her and then trying to get rid of her. Even though Hosea could not be assured that the children were his, his feelings for his wife got in the way of an easy disposal, mimicking the anguish that God experienced when the Israelites sinned. The prostitute in question was not simply any woman who sold her body, but a temple prostitute who aided idol worship by offering her body in copulation. As the Israelites neared their homeland, a new set of desires put fertility and sexuality together in a seductive and hard-to-resist cocktail.",

Perhaps the Talmud was positing something that Freud understood: human beings are not revolted by their own excrement, only that of others. They often regard it, curiously, as some kind of creative act of wonder. Freud wrote in <i>Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality</i> that “defecation affords the first occasion on which the child must decide between a narcissistic and an object-loving attitude.

In God’s anger, He told Moses to impale the ringleaders for these crimes of passion in a public setting. This punishment is in keeping with the general biblical measure-for-measure approach to punishment; crimes that are public are punished publically, stressing deterrence. Extreme crimes are met with extreme punishments. Crimes of acute physicality are met with physically brutal and visually terrifying punishments. Crimes permitted or unaddressed by leaders induce punishments directed at those very leaders. Moses addressed the leadership, telling them each to slay the men within their tribes who committed these offenses. R. Joshua in the Talmud believed that the leaders were told to fight these crimes directly as a statement about their failure to lead with the necessary strength of character or passionate commitment. Having been required to execute and enforce the punishment, they were being blamed on some level for not stopping the crimes in the first place.

The companions may have been a reference to his kinsmen. Whereas until this point, the sexual permissiveness of the Israelites existed at the edges, away from the center of the camp, this act brought it right in front of the Tent of Meeting, at its threshold.

The Israelites in this view may not have had a chance to protest by the time they understood what was happening, something Pinhas may have seen earlier than others since he was, according to I Chronicles, a chief of the guards who protected the Tent of Meeting (I Chr. 9:20). Stationed in a position of authority at the portal to the Tent of Meeting and perhaps armed, he was the most likely person to take an active role in stopping the damage.",
                "Perhaps the sexual reading of the text must give way to a more linguistically convincing interpretation, one that is more nuanced, but contextually more sound. If the woman being brought to the kinsmen of the Israelite man was merely making the acquaintance of family, then the earlier sin of intercourse was being stabilized into intermarriage, a much more harmful outcome for the long-term health of the community. It is one thing to sow one’s oats with foreign women in a moment of moral lapse. It is another matter altogether to bring such a woman home to meet the family. An Israelite who brings an idol-worshipper to the Tent of Meeting was uniting two separate and distinct worlds that were meant to be oppositional. In this scenario, it is easier to understand the silence and acquiescence of the audience. A defiant sexual act may be stopped by bystanders. A family meet-and-greet would hardly warrant such a violent response. What was everyone to do? Why did the people not close in on his brazenness, stopping the act? Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch, in commenting on the Israelites passively watching this scene in tears, observes that, “the sight was so overwhelmingly painful that they had no strength or thought for virile action.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hirsch, <i>The Pentateuch with Translation and Commentary</i>, 430 (Numbers 25:6).</i> Others blame their passivity on the fact that there was so much complicity in Shittim that no one could herald righteousness publically without being labeled a hypocrite. The fact that this particular Israelite crossed an invisible boundary of acceptability mattered less than the breaking of communal boundedness generally.",
                "This same reasoning is offered in a passage of <i>Aggada</i> that focuses on why Moses did not intervene. The Israelite had taken a Midianite, not a Moabite woman. Moses was married to a Midianite. Who was he to stop them, if hypocrisy was the currency of the moment? Moses, in response to this accusation, fainted from the disturbance, rendering him impotent to stop the crime. Even without resorting to the midrash’s irony, since Moses hardly took his Midianite wife into the camp’s center for public exposure, Moses’ inability to act is hard to digest.",
                "We have other occasions where Moses did not take center stage when leadership was needed. In Exodus 14, at the cusp of the sea and with Egyptian chariots gaining speed behind them, Moses adjured the Israelites to watch God fight their war. “Have no fear! Stand by and witness the deliverance which the Lord will work for you today; for the Egyptians whom you see today you will never see again. The Lord will battle for you; you hold your peace” (Ex. 14:13–14). The verbs in the verses are all static, passive. God turned to Moses and instructed him to go forward; this was not to be God’s war alone. Later in Numbers 14:5 and 16:4, Moses again failed to understand when to put himself at the center to quell the trouble and when to stay still. In the case at hand, very possibly, there was little time to do anything, as the explosion at the camp’s periphery encroached the center. Rather than view Moses’ failure to act as a condemnation, the text may have chosen to highlight Pinhas’ zeal, encouraging other leaders to step up their responsibility for problems in the camp. Moses could not shoulder the moral burden alone. Pinhas’ forward lurch may have been a welcome respite. Moses may have hit a rock, but this was the extent of his violence.

Unfortunately, that clarity is rare because of the complexity of most moral dilemmas.

He posits that there are generally three moral rubrics that seem to represent universal moral norms: <i>autonomy</i>, the moral belief that we must protect the rights of individuals to make choices and protect them from harm; <i>community</i>, the norms that guide our interactions with others around issues of fairness, duty, loyalty, and respect; and <i>divinity</i>, the idea that God exists in the world and, therefore, touches all things with divinity. To protect this divinity, we create moral norms that protect the spirit from degradation and contamination. We valorize purity.",
                "The Pinhas narrative seems to hinge on all three of these moral arenas. The man who approached the Tent of Meeting with a Midianite woman was trying to showcase his <i>autonomy</i>; his behavior was his personal choice. Pinhas was trying to protect the<i> community</i> out of a sense of loyalty and respect for the norms and boundaries that exist within group frameworks. He protected <i>divinity</i> in that he saw, as a guard of the Tent of Meeting, that this brazen act diminished God’s presence by mocking the sanctity of holy space. The Israelite leader who sinned made a choice when it came to location, engaging in his nefarious behavior in a place associated with <i>kedusha</i>, holiness, and a strict set of regulations.",
                "<b>Leadership and Priority-setting</b><br>We see this narrative as primarily about violence, but when reshaped, it becomes a story about loyalties and the conflict of allegiances. “Recognizing how you have prioritized your loyalties is an essential step in exercising adaptive leadership. You will then begin to be able to identify which of those loyalties are holding you, inhibiting your leadership, rather than you holding them.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heifetz and Linsky, <i>Practice of Adaptive Leadership</i>, 189.</i> Every leader must examine with microscopic care what his or her loyalties are and how they shape personal judgments and actions. “Typically, the loyalties you have that are getting in the way of the goals you are trying to accomplish are not ones you tell everyone about…. We think of them as unspeakable loyalties; they are just as powerful as the people and values you talk about all the time, but not as apparent.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Heifetz and Linsky, <i>Practice of Adaptive Leadership</i>, 192.</i> Quiet allegiances are often stronger than those that are loudly articulated. When put under pressure, those quiet allegiances may burst forth with exuberance or violence, forcing everyone around the leader to question priorities.",
                "Pinhas had no doubt about what he stood for, and he exerted his allegiances in a crowd of people who were muddled about theirs. Drawn by the magnet of idol worship, the Israelites of Numbers had no idea what to think of a leader who disobeyed God right in front of them at the Tent of Meeting. They stood by and cried. Moses, too, stood in shock. In an oft-neglected detail of Moses’ burial, we find that not only was Moses buried on the opposite side of the Jordan River, he was moved down from the majestic view of Mount Nebo to a dark valley in the land of Moab. God, it says in Deuteronomy 34, “buried him in the valley in the land of Moab near Beth-peor; and no one knows his burial place to this day” (Deut. 34:6). Moses spent his eternal life paying the price for a leadership mistake in view of the spot where he did not act.",
                "Urgent situations sometimes summon dormant passions or unexpected heroic responses. Sometimes people spend a lifetime preparing for a leadership moment of short duration. Sometimes people become leaders in an unexpected moment of action. Passion cannot be mustered artificially. It is subjective and consuming. The immediacy of an unanswered dilemma can bring out passion in the least assuming contenders for leadership. What matters will be all of the subsequent moments of quiet that test whether leadership was just a temporary stint or an enduring commitment."

                "As the book of Numbers winds to a close, something changed which enabled Moses to recoup his control and offer the Israelites his farewell exhortations, his advice and legal guidance for life in a homeland, and his plea for an able successor. He reestablished trust with the people by questioning their requests, acquiescing when able, and securing commitment through a reassessment of the power of language. Where language served as a mechanism of violence and diminishment in the midsection of Numbers, it transforms into a discussion of oaths by the book’s end. The Israelites used the language of need, greed, and impulse as followers. After Mosaic leadership broke down, it was slowly rebuilt with a different two-way understanding. Moses offered a hand of reconciliation and validation by allowing a few tribes to stay on the other side of the Jordan, an immediate need of self-interest, but one that would ultimately have long-term collective benefits. And the discussion of oaths cemented an understanding that words have consequences and must be taken seriously. Flexibility, accountability, and perspective all melded into the reestablishment of trust. Trust allowed then and allows now a renewed commitment to a shared picture of a collective future."

                "Washington connected language with personal integrity, and we find myriad examples of this connection in biblical leadership. In one of the most poignant uses of the reflective tense in prophetic literature, Samuel’s early achievements are characterized as a word victory: “Samuel grew up and the Lord was with him; he did not leave any of Samuel’s predictions unfulfilled” (I Sam. 3:19). The Hebrew captures the language equation, “<i>velo hipil mikol devarav artza</i>.” This literally means that none of his words were allowed to fall to the ground. The image of words falling is pregnant with a sense of buoyancy. Words once allowed in the hands of a flawed leader to fall on the ground and shatter were now picked up and polished, nurtured and raised high. The word has thing-ness in this verse; the Hebrew “<i>devar</i>” communicates both word and thing. Yet the translation fails to capture a textual ambiguity that makes the Hebrew expression more potent as an expression of leadership triumph. It is unclear whose words were not allowed to fall to the ground. God may not have allowed any of Samuel’s words to fall to the ground, ensuring that his predictions and statements had heft and veracity. Alternatively, Samuel may have done the same for God’s words, making sure that he made good on all that God demanded. Every speech act, every command and revelation, was met with action. And yet another translation may have Samuel fulfilling the words of his constituents. Hearing their needs and their requests, he did his utmost to make their words a reality. Although the previous pronoun in the verse would indicate that Samuel made good on God’s word, the lovely ambiguity teases the reader to contemplate what contributes to a leader’s success in the most expansive sense.",
                "In the first chapter of Joshua, the people showed their newly minted leader their support with repeated words of encouragement. Joshua told them that he would follow in the footsteps of Moses’ loyalty. They in turn replied with a Sinai-like commitment to all of Joshua’s future demands:",

Only be strong and resolute!” (Josh. 1:16–18)</small>",
                "In pledging their allegiance to Joshua, the Israelites looked back and summed up their relationship with Moses as one of wholehearted fealty. We look at these words in wonder, searching in vain for even a single verse that communicates their obedience to Moses’ words in his lifetime. They never offered this kind of verbal support to Moses; of course, it is easier to lead when you take someone <i>into</i> the Promised Land than when you spend forty years trying to get them there.",
                "Words in the mouths of leaders and followers have a dark side in the Bible as well; littered across its pages are many words of deception and recrimination. We open Genesis with the snake lying to Eve, and Eve lying to Adam. Later, Jacob’s stilted conversation with his father when he dressed as his brother to steal the blessing pains the reader with its manipulation: “I am Esau, your first-born” (Gen. 27:19). Isaac did not immediately accept this self-identification: “The voice is the voice of Jacob, yet the hands are the hands of Esau…. Are you really my son Esau?” (Gen. 27:22, 24). At this juncture, Jacob could have raised his hands in self-disgust and confessed. Instead he hammered the lie in deeper. “I am.” Still later in Genesis, Jacob tasted the impact of lies in bitter recriminations. Joseph’s brothers turned up at Jacob’s door with a coat dipped in animal blood, asking the not-so-innocent question: “We found this. Please examine it; is it your son’s tunic or not?” (Gen. 37:33). They knew exactly whose coat it was, but they let an object tell their lie; a gift of love came back to Jacob as a prop of deception. His sons wounded their father with words in stabbing convulsions of loss.",
                "<b>Keeping the Word</b><br>Moving from ancient texts to ancient rituals, we integrate the seriousness of words in the Bible with our own practice. One of the most solemn prayers in the Jewish liturgical year is <i>Kol Nidrei</i>, the Yom Kippur service that ushers in the anxiety of judgment and atonement. The words, far from being spiritually uplifting, are technical expressions to cover any possible infraction in swearing, vowing, or committing oneself to a behavior that one simply cannot keep. The language of this contract/prayer attempts to capture every nuance of being bound by words. Several talmudic tractates are devoted to the subject of oaths, and every Yom Kippur, this talmudic language makes its way into our prayers, ensuring that oaths we have not fulfilled during the course of the year will be nullified as the dust of the earth. Far from English writer Samuel Butler’s observation, “Oaths are but words, and words but wind,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Samuel Butler, <i>Hudibras</i>, pt. II [1664], canto II, 1.107.</i> Jewish tradition regards words as the precipitants of actions, much as they were the building blocks of God’s creation of the world in Genesis. Thus, we enter the holiest day of the year, a state of forgiveness, by recalling personal failings or weaknesses that have kept us from our word.",
                "This ritual, haunting in its melody, raises the question of why we need to take oaths at all. If it is such a serious breach of character to break a vow, then we would do best to keep free of oaths altogether. Yet something compels us to make these word commitments again and again in a fit of irrational exuberance, reaching for a best self in a moment of optimism.",
                "Numbers 30 opens with an entire chapter devoted to the making and breaking of oaths. Strangely, this chapter appears at the closing of Numbers, right before the listing of the sites that the Israelites encountered on their way to the Promised Land. Why it is a necessary literary departure from the narrative may best be understood after looking at the legal boundaries placed on oaths in the first place. The chapter begins with the most typical breech: “If a man vows a vow to the Lord, or swears an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word, he shall do all that proceeds out of his mouth” (Num. 30:3). In the words of one medieval writer, this command is an attempt to coalesce the heart and the mouth. Words uttered are worlds created.",
                "There is a built-in presumption that words in Jewish tradition are not just exhalation accompanied by noise, gusts of air without weight. Rather, they are expressions of profound obligation. One of the most significant biblical acts is the making and sustaining of a covenant. An agreement is a sacred act of responsibility and should not be taken lightly. When words are not treated seriously, tragedy can result, as Bible scholar Daniel Friedmann observes:",
                "<small>A society in which deceit and breach of promise are tolerated and even encouraged must inevitably face functional difficulties and be prone to disintegration. When people cannot rely on the word of their associates, they must behave in similar fashion. They will avoid paying today for future goods and will not assist their allies for fear that they will not be repaid in a similar way. It therefore becomes necessary to find a mechanism that negates the usual exemption from truth telling and breach of promise, one in which a promise given can be relied upon. Such a mechanism did exist in the biblical world and in the ancient world. This was the system of oath and vow.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Daniel Friedmann, <i>To Kill and Take Possession: Law, Morality, and Society in Biblical Stories </i>(Peabody, MA: Hendrickson Publishers, 2002), 66–67.</i></small>",

Is God not bound by his own oath?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus Rabba 43:3.</i> Harold Schulweis, in his book <i>Conscience: The Duty to Obey and the Duty to Disobey</i>, quotes the conclusion of this midrash: “I cannot retract an oath which has proceeded from My mouth.” Moses then appealed to God’s own laws: “Did You, God, not give me the power of annulment of oaths by saying, ‘When a man vows a vow to the Lord or swears an oath to bind his soul, he himself cannot break his word’ (Num. 30:3), yet a scholar may absolve his vows if he consults him?” Moses wrapped himself in his cloak in the manner of a sage, while God stood before him asking for an annulment of the divine vow. God said his own <i>Kol Nidrei</i>. Moses asked God, “Do you now regret Your vow?” and God replied, “I regret now the evil which I said I would do to my people.” Hearing God’s response, Moses ruled: “Be it absolved for You. There is neither vow nor oath any longer.” In Schulweis’s words, God was liberated by Moses’ use of God’s law.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Harold Schulweis, <i>Conscience: The Duty to Obey and the Duty to Disobey</i> (Woodstock, VT: Jewish Lights, 2008), 14–15.</i> In the wilderness, when words were thrown into desert winds, God created a way back, a way out of language.",
                "<b>Promises, Promises</b><br>To illustrate how foolhardy oath-making can be, the Bible presents us the example of Jephthah and his daughter, one of its most tragic narratives. The oath makes little sense without the context in which it was made. In Judges 11, the chieftain Jephthah was subject to immense insecurity, as he prepared for a war he was unsure he would win. This insecurity was not only born of national worries; it resided within Jephthah himself. Jephthah is introduced as an outsider, the child of an able warrior and a prostitute. Unable to inherit as his half-brothers, he left his father’s house and joined a group of ill repute: “Men of low character gathered about Jephthah and went out raiding with him” (Judges 11:3). Jephthah rose to the lowest expectation that his shaky birth precipitated. Jephthah’s exploits, however, made him a good candidate to lead the Israelites into war against the threatening Ammonites. The very brothers who had once spurned him suddenly sought out his leadership.",
                "However spurned he had been within his family and social circles, he demonstrated his unquestionable talents in the military arena. The biblical narrative presents his attempt to negotiate with his enemies and then his capacity for victory when his enemies refused to capitulate. Thus did Jephthah try to secure safe passage to the Israelite homeland through neighboring countries. But then he met an enemy that shook his budding confidence to its core: the king of the Ammonites. Despite pleading national innocence with the king of the Ammonites, Jephthah prepared for the inevitability of war. Nevertheless, the king “paid no heed to the message that Jephthah had sent” (Judges 11:28).",
                "On impulse, Jephthah made an oath that if God made him victorious in battle against Ammon, he would offer up to God, “whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace” (Judges 11:31). What greeted him at the door, painfully, was his own flesh and blood; his daughter welcomed him home with timbrels and dancing. The musical approach only heightened the drama of disappointment. The celebration was short-lived. Jephthah said to the daughter who thrilled in her father’s success: “Alas daughter, you have brought me low. You have become my troubler. For I have uttered a vow to the Lord and I cannot retract” (Judges 11:35).",
                "Jephthah told her that she was the cause of his problems. In reality, however, <i>he</i> was the cause of his own troubles <i>and </i>hers. He understood the price of foolish words only when it was too late to revoke his oath. Listening to the last days of Jephthah’s daughter, we are filled with the father’s poor judgment and the cost to the daughter: “she was an only child. He had no other son or daughter” (Judges 11:34).",
                "<small>“Alas daughter, you have brought me low. You have become my troubler. For I have uttered a vow to the Lord and I cannot retract.” “Father,” she said, “You have uttered a vow to the Lord; do to me as you have vowed, seeing as the Lord has vindicated you from your enemies, the Ammonites.” She further said to her father, “Let this be done for me. Let me be for two months and I will go with my companions and lament upon the hills and there bewail my maidenhood.” “Go,” he replied…. After two months’ time, she returned to her father and he did to her as he had vowed. She had never known a man. So it became a custom in Israel for the maidens of Israel to go every year, for four days in the year, and chant dirges for the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite. (Judges 11:36–40)</small>",
                "Much scholarship has been written about this unusual daughter and her request as well as whether her father had the gumption to go ahead with his promise. After all, no time frame is referenced in the promise; why not give her two months or even longer to enjoy her adolescence since she will never know adult life? The promise is the subject of communal awareness, long past its utterance. A custom developed to mourn her young life in the hills where she bewailed her virginity. She cried for a life not yet lived and those after her mourned the potential that never became actualized as a result of an oath. The bewailing of her virginity was another way to stab further into her father’s heart, since she was unable to experience adulthood and its pleasures. In offering us this small glimpse of family heartbreak, the Bible confirms that war victories are celebrated long after they are fought and won, and war losses are also measured long after wars are lost and won, through those walking the streets without limbs or bereft of sons and fathers. Jephthah fought this war to regain entrance into a family of half-brothers who had spurned him. He ended up sacrificing his daughter, the one person who truly loved and accepted him, for the unsure set of relationships previously denied him as a prostitute’s son. He won the war but carried forever a broken heart. It was a Pyrrhic victory, to be sure.",
                "What motivated Jephthah’s utterance? Did he not realize his oath might exact a steep price for victory? Surely he did not think that only small animals and poultry crossed his threshold. He must have considered the likely possibility that it would be a member of his own family, happily greeting his return from war.",
                "Perhaps not. Maybe he believed he could not be victorious and was bound to lose, making his vow irrelevant. Alternatively, in a time of crisis and desperation he may have believed that he <i>would be</i> willing to pay almost any price to resolve this problem, one that was potentially life-threatening. In the midst of financial difficulty, family breakup, or professional failure, we all find ourselves willing to try anything or say anything to experience relief. A person with a fatal illness might turn to alternative medicine when traditional medicine fails; when alternative medicine fails, that person might turn to unconventional methods. When all fails, he or she might turn to magic, using an implausible method to achieve an implausible result.",
                "With the word traps of oath-making and oath-taking, it would make more sense to commit ourselves in deed than in word to a desired outcome. To achieve a good test score or lose a certain amount of weight, a promise is not an outcome. It is only a method, and a shaky one at that, of attaining an outcome. Somehow, the words seem to secure for us a greater emotional commitment. Their mere expression anchors us in the realm of possibility. If I take an oath, then surely I will study or I will put back that pint of ice cream without tasting even a spoonful. But because we know the emptiness of words, we just might find ourselves saying that we’ll study a little later or start the diet tomorrow. If we attach God to these words, however, and a verbal structure of enforcement, then it will add heft to our promises, weight to our words. God becomes the divine police squad and enforcer. That is what the oath-maker hopes for, that the vow will offer the discipline that may not come naturally. Discipline is not a function of word, but of deed. We take oaths because we do not trust ourselves to be true to our deepest wishes.",
                "Numbers offers us a warning that other narratives illustrate: watch yourself if you think, especially in a moment of folly, that words are meaningless and can be swallowed back as quickly as they are uttered. They are not silly promises or motivational slogans. Anyone who needs such motivation should not look to words but to actions to inspire. Promises are a language of commitment and a language that, like any other, needs to be carefully learned and used sparingly for maximum effect. Failure to do so can have consequences that may seem unbearable.",
                "<b>Language and the Book of Numbers</b><br>We may have a clear understanding of the folly of vows, but not understand why the end of Numbers, of all places, contains the passages relevant to their disavowal. Perhaps in this period of Israelite insecurity, with the dozens of locations where Israel encamped in forty years recorded, we find another casualty of the journey. People in desperate straits, those for whom there is no end in sight, often say things that have unintended consequences. In a time of impermanence, words bear a message of eternity. In the desert, words had meaning and somehow stayed fixed and permanent, even while the camp moved from place to place. In this spirit, the Israelites were told about the harsh consequences of unsatisfied oaths. If you have the discipline to change, then operate on that discipline alone. If not, making an oath will not force you to keep it. It will just imprison you. The words will become fetters, created out of good intention, but met with unexpected realities. There are many prices to be paid for travel. The misspent word is surely one of them.",
                "The book of Numbers closes not with another narrative of dissent, but with a legal excursive on language. Because words build and destroy, words in the mouths of leaders can raise people or diminish people. It is hard to believe that a string of vowels and consonants can have this kind of impact, but words always do. When we think of the famous words emitted by leaders that get chiseled into stone on their monuments, we understand that words can inspire and change a culture. They can transform the way that we look at a problem and shift assumptions. “If you will it, it is no dream” sits side by side with “I have a dream” and “You see things; and you say ‘Why?’ But I dream things that never were; and I say ‘Why not?’” For the ancient Israelites, language was a problem because they used very few words to describe their conditions of suffering. They returned again and again to the same complaints and themes without articulating many of the problems that lay beneath the surface of thirst and hunger. Oaths present a similar dilemma; they mask the real problem by creating a language wall between what is and what may naively be if all promises are kept. Under every oath is an unnamed human struggle.",

                "Susan Scott in <i>Fierce Conversations </i>surfaces what gets in the way of language that is clear and unambiguous. She believes that many people do not have difficult conversations because they either minimize the message for fear of being too direct or use language that is overly judgmental or harsh because they do not know how to use language effectively to achieve certain desired ends. She includes the use of delaying tactics or avoidance to avert being confrontational. The boss calls in a subordinate to tell him that his job is at risk and begins the conversation with, “How’s it going?” rather than stating why the person has been called in and what the message is that must be delivered. Scott calls the method of softening messages by the use of excessive compliments and distractions, “too many pillows.” People cannot understand what message is being delivered because it is lost in a morass of other messages in this indirect form of communication. Scott also does not favor a popular method of improvement, messaging in the world of supervision, the “Oreo cookie” or the “buttered sandwich.” The message that is difficult to digest is sandwiched between two compliments. What this does, Scott claims, is diminish the potency of the message, while offering compliments that are not heard because those listening are stuck on the bad news that they know will soon be deposited at their doorstep. Compliments should remain compliments. Criticisms should remain criticisms. Scott also advises avoiding a scripted message, where we overplay what someone else will say and thereby fail to listen and fail to say what we need to because we “know” the response ahead of time. We never know how someone will respond, even if we’ve been down this road many times. It prevents us from engaging in genuine dialogue, in both talking and listening with sincerity.",

This military incursion is regarded as Moses’ leadership swan song: “Avenge the Israelite people on the Midianites; then you shall be gathered to your kin” (Num. 31:1). Having not been at the forefront of attack in the Zimri and Kozbi affair (Num. 25:6–9), Moses was allowed another chance to redeem himself fighting the Midianites as a legacy before he died.

When we think of innovation, we generally are not referring to small, incremental changes but to larger paradigm shifts that impact the way that we think or behave. These may be based on a desire for convenience, safety, efficiency, comfort, or all of the above. Innovation allows us to do things faster, better, or bigger than we did before.

The tribes found themselves, as a result of the military skirmishes in Numbers 31, in happy possession of much cattle; this lucky windfall slowed their pace. It also created additional responsibilities of stewardship, accompanied by the belief that this could be best accomplished elsewhere. Moses could have pointed out the spiritual lapse in the possible exchange of a divine map to freedom for a lot of cows. It hardly seems an even deal. He could have also pointed out that these tribes were given an unexpected bonus that they were free to benefit from, but not at the expense of a larger promise.

Moses pushed for mile after mile through material promises to inspire progress. Sometimes such inducements work. Often they do not. They can become robotic and Pavlovian. They can lead to short-term thinking and compromise long-term objectives, as they so often did in the book of Numbers. At times, they can inspire unethical behavior in the battle for satiation. They break down collaboration when the promise of rewards becomes competitive. Pink encourages a different force, what he calls “Motivation 2.1.” Intrinsic motivation, in contrast with the extrinsic motivation that peppers Numbers, is tied up with the desire for autonomy, mastery, and purpose. People want to be led, but they also want independence. They want their future to be self-determined by a purposeful existence where they utilize their talents and gain mastery.",
                "All of this requires a very high level of trust in one’s followers, a trust that is hard to find and more difficult to earn if it has been compromised on previous occasions. Turn to the Moses narratives and trust seems to be the commodity most often sacrificed in a relationship that advanced and regressed in painful cycles. At the end of Exodus 14, after the Egyptian pursuit of the Israelites ended in a split-sea drowning, the chapter closes unexpectedly: “And when Israel saw the wondrous power which the Lord had wielded against the Egyptians, the people feared the Lord; they had faith in the Lord and his servant Moses” (Ex. 14:31). The Israelites experienced the plagues as constant miracles, prompting further commitment and allegedly creating trust. But the trust was not complete, as evidenced by the need to cap the splitting of the sea experience with a statement that the people had faith in God and Moses. It leads the reader to wonder if they did not have trust before in their agents of salvation. They clearly experienced a different type of faith, a faith of greater intensity, than they had felt before. Perhaps trust, consequently, is more malleable than we assume. Most people believe that trust is an enduring and static condition shared between or among people. But these narratives help us understand that faith can be earned quickly and also lost quickly, sometimes with greater speed than we may feel comfortable confessing.",

He was suspicious, as we might expect, since he had been on a long journey and recognized behaviors that did not accord with a larger, master plan. The tribes, for their part, perhaps did not believe that Moses would ever acquiesce to a plan that would segment the tribes and, in effect, segment the nation. Moses then named the assumptions of low trust, testing if they were relevant and true. The two-and-a-half tribes who made the request clarified their position. Some caveats to the plan were created, resulting in a high-trust conclusion to the chapter. As an unintended consequence of a development no one could have predicted almost forty years earlier, the tribes on the other side of the Jordan renamed the cities around them, making them part of Greater Israel and extending the sphere of Israelite influence and domination.",

                "This was not the last time that these tribes would play the trust card and challenge convention. In the same chapter of Joshua, this very same cluster of tribes engaged in a peculiar behavior that was again identified, named, and reported to the Israelites soon after the troops had returned home. They had constructed an altar on the other side of the Jordan, an act strictly prohibited by law since all sacrifices were to take place in Jerusalem at one holy center. There was outrage. The Israelites gathered together at Shiloh “to make war on them” (Josh. 22:12). Not long after Joshua’s commendation and blessing, the tables had turned with frightening speed, the speed of trust lost. Before waging war, the Israelites sent a priest and representatives of the tribes to confront their wayward brothers with a question: “What is this treachery that you have committed this day against the God of Israel, turning away from the Lord, building yourself an altar and rebelling this day against the Lord!” (Josh. 22:16–17). But they did not only limit the ramifications of the offense to their brethren. If they were indeed still one unit as a people, they reckoned that this crime would have repercussions for them all: “If you rebel against the Lord today, tomorrow He will be angry with the whole community of Israel” (Josh. 22:18). Once again, assumptions were made about their motivation; their detractors believed that they had moved into a defiled land that was taking its spiritual toll on them. They begged them to cross over to spiritual safety, and they wrapped up their diatribe with a cautionary tale. When God punished Achan and his family not long before for breaking the law, Joshua reminded these tribes, who were transgressing a direct commandment of the Lord, that all of the Israelites had suffered: “he was not the only one who perished for that sin” (Josh. 22:20).",
                "The two-and-a-half tribes cried out in anguish that they had once again been misunderstood. In actual fact, they had built an altar not to offer upon it sacrifices, defying divine mandate, but to be a “witness” for their children that this was an aspect of life that they had denied themselves by living on the other side of the Jordan. They wanted their children to see what an altar looked like and to understand the language of sacrifice even if it was not one they were able to practice. The Israelites, in hearing this, were relieved that this altar was only for educational purposes. With trust regained, they returned home to offer their report. They praised God and “spoke no more of going to war against them” (Josh. 22:33). And then, in the chapter’s close, they named the altar “witness,” to signify a return to solidarity: “It is a witness between us and them that the Lord is our God” (Josh. 22:34).",

Miriam, Aaron, and Moses never got the satisfaction of entering the land, and we cannot help but empathize with their unrequited yearning. They met their deaths on the way. Even the hero died. Moses and company were not spared the fate of all mortals. Their deaths in relatively close sequence indicated to the Israelites that along with the new terrain, they had to transition to new leadership. One of the most striking aspects of the demise of all three is that their deaths mimicked, stylistically and substantively, the lives they respectively led. This technique proves to be a very powerful comment on their personal histories. By reading between the lines of each death scene, we come closer to understanding the contribution of this famous sibling triumvirate. We also understand the hole that losing a leader creates in those who follow.",
                "<b>Miriam in Life and Death </b><br>Miriam’s death appears as the main narrative portions of Numbers wind to a close: “And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first of the month; and the people stayed in Kadesh. Miriam died there and was buried there. The community was without water, and they joined against Moses and against Aaron” (Num. 20:1). We are disturbed by the paucity of words, the absence of eventfulness surrounding Miriam’s death and burial. There was no announcement of death as there was in the narratives on Aaron’s and Moses’ passing; there is no comment on the loss. Public mourning is not recorded, only the aggravated complaining of a congregation once again in need. One well-known midrash links verses 1 and 2 artificially by suggesting that the well and water that Israel received while in the desert came in Miriam’s merit and that, with her death, they were taken away. Without her, the children of Israel were thirsty.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sifrei on Deuteronomy, 205.</i> Yet, there is no recognition in the narrative itself that the people suffered this loss of provision with any awareness of its supposed source. They expressed no sadness. Instead, we are aghast at the self-centeredness of the collective in the face of personal and national tragedy. Another midrash surprises us with its interpretation of events. According to one reading, Moses and Aaron were busy mourning the loss of their beloved sister and were so grief-stricken that when the Israelites appeared at the tent door and realized the news, they backed away. It was at this point that God condemned the brothers: “Public servants, leave here immediately. My children are ravished with thirst and you mourn over an old woman?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> I:563.</i> Rather than admit any indiscretion on the part of the Israelites, God condemned Moses and Aaron for neglecting their communal responsibilities in favor of private despair.",
                "This midrash, like the text, shows little pity for the loss, and, in fact, compounds our surprise at the text’s dismissiveness. We the readers feel the death of Miriam as a great communal loss. How could those experiencing it not feel it? How could they be so selfish? The initial harshness, however, softens when the matter is framed as a leadership dilemma; communal needs take precedence in a time of crisis over the leader’s personal suffering. It is hard to mourn one death when death becomes a collective shadow over an entire people wasting away from thirst. Even so, they could have paused for a few moments in such a long trek and given Miriam the burial she merited as a faithful servant to the Israelites, a protective sister, an obedient daughter. She did not deserve a death of ignominy. Nor did this neglect teach the Israelites the dignity of leadership, if the death of even one leader was virtually ignored.",
                "If we apply the literary reading of biblical deaths, namely that they often mirror the qualities of a life, then it is easier to unlock the mystery of their deaths. Miriam’s past history sheds light on her demise. Every biblical mention of her name appears curtailed. She is only allotted one verse in her introduction, Exodus 2:4, where she had no name, only a relationship to her younger brother: “And <i>his sister</i> stood from afar.” Her conversation with Pharaoh’s daughter was equally brief. What may be claimed as the climax of her leadership, her singing the Song at the Sea, was only two recorded verses long (Ex. 15:20–21). Numbers 12, the longest narrative stretch involving her, is not as interested in her as it is in a defense of Moses to his siblings. Her name is mentioned only in 12:1 and then later in the chapter when several verses are devoted to her illness. We no longer expect much information about her, and in death, this enigma of brevity continues.",
                "Yet, the stylistic parallels are valuable in that they clue us to a pattern of character development – or, one may even suggest, an arrest of development. Mention of Miriam is almost always overshadowed by the needs of another, most often the needs of the congregation. When she is introduced it is in service of her brother at the behest of her mother, standing by the water. At the splitting of the sea, we expect Miriam to continue her song, only to be told two verses later that, “Moses led Israel onward from the Sea of Reeds and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water” (Ex. 15:22). There is an obvious parallel between this climactic moment and the anonymity of Miriam’s death. Attention to her is consistently bypassed by the needs of the congregation, even at her death. Specifically it is the need for water that takes precedence time and again. Although the midrash mentioned earlier attributes the water to Miriam’s credit, it seems to serve only as an obstruction to a sustained focus on her. It is no wonder that her name means “bitter waters.”",
                "The only caveat to this is in Numbers 12:15–16 when she was expelled from the camp for seven days with the biblical disease commonly referred to as leprosy. Her illness was a consequence of the slander of Moses. Nevertheless, the Israelites waited for her to be healed before continuing their journey: “And Miriam was shut up without the camp seven days; and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again. And afterward the people journeyed from Hazerot and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.” We sense the honor awarded her in their waiting, but also the inconvenience to the large camp her sickness posed. Although here the interruption in textual focus on her is positive, still the narrative moves quickly from her to the ongoing trek of the Israelites: “And afterward the people journeyed from Hazerot and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.”",
                "Miriam is somewhat of an anomaly in the role established for women from the book of Genesis. We know nothing of her own family life, with the exception of the names of her brothers. She is not identified in the biblical text as a wife or a mother, but instead, in Exodus 15, as a sister and as a prophetess. And the unusual and disquieting information about her death is in keeping with the unusual parameters of her character. In <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Moses is depicted as carrying Miriam’s head and Aaron, her feet. Both are engaged in her burial and grieve privately over her death. This midrash creates a portrait of a tripod that has lost one of its legs. Instead of this sibling triumvirate standing in unison, now two stand vertically and support the third who lies lifeless, horizontally.",
                "Miriam’s death is an omen of the upcoming death of the brothers. The structure of leadership was changing; the wilderness was swallowing it. Miriam demonstrates a sad truth about death. The actual moment of death is, for most, not a staged beautiful closure. It is a jarring, abrupt cessation of life that leaves a wide, inexplicable gap for those left behind. But life and the biblical narrative continue despite the loss, as depicted in the text. The midrashim on this incident offer death what the passage of time offers death: hindsight, reflection, and a fuller, more gentle measurement of individual worth. Helen Keller once said, “Death is no more than passing from one room into another. But there’s a difference for me, you know, because in that other room I shall be able to see.” In the “other room” of our midrash, we are able to see Miriam’s death and the heaviness of her loss at a distance. The two portraits of death, that of the text and that of the midrash, stand side by side. Her immediate loss was eclipsed by the urgent needs of the collective, but her death ultimately exacted a far deeper grief. Only when we lost Miriam did we also begin to celebrate her life.",
                "<b>Aaron: Mourned by the Community </b><br>Aaron’s death is awarded more detail, but no less mystery. In the very same chapter in which Miriam’s death is recorded, Aaron’s passing is also described:",
                "<small>And they journeyed from Kadesh; and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation came unto Mount Hor. And the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor, by the border of Edom, saying, “Aaron shall be gathered unto his people; for he shall not enter the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because you rebelled against my words at the waters of Meribah. Take Aaron and Eleazar his son and bring them up unto Mount Hor. And strip Aaron of his garments and put them upon Eleazar, his son; and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people and shall die there.” And Moses did as the Lord commanded; and they went up into Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. And Moses stripped Aaron of all his garments and put them upon Eleazar his son and Aaron died there on the top of the mount; and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount. And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel. (Num. 20:22–29)</small>",
                "There are several fascinating aspects of this passage, but most notable are the repeated mention of the community, the forewarning Aaron received about his death, the presence of his brother and son at the moment of his passing, and the curious legacy of the clothing. In many respects, Aaron’s death is the most complete narrative depiction of the three; it appears there was time for him to prepare for the moment, to spend it with his family, and to depart in the presence of his community. It is a sharp contrast from the beginning of Numbers 20; Miriam’s death was both sudden and solitary.",
                "The passage begins in similar fashion to Miriam’s death scene, as an interruption of the sojourns of the children of Israel. Here, however, there is special mention of the “whole congregation.” It is this group that frames the passage, as it closes with “all the house of Israel.” Again in the middle we are reminded that this event takes place “in the sight of all the congregation.” That the whole congregation would travel together and mourn collectively for one of its leaders comes as no surprise, but the noticeable absence of this communal presence in the death of Miriam and, to a lesser degree, Moses, makes it noticeable here. Aaron had been a man of the people. He served as spokesman to them and orchestrated the plan for the Golden Calf in consonance with their wishes. In rabbinic literature, he is lauded as a pursuer of peace, a mediator who was devoted to his constituents. While he may have erred in some respects (Deuteronomy 9:20 records God’s displeasure with Aaron for his involvement in the sin of the calf: “And the Lord was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him”), Aaron was a defender of the people. He had mercy on their faults and, through the generosity of his spirit, was able to overlook some of their evil tendencies. God seems to find more mercy for those too generous than for those who were not generous enough. One midrash queries why Moses was not accorded the same public mourning and concludes, “since he judged strictly and criticized whereas Aaron never said a negative word to any man.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Avot DeRabbi Natan</i> 12.</i> For this, the midrash concludes, Aaron was awarded the appellation “a pursuer of peace.” Aaron’s mistake was in loving the congregation too much. It is no coincidence, then, that his death would be framed by the presence of the people he unconditionally loved.",
                "Aaron was the natural choice to be a representative of the people. In this public capacity, clothing was particularly significant. An entire chapter of Exodus (28) is devoted to the creation of the priestly vestments: “And thou shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother for honor and for beauty” (Ex. 28:2). The priest had to be properly clothed to serve his holy task, to garner respect for his position as the divine emissary. Rather than view this as a concession to human aesthetics and materialism, the Bible views such dress as an important means to enhance the divine image. Aaron’s disposition made him “well-suited” to the wearing of such garments; where Moses himself confessed his deficiencies as a leader in the beginning of Exodus – “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh?” (Ex. 3:11); “I am not an eloquent man” (Ex. 4:10) – Aaron was chosen as his voice. Where Moses covered his face with a veil when bringing the commandments off the mount (Ex. 34:33), Aaron appeared before the congregation in the full splendor of the vestments. Moses shied away from some of the public aspects of leadership. Aaron, on the other hand, was able to act and dress the part of a public persona.",
                "At his death, Aaron bequeathed this legacy of leadership to his son, Eleazar, symbolically through his clothing. According to one midrash, the fabric of his life was so intertwined with the fabric of his clothing that Moses was unsure how to disrobe Aaron while he was in the process of dying. In another midrash God interjected and told Moses to do his task and the Heavens would do theirs. As Aaron was dying, Moses asked him, “Tell me what you see.” Aaron responded, “I see naught but the clouds of honor clothing me as you disrobe me.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> I:763.</i> Even in death, Aaron moved from one wardrobe to another, exchanging the clothes of this life for a new set of other-worldly coverings.",
                "With this disrobing, Aaron met his death with equanimity. In the text, Aaron’s death was foretold. In another midrash, it was Moses who had to tell Aaron he was about to die. Unsure how to broach the subject, he woke Aaron early in the morning, confessing difficulty with a matter of study on which he sought his brother’s advice. Moses was bothered that in Genesis, as a consequence of Adam’s behavior, the first man introduced mortality to the world. Aaron responded, “Moses, my brother, do not speak thus, are we also not to accept the divine decree?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Yalkut Shimoni, Ĥukkat </i>and <i>Sefer HaAggada </i>[Hebrew], eds. H.N. Bialik and W.H. Rawnitsky (Tel Aviv: Devir, 1987), no. 108, 71.</i> When Moses saw that Aaron understood the inevitability of death, Moses revealed that Aaron was soon to meet his Maker. The sense of peace conveyed in the midrash, a gentle transition from this world to the next, is even more exaggerated in the continuation of the midrash as Moses dictated Aaron’s death scene and Aaron conceded:",
                "<small>Said Moses to Aaron, “Rise up, my brother to this bed.” He rose. “Extend your arms.” He extended them. “Shut your eyes.” He shut them. “Close your mouth.” He closed it.

                "These midrashim convey Aaron’s ability to face death. It was for him as simple as removing his clothing, as if the outer shell was a reflection of the inner life. Aaron was so enmeshed in the responsibility symbolized by his clothing that passing the clothing on to his son was enough to signal his death. He was able to follow simple directives; he succumbed to divine judgment limb by limb. In Numbers 27:13, Moses was told that he, too, would die “as your brother Aaron was collected up unto his people.” Rashi comments on this strange expression; death is one of the most unique expressions of individuality. Could it be that Moses would have the same death as his brother? Rather, Rashi suggests, Moses envied the death of his brother and pined for its equanimity. He wished, as perhaps any human would, for a death forewarned, a death shared with one’s family and community, a death where fate is accepted with peace. Aaron died that way because he lived that way.",
                "<b>Moses’ Final Debate</b><br>Not so Moses. Moses argued from the moment he became a leader to the moment of his death. It is not surprising that when he finally died, Deuteronomy 34:7 reads: “And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died; his eyes were not dim, nor his natural force abated.” We sense a man taken by force, open-eyed and full of life, hungry to cross the Jordan and fighting against his very last breath.

                "Moses received forewarning of death like his brother, but unlike his brother he was told long before, in the book of Numbers, chapter 20, only to die at the end of Deuteronomy 34. He is told again and again that he would sleep with his ancestors.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Deuteronomy 31:14, 31:16, and 32:49–50.</i> Why is he told on several occasions to ascend a mountain to see the place from afar that he would never enter? Why did God not hearken to his plea, “Let me go over, I pray Thee, and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan” (Deut. 3:25)? Why was this fighter allowed more time to prepare for his final debate than his siblings?",
                "One could argue that Moses’ first act of leadership or role as protector came in Exodus 2:11–14, when Moses saw one of his brothers shamed by the physical force of his taskmaster. He saw discord and put himself at the center of it, a place he gravitated to throughout his leadership. After killing the Egyptian, Moses immediately tried to break up a fight between two Hebrews and, ironically, questioned the use of violence. The Hebrew slave turned to Moses and offered up the question that, as we saw earlier, would color and typify Moses’ long tenure of leadership: “Who made you chief and ruler over us?” (Ex. 2:14). In essence, this small scene foreshadows the vicissitudes that Moses faced in the wilderness. It is the seed of contention that germinated into much larger personal battles: the constant bitterness of the Israelites in the desert, the intimate questioning of his character by his own siblings, the battle waged by Korah and his followers against Moses’ leadership. It is against this backdrop of dissonance that Moses’ death must be analyzed. Moses was a fighter. He fought for his life as an infant on the Nile, he fought God over his death, and he fought in many other skirmishes in between.",
                "Moses was told, near the end of Numbers, that he, like Miriam and Aaron, would die.",

                "Thus, as a very result of conflict, Moses was punished. His punishment was not only death but also a death that would, because of its location, signify unrequited longing. He was taken up to Mount Nebo to look at the land, but “[he was] buried in the valley near the land of Moab near Beth-peor; and no one knows his burial place to this day” (Deut. 34:6). Three times was he told to go up on three different mountains to see the land that he would not enter, and with the irony that marks so many tragedies, he was buried in a valley.",
                "The fighting spirit of Moses is also captured in the numerous midrashim that record his emotions at this time. Perhaps the most striking of these is a very lengthy plea to God, the angels, and the natural world to spare his life. “When Moses beheld that the divine decree had been sealed [signifying his death] he drew a small circle and stood within it and said, ‘Master of the Universe I will not move from here until you cancel the decree.’” <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy Rabba 7:1 as seen in<i> Sefer HaAggada</i>, no. 137, 77.</i> Here Moses sulked like a stubborn child to a strict parent.

In every direction, he supplicated for mercy, for a voice to compete with the finality of God’s voice. But Moses was a voice alone. This loneliness in death sharply contrasts with the death of his brother, Aaron, and also reflects the very solitary nature of his leadership.

Knopf, 1994), 10.</i> That Miriam should spend her life in service of others and not die that way would be uncharacteristic. That Aaron would die without contentment or the presence of his community is unthinkable. That Moses should contend with the uncompromising nature of life and yield to it immediately in his death would almost disappoint. The tragedy of the text is ultimately for the reader of the Bible and not its heroes. Life does not always mimic art, and the lives we lead, however noble or selfless or contentious, do not necessarily translate into self-styled death scenes. How rewarding it would be to die as Petrarch recommends, “A good death does honor to a whole life.” But, unfortunately, these death scenes in no way indicate to the innocent reader that we can control death. Quite the opposite. The God of these narratives collected His dues at unexpected moments. Yet perhaps the texts encourage a small, even illusionary, hope that we are to be ultimately remembered not by how we die, but by how we live. That is how we remember Miriam, Aaron, and Moses. Their deaths are only a confirmation of what we always knew about them.",
                "The death of a leader forces succession and a transition that can be uncomfortable and unexpected. We do not betray the legacy of a leader who died by looking for the next leader. We honor the memory of a leader by appointing a new leader in his or her place because we continue the legacy of concern and commitment that they have established. It is an ultimate act of trust. We continue because we must. If biblical leadership demonstrates a repeated pattern it is this; hardly one leader passes before another one is determined. We do not let a nation suffer or thrive without a leader. We continue after a leader dies because the leader who has left us would have continued had he been able to continue. The investment of one leader must translate into the ongoing nurturing of the next. Meaningful and responsible survival demands it. Jewish history demands it."

If we are trying to escape from a particular reality, then the new reality should be compelling and stimulating. If we are looking for an adventure, then we must prepare ourselves for the possibility of surprise and ambiguity. If it is to welcome a new life on a new shore, then we should pack accordingly.

            "To call the book of Numbers a travel book would be to both trivialize it and make it relevant at the same time. It is a book about travel, no doubt. It contains all of the unexpected adventures, surprises, glitches, and anxieties we can expect from a quality travelogue. There is a destination and many stopping points. There is a change of food and conditions. There are a lot of complaints. Travel books without conflict make for very uninteresting reading. Numbers mentally transports us to a way of life rarely experienced by modern human beings. But it also begs the question: why did this ancient travel experience have to take place in the wilderness? And what does it teach us about leading in the wilderness?",
            "<b>When Will We Get There?</b><br>Not all travel is about the destination. It is also about living in a world without the same conditions and distractions. Travel of this kind forces us to linger; as we slow our pace – because speed is not going to get us there any quicker – we begin to take more notice of our environs. We stop fighting the need to get to a destination and simply allow ourselves to be fully present where we are. We become part of the place.",

Initially disappointed that the chances of finding the remains of Noah’s ark were slim, he concluded, nevertheless, that the travel itself had redeeming value: “Now that we were here, the truth seemed far less important. What was important, I realized, was the ongoing hunt, the often-eccentric never-ending quest to verify the biblical story, which itself masked one of the oldest human desires: the need to make contact with God.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bruce Feiler, <i>Walking the Bible</i> (New York: William Morrow, 2001), 9.</i>",
            "The Israelites needed to spend so long in their environment to fully appreciate, with every fiber of their experience over more than a generation, that spiritual living requires a relinquishment of control to forces beyond the self.

            "God, even more than wilderness, is distant and remote, mysterious and dimensionless. There is no way to limit and measure the wild.

            "The gift of travel is the capacity to wander and to wonder. Survival is not only a technique; it requires faith, meaning, and endurance. It requires physical strength but also a toughening and tendering of the soul. Leaders frame the experience of ambiguity. They negotiate the transition, but also give us the language and suggest the appropriate emotional response to being in the wilderness.",
            "In order to become willing nomads, we have to consciously leave the past. The Israelites were not very willing partners in this consciousness. In the same chapter of their salvation in Exodus, they complain; one chapter later, they tell Moses and Aaron that their lives were better in Egypt and that there were graveyards there, too. Their wilderness trek is punctured by multiple contradictory forces that both press them forward and have them look longingly backwards, as Michael Walzer observes:",
            "<small>The great paradox of the Exodus, and of all subsequent liberation struggles, is the people’s simultaneous willingness and unwillingness to put Egypt behind them.

            "Only by spending so many years in wilderness isolation were they truly able to put Egypt behind them. The more circuitous the route, the further back Egypt felt in the consciousness-shaping mechanisms that were necessary for transformation. They needed to get to a point of no return. The longer the time, the greater became the psychic distance between the past and the present. Forty years was the uprooting of one entire generation with the longing for Egypt and its ways.",
            "As the book of Numbers draws to a close, the journey is not quite done. The very last verse of Numbers juxtaposes the giving of law with the Israelites’ long and wearying trek: “These are the commandments and regulations that the Lord enjoined upon the Israelites, through Moses, on the steppes of Moab, at the Jordan near Jericho” (Num. 36:13). Even the geography is tantalizing. Moab and Jordan are still border countries, but Jericho is an oasis in the land of Canaan. It meant home was closer than ever.",
            "After so many chapters of leadership challenges, complaints, and subsequent punishments, the book of Numbers ends where it began: commandments and regulations. The order of the encampment in the first ten chapters is paralleled by the tightly constructed closing chapters on language, law, and the travel route. In between the organization of law, we find narratives of dissension that wear away the strength and potency of leadership: the challenge of the spies, the gossip among siblings, the mutiny of Korah, the Moabite seduction of Israelites, and the violence of Pinhas. Then again, in bookend fashion, the same book that began with a census closes with one; the text ends the chaos of the wilderness with the counting of the remaining Israelites. Again, the security of numbers and dates prevails over the reigning anarchy thick in the heart of the wilderness. But a hint is dropped at the conclusion of the census, even as the book ties its pieces together, indicating that life post-wilderness will never be the same:",
            "<small>These are the persons enrolled by Moses and Eleazar the priest who registered the Israelites on the steppes of Moab, at the Jordan near Jericho. Among these there was not one of those enrolled by Moses and Aaron the priest when they recorded the Israelites in the wilderness of Sinai. For the Lord had said of them, “They shall die in the wilderness.” Not one of them survived, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun. (Num. 26:63–65) </small>",
            "That Caleb and Joshua lived through the challenges of the wilderness experience and survived positioned them well to be future leaders. Indeed, it is not surprising that the next chapter of Numbers presents a succession plan for Moses in the form of Joshua, the spy who did not forgo his loyalty to the Promised Land upon his return. Once a successor to Moses is identified and presented publicly, the text turns to a recording of the wilderness travels itself. A list of points is penned along the map that the Israelites navigated together between Egypt and Jericho. This record of marches and campsites raises the age-old philosophical travel question of whether it is the journey or the destination that matters. Commentaries on the book’s end engage in a philosophical meandering on the art of travel embedded quietly in the long and tedious list of stops and starts. Among medieval Jewish commentaries on Numbers, there are the romantics and the non-romantics. The romantics care about the journey and what is learned or gained by each step and march forward. The non-romantics focus on the destination. Moses’ record was merely for historical value. Once there, little of the trip needed to be remembered. It is this undecorated rhythm and beat that accompanies us for forty-eight verses of geographic record: “The Israelites set out from Ramses and encamped at Succoth. They set out from Succoth and encamped at Etham, which is on the edge of the wilderness. They set out from Etham and turned about toward Pi-hahiroth, which faces Baal-zephon, and they encamped before Migdol. They set out…” (Num. 33:5–8), and so on and so forth. Many commentators were intrigued by this movement and saw in it a deeper sense of what traveling might be. <i>Kli Yakar</i>, Rabbi Ephraim Lunshits (a sixteenth-century Polish commentator), takes a different route, so to speak. He explains that what is recorded is the journey from here to there, the marches rather than the stops:",
            "<small>These were the marches of the Israelites who started out from the land of Egypt, troop by troop, in the charge of Moses and Aaron. Moses recorded the starting points of their various marches as directed by the Lord. Their marches, by starting points, were as follows… (Num. 33:1–2)</small>",
            "By the time we reach the end of the list of forty-two locations forty-eight verses later, we feel the utter fatigue of this push. Rest stops along the way disappear. Once there and looking back, we care less about the events of each encampment as much as how each bit of travel, strung together, got us to this particular place, pushed us closer to Jericho.",
            "Perhaps the constant dislocation had another benefit; it enhanced the need for home and the need to be rooted, making the Land of Israel ever more appealing in the eyes of a wandering people. The journey’s pain expanded the existential need for home. Rabbi Lunshits explains that the choice of terminology is not accidental. The essence of the journey is the travel, not the places of encampment along the way. The forty-two temporary lodging spots in those forty years were not many, according to Rabbi Lunshits, relative to the length of the trip. Each place had something to teach them about life in community.",
            "The need to keep moving, to allow oneself to be changed by the propulsion of a journey, is integral to the Jewish soul and spirit. Travel is the first act of the first Jew: “Now the Lord said to Abraham, ‘Get up and go out of your country, and from your family and from your father’s house, to the land that I will show you’” (Gen. 12:1). Go and keep going. Part of the process of becoming a Jew was to take a journey. The charge that Abraham embraced as an individual was mimicked by an entire nation. To go where they had not been. To cut off the ties of the past and to endure the challenges that the journey presented. All of this would merit them the Promised Land and the gift of nationhood. Those who survived were wiser for the journey. They became more expansive in the process. They realized that what keeps a nation going is literally that it keeps going, or, in the words of Michael Walzer, “the wilderness had to be a new school of the soul.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Walzer, <i>Exodus and Revolution</i>, 53.</i>",
            "The charge Numbers leaves leaders with is the very same one that the ancient Israelites received. Discover yourself in the wilderness of a future you know not. Go outside to go inside. Grow where the wild things are. Learn from that which almost kills you. Leave the past and discover God. Limit the complaints. Learn to lead others in the wilderness by organizing chaos. Be flexible enough to ride the chaos when all attempts at organization fail. Have contingency plans. Create a destination postcard. Do not try to lead alone. Learn to trust yourself and others in situations of uncertainty. And do not, under any circumstances, give up. You will get there."
