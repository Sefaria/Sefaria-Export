This, and the destined reward, should be the ultimate objective for all the Torah’s commandments.<br>The answer is that the Torah needs to present the goal to which we should direct ourselves. If so, the goal is the material benefits, because the goal needs to be a clear, visible sign. An unseen sign will not be useful. In fact, the soul’s bliss is hidden and incomprehensible while we are alive. Therefore, in His Divine Wisdom Hashem added temporal successes as reward for fulfillment of the Torah. Even if they will have intention for this revealed goal, they will not be prevented from achieving the loftier objective.<br>Furthermore, there is no need to tell the soul that if it completes its worldly mission it will arrive honorably at its final destination. The only warning needed is that rebellion will cause it to be cut off from its true abode. Therefore, the Torah describes, in the works of the Sanctuary and in their travels, the people’s closeness to Hashem. In this <i>parshash</i> as well (v. 11): “I will set My Sanctuary among you,” and in every place the Torah announces: “You shall be holy.” This holiness is the soul’s closeness to Hashem while in this world, and so much the more so after separation from the body.",

                    "The Torah addresses these issues in this <i>parshah</i>. First it speaks about fulfilling needs, and about removing the oppressors (v. 6): “I will grant peace in the land … I will banish evil beasts from the land.” And it says Hashem will provide them with a spirit of might according to their readiness.
