But how do we know that even if all of us were wise men, we must still thank G-d? For this he brought the second verse, \"all Your works shall give thanks to You (yoducha)\". The word \"yoducha\" (give thanks to You) is a combination of two words, \"yodu\" and \"lecha\". For the matter of thanks, is for the beneficiary to tell his benefactor that he recognizes his good, as written \"give thanks to the L-ord for He is good\" (Ps.107:1). Afterwards, he explained the matter of thanks, in saying \"they shall speak of the glory of Your kingdom\", namely that the honor of Your sovereignty is different from that of flesh and blood, because a flesh and blood king has pleasure and benefit from his people, unlike G-d who needs nothing as mentioned earlier. Hence, we do not yet know if He wants that we examine His beneficence and thank Him for them. Therefore, he brought this verse \"to make known to the sons of man\", i.e. G-d's intent in creation was to make known to the sons of man, etc. And like the verse (Prov. 16:4) \"the L-ord made everything for His praise\" .

And even though our Sages counted \"thought\" as one of the things which are not in a man's control, since thoughts pop up on their own in a man's mind. Nevertheless, there are two answers to this. Firstly, this was stated regarding the beginning of the thought's entering one's mind. Then it is only like a tiny spark that a man can easily extinguish. Hence, immediately, when he senses it, he can dismiss it and remove it from his mind and turn his mind to other things. However, if he does not dismiss it right away, then that spark will be fanned by a man's ruach (spirit) and will prolong for some time. This prolongation is called \"hirhur\" (musing) in the words of the Sages. The second answer is that a man has the ability to not leave any room for these thoughts to arise, namely, by not allowing his mind to go idle in the first place - through the study of torah or engaging in work, as the Rambam wrote (Isurei Bia 22:21): \"thoughts of lusts do not strengthen except in a heart devoid of wisdom\". Behold, after the thought is fanned and prolongs in his spirit, this will correspondingly arouse the force of lust. And after he has lusted for it, he will hesitate a bit and deliberate whether or not to do it. Afterwards, he resolves to do it, and the matter will be held and pending in his mind until the time of the actual committing of the act of sin. ",

A man must then draw it back and remove it from his heart, and dismiss it from his mind by force. This is the meaning of the double expression \"return...draw back\". Understand this.",

(1) For corresponding to the first cause, namely, their great absorption in matters of this world and the endless clamor of its waves of pleasures which do not allow quietude of the imaginations of his heart, behold, for a man caught in this, certainly there is no hope whatsoever that on his own, he will stir himself to recognize the beneficence of the Creator, and praise Him on them. Because, from where will this recognition come? Since his heart is preoccupied with too many things until there is no room left to think of anything else. Combine this, with his imagining always that he is lacking much, and whatever he has is worth nothing to him. Either way, there is way that his heart will come to recognize G-d's beneficence. On this he wrote earlier \"the majority of mankind are too blind to recognize these benefits\". He wrote \"blind\" without qualification, in that they do not recognize them at all. (2) Corresponding to the second cause, namely, being greatly habituated in them from childhood, behold, it is known that habit alone cannot by itself annul and desensitize a person from feeling something. If someone strikes him with a stick every day for several years, he will also feel the latest one, only that his fear of the feeling will not be so great, like someone who never experienced it. Hence, habit alone is not enough to block out the recognition completely. Likewise for the good, due to being habituated in them he does not recognize them properly, relative to their high excellence. On this he wrote: \"or comprehend their high excellence\".(3) Corresponding to the third cause, namely, that a man is bitter and complains on many of the matters that are actually good for him due to their appearing bad on the surface, without contemplation. On this he wrote \"they do not think over their matters\", as explained earlier. Think and contemplate this for I have been brief.",

Likewise, it is possible to find someone who has intent to be of actual benefit to his fellow, but not because he has a benevolent disposition towards him, but rather due to some outside interest, either to appear noble, or to annoy his enemy who desires evil for that fellow...

The reason being that his intent is to demonstrate that the torah commanded this from the perspective of human understanding not as a statute (without reason) like other statutes of the torah (such as shatnez or milk and meat). In the Ten Commandments, it says \"honor your father... in order that you lengthen your days\". Once the torah designated reward as such, the status of the commandment appears to be as a Biblical precept (i.e. not a precept derived from reason). But in the verse, \"Ye shall, everyone, revere his father and his mother\", there it reveals that the torah obligates this from the side of Reason. Hence, the torah wrote the mother first, since she toiled more in his upbringing. And on \"honor\", he brought the verse \"A son honors his father, and a servant his master\", which clearly shows from the language of the verse that the intent is from Reason, since it was not stated as a command but rather in a language of \"custom of the world\", as a natural duty derived from common sense.",

On the other hand, this case [that \"their benevolence is mixed\"] means, even if we you were to suppose they had free will (and nothing compelled them) and we will say that they are being benevolent in this, nevertheless, it is not true benevolence since certainly, \"their benevolence is mixed, etc.\"."

G-d forbid, I do not hold this arrogant view.<br>\"nor did I lift up my eyes\" - i.e. likewise, G-d forbid, for me to lift up my eyes to heaven, and to attribute all of my actions and movements to You, and claim that I am forced in them. Hence, I do not hold of either extreme view.<br>\"Nor do I involve myself in great matters, Or in things too high for me\" - Likewise, I know that I am incapable of distinguishing between \"necessity and righteousness\". These are the words of the author for \"one who goes deeply into these subjects will not escape sin and will stumble\". He wrote \"great matters\" corresponding to their magnitude. And \"too high for me\" corresponding to the concealment of their essence.<br>\"Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul\" - i.e. you know and can testify that I indeed conducted myself like this.<br>\"stilled and quieted\" - \"stilled\" means strengthened myself such as \"I stilled myself until the morning\" (Isaiah 38:13). i.e. I took on myself to hold on to both views - in some of them I strengthened myself and told myself \"See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no G-d with me\" (Deut. 32:39), for G-d left the free will in my hands. Namely, in matters of [doing good] deeds. As the author wrote earlier \"the proper course to follow is to act on the principle of one who believes [that actions are left to a human being's free will, who will therefore be rewarded or punished for them]\". While in other matters I \"quieted my soul\" anticipating G-d's will, namely in matters of Bitachon (trust in G-d). As the author wrote \"At the same time, we ought to trust in G-d with the trust of one, fully convinced [that all things and movements, together with their advantageous and injurious results happen by the decree of the Eternal]\". This is the meaning of the term \"quieted\", and this term is used in scripture regarding Bitachon (trust) such as \"wait quietly for the salvation of the L-ord\" (Eicha 3:26) and \"Wait for the L-ord and hope for Him\" (Ps. 37:7).<br>Afterwards, he clarified his words in saying \"like a weaned child with his mother\", that in being on his mother's breast, he is entirely dependant on her will. But after he has been weaned, his matters are dependant on both his will and her will. Namely, to fulfill his needs, he must engage himself to walk with his feet to the place of food and to take it with his hand and place it in his mouth, and likewise to put on clothing. But he is still lacking the ability to obtain his needs independently . Therefore, he must place his trust in his mother, that she will provide for him. This is the meaning [of the double expression]: \"like a weaned child with his mother; my soul is with me like a weaned child\". Namely, that for matters of bitachon \"like a weaned child with his mother\", while for others, namely doing good deeds, \"my soul is with me like a weaned child\", that it depends on me. The Psalm ends with bitachon (Trust) which is the foundation of Judaism, and its perfection, saying \"Let Israel hope in the L-ord from this time forth and forever\"."

The intent is on the acts of punishment which a man is actively punished by, just like he sinned with actions, as written regarding sinners \"for their worm shall never die, and their fire shall not extinguish\" (Isaiah 66:22). While on refraining from doing good, he wrote \"prolonged affliction\". The word \"affliction\" connotes withholding something good and desirable such as the \"afflictions of Yom Kippur\", which are all withholding of desirable things (such as washing, eating, etc.) Likewise, in truth, on the wicked it is written there: \"behold My servants will eat and you will go hungry..\" (Isaiah 65:13), and \"he will not see the good\" (Jer. 29:32). Therefore he wrote regarding active punishments \"severe\" and regarding afflictions \"prolonged\". For since, the affliction is withholding of good, it is not proper to say \"severe affliction\". For it is not correct to say this withholding is greater than that one. It is only proper to use the term \"prolonged\", namely, that the affliction will be for a long time. Furthermore, regarding the active punishment, which is incurred for bad deeds, it is only for a limited time just like his bad deeds were limited in time. On this it is written: \"He does not maintain a dispute continuously or remain angry for all time\" (Ps. 103:9). But for the affliction, which is withholding [good], it could be, G-d forbid, forever. For just like he refrained from doing these good deeds, so too he will be completely withheld from the good, and will never ever merit it. Hence, the intent in the word \"prolonged\" is on eternity, as they expounded the verse (Kidushin 39b):\"you shall prolong your days\" (Deut.22:7) - to the world which is eternally prolonged. Hence, it is correct to use specifically the term \"severe\" for this, and \"prolonged\" for that. Understand this. ",

This causes great loss to a man's strength and health as the Rambam wrote in Hilchos Deos 4:19, on this he wrote \"great loss\". The latter two are the damages which come from providing for their needs (ex.big house). That when they are near, they persuade their husbands and act playfully and seek luxuries which brings to two harmful things, namely, \"great exertion\" in exerting oneself to provide for their needs and \"strain\" of the mind in the mental distraction of providing their needs.

In truth, each one of these certainly has a specific instruction [to combat it]. These correspond to the seven traits which our sages counted that a man becomes proud of. Therefore, they said that these traits are good for the righteous because they don't become arrogant in them.
