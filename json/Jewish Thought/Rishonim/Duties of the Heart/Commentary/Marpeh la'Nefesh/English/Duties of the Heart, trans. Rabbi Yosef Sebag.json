            "G-d graced man with knowledge and understanding to know and understand His torah and to do His will, provided that his intellect is free from serious damage, namely, that it has not become erroneous or that it has not become ruined due to some brain damage.",
            "this was explained in the Kuzari (maamer sheni ot 25,48,50). The summary of his words is as follows: a man cannot attain the favor of G-d or come close to Him except through His commandments. For He [alone] knows the measure, amount, time, and place of each commandment. Therefore, if we perform them as G-d commanded Moses, the divine presence will rest on our handiwork as was the case in the building of the Tabernacle despite that we do not understand their reasons and effects and that they are beyond our human logic... so too by the torah, we must listen and carefully follow that prescribed quantity and quality, how and with what we can do His will, namely, His law and religion. For otherwise, as with all the nations of the world which also strive, each man trying to come close to G-d in his own way, but he does not succeed. For no prophet, seer, or [man with] divine spirit (ruach hakodesh) has appeared to them as is the case with the Jewish people when they would follow the torah and commandments properly as is known. Therefore, a man should not become \"smart\" against the word of G-d, as written (Prov. 21:30) \"there is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel [that can succeed] against the L-ord\". See also Gate 8 ch.3 part 4 where the author wrote similar words there.",
            "i.e. the oral law, which was received from generation to generation until Moses, as our Sages said (Pirkei Avot 1:1) \"Moses received the torah at Sinai and transmitted it to Joshua...\" Because every commandment G-d gave to Moses was accompanied with an oral explanation and clarification. This is the oral law. And thus Moses transmitted it to Joshua, and Joshua to the elders, etc. For without an explanation we would not know how to do even one precept fully, i.e. to do it completely, such as Tzitzit, Tefilin, and likewise for all of the others. Then each person would explain the precepts in the torah according to his knowledge and understanding, and every Jew would have a different torah and a different religion. Therefore, our torah depends on the transmitted oral law which Moses received at Sinai and which was transmitted until it reached the place G-d chose [for His temple]. For there [in Jerusalem] are the true receivers of the oral tradition, the great Sanhedrin and the Kohanim (priests). Therefore, the torah says (Deut. 17:10-12) \"you shall do according to the torah which they [the Sanhedrin] teach you. Be careful to do everything they instruct you to do...and the man which does not hearken unto the priest that stands to minister there before the L-ord your G-d, or unto the judge [of the Sanhedrin] - that man shall die\"... And they also received from Moses all the great secrets which are known to true Kabalists, and the amazing allusions, for it is all hinted in the torah. The torah is expounded in 4 ways (Pardes) as explained in the Zohar, Ramban, and the Alshich. The author was brief here for he relied on the words of Rabbi Saadia Gaon.",

You have been granted free will in this. If you want to strengthen this connection, you may do so. And if you want to weaken it little by little until it is severed completely, you may likewise do so. This connection will only be strengthened if you employ it for love of G-d, and that your intent is to Him, as we wrote, and its weakening occurs when you set your thoughts to other than Him. [And even if you were the wisest man in divine knowledge, when you turn your thoughts to necessary eating or some other necessary occupation - you have already severed that clinging between you and G-d.

            "it seems the author's view is like that of Rabbi Saadia Gaon, that the Tradition is primary. And if one is of strong intellect, so that he can also delve into rational inquiry in order that his faith will be more firmly implanted in his heart through both tradition and rational proofs and together they will be perfect in his heart and mind - then he can tread this path [of rational inquiry], as will be explained in Gates 1 and 2. Here is an excerpt from the introduction of Sefer Emunot by R.Saadia Gaon: even though the Sages prevented us from this inquiry in saying \"whoever inquires into four things, better had he not been born\" (Chagiga 11b). Their intent was only if we abandon the books of the prophets and instead each person relies on his own intellect in trying to understand the first beginnings of time and space [first existence]. For whoever inquires in this way, perhaps he will find [truth], perhaps he will err. And until he finds [the truth], he will be without religion. And even if he finds [truth] it is possible that he will stray from it due to some doubt that will surface in his mind and he may lose his faith. Everyone agrees that one who goes in this manner is a sinner. But we, the congregation of Israel, investigate and rationally inquire what we received from the prophets, who were confirmed true prophets through signs and miracles, so that what we received from them in knowledge may become tangibly clear to us. Secondly, [we study this in order to know how to] refute those who come against us in Torah matters in the way of \"know what to answer a heretic\" (Pirkei Avot 2:14). See there at length.)",

There is no other' (Deut. 4:39), and David said: 'And you, Solomon my son, know the G-d of your father and serve Him with a perfect heart and with a willing soul' (Chron. I 28:9), and 'knowing' means in the heart not on the mouth\". end quote.",

So too regarding the four elements, before each one received the form visible to us, it was first composed of the primordial substance, which is called by the Greeks, \"hiyuli\", and in the kabalistic books, \"nefesh yesodot\" (the spirit of the elements), since the form requires the underlying physical, without which it cannot hold its form, and the substance is the essence of the thing while the form is the incident (mikre), because sometimes it is embodied in this form and sometimes in another. The physical and the form of the four elements always existed simultaneously, because their existence preceded that of all the creations, and from them all creations were composed...now you will understand well the author's coming words.

                    "In the Moray (Rambam's Guide for the Perplexed) Chapter 13: \"I say that any work done with intent must have a purpose for which it was done... and likewise it is clear that the thing which was made with intent is mechudash (created) after there was not... And Aristotle already clarified that the plants were created for the creatures, and likewise for other things, each one for the other, and all the more so for the limbs of the creatures. Know that this existence of plan and purpose in natural matters brought the philosophers to believe in a beginning beyond nature...Know that the greatest proof to the chidush of the world, for one who admits the truth, is from the natural world around us, since all of them have a purpose and that each one is for the other - this is a proof on intent from an Intender, and intent which is carried out...\" End of the Rambam's words. I wrote this because even though the Rambam greatly engaged in debating and refuting all the different viewpoints, whether for kadmon (eternal existence of the world) whether for creation, as you can see in that entire book, this is what he found most proper in his eyes from all the proofs, and he brought it as his final words, and in truth, it is a foundation and root. Therefore, the author (of this book) also built all of his building on it, since they are things which can be grasped intellectually - but to delve deeper in these matters is extremely dangerous, as the Rambam wrote in the Moray part 2 chapter 16: \"When it became clear to me [that arguments can be made against each of the proofs that Aristotle brought to show that the world was eternal (and not created), and therefore] the question of whether the world is kadmon (eternally extant) or created remains unresolved [through philosophical proofs], I chose to resolve the question based on the prophecy of the prophets, since prophecy is able to clarify matters that are beyond the power of the intellect to resolve and even those who believe that the world is eternal do not deny the existence of prophecy....\", see there. And in part 2 chapter 17, he brought a very powerful analogy against the heretics who believe in kadmus (eternal existence of the world), and he said that all of their proofs and logic are only from the nature which exists in the world after the Creator has already created them in perfect form from all angles as they are now, and how can we possibly bring a proof from this as to how it was before it was created and brought to existence from nothing: \"the analogy of this is to a child who was born in a deserted island, and then his mother died, and this orphan never saw a female. When he grew up and matured intellectually, he asked his father how a man was formed. His father answered him 'each person among us, came to be and was formed in the belly of a female, who is of our kind, like us, of such and such form, and the man was in her belly, small, and his body was closed. And he grew there slowly, slowly for fixed months until the time he was forced to go out from her belly through an opening which opened for him. Afterwards he grew until he became big in his limbs, senses, and intellect, as you see now. The orphan started to deny all of this, and built proofs against all these true things, saying that \"they are impossible and are lies, because how is it conceivable that a live man can breathe through his nostrils inside a container which is closed on all sides, and it appears impossible that one cannot live for any time without breathing, or if one cannot excrete the waste of his food, he will die a painful death, and how could his mouth be shut and his navel open, and his eyes closed and his limbs constricted together for such a long time, and when he comes out of there, all of his limbs and his eyes should be intact\". This is a clear proof that the formation of man could not have occurred in this way, even though it is truly so.\" He ends off: \"contemplate this analogy and test it, and you will find the two matters to be identical, and that we are of these who pursue Moshe Rabeinu, peace be unto him, and Avraham avinu, we believe the world came to be in such and such a way, and it was such and such, and it was created such and such, and afterwards Aristotle came to refute our words, and he brought proofs from the laws of this nature, which are complete and with us, here in the present, but which are not comparable to what existed at the time of creation, for this was after absolute non-existence... He then finishes: \"and you must be careful in this matter as it is a great protective wall, which I have built around the Torah.. to protect from the stones of all who hurl at it\", until here is the Rambam, see also what is written in the introduction of the book \"Haemunot\".

Since our G-d, blessed be He, possesses unlimited power, as evidenced by the continuous motion of the sphere, we see that His power is not the power of a body.

There he explains this matter at length as he received it from his teacher, the Arizal, through the divine presence which rested on him... The summary of what he says is that good and bad traits in a human being stem from the nefesh bahamit (lower soul). The body is comprised of the four elements of the world and their spiritual counterparts, which are material and form. Therefore, all the traits fall into two main divisions which in turn subdivide into two subdivisions: \"arrogance\", from the element of fire (Rabbi YS: see Gate 1 ch.6 for an explanation of the four elements system of classification. Modern science combined everything with E=mc2 because it ignores the spiritual side of reality). [Excessive] speech, whether good or bad springs from the element of air. Lust for physical pleasures springs from the element of water, sadness and laziness from the element of earth. From their opposites spring the good traits in a human being. The 613 commandments correspond to the 613 spiritual limbs of the soul which are enclothed inside the nefesh bahamit which in turn is enclothed in the 613 physical limbs of the body. Therefore, the body is not able to work and fulfill the 613 commandments if the soul is ill with the sickness of these bad traits, just like if the body were ill. Therefore, the traits were not included in the 613 commandments. It comes out that bad traits are more severe than fulfillment of the commandments themselves, since then the body and soul are not capable of fulfilling any commandment properly. Therefore, the bad traits are like bad food to a sick body - all the medications in the world (i.e. the commandments) will be of no avail as long as he continues with the bad food.

How many have gone off to evil ways, r\"l, and it is all due to the enticements of the yetzer hara. Therefore scripture tells us to guard \"very much\" from him, as written (in the Shema - Devarim 11:16): \"guard yourself lest your heart be enticed, and you stray and will serve other gods, and worship them\" i.e. when you stray from the way of the torah, even for small things, eventually you \"will serve other gods, etc.\" (ibid), and in the end \"then the L-ord's wrath be kindled against you\", etc. (ibid) until finally, \"you'll be swiftly destroyed from the good land\" (ibid), like our Sages told us in books, and likewise we saw with our own eyes. Here is a quote from the \"Magid\" (angel) to the Beis Yosef (Rabbi Yosef Karo, sefer magid Parsha Vaera): Yom Revii (Wednesday) at the time of mincha, while I was studying mishnayot: (The heavenly messenger said:) Chazak v'Ematz (be strong and courageous) in my torah, and unify your heart to not separate your thoughts from my torah, my yira, cleave to my nitzchi, my nekiyus, my sod, my oz, etc, my tiferet, my torah, my teshua, my teshuva (see the book Tomer Devorah for an explanation of the Divine attributes), because that which you seek from the Holy One bb'H, that He guide you in the ways of His teshuva, these are the ways I am teaching you, i.e. these are the ways of His teshuva. Strengthen yourself so that you do not part your thought for even a second from my torah and my yira. Annul from your heart all the hirhurim (urges, thoughts) which come to you from the yetzer hara, the serpent, the Samal (Satan). They put these in your heart to make you lost, to confuse/disorient you, to destroy you. And you, stand up against them, annul them from your heart, let not their words enter your ears. Thereby, you will cause them to be lost and confused/disoriented, and you will destroy them. Their desire is in you but you will rule over them. That which you see that sometimes I speak to you but the words do not \"arise\", behold you know what the Sages said: \"shema yigrom hachet\" (\"sin may cause\" [the forfeiture of future good]). Furthermore, even if it does not cause, nevertheless, the hirhurim (thoughts) which enter your heart cause that my words do not arise and they also cause my words to stagger and I do not reveal to you all the words. Therefore, be watchful and guard yourself from these hirhurim, and especially at the time of prayer, annul all these thoughts and unify your heart to my prayer and my service. It is necessary for you to not mesiach daat (become distracted) at all, because the moment you become distracted, your yetzer hara will make you lost, confuse/disorient you, topple you, destroy you, and cast you in the bor tachtis (depths of the pit, i.e. Gehinom). Therefore, you must be constantly alert to his strategies. Do not be forgetful of him for even one second. Be always watchful of him, because zehirus (watchfulness) brings to cleanliness. And thereby, you will make him lost and will destroy him, confuse/disorient him, submit him under you. You must exert yourself exceedingly to not neglect your watchfulness of him for even one second. And especially during the time of Shema and prayer, to burn all hirhurim and machshevot betelot (useless thoughts) with the straw of kerias shema. And thus, you will become elevated and exalted. See and reflect that all the thoughts that a man ponders on his affairs, they do not increase, decrease, or annul in the least from what was decreed for him. Therefore, annul the hirhurim from our heart.(later on Parsha Bo) Friday night 4th of Shevat: \"G-d is with you, etc. only cleave in me and in my yira and in my mishnayot. Do not part your thoughts for even one second because, I, I am the mishna (i.e. the Shechina) which is speaking through your mouth. I am the mother which is chastising her child (i.e. the Shechina). Strengthen and cleave to me, because I and all of my legions are all around you. And you are among us like a king with his army. If the eye had permission to see, you would see out as far as your eye could behold in every direction everything full of troops (angels) which were created from the breath of your mouth, when you toil in mishna. They are encamped all around you, and they surround my troops. And you are in their midst like a king in his army. And all of them proclaim and say 'give honor to the holy form of the King, because he is our teacher, etc.' Therefore, be careful for yourself in all your way to be constantly clinging to me, and do not part your thoughts for even an instant from Me, and I will elevate you exceedingly in lofty levels.

                    " Rav Moshe Alshich wrote in parsha ki tetze similar to these words, see there. He concluded saying: \"for two great and important reasons war with human beings is small compared to the war of the yetzer. The first: War with humans is not in a man's hands, but rather it belongs to G-d since \"Ha-shem Ish Milchama\" (G-d is the master of war) (Shmos 15:3) and without Him \"no man shall lift up his hand\" (Bereishis 41:44). But the war of the yetzer belongs to man, not to G-d, since \"Everything is in the hands of G-d, except for fear of G-d\" (Berachot 33b). Free choice is unrestrained, to whatever way one desires, he may pursue. The second: One who wages war with his yetzer is like a young lad who approaches a city he does not recognize. Inside it is a seasoned warrior, trained in warfare from his youth, knowledgeable in all the roads and alleys of the city, since he dwelled there all of his life. And there are over 600 troops there who are all like slaves of that seasoned warrior and follow his orders, powerful warriors which do his will. The city is barricaded shut, with the seasoned warrior and his troops inside it. And behold, this young lad comes and bold heartedly decides to wage war with the seasoned warrior and topple him and conquer the entire city, capture all of its inhabitants, and enslave them all to himself, and change their hearts to accept him as their master. And in truth - if a man does thus with his yetzer hara, this is the ultimate degree of mightiness, because this is like the lad who wages war with the seasoned warrior as above. And this is what our sages said (Pirkei Avot 4:2): \"Who is mighty? He who conquers his yetzer, as it is written (Proverbs 16:32) \"One who is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and one whose temper is controlled than one who captures a city\", [a city] as above.

The first: That one knows and recognizes all of his actions... know my son that most people are not careful about devarim betalim (useless chatter), nor from looking at woman and speaking to them without needing to. They are also not careful to pray with kavana (intent), and to speak [mundane things] in a synagogue, and from frivolity (sechok and kalut rosh), nor from giving tzedaka to those fitting to receive... and talmud torah, and likewise from jealousy, hatred, slander, arrogance, anger, and all the [bad] traits mentioned in this book... Even if he knows the transgressions he committed, he will not regret them if he is not certain of the evilness of what he did. If he thinks \"so what if I benefited from this world without a beracha, or if I wasted time for torah study, it is not so bad?\" He who thinks thus will not regret nor repent wholeheartedly. Rather one must think: \"there is nothing worse in the world than one who doesn't care about the orders of the lofty King\"... The penitent must know and believe from the depths of his heart that there are harsh and bitter retributions and punishments in the next world for the sins he committed. If he does not know this, he will not care to repent. But after the inevitability of the punishment is clear to him, then he will repent and regret it and beseech forgiveness for it from G-d."

He thinks it is not worth anything in the eyes of G-d, and one says to himself, 'if so, why should I do it?' On this he wrote: 'Do not consider small in your eyes any good'. And here is an excerpt from the Chasid on the chapter \"Yesh Nochalim\":\n\"know that the commandments and warnings which appear very small and insignificant, and people are indifferent to them - they stand over the heights of the universe, it is impossible to imagine their measure or examine their effect by (limited) human intellect. It cannot be grasped except by true, holy, supernal sages who the light of G-d shines on them. And every mitzva, even the smallest of the smallest, has a power and root in the divine chariot (kabala terms), from which the matter emanates down to the physical world. When one fulfills the mitzva, the corresponding supernal power is aroused in his root above, and there they are illuminated without limit, and he adds power and might to the Pamalya shel Maala. And if he does a sin, whether in speech or in deed, thereby strengthening the power of the \"Samech-Mem\" and his helpers (the forces of impurity), he arouses the power of tuma and klipa of that matter which is aligned to him in the chariot of tuma. Therefore, G-d has commanded us specifically on these commandments and warnings and not on others. And likewise for all the Rabbinical commandments, which are also in this way, etc.... And let one imagine as if he is actually toiling in the corresponding matter on high, because even though he is a small creature, G-d has granted him power to arouse supernal powers on high. This is what is meant by the verse \"the portion of G-d is His people, Yaakov the rope of His inheritance\" (Devarim 32:9), which means that G-d has granted of His honor to them, and He blew into their nostrils the soul of living spirit. And the part is attached to the whole, like a rope whose one end is tied to a high place and the second end is down below - one who grabs the end below and pulls it with all of his strength - moves the end above. And this is what they said in the mishna (Avos 2:1) \"be careful of a light commandment just like for a severe one\". End of excerpt."
