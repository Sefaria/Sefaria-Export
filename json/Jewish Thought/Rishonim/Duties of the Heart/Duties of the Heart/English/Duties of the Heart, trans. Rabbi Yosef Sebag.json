        "Introduction of the Author": [
            "Blessed be the L-ord, G-d of Israel, to Whom true Unity can be fittingly ascribed, whose existence is Eternal, whose beneficence is unceasing, who created all that is found as a sign of His Unity, who formed beings to serve as witnesses of His power and brought new things into existence to testify to His wisdom and great benevolence, as written \"one generation shall praise your works to another, and shall declare Your mighty acts\" (Ps. 145:4), and \"all Your works shall give thanks to You, O L-ord; and Your saints shall bless You; they shall speak of the glory of Your kingdom, and talk of Your power; To make known to the sons of men His mighty acts, etc\" (Ps.145:10-12).",
            "The greatest gift which the Creator bestowed on His servants, human beings, after bringing them out to full perception and complete (mature) understanding - is wisdom, which is the life of their spirit and the candle of their intellect; It brings them to the favor of G-d and saves them from His wrath in this world and the next, as Scripture says \"for the L-ord gives wisdom: out of His mouth comes knowledge and understanding\" (Prov.2:6); And Elihu said: \"but there is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty that gives them understanding\" (Job 32:8); And Daniel said: \"He gives wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding\" (Daniel 2:21), and \"I am the L-ord your G-d who teaches you for your benefit, who leads you by the way that you should go\" (Isaiah 48:17). ",
            "Wisdom falls into three divisions:",
            "The first division is the science of nature, called in Arabic, \"Al-Ilm al-tibi\". This branch of knowledge deals with the essential and incidental properties of material bodies.",
            "The second division consists of the practical sciences, called in Arabic, \"Al-Ilm al-riazi\". These comprise arithmetic, engineering, astronomy, and music. ",
            "The third division, called in Arabic, \"Al-Ilm al-ilahi\". is the science of theology, which deals with the knowledge of G-d, knowledge of His torah, and other [spiritual] things, such as the soul, the intellect, and spiritual beings.",
            "All these divisions of wisdom, and their respective branches, are gates which the Creator has opened for men through which they may attain [a comprehension] of religion and of the world. Only that some sciences are more needed for religious matters while others are more needed for secular interests.",
            "The sciences whose use is closest to worldly matters is the science of nature, which is the lowest science and the practical science, which is second. These two sciences instruct on all the secrets of the physical world, its uses and benefits, its industries and trades and is conducive to physical and material well-being.",
            "The science which is most needed for religion is the highest science - Theology. We are under duty to study it in order to understand and obtain a knowledge of our religion. But to study it in order to attain worldly benefits is forbidden. Our teachers said (Nedarim 62a): \"[expounding the verse:] 'to love the L-rd your G-d, to hearken to His voice, and to cleave to Him' [This means] that one should not say, 'I will read Scripture that I may be called a scholar.' I will study [mishna], that I may be called Rabbi, I will study [Talmud], to be an Elder, and sit in the assembly [of elders]; but learn out of love, and honor will come in the end.\". And \"Do [good] deeds for the sake of their Maker, and speak of them [words of torah] for their own sake. Make not of them a crown wherewith to magnify yourself, nor a spade to dig with\" (ibid). And \"'Fortunate is the man that fears the L-ord, that delights greatly in His commandments' (Ps. 112:1), R. Eleazar expounds thus: 'In His commandments' but not in the reward of His commandments. This is just what we have learnt. 'He used to say, Be not like servants who serve the master on the condition of receiving a reward; but be like servants who serve the master without the condition of receiving a reward.'\" (Avodah Zara 19a). ",
            "The avenues which the Creator has opened for the knowledge of His law and religion are three:",
            "The first is a [sound] intellect which is free of any damage.",
            "The second, the book of His law revealed to Moses His prophet. ",
            "The third, the tradition which we have received from our ancient Sages who in turn received them from the prophets, peace be unto them. The great Rabbi Saadia of blessed memory already discussed on this avenue to a sufficient extent. ",
            "Furthermore, the science of the Torah falls into two divisions:",
            "The first aims at the knowledge of the duties of the limbs (practical duties) and is the science of external conducts.",
            "The second deals with the duties of the heart, namely, its sentiments and thoughts, and is the science of the inner life. ",
            "The duties of the limbs likewise fall into two divisions.",
            "The first consists of precepts which reason would have dictated even if the torah had not made them obligatory.",
            "The second, precepts received on the authority of Revelation which reason neither obligates nor rejects such as the prohibition of milk with meat, shaatnez (garments woven of wool and flax), kilaim (sowing diverse seeds together), and similar precepts whose reason for being prohibited or obligatory is unknown to us. ",
            "The duties of the heart, however, are all rooted in rational principles, as I will explain with G-d's help.",
            "All the precepts are either positive commandments or negative commandments. We do not need to explain this for the duties of the limbs because these are universally known. I will, however, with G-d's help, mention of the positive and negative commandments of the duties of the heart to serve as examples of those not cited.",
            "Among the positive commandments of the duties of the heart: to believe that the world has a Creator who created it from naught, that there is none like Him, that we acknowledge His Unity, that we serve Him in our hearts, that we reflect on the wonders of His works, that these may serve as evidences of Him, that we place our trust in Him, that we humble ourselves before Him, that we revere Him, that we fear and feel abashed when we consider that He observes our outer and inner being, that we long to do His will, that we devote our acts to His Name, that we love Him and those that love Him in order to come close to Him, that we hate His enemies, and similar duties which are not visible by the senses. ",
            "Negative commandments of the duties of the heart are the converse of those just mentioned. Also included among them: to not covet, avenge, nor bear a grudge; as written \"you shall not avenge nor bear a grudge\" (Levit. 19:18). ",
            "Among them, that our minds not muse on [doing] transgressions, nor desire them, nor resolve to do them and other similar things which are hidden in a man and observed by none but the Creator, as written \"I the L-ord search the heart, I test the mind\" (Jer. 17:10) and \"the candle of G-d is the spirit of man, searching all the inner depths of the heart\" (Prov. 20:27). ",
            "As the science of the torah deals with two parts, external and inward commandments, I studied the books of our predecessors who lived after the [compilers of the] Talmud. They composed many works dealing with the precepts. In the expectation of learning from them the science of inward religion, I found, however, that all that they intended to explain and clarify fall into three categories:",
            "The first, to explain the Torah and the books of the prophets, and this is in one of two ways, either explaining the words and subject matter, as did Rabeinu Saadya, of blessed memory, in his commentaries of most of the books on Scripture. Or to explain the language and grammar, grammatical forms and usages in all their varieties, as well as paying heed to accuracy of the text, like the books of Ibn Ganach, the Massorites, and their school.",
            "The second, to compile the explanation of the commandments into summary form, such as the work of Rav Chefetz ben Yatzliach of blessed memory. Or of only the commandments which apply today such as Halachot Pesukot, Halachot Gedolot, and similar collections; or of special topics as the Geonim did in their Responsa on practical duties and in their decisions.",
            "The third, to confirm our faith in the matters of torah in our hearts through logical proofs and refutation of heretics like the book of Emunot (of Rabbi Saadia), the Sharashei Hadat, the Sefer Mekametz and similar works. ",
            "I examined these writings but failed to find among them a book specially devoted to the inner wisdom. I found that this wisdom, which is the duties of the heart, had been entirely neglected. No work had been composed, systematically explaining its roots and branches.",
            "I greatly wondered about this, and thought to myself, perhaps this class of duties is not obligatory from the torah but is only an ethical obligation the aim of which is to teach us the proper and just way. Possibly it belongs to the class of extra practices that are optional, for which we will not be held accountable for them nor will we be punished for neglecting them. And therefore, our predecessors omitted to write a special book on them. I investigated the Duties of the Heart from Reason, Scripture, and Tradition (talmud,midrash,etc.) to inquire whether or not they are obligatory and found that they form the foundation of all the precepts, and that if there is any deficiency in their observance, no external duties whatsoever can be properly fulfilled. ",
            "First the arguments from Reason. It is already familiar that man consists of body and soul. Both are among the benefits G-d has bestowed on us. One of these elements of our being is visible and the other is invisible. Therefore, we are accordingly under duty to render the Creator visible and invisible service. The outward service is the observance of the duties of the limbs such as praying, fasting, giving charity, learning the torah and teaching it, making a Sukka, waving a willow branch (on the festival of Sukkot), Tzitzit, Mezuza, Maake, and similar precepts whose performance is completed by the physical limbs.",
            "Inward service, however, consists of the fulfillment of the Duties of the Heart such as: to acknowledge the Unity of G-d in our hearts, believe in Him and His torah, to undertake His service, that we revere Him and humble ourselves before Him, that we love Him, trust in Him, and give over our lives to Him, that we abstain from what He hates, devote our actions to His Name, that we reflect on the benefits He bestows, and similar things which are performed by the thoughts and sentiments of the heart but do not associate with activity of the visible limbs of the body. ",
            "I am certain that [even] the duties of the limbs cannot be performed properly unless they are accompanied by will of the heart, longing of the soul to do them, and desire of the heart to perform them. If it should enter our mind that we are under no obligation to choose the service of G-d and to yearn for it, then we would be exempt from the duties of the limbs for no act can be complete without the agreement of the soul. And since it is clear that the Creator has put us under obligation to perform the duties of the limbs, it would not be reasonable for us to suppose that our soul and heart, the choicest parts of our beings, should have been exempted from serving Him according to the extent of their ability, because their cooperation is required for the complete service of G-d. Therefore, it is clear that we are under obligation to perform outward and inner duties so that our service to the blessed Creator will be whole and complete, including both our inner and outer being. ",
            "After their obligation has become clear to me from the grounds of Reason, I said to myself \"perhaps this matter is not written in the torah, therefore they refrained from writing a book which instructs on it and demonstrates it.\" ",
            "But when I searched in the torah, I found that it is mentioned frequently. For example (Deut. 6:5-6): \"you shall love the L-ord your G-d with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might; And these words, which I command you this day, shall be on your heart\", and \"so that you may love the L-ord your G-d, and that you may hearken to His voice, and that you may cling to Him\" (Deut. 30:20), and \"to love the L-ord your G-d and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul\" (Deut. 11:13), and \"You shall walk after the L-ord your G-d and fear Him\" (Deut. 13:5), and \"you shall love your fellow as yourself\" (Levit.19:18), and \"now, Israel, what does the L-ord your G-d ask of you, but to fear the L-ord your G-d\" (Deut. 10:12), and \"Therefore love the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt\" (Deut. 10:19). And reverence for G-d and love for Him are among the duties of the heart. ",
            "Regarding the negative commandments [of the duties of the heart], the torah wrote: \"nor shall you covet etc\" (Deut. 5:18), \"You shall not avenge, nor bear any grudge\" (Levit. 19:18), \"You shall not hate your fellow in your heart\" (Levit. 19:17), \"and so that you do not seek after your own heart and your own eyes\" (Numbers 15:39), \"you shall not harden your heart nor shut your hand from your poor fellow\" (Deut. 15:7), and many other similar passages.",
            "Afterwards, the Torah reduced all [religious] service to the service of the heart and tongue in saying \"For this commandment which I command you today is not hidden from you, neither is it far off; It is not in Heaven...But the matter is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it\" (Deut.30:11). And in the other books of the prophets, they spoke extensively on the matter and mentioned it in several places. I do not need to mention them because they are numerous and well-known. ",
            "After it had become clear to me that the duties of the heart are obligatory from the Torah and from reason, I searched the matter in the writings of our Sages. I found it to be even more explicit in their words than what is explained in the Torah and derived from reason. Some of them are stated as general principles such as \"G-d wants the heart\" (Sanhedrin 106b), and \"the heart and the eyes are the two agents of sin\" (Yerushalmi Berachos 1:5). Some of them in Tractate Avos, which there is no need to elaborate. I also found many in their traits and habits when they were asked about them as written regarding \"to what do you attribute your long life?\" (Megila 27b).",
            "I found in the Torah regarding one who kills someone unintentionally, no capital punishment is incurred. Likewise, one who performs a sin unintentionally which if intentional would incur either capital punishment or the penalty of Karet (excision), the person had only to bring for them a sin-offering or an asham offering. All this is a clear proof that the essential condition of liability for punishment is the association of mind and body in a forbidden act, the mind by its intention, and the body by its movement.",
            "So too our wise men said: \"whoever performs a religious duty but did not intend to do it for the sake of G-d - he will not receive reward for it.\" ",
            "And since the hinge and pillar of all deeds rests on the foundation of intention and hidden sentiment of the heart, a system of the duties of the heart should precede, by nature, a system of the duties of the limbs. ",
            "After it had become clear to me through Reason, Scripture, and Tradition that the inner science is indeed an obligation, I said to myself, \"perhaps this class of commandments are not obligatory at all times and at all places, similar to shmita, yovel (jubilee year), and [temple] offerings\".",
            "But when I delved deeper into the subject, I found that we are obligated in them constantly, without pause, throughout our lives, and that we have no claim (excuse) whatsoever for neglecting them. This applies to such duties, for example, as acknowledging the Unity of G-d in our hearts, to serve Him inwardly, to revere Him and to love Him, to yearn to fulfill the commandments obligatory upon us, as Scripture says \"O my hope is that my ways are directed to observe Your statutes\" (Ps. 119:5); to trust in Him and surrender ourselves to Him, as written \"trust in Him at all times, pour out your heart before Him\" (Ps.62:9); to remove hatred and jealousy from our hearts, to separate from the superfluous worldly matters which preoccupy us away from the service of G-d - we are under constant duty in all of these things, at all times and in all places, every hour, every second, and under all circumstances, as long as we have life and reason. ",
            "The analogy of this is to a slave whose master charged him with two jobs. One in the house and the other in the field. The latter consisted of cultivating the ground and its care at definite periods and times. When those times are past or if he is unable to work there due to some thing which impedes him, he is then to be relieved of his responsibility for the work in the field. But he is never exempt for the work which he is commanded to do in the house, provided there is no impediment or other matter he must tend to. Hence, he is constantly charged to work the house when he is free to do so. ",
            "Such too is the case for the duties of the heart which are always binding upon us. We have no excuse for their neglect, and there is nothing which impedes us in their fulfillment, except for love of this world, and lack of understanding in regard to our Creator, as written \"they do not consider the work of G-d\" (Isaiah 5:12). ",
            "I said to myself, \"perhaps this class of commandments does not branch out to many commandments. Therefore, they abandoned them and did not compose a book specially devoted to them\". ",
            "But when I investigated, on their number and derivatives, I found their derivatives to be exceedingly numerous until I thought that what David, peace be unto him, said \"I have seen a limit to all perfection, but Your commandment is exceedingly broad\" (Ps. 119:96) was referring to the Duties of the Heart. Because, the Duties of the Limbs are a known number, namely, 613. But the Duties of the Heart are exceedingly numerous until their derivative branches are countless. ",
            "I further said: \"perhaps they are so clear and familiar to everyone, and every person clings to them that a book on the subject is unnecessary\". When, however, I studied the conduct of human beings throughout the ages as recorded in books, I found that they are far from [the knowledge or practice of] this class of commandments, with the exception of some zealous individuals, special elect of them, according to what is recorded about them. But as for the rest, how much were they so in need of exhortation and instruction! And all the more so, for most of the people in our generation, who neglect even the commandments of the limbs, not to mention the commandments of the heart. And if any one of them is roused to devote himself to the study of the Torah, his motive in this is to be called a \"wise man\" by the masses, and to gain for himself a name among the great. And thus he strays from the way of the Torah to things which will neither aid him in ascending spiritually, nor save him from spiritually stumbling. And he studies unnecessary things the ignorance of which he would not be punished for, while he omits to investigate the roots of the religion and the foundations of the Torah, which he should not have ignored nor neglected and without the knowledge and practice of which, no commandment can be properly fulfilled. For example, regarding acknowledging the Unity of G-d, (the question arises) whether we are under duty to examine this by the light of reason or whether it is sufficient if we accept it by tradition alone, namely, that we declare like the simpleton and the fool that \"G-d is One\" without argument or proof. Or, if we are under duty to investigate through rational inquiry the distinction between true Unity versus relative unity, so as to distinguish [the Unity of G-d] from other existing unities which we call \"one\". ",
            "Of this the believer is not permitted by our religion to remain in ignorance, for the Torah exhorts us on this in saying \"Therefore, know this day and consider within your heart, that the L-ord is G-d in Heaven above and on the earth below. There is none other\" (Deut. 4:39).",
            "The same is the case for other commandments of the heart which we have mentioned already or will mention. The believer's faith will not be complete until he knows these duties and practices them. They are the inner science, the light of the heart, and the shining of the soul. On this Scripture says: \"Behold, Thou desirest truth in the inward parts; make me, therefore, to know wisdom in mine inmost heart\" (Ps. 51:8). ",
            "It is said of a Sage who would pass the first half of the day in the company of other people. But when he was alone, he would call out \"O for hidden light\", by which he referred to duties of the heart.",
            "One of the wise men was consulted regarding a strange case on the laws of divorce. He replied to the inquirer: \"you are asking on what will not harm you if you do not know it. Do you already know all that you are under duty to know of the commandments, and that you are not allowed to neglect, and that you should not be negligent of, that you turn to speculate on remote questions which will not avail you of any advancement, nor fix any crookedness in your soul. Behold, I swear, it has been 35 years that I have occupied myself with what is essential to the knowledge and practice of the duties of my religion. You are aware of my great in-depth study and the great library of books I possess. And yet, I have never turned my mind to the matter to which you have directed your attention and about which you inquire.\" And he continued to rebuke and shame him concerning the matter. ",
            "Another Sage said \"I learned to purify my deeds for 25 years.\" ",
            "A third Sage said \"there is wisdom which lies hidden in the hearts of the wise, like secret treasure. If they conceal it, man cannot discover it. If they reveal it, man cannot deny the correctness of their words regarding it. And this is as Scripture says \"wisdom in the heart of man is like deep water, but a man of understanding will draw it out\" (Prov. 20:5), i.e. wisdom is innate in a man's being, in his nature and faculties of perception, like water that is hidden in the depths of the earth. The intelligent and understanding individual will strive to investigate what is in his potential and inward faculties in order to discover and expose this wisdom, and will draw it forth from his heart, just as one searches for water that is in the depths of the earth. ",
            "I once asked a man who was considered among the Torah Sages concerning some of the topics we mentioned regarding the inner wisdom and he replied that on this and similar things, the tradition is sufficient to stand in place of rational inquiry.",
            "I said to him: \"This applies only to those who lack the ability to inquire due to low powers of perception and weakness of understanding, such as women and children, or feeble minded persons (Translator: women used to be much less educated than in our times). But a man who has sufficient power of intellect and perception to attain certainty on the truth of Tradition, and he neglected to investigate this due to laziness or due to holding in light esteem the commandments of G-d and His Torah - certainly he will be punished for this and he sins for having neglected them. ",
            "This matter is similar to [the following illustration]. An officer was charged by the king to receive money from the officials of his kingdom. The king gave him special instructions to count the coins, weigh them, and verify their quality. The officer was sufficiently intelligent and skilled to fulfill all that the king had commanded him. But the royal servants cunningly befriended him with words until he trusted in them. They brought the money to him and assured him that it was correct in amount, weight, and quality. He believed them and was too lazy to verify for himself the truth of their words thereby transgressing the king's orders. When the matter reached the king, he ordered that the money be brought before him. When the king questioned the officer as to the total count and weight of the money, he could not answer. Though the amount of money may have been correct, the king condemned him for having been lax in his command in relying on the words of the servant in something he could have obtained certainty for himself. Only if he was not skilled enough to make an accounting, would he not have been found guilty for relying on the servants.",
            "So too, if you were not capable of grasping this subject with your reasoning faculties, as is the case regarding reasons for received commandments, then your excuse for refraining from this inquiry would be valid. Likewise, if your mind falls short and your perception is too weak to understand it, you would not be punished for your neglect, and you would be considered like children and women, who accept it from the Tradition. But if you are a man of intellect and understanding, who is capable of obtaining certainty on what you have received from the Sages and prophets regarding the roots of the religion and the pivots of the deeds, you are then commanded to use your intellect until you comprehend the matter so that it will be clear to you from both tradition and Reason. But if you ignore this and are negligent in it, you will be considered as falling short in your duties to the blessed Creator. ",
            "This will be explained in two ways:",
            "Firstly, from what Scripture says \"if there arise a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, between affliction and affliction...and you shall do according to the sentence which they declare to you\" (Deut. 17:8-10). If you examine what subjects are included in the first verse, you will find they are things which need to be detailed, distinguished, and discussed by the method of Tradition, and not by that of logical demonstration from Reason alone. You can see, the verse does not include matters which can be attained through Reason. For he did not say, for example, \"when you have a question on the Unity of G-d\"; or regarding the Names and attributes of the Creator, or as to any of the roots of the religion, such as the service of G-d, trusting in Him, submission before Him, devoting activities to Him, purifying conduct from the damage of detrimental things, repentance from sins, fear and love of Him, being abashed before Him, making a spiritual accounting, and similar duties which can be fulfilled through reason and recognition. He did not say to accept them on the authority of the Torah Sages and to rely only on the Tradition. On the contrary, Scripture says in regard to these to reflect on them to your heart and to apply your intellect on them after having first accepted them from the Tradition, which covers all the commandments of the Torah, their roots and branches. You should investigate them with your intellect, understanding, and judgment, until you will sift the truth of it from the false [notions], as written \"therefore, know this day and consider it within your heart, that the L-ord, He is G-d\" (Deut. 4:39). ",
            "Likewise, we will say regarding all that we are capable of grasping by Reason, as our Sages said (Rabbi Yishmael's 7th rule of expounding the Torah) \"if anything included in a general proposition is made the subject of a special statement, whatever is proclaimed of that special statement is not to be understood as limited to itself, but is applied to the whole of the general proposition\". Knowing the Unity of G-d is but one branch of the topics which can be understood by Reason. And as it is our duty to use this method on this topic (of G-d's Unity), it is equally our duty to do so with all of them. ",
            "The second argument is drawn from Scripture says: \"Have you not known? Have you not heard, that the everlasting God\" (Isaiah 40:28). It says \"known\" which implies knowledge from rational proofs, and afterwards \"heard\" which implies from the Tradition. And likewise, \"Have you not known? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning?\" (Isaiah 40:21). The prophet preceded mentioning knowledge from rational proof to knowledge which is from received tradition. And likewise Moses, our teacher, said: \"Do you thus requite the L-ord, Oh foolish and unwise people? Is He not your Father who acquired you? Has He not made you and established you? Remember the days of old; consider the years of many generations. Ask your father, and he will show you; your elders, and they will tell you.\" (Deut. 32:6). This is a proof to what we mentioned, that despite that the Tradition should be preceded by nature, for the students must learn it first, nevertheless, it is not right to rely solely on it for one who is able to comprehend it by the method of rational demonstration. It is therefore proper, that everyone who is capable of this, is under duty to investigate with his intellect and to bring logical proofs of it by the demonstration which deliberate judgment would support. ",
            "After I had become convinced that the commandments of the heart are indeed obligatory, and that, on grounds we mentioned, we are obligated in them, I found that these duties had been neglected and that no book had been composed specifically on them. I contemplated on the condition of low observance of them from my contemporaries due to their inability to comprehend them, and hence, all the more so, were they unable to perform them or toil in them. I was stirred by the grace of G-d to inquire into the inner science. ",
            "I also noticed from the practice of our Sages, and from their sayings that we have received, that they were more zealous and engaged in their personal duties than in developing inferences of laws and remote, doubtful questions. ",
            "Their efforts were first spent on determining the general principles of judgment, to make clear what is permitted and what is forbidden. ",
            "Afterwards, they busied and strove to clarify their active obligations and inward duties. If a strange case came before them that belonged to the class of inferences from existing laws, they investigated it at the time it was presented to them, and deduced the law from the principles known to them. But they never troubled their minds for these things before this for they regarded secular matters lightly. ",
            "And when they needed to render a ruling on that matter, if the ruling was clear to them from the Tradition transmitted to them by the prophets, they would rule on that basis. If it was a question which required expounding the Tradition, they would investigate it with the light of reason. If they all agreed together, they would give a ruling. But if there was a disagreement on the ruling, they would rule according to the majority opinion, as written by the Sanhedrin (Talmud Sanhedrin 88b): \"when a question was posed to them, if they had a tradition on it, they gave the decision right away. If they differed, they took a vote. If the majority ruled the thing was clean, it was declared clean. If the majority ruled it unclean, it was declared unclean. This was according to the principle they received 'the decision follows the majority'\". They composed in Tractate Avot, the traditions of the moral principles and ethical standards of the Rabbis as taught by each of them in his time and place. ",
            "The reports of the men of the Talmud regarding their teachers, are enough to demonstrate the depth of their wisdom and great toil in purifying their deeds. For instance (Berachot 20a): \"Said R. Papa to Abaye: How is it that for the former generations miracles were performed and for us miracles are not performed? It cannot be because of their [superiority in] study, because in the years of Rab Judah the whole of their studies was confined to Nezikin (the mishna order of monetary damages), while we study all six Orders...And yet when Rab Judah drew off one shoe, rain used to come, whereas we torment ourselves and cry loudly, and no notice is taken of us! He replied: The former generations used to be ready to sacrifice their lives for the sanctity of [G-d's] Name; we do not sacrifice our lives for the sanctity of [G-d's] Name\", and (Avodah Zara 17b): \"he who only studies the Torah, is like a man who is without a G-d, as it is said (Chronicles II 15:3) 'Now for long seasons, Israel was without the true G-d'. Hence, Torah study must be combined with acts of kindness\". ",
            "Thus it became clear to me that all the roots of deeds which one intends for His Name are founded on purity of heart and mind and singleness of mind. Where the motive is tainted, good deeds, however numerous and diligent, are not accepted; as Scripture says \"even when you make many prayers, I will not hear. Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your doings from before My eyes; cease to do evil\" (Isaiah 1:16). And, \"but the matter is very near to you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it\" (Deut. 30:14), and \"give Me your heart, and let your eyes keep My ways\" (Prov. 23:26). And our wise men have said: \"if you give Me your eyes and heart, I know that you are Mine\" (Yerushalmi Berachos 1:5); and Scripture says \"you shall not wander after your hearts and after your eyes\" (Numbers 15:39), and \"with what shall I come before the L-ord and bow myself before G-d on high? Shall I come with Olah offerings?\" (Micha 6:6), and the answer given was \"He has told you, O man, what is good, and what the L-ord demands of you; but to do justice, to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your G-d\" (ibid 6:8); and \"but let him that glories glory in this, that he understands and knows Me, that I am the L-ord doing kindness, justice, and righteousness\" (Jer. 9:23). The explanation is that a man who glories should glory in comprehending G-d's ways, recognizing His beneficence, reflecting on His creation, realizing His might and wisdom, as manifested in His works. All these verses which I have brought are proofs on the obligatory character of the commandments of the heart and the discipline of the soul. ",
            "You should realize that the aim and value of the duties of the heart is that our exterior and interior be equal and consistent in the service of G-d, so that the testimony of the heart, tongue, and limbs be alike, and that they support and confirm each other instead of differing and contradicting each other. This is what Scripture calls \"tamim\" (innocent/perfect), in saying: \"You shall be perfect with the L-ord your G-d\" (Deut. 18:13), and \"Noah was a righteous man and perfect in his generations\" (Gen. 6:9), and \"he who walks uprightly, and works righteousness, and speaks the truth in his heart\" (Ps. 15:2), and \"I will give heed unto the way of integrity..I will walk within my house with a perfect heart\" (Ps. 101:2).",
            "On the other hand, one whose inner [being] is not consistent with his outer [life] is condemned by Scripture, as written: \"his heart was not whole with the L-ord, his G-d\" (Kings 11:4), and \"but they flatter Him with their mouths and lied with their tongues. For their heart was not steadfast with Him\" (Ps. 78:36).",
            "It is well known, that whoever exhibits conflicting or contradictory behavior in word or deed - people do not believe in his integrity and have no confidence in his truthfulness. Likewise, if our exterior conflicts with our interior, if our heart's intent conflicts with our words, if our physical activities are not consistent with the convictions of our soul - our service to our G-d will not be whole, for He will not accept from us fraudulent service, as written \"I cannot [bear] iniquity with assembly\" (Isaiah 1:13), and \"For I am the L-ord, Who loves justice, hates robbery in a burnt offering\" (Isaiah 61:8), and \"if you offer a blind [animal] for sacrifice, is it not evil? And if you offer the lame and the sick, is it not evil? Bring it now to your governor. Will he accept you, or lift up your face\" (Malachi 1:8), and \"Behold, to obey is better than a peace-offering; to hearken (is better) than the fat of rams\" (Samuel 15:22). ",
            "Hence, one commandment, according to the heart and intent with which it is performed, can outweigh many commandments, and likewise one transgression can outweigh many transgressions. Even the thought to do a commandment and the yearning to do it out of reverence for G-d, despite that one was unable to actually perform it, may, nevertheless, outweigh many commandments performed without this reverence, as G-d said to David: \"because it was in your heart to build a house for My Name\" (Chronicles II 6:8), and \"then the G-d fearing men spoke to one another, and the L-ord hearkened and heard it. And a book of remembrance was written before Him for those who feared the L-ord and for those who thought upon His Name\" (Malachi 3:16), and our Sages expounded the last words (Shabbat 63a): \"what is meant by 'thought upon His Name?' - [answer:] \"if one intended to fulfill a commandment but was prevented from doing it, it is accounted to him as if he had done it.\" ",
            "When these arguments from Reason, Scripture, and Tradition dawned on me, I began to train myself in them, and I undertook on myself the task of knowing and practicing them. The discovery of one principle revealed another related to it, which in turn led to a third, until the matter became broad and it was difficult for me to retain it always in mind. I feared that I might forget what I had already thought out, and that what had become solid shaped in my mind might dissolve, especially since in our times there are so few helping on this wisdom. I decided to compose a book on them which would include their roots and surrounding divisions, and much of their derivatives; and so I would always urge myself to know them and obligate myself to do them.",
            "Where my practice was consistent with my words, I thank G-d who helped me in this, and taught me His ways. But where my practice was inconsistent with my words and fell short of attaining this, I blame and rebuke my soul, and argue with it, so that from the standard of righteousness set forth in this work, my soul might realize its own iniquity, and from its standard of justness, its own deviation, and from its uprightness, its own perverseness, and from the perfection there taught, its own short-comings. ",
            "I saw proper to make the book one of permanent value, a hidden treasure, a lamp to illuminate men's paths and teach them the path in which they should go. I hoped that the book would be of still greater use to others than to myself, and of greater beneficial instruction to others than to my own benefit of fulfilling my wish.",
            "I said to myself that I will compose a book on this subject that would be systematically divided according to the roots of the duties of the heart and the inner commandments; be comprehensive and adequate to the matters, point out the good and right way; serve as a guide to the customs of the earlier Sages and the discipline of the pious; awaken men from their senseless sleep; delve in detail into the depths of this wisdom; recall to men the knowledge of G-d and of His Torah, promote the salvation of the soul; encourage the observant, stir up the negligent, set the eager on the right road, straighten the early, guide beginners and show the way to the perplexed. ",
            "But when I thought of proceeding to carry out my decision to write this book, I saw that a man like myself is not fit to compose a work like this. I estimated that my strength was insufficient to properly divide its parts, the subject appearing too vast to my eyes, my knowledge too inadequate, and my intellectual faculties too weak to grasp the topics. Furthermore, I am not proficient in the subtleties of the Arabic language which it would need to be in, due to this being the easiest language for most of my contemporaries to grasp. I feared that I would be toiling at a task which would only serve to demonstrate my deficiencies and that I would thus be exceeding proper bounds of discretion. I therefore, told my soul to retract the thought and to draw back from what it had resolved on. ",
            "When I then decided to relieve myself of the burden of this undertaking and give up my plan of composing this work, I again suspected my soul of having chosen tranquility, to dwell in the abode of laziness, in peace and quiet. I feared that perhaps this decision to abandon the project stemmed from the lust for pleasure, and that this is what had inclined me to the way of peace and tranquility, to decide to abandon this in order to sit in the company of laziness. ",
            "I knew that many great works were lost due to fear, and many losses were caused by concern. I remembered the saying: \"it is part of prudence not to be overly prudent\". I told myself, if every person who ever composed a good work or who ever taught the upright and proper path had waited until all his wishes were fulfilled, no person would have ever uttered a word after the prophets, whom G-d had chosen as His agents and strengthened with His divine help. If every person who had wished to attain all good qualities but was unable to attain them, had abandoned whatever he could attain of them, then all human beings would be devoid of all good and lacking all excellencies. They would have been perpetually pursuing after false hopes, the paths of righteousness would have been desolate, and the abodes of kindliness would have been abandoned. ",
            "I understood that while men's souls lust greatly to attain evil ends, they are sluggish to toil in the pursuit of what is noble. They are lazy in seeking the good, and always walk in the paths of laughter and rejoicing. ",
            "If a vision of lust appears to them and beckons to them, they invent falsehoods so that they may turn to it. They bolster up its arguments to make its deception seem upright, to strengthen its lies, to make firm its looseness. But when the light of truth invitingly shines before them, they make up idle pretexts to refrain from turning to it. They argue against it, declare its courses misleading and contradict its assertions, so as to make it appear inconsistent and thus have an excuse to part from it. Every man's enemy is between his own ribs. Unless, he has an aid from G-d, a rebuker always ready for [rebuking] his soul, a powerful governor, that will harness his soul with the saddle of service, and will muzzle it with the bridle of righteousness, strike it with the stick of discipline; and when he resolves to do good, he should not delay, and if his heart entices him to a different path, he should scold it and overpower it. ",
            "Therefore, I found myself obligated to force my soul to bear the task of composing this book, and resolved to expound its topics with whatever language or analogy would make the matters readily understandable. Among all the duties of the heart, I will only mention those which suggest themselves to me, and will not trouble to expound all of them, so that the book will not be too long. I will, however, cite among the things necessary for the clarification of each of its roots in the section allocated to it. And from G-d, the true Unity, may I receive aid. On Him, I place my trust and to Him I ask to teach me the right path which He desires, and which is pleasing and acceptable to Him, in word and deed, in inner and outer conduct. ",
            "When my deliberation was complete, and I finally resolved to write it, I laid its foundations. I built it on a basis of ten principles, which cover all of the Duties of the Heart and accordingly divided the book into ten parts, each part designated for one principle, discussing its scope and divisions, the things it depends on, and the things detrimental to it.",
            "I propose to take the most direct (easiest) method of arousing, teaching, and instructing, using language clear, direct, and familiar, so that my words will be more easily understood. I will refrain from deep language, unusual terms, and the arguments in the way of \"defeat\" (nitzuach), which the logicians call in arabic \"Algidal\", and likewise for remote inquiries which cannot be resolved in this work, for I only brought such arguments as are satisfactory and convincing according to the methods proper to the science of theology. ",
            "As the philosopher said \"it is not proper to seek of every inquiry a conclusion in the way of mofet (irrefutable proof), since not every topic in rational inquiry can be demonstrated to this extent. Likewise, we should not be satisfied in the science of nature with the method of 'sufficient' (since a full \"raya\" proof can be achieved). Nor in the science of theology should we strive to apprehend with the senses or draw comparisons with physical phenomena.\" Nor should we require logical demonstration of the first principles in nature. Nor should we require logical demonstration of the first demonstrations of the first principles.",
            "If we carefully avoid these things, it will be easier for us to achieve our aims. If we do not do so, we will stray from our subject, and it will be difficult for us to achieve our intended purpose.",
            "Since this work is of theological character, I have refrained from the methods of demonstration usual in the sciences of logic and mathematics except in the first gate, where possibly the subtlety of the inquiry compels resort to these methods.",
            "I have drawn most of my proofs from propositions which are accepted as reasonable and these I have made clear by familiar examples about which there can be no doubt. I supported them with what I found written in Scripture and afterwards with the words of tradition received from our Sages. I quoted also the pious and wise of other nations whose words have come down to us, hoping that my readers' hearts would incline to them and give heed to their wisdom, as for example, the words of philosophers, the ethical teachings of the ascetics, and their praiseworthy customs. Our Rabbis have already said regarding this (Sanhedrin 39b):",
            "\"One verse says: 'after the ways of the surrounding nations you have done' (Ezek. 11:12), while in another verse it says [in contradiction] 'after the ways of the surrounding nations you have not done' (Ezek. 5:7). How can this be reconciled? As follows - their good ways you have not copied; their evil ones you have followed.\"",
            "Likewise, the Rabbis said (Megila 16a): \"whoever says a wise thing, even among the gentiles is considered a Sage\". They also said regarding bringing analogies to make difficult concepts easier to understand: \"he taught it by signs and explained it by analogies\" (Eruvin 21b); and the wise man said: \"to understand a parable and figure, the words of the wise and their riddles\" (Prov. 1:6).",
            "When I accepted to undertake the task of composing this book on the divisions of the duties of the heart, I set my mind to select those which were most comprehensive and which would lead to the rest.",
            "I set their chief root, and great foundation to be the wholehearted acceptance of G-d's Unity. Afterwards, I examined which of the duties of the heart are most fitting to be joined to the [wholehearted acceptance of the] Unity of G-d. I fully realized that as the Creator is the true Unity, and is subject to neither essence nor incident, it is impossible for us to grasp Him from the aspect of His glorious essence. We are therefore forced to know and grasp Him from the aspect of His creations. This is the topic of the second treatise, the Gate of Examination of G-d's works. I therefore made this examination the second root of the general principles of the duties of the heart.",
            "I then reflected on the sovereignty belonging to the true Unity, and what service is correspondingly due to Him from His creatures. I therefore set the assuming of His service as the third root of the general principles of the duties of the heart. ",
            "It then became clear to me, what is proper regarding the true Unity, that as He alone rules all things and all the benefits and harms we receive come from Him and are under His permission, we are in duty bound to put our trust in Him and to surrender ourselves over to Him. I therefore made Trust in G-d as the fourth root of the general principles of the duties of the heart. ",
            "Afterwards, I pondered on the conception of absolute Unity, that as G-d is unique in His glory, has nothing in common with anything, nor resembles anything else, we must therefore join to this that we serve Him alone, and that we devote all activities to Him, since He does not accept worship which is associated with other than Him. Therefore, I placed the devoting of acts to G-d as the fifth root of the general principles of the duties of the heart. ",
            "Afterwards, when my thoughts continued pondering as to what we owe to the true Unity regarding proclaiming His glory and greatness. Since there is none like Him, therefore we decided to join to this - humbling ourselves before Him to the utmost of our ability. Hence, I made Humility/Submission the sixth root of the general principles of the duties of the heart. ",
            "When I reflected on what happens to human beings, that they neglect and fall short of what service they owe to the blessed Creator, and the path with which they can rectify their crookedness and shortcomings, namely repentance and beseeching for forgiveness, I therefore placed Repentance as the seventh root of the general principles of the duties of the heart.",
            "When I sought to grasp what our inner and outer duties to G-d truly are, and realized that it is impossible for us to fulfill them until we bring ourselves to an accounting on them before G-d and are meticulous in this, I made the spiritual accounting the eighth root of the general principles of the duties of the heart.",
            "When I meditated on the matter of the true Unity, I saw that the wholehearted acknowledgement of His Unity cannot possibly endure even in the soul of the believer, if his heart is drunk with the wine of love of this world and he inclines to the material pleasures. But if he strives to empty his heart and liberate his mind from the superfluities of this world and separate himself from its luxuries, only then will he completely accept G-d's Unity and rise to its level. I therefore set Abstinence as the ninth root of the general principles of the duties of the heart.",
            "Afterwards, I inquired on what we are obligated to the blessed Creator, who is the goal of all our desires and the purpose of all our hopes and with whom all things begin and end, and as to what is due to Him from us in regard to the love of His favor and fear of His retribution, the former being the highest good and the latter being the greatest evil, as Scripture says \"For His anger is only a moment; in His favor is life; Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning\" (Ps. 30:6), I therefore placed love of G-d as the tenth root of the general principles of the duties of the heart. ",
            "After I arrived at these principles by Reasoning, I searched our Scriptures and traditions and found them indicated in many places. I will explain each of them in their respective treatise with G-d's help. I named the book, with a title which reflects my aim in writing it. It is called the Instruction of the Duties of the Heart.",
            "My goal in this book is to obtain wisdom for myself and at the same time, to stir the simple and the negligent among the followers of our Torah and those who have inherited the precepts of our religion, by bringing sufficient proofs which reason can testify as to their soundness and truth and which will only be disputed by the hypocritical and false people, because to such people truth is a burden on them and their desire is to make things easier on themselves. I will not trouble myself to answer them because my purpose in this book was not to refute those who dispute the fundamentals of our faith. My aim is rather to bring to light what is already fixed in our minds and embedded in our souls of the fundamentals of our religion and the cornerstones of the Torah. When we arouse our minds to ponder them, their truth becomes clear to us inwardly and their lights will illuminate even our exterior.",
            "The following is an analogy for this: An astrologer entered the courtyard of his friend and divined that there is a hidden treasure in it. He searched for it and found masses of silver that had turned black due to a crust of rust which had formed on it. He took a small portion, scrubbed it with vinegar and salt, washed and polished it until it had regained its original luster, splendor and shine. Afterwards, the owner [of the courtyard] gave orders that the rest of the treasure should be treated so.",
            "My intent is to do the same with the hidden treasures of the heart, namely, to reveal them, and demonstrate their shining excellence, in order that anyone who wishes to draw close to G-d and cling to Him may do the same.",
            "When, my brother, you have read this book, and comprehended its theme, take it for a remembrance. Bring your soul to a true judgement. Ponder it over, develop its thoughts. Cling it to your heart and mind. If you find an error in it, correct it; any omission, complete it. Have intent [when reading it] to follow its instruction and guidance. Do not have the aim of acquiring a name or to gain glory through its wisdom. Judge me leniently if you find any mistake, flaw, or whatever other shortcoming in its topics and words. For I hurried to compose it and did not tarry because I feared that death would overcome me and prevent me from my goal of completing it. You know how weak is the power of flesh to attain anything, and how deficient is man from fully grasping, as Scripture says: \"Surely the sons of men are vanity; the sons of men are a lie; if they go up in the scales; they are altogether lighter than vanity\" (Ps. 62:10). I have already confessed from the outset on my insufficient strength. Let this admission atone for the errors and flaws in it. ",
            "You should know that all the Duties of the Heart and all disciplines of the soul, whether positive or negative, fall within these ten roots which I have composed in this book, just like many of the commandments fall under the precepts of \"love your fellow as yourself\" (Levit. 19:18), and under \"he did no evil to his fellow\" (Ps. 15:3), and under \"turn from evil and do good\" (Ps. 34:15).",
            "Fix them to your mind. Return them to your thoughts continuously. Their derivatives will be made known to you, with G-d's help, when He will see your heart desiring in them and inclining to them, as written: \"Who is the man who fears the L-ord? Him will he instruct in the way that he should choose\" (Ps. 25:12). ",
            "I saw fitting to conclude the introduction of this book with a wondrous parable, which will stimulate you to study its content, and arouse you to realize the special importance of this class of commandments over the others, as well as the difference between the level of the physical, philosophical, and linguistic wisdoms to the level of the wisdom of the Torah. Try to understand this parable when you read it. Recall it to your thoughts. You will find what you seek with G-d's help.",
            "A king distributed balls of silk to his servants to check their intelligence. The industrious and sensible one sorted from the balls of silk allotted to him and selected the best quality ones. He then did the same with the remaining ones until he divided all of his portion into three grades - fine, medium, and coarse. He then made from each grade the best that could be done with it and had the material done by skilled craftsmen into expensive garments of various colors and styles, which he wore in the presence of the king, selecting garments suitable to the occasion and place.",
            "The foolish among the king's servants used all the balls of silk to make that which the wise servant had made with the worst sort. He sold it for whatever he could get for it, and hastily squandered the money in good food and drink or the like.",
            "When the matter came to the king, he was pleased with the deeds of the industrious and sensible one, drew him closer, and promoted him to a position of one of his treasured servants. The deeds of the foolish servant were evil in his eyes, and the king banished him to the faraway desert lands of his kingdom to dwell among those who had incurred the king's anger.",
            "Likewise, the blessed Al-mighty gave His Torah of truth to His servants to test them. The thinking, intelligent man, when he reads it and understands it clearly, will divide it into three divisions. The first is the knowledge of fine spiritual themes, namely, the inner wisdom, such as the duties of the heart, the discipline of the soul and will obligate his soul on them always. Afterwards, he will select the second portion, namely, the practical duties of the limbs, doing each one in its proper time and place. Afterwards, he will make use of the third division, the historical portions of Scripture, to know the various types of men and their happenings in historical order, and the events of past ages and their hidden messages. He will use every part according to its proper occasion, place, and need.",
            "Just like the industrious servant provided skilled craftsmen's tools in order to carry out his intentions in the manufacture of the silk of the king, so too, in each of these divisions, the intelligent man will use the help of the practical sciences, the science of logic, the science of language, etc. which he will employ as introductory to the science of theology. For one who is not knowledgeable in them cannot recognize the wisdom of the Creator in nature, and will not know the physical workings of his own body, much less for what is outside himself. ",
            "The foolish and distracted person when he occupies himself with the Book of G-d, uses it to learn riddles of the ancients or the historical accounts. He hastens to apply it for worldly benefits and will bring arguments from it to justify pursuing worldly pleasures, abandoning the way of abstinence (from the superfluous), going in his own way, and following the views and wishes of each type of person he meets, as written \"he shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray\" (Prov. 5:23).

            "Introduction": [
                "The author says: After investigating after what is the most necessary of the cornerstones and fundamentals of our religion, we found that the wholehearted acceptance of the unity of G-d is the root and foundation of Judaism. It is the first of the gates of the Torah, and it differentiates between the believer and the heretic. It is the head and front of religious truth, and one who strays from it - will not be able to perform religious deeds and his faith will not endure.",
                "Because of this, G-d's first words to us at Mount Sinai were: \"I am the L-ord your G-d...you shall not have other gods before Me\", and later on He exhorted us through His prophet saying: (Shema Yisrael..) <i>\"Hear O Israel the L-ord, is our G-d, the L-ord is One\"</i> (Deut. 6:4)",
                "You should study this chapter of Shema Yisrael until its close, and you will see how its words move from one matter to another, encompassing 10 matters, that number corresponding to the Ten Commandments. The explanation is as follows:",
                "First there is the command to believe in the Creator, when it says <i>\"Hear O Israel the L-ord\"</i>. His intent was not for hearing of the ear, but rather for belief and acceptance of the heart, as the verse says <i>\"we will do and we will hear\" </i>(Ex. 24:7), and <i>\"Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it\" </i>(Deut. 6:3), and similarly for all other verses which come in this way using a term denoting \"hearing\", the intent is only to bring to belief and acceptance.",
                "After He placed us under obligation to believe in the reality of His existence (through rational investigation for those capable as in ch.3), we are then called upon to believe that He is our G-d, as indicated in the word \"our G-d\", and afterwards He commanded us to believe that He [alone] is truly one, in saying: \"G-d is one\" .",
                "After He bid us to believe and accept these three principles we mentioned, He proceeded to what is incumbent on us to follow them with, namely, to love G-d wholeheartedly, in private and in public, with our life and with our might, as He said: <i>\"And you shall love the L-ord your G-d with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might\" </i>(Deut. 6:5). I intend to clarify this matter in the Gate of Love of G-d (Gate #10), with the Al-mighty's help.",
                "Afterwards, He moved on to exhort on the duties of the heart, in saying: <i>\"And these words, which I command you this day, shall be on your heart\"</i>, which means to cleave them to your heart, and believe them in your inner being.",

But since we cannot conceive that something less than one can bring anything into existence, we conclude that the Creator must be one.

If it were possible that it could have been written with less than one person, we would consider this possibility. And even though it is possible that it was written by more than one person, it is not proper to consider this unless there is evidence which testifies to this, such as different handwriting style in part of the letter or the like.",

And since He cannot be seen, it is impossible to find Him and know Him except through the proofs and observations of His handiworks which point to Him.

If we conceive something plural with our intellect or perceive it through our senses, we will know with certainty that unity preceded it, just like when counting things, the number one precedes the rest of the numbers. Whoever thinks the Creator is more than one, must therefore nevertheless concede that there was a preceding unity, just as the numeral one precedes the other numbers, and just like the notion of unity precedes that of plurality. Hence, the Creator is absolutely One, and Eternal (Kadmon), and none is Eternal but He as written: \"Before Me no G-d was formed, nor shall any be after Me\" (Isaiah 43:10).",

Plurality is an incidental property ascribed to the Etzem (essence), and comes under the category of \"Kamus\" (quantity). Since He is the Creator of essence and incident, none of these attributes can be ascribed to His glorious Being. For, it having been clearly demonstrated through scripture and reason that the Creator is above and beyond all comparison with, and similarity to, any of His creations, and seeing that plurality which adheres to the essence of anything that is plural is an incidental property - this property cannot be fittingly ascribed to the Creator's glorious Essence. And if He cannot be described as plural, He must certainly be One because there is nothing in between the two possibilities, as Chana said: \"There is none holy as the L-ord: for there is none beside You\" (Shmuel I 2:2).",

Instead of saying \"the first day\", the verse uses the term \"one (day)\", because the term \"one\" refers to any beginning unprecedented by any other beginning.

                    "We ascribe to Him these three attributes and speak of them in order to indicate His Being and true existence, to call attention to His glory, to make human beings understand that they have a Creator whom they are under duty to serve.",
                    "We must ascribe to Him \"existence\", for His existence is demonstrated by proofs based on the evidence of His handiworks, as written: <i>\"Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who has created these things? He that brings out their host by number: He calls them all by name. By the greatness of His might, and for He is strong in power; not one fails\" </i>(Isaiah 40:26).",
                    "We must necessarily ascribe existence to Him because it is a principle accepted by our reason that for something which is non-existent no action or result can come. Since His works and creations are manifest, His existence is equally manifest to our intellect.",
                    "We ascribe to Him Eternity (no beginning), because rational arguments have demonstrated that the world must have a First (cause) which had no previous cause before it and a Beginning which had no prior beginning. It has been demonstrated that the number of causes cannot be infinite. It logically follows, that the Creator is the First Beginning before whom there is no Beginning, and this is what is meant by His Eternity, as written: <i>\"From everlasting to everlasting, You are G-d\" </i>(Ps. 90:2), and <i>\"before Me there was no god formed, neither shall any be after Me\" </i>(Isaiah 43:10).",
                    "Regarding declaring of Him that He is One, we have already sufficiently demonstrated this by well known arguments and it has been established by clear evidence, that true Unity is inseparable from His glorious essence. This unity implies absence of plurality in His Being, the absence of change, transformation, incident, origin or destruction, joining or removal, comparison or association or any other properties of things that are plural.",
                    "It is necessary for you to understand that these attributes do not imply any kind of change in His glorious essence, but only to denote a negation of their opposite. What the attribution of them should convey in our minds is that the Creator of the world is neither plural, nor non-existent, nor created",
                    "Likewise it is necessary for you to understand that each one of these three attributes we mentioned implies the other two, when we analyze them. The explanation of this is as follows:",
                    "When true Unity is the inseparable and permanent property of a thing, that thing must necessarily also be Eternally Existing (without beginning), since that which is non-existent cannot be ascribed neither unity nor plurality. Hence if true (absolute) Unity is the attribute of any thing and essentially belongs to it, it logically follows that the attribute of Existence with its implications also belongs to it. It must also be Eternal (eternally existing) because true (absolute) unity neither comes into existence nor passes out of existence, neither changes nor is transformed. Hence, it must be Eternal, for it has no beginning. Hence, that which the matter of true Unity belongs has also the attributes of Existence and Eternity.",
                    "So too, we say that the attribute of permanent Existence, attributed to a thing, implies the attribution to it of absolute Unity and Eternity (without beginning).",
                    "It implies absolute Unity since that which permanently Exists could not have come into existence from nothing, and cannot pass from the state of existence into that of non-existence. Such a thing is not plural since that which is plural is not permanently existent, as it must have been preceded by Unity. Therefore, that which exists permanently is not plural, and is accordingly, One.",
                    "The attribute of Eternity (without beginning) also belongs to it, since that which exists permanently has neither beginning nor end, and is accordingly Eternal.",
                    "So too, we assert that the attribute of Eternity, belonging to any Being, also implies in that Being, the attributes of absolute Unity and permanent existence.",
                    "It implies Unity, since that which is Eternal has no beginning, and that which has no beginning is not plural, since all things plural have a beginning, namely, a (parent) unity. Therefore, that which is plural is not Eternal, and that which is Eternal can only be One. Therefore, the attribute of absolute Unity is implied in the attribute of Eternity.",
                    "Likewise, the attribute of existence is implied in that of Eternity. For the non-existent cannot be described as either Eternal or created.",
                    "We have clarified that these three attributes are one in meaning and imply the same thing. They do not imply any change in the Creator's glorious essence, nor do they imply any incidental property or plurality in His being, because all that we are to understand by them is that the Creator is neither non-existent, nor created, nor plural. If we could express His being in a single word which would denote all three of these attributes as they are understood by the intellect so that these three attributes would arise in our mind when the one word was used, we would use that word to express it. But since we do not find such a word in any of the spoken languages which would designate the true conception of G-d, we are forced to express it with more than one word.",
                    "This plurality in the Creator's attributes does not, however, exist in His glorious essence but is due to inadequacy of language on the part of the speaker to express the conception in one term. You must understand that, regarding the Creator, there is none like Him, and whatever attributes we speak of regarding Him, you are to infer from them the denial of their opposite. As Aristotle said \"negating attributes of G-d gives a truer conception of Him than affirming attributes\". For all affirmative attributes ascribed to G-d must necessarily ascribe properties of Etzem (essence) or Mikre (incidental properties), and He who created etzem and mikre has not the properties of His creatures in His glorious essence. But the denial of such properties to Him is undoubtedly true and appropriate to Him. For He is above all attributes and forms, similarity or comparison. Therefore, you must understand from these attributes that they refer to the negation of their opposites.",
                    "THE ACTIVE ATTRIBUTES<br>The active attributes of G-d are those which we speak of the Creator with reference to His works. It is possible, when speaking of them, to associate Him with some of His creations. We were permitted, however, to ascribe these attributes to Him because of the forced necessity to acquaint ourselves with, and realize His existence, in order that we assume on ourselves the duty of His service.",
                    "We have already found that the Torah and the books of the Prophets extensively use these active attributes, as also in the Psalms of prophets and saints. They are used in two manners:",
                    "One, attributes which denote physical form such as in the verse \"So G-d created man in His own image, in the image of G-d, He created man\" (Gen. 1:27), \"for G-d made man in His image\" (Gen. 9:6), \"by the word of G-d\" (Numbers 9:18), \"I, even My hands, have stretched out the heavens\" (Isaiah 45:12), \"in the ears of G-d\" (Numbers 11:1), \"under His feet\" (Ex. 24:10), \"the arm of G-d\" (Isaiah 51:9), \"who has not taken My soul in vain\" (Ps. 24:4), \"in the eyes of G-d\" (Gen. 6:8), \"G-d said in His heart\" (Gen. 8:21), and other similar verses regarding physical limbs.",
                    "Two, attributes which denote bodily movements and actions, as written: \"and G-d smelled the pleasing aroma\" (Gen. 8:21), \"And the L-ord saw...and the L-ord regretted\" (Gen. 6:5-6), \"and G-d came down\" (Gen. 11:5), \"and G-d remembered\" (ibid 8:1), \"and G-d heard\" (Numbers 11:1), \"Then the L-ord awakened as one out of sleep,\" (Ps. 78:65), and many more activities of human beings like these attributed to Him.",
                    "Our Rabbis, when expounding the scriptures, paraphrased the expressions used for this class attributes and were careful to render them in an honorable way, and ascribed them all to the \"glory of the Creator\". For example, the verse \"behold G-d stood over him\" (Gen. 28:13), they rendered - \"the glory of G-d was present with him\"; \"and G-d saw\" (ibid 6:5), they rendered - \"it was revealed before G-d\"; \"and G-d came down\" (ibid 11:5)- \"the glory of G-d was revealed\"; \"and G-d went up\" (ibid 35:13) - \"the glory of G-d departed from him\".",
                    "They rendered everything in a reverential way, and avoided attributing them to the Creator in order not to ascribe to Him any kind of physicality or incidental property.",
                    "The great master, Rabeinu Saadia, already expounded sufficiently at length on this in the Sefer Emunot Vedeot, in his commentary on parsha Bereishis, parsha Vaera, and in Sefer Yetzira, and we do not need to repeat his explanations in this book. What we are all agreed upon is that necessity forced us to ascribe physicality and to speak of Him with the attributes of His creations in order that human beings can have some way to grasp the existence of the Creator. The books of the prophets connoted Him with corporeal terms because these are closer to our mind and understanding.",
                    "If they had spoken of Him in a more accurate fashion, using words and matters connoting spiritual things, we would not have understood neither the words nor the matters, and it would have been impossible for us to worship something which we do not know, since it is not possible to worship an unknown. Therefore it was necessary that the words and concepts be according to the understanding ability of the listener so that the matter will first be grasped in the listener's mind in an understandable, corporeal sense from the concrete terms. Afterwards, we will enlighten him and explain to him that all this was only metaphorical, to bring the matter close and that the true matter is too fine, too sublime, too exalted, and too remote from the ability and powers of our mind to grasp. The wise thinker will endeavor to remove the husk of the terms and their corporeality and will ascend in his mind step by step until he will reach the true intended meaning according to the power and ability of his mind to grasp.",
                    "The foolish and simple person will conceive the Creator in accordance with the literal sense of the metaphor, and if he assumes the service of His Creator, and he endeavors to labor for His glory, he has in his simpleness and lack of understanding, a great valid excuse because a man is held accountable for his thoughts and deeds only according to his ability, intelligence, understanding, strength, and material means. But if the foolish is capable of learning wisdom and he neglects it - he will be held accountable for it and punished for his lacking and refraining from study.",
                    "If the scriptures had employed more accurate, truer terminology, then nobody would have understood it except the wise, understanding reader and most of mankind would have been left without religion and without Torah (guidance) due to their limited intellect and weak understanding in spiritual matters. But the word which may be understood in a material sense will not damage the understanding person because he recognizes its real meaning, and it is at the same time beneficial to the simple person so that it will fix in his heart and mind that there is a Creator which it is his duty to serve.",
                    "This is similar to a man who came to visit a friend who was of the wealthy class. His wealthy host felt a duty to provide his friend with a meal and also food for the animals which he brought with him. The wealthy man sent to him an abundant quantity of barley for his animals and a small quantity of food fitting for him but only enough for his need.",
                    "So too, the scriptures and the books of the pious abundantly employed material analogies when referring to the attributes of the Creator according to the understanding of the masses and according to the common language which the masses converse. Therefore, when referring to this, our Rabbis said \"the Torah speaks like the common language of men\" (Bava Metzia 31b). And the scriptures gave few hints of spiritual matters which are intelligible only to the (few) wise and understanding men.",
                    "In this way, even though all people have different views of G-d's glorious essence, nevertheless, all people are equal with regard to knowing the existence of the Creator.",
                    "Likewise we will say for all subtle matters found in the Torah such as the reward in the next world or its punishment.",
                    "And likewise we will say for the clarification of the inner wisdom (the duties of the heart) which was our intention to clarify in this book. The Torah was very brief in expounding their matters, relying on the intelligent men. The Torah only hinted at it to arouse one on it, such as mentioned in the Introduction of this book, so that anyone who is able to enquire and investigate them will be aroused to do so until he has understood and mastered them as written: \"those who seek G-d will understand all things\" (Mishlei 28:5).",
                    "The prophet (Moshe Rabeinu) has already warned us against thinking that G-d has a form or likeness as written \"Take therefore good heed unto yourselves; for you saw no manner of form on the day that the L-ord spoke unto you in Horeb (Sinai) out of the midst of the fire\" (Deut. 4:15), and \"And the L-ord spoke unto you out of the midst of the fire: you heard the voice of the words, but saw no form; only you heard a voice\" (ibid 4:12). When saying \"take good heed\", he warned us in our minds and thoughts to not represent the Creator under any form (tavnis) or to conceive Him under the likeness (demus) of anything or any comparison (dimyon) since your eyes never perceived any form or likeness when He spoke to you.",
                    "And it is written \"To whom will you liken to G-d? What likeness will you compare to Him?\" (Isaiah 40:18), and \"to Whom will you liken Me that I will be equal to, says the Holy One\" (ibid 40:25)",
                    "And it is written: \"For who in the heaven can be compared unto the L-ord?\" (Ps. 89:7), and \"Among the mighty ones there is none like You, O L-ord\" (Ps. 86:8), and many more like this.",
                    "Since it is impossible to form a representation of Him with the intellect or picture Him with the imagination, we find that Scripture ascribes most of its praises to the \"Name\" of G-d, as written: \"And they shall bless Your glorious Name\" (Nehemiah 9:5), and \"that you may fear this glorious and revered Name\" (Deut. 28:58), and \"Let them praise Your Name, great and revered\" (Ps. 99:3), and \"of My Name he was afraid\" (Malachi 2:5), and \"But unto you that fear My Name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in its wings\" (Malachi 3:20), and \"Sing unto G-d, sing praises to His Name, extol Him that rides upon the skies, whose Name is the L-ord\" (Ps. 68:5).",
                    "All this is in order to honor and exalt His glorious essence because, besides clarifying that He exists, it is impossible for us to clarify in our minds anything about His Being except for His great Name.",
                    "But as for His glorious essence and His true nature - there is no picture or likeness that we can grasp in our minds. Therefore, His Name is frequently changed in the Torah and likewise in the books of the prophets.",
                    "Because we cannot understand anything about Him except for His Name and that He exists. His glorious Name is also associated with heaven and earth and the Spirits, as Abraham said: \"And I will make you swear by the L-ord, the G-d of heaven and the G-d of the earth\" (Gen. 24:3), and Yonah said: \"I fear the L-ord, the G-d of heaven\" (1:9), and Moshe said: \"the G-d of the spirit of all flesh\" (Numbers 27:16). And the verse proclaims: \"Behold, I am the L-ord, the G-d of all flesh\" (Yirmiya 32:27).",
                    "The reason for this is that He is known to us in the way possible through the traditions of our forefathers from whom we have inherited the knowledge of His ways, as written \"For I have known him (Abraham), to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of the L-ord, to do righteousness and justice\" (Gen. 18:19).",
                    "Perhaps, G-d revealed Himself to them because they were the only ones in their generation who took on to serve Him since the people of their generation worshipped other \"gods\" (idols, sun, moon, money, etc.)",
                    "Similarly we will explain for His being called (in scripture) \"the G-d of the Hebrews\" (Ex. 3:18), \"the G-d of Yisrael\" (Gen. 33:20), as the verse says \"not like these is the portion of Yaakov for He is the Creator of all\" (Yirmiya 10:16).",
                    "And David said: \"O L-ord, the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup\" (Ps. 16:5). And if we were able to grasp His true nature, He would not be known to us through other things.",
                    "Since it is not possible for our intellects to grasp His true nature, when referring to His glorious essence the scripture describes Him as the G-d of the choicest of His creations, rational or otherwise. Therefore, when Moshe Rabeinu asked G-d \"when the Israelites ask me what is His name, what should I answer them?\", G-d answered him: \"so shall you say to the descendants of Israel: 'Ehe-ye' sent me to you'\". And since G-d knew that the Israelites would not understand the true nature of this name (Ehe-ye), He added an explanation and said: \"thus should you say to the Israelites: \"The L-ord, the G-d of your forefathers, the G-d of Abraham, the G-d of Isaac, and the G-d of Jacob sent me to you, this... (Ex. 3:15)\".",
                    "G-d's intent (to Moshe) in this was that if the people did not understand these words and their implications through intellectual reason, then tell them that I am known by them through the tradition they received from their ancestors. The Creator did not establish any other way to know Him except through these two ways, namely, (1) that which intellectual reason testifies through the evidence of His deeds which are visible in His creations, (2) and that of ancestral tradition, as scripture says: \"Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it\" (Iyov 15:18).",
                    "And since our perception of all existing things is through one of three ways:",
                    "1. Physical perception, such as through sight, hearing, taste, smell, or touch.",
                    "2. Through our reason, by which the existence of something is demonstrated from its indications and effects, until the reality of its existence and nature are established to us as if we perceived it with our physical senses.",
                    "This is called in the book of proverbs \"understanding and intellectual discipline\" (Mishlei 1:2-3).",
                    "3. True reports and reliable tradition.",
                    "Since it is not possible for us to perceive the Creator through our senses, we can only know Him through true reports or from proofs on Him based on the evidence of His deeds.",
                    "And since the proofs drawn from the evidence of His deeds in the creations are established and greatly numerous, therefore the attributes ascribed to Him because of them are also numerous.",
                    "The saints and the prophets described His attributes in different ways. Moshe Rabeinu said \"The Rock, His work is perfect, for all His ways are justice\" (Deut. 32:4), and he also said: \"He is G-d of gods, and L-ord of lords, the great G-d, the mighty, and the awesome\" (Deut. 10:17), and also \"He exacts justice for the fatherless and the widow\" (Deut. 10:18). And G-d Himself described His own attributes as written: \"And the L-ord passed by before him, and proclaimed: 'The L-ord, the L-ord, G-d, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy unto the thousandth generation, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, etc.'\" (Ex. 34:6).",
                    "(That G-d possesses) these attributes we see from the evidence of His deeds towards His creations and also from the wisdom and power which His deeds reflect. And if we investigate this matter with our intellect and understanding, we will fail to grasp the smallest of the smallest of part of His attributes, as David said: \"Many, O L-ord my G-d, are Your wonderful works which You have done, and Your thoughts which are toward us...\" (Ps. 40:6), and \"Who can utter the mighty acts of the L-ord? who can show forth all his praise?\" (Ps. 106:2), and \"And blessed be Your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise\" (Nehemiah 9:5). And the Sages said in the Talmud (Berachos 33b):",
                    "A certain person led the prayer service before Rabbi Chanina and said: \"the great, the mighty, the awesome, the powerful, the glorious, the potent, the feared, the strong, the powerful, the certain, and the esteemed G-d!\". R' Chanina waited until he finished. When he finished, R' Chanina said to him: \"did you complete all the praises of your Master? What need is there for all of this? even us, these three praises that we say (in the daily prayers), if not for the fact that Moshe Rabeinu said it in the Torah (Deut. 10:17), and the men of the great assembly came and established it in prayer, we wouldn't be able to say them! And you say all these praises and continue? It is analogous to a king of flesh and blood who had thousands upon thousands of golden coins, and they would praise him for possessing silver coins, isn't this a disgrace to him\"?",
                    "And \"to You silence is praise\" (Ps. 65:2), to which our teachers said: \"the best potion is silence, the more you praise a flawless pearl, the more you depreciate it\" (Megila 18a).",
                    "Therefore, you should exert your mind until you know the Creator through the evidences of His works and not strive to know Him in His glorious essence. For He is exceedingly close to you from the side of His deeds but infinitely remote in any representation of His essence or comparison with it. As already stated, we will never be able to find Him in this way. When you arrive at the stage where you abandon (trying to find Him) through your thoughts and senses because He cannot be grasped in this way, and you instead find Him in the evidence of His deeds, as though He were inseparable from you - this is the pinnacle of knowledge of Him which the prophet exhorts us on in saying \"Know therefore this day, and consider it in your heart, that the L-ord He is G-d in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else\" (Deut. 4:39).",
                    "One of the Sages said: \"the more one increases knowledge of the Creator, the more one is awe-struck with regard to His nature\".",

                    "The reason being, that it is our duty to be in fear and awe, and to guard from it, as some of the Sages said: \"that which is beyond you, do not expound, that which is hidden from you, do not investigate. That which is permitted to you - contemplate. Do not have any business with hidden things\" (Ben Sira in Megila 13a).",
                    "And our Sages said: \"whoever is not concerned for the honor of his Creator it is better for him had he not been created\" (Chagiga 11b). And they expounded on the verse \"Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speaks, surely he shall be swallowed up\" (Iyov 37:20) - Whoever comes to speak the might of G-d will be destroyed (Talmud Yerushalmi Berachos 9a). And the verse says: \"And he struck the men of Beth Shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the L-ord\" (Shmuel 6:19) (who stared at it with coarse hearts, without due awe- PL), and \"It is the glory of G-d to conceal a thing\" (Mishlei 25:2), which means to conceal His secret from men who are not wise, and \"the secret of G-d is with them that fear Him\" (Ps. 25:14).",
                    "Furthermore regarding the physical senses we mentioned and the mental faculties, namely, memory, thought, imagination, counsel/will, recognition, which all refer to one power, namely, the mind which gives them the ability to apprehend things.",
                    "THE PHYSICAL SENSES<br>Each one of the (physical) senses has a distinct ability to perceive certain types of sensations which the other senses lack. For example, form and color can only be perceived by the sense of sight. Voices and music can only be perceived by the sense of hearing. Scent and various odors - only by the sense of smell. Various tastable things - only by the sense of taste. Hot and cold and many matters of quality - by the sense of touch.",
                    "Each sense has a power to perceive its relevant sensation to a definite extent, beyond which it is incapable of perceiving further. For example, sight has the ability to perceive something close by, and the further away one goes, the weaker its ability to apprehend it, until eventually it ceases to apprehend it completely. Likewise for the sense of hearing, and also for the other senses.",
                    "And it is impossible to grasp a sensation without the appropriate sense designated for it. One who strives to grasp it with a different sense will fail to accomplish his desire. For example, one who strives to grasp a melody with the sense of sight or visible things with the sense of smell or taste with the sense of touch - he will not be able to find them or grasp them, despite that they exist, because one is trying to perceive them without the limbs designated for perceiving these sensations.",
                    "Likewise we will say for the mental faculties we mentioned. Each one of them has a distinct power to perceive a specific thing which the others cannot, and a limit to which it can grasp no further, as we mentioned for the physical senses.",
                    "Likewise we will say for the mind (in total) which grasps intellectual things by itself or through proofs. For things that are close to it, it will grasp its truth directly through itself, while for things which are remote and hidden, it will grasp it through building proofs which point to it.",
                    "And since the Creator is infinitely remote and hidden for us from the side of His glorious essence, the intellect can grasp only that He exists.",
                    "And if it strives to grasp His glorious essence or to imagine Him - even His existence will be hidden to it, because it strove to grasp something beyond its ability, as we mentioned for trying to grasp a sensation with the wrong sense.",
                    "Therefore, we must seek the existence of G-d through the evidence of His deeds in the creations - and these will be proofs on Him for us. And when His existence is established for us in this way, we must then cease and not seek to liken Him in our thoughts or to try to represent or figure Him in our imagination, or attempt to apprehend His glorious essence. For, if we do this, thinking we will understand Him more closely - even the realization of His existence will disappear from us, because anything we imagine in our minds will be other than Him. And scripture says: \"Have you found honey? eat only as much as is sufficient for you, lest you be filled with it, and vomit it\" (Mishlei 25:16).",
                    "I saw fitting to try to bring the matter close to you using two illustrations.",
                    "The First of the two will demonstrate that each physical sense perceives its class of sensations and then it reaches its limit whereby the next physical sense picks up where it left off. And afterwards, it will also reach its limit and the next sense will start, and so on for all the senses. When they all reach their limit of perception, the intellect will then start to perceive what is in its power to apprehend. This will be demonstrated by means of one object.",
                    "Imagine that a stone was thrown far away. It makes a whistling/crashing noise and strikes a man. The man perceived with his sense of sight the appearance of the stone and its form. Then he perceives with his sense of hearing the whistling/crashing noise, then he perceives with his sense of touch the coldness and hardness of it. Afterwards, the physical senses cease to apprehend any more of the stone. Then the intellect perceives that the stone must have had a thrower who threw it, since it is clear to it that the stone did not move from its place by itself.",
                    "That which is normally perceived through the physical senses cannot be apprehended by the intellect without the physical senses. And all the more so, that which is normally perceived by the intellect cannot be perceived by the physical senses.",
                    "The second illustration will demonstrate that for spiritual matters, once we are convinced of their existence, it is not proper to investigate their nature because this approach only ruins our intellect. This is like one who tries to understand the sun from observing its light, radiance, shine, and its power to dissipate darkness. If he accepts its existence, he will benefit from it, use its light, and attain all that he seeks from it. But one who strives to study its roundness and focuses his eyes to stare at it - his eyes will dim and (eventually) their sight will be lost and he will not benefit from the sun..",
                    "The same thing will happen to us. If we study the existence of the Creator from the evidence of His signs in the creations, the wisdom manifested in them, His power shown in all His creations - we will think and we will understand His nature. Then our minds will be illuminated with knowledge of Him and we will attain all that is possible for us to attain, as written \"I am the L-ord your G-d who teaches you for your benefit, who leads you by the way that you should go\" (Isaiah 48:17).",
                    "But if we exert our minds to understand the matter of His glorious essence, and to try to liken or represent Him in our minds - we will ruin/diminish our intellect and understanding, and we will not grasp even what was known to us, as would happen to our eyes if we stared at the sun. We must be careful in this matter, and remember it when we investigate on the matter of the existence of G-d.",
                    "Likewise, we must be careful regarding His attributes, whether those which describe His glorious essence or those the prophets ascribe to Him - not to take them literally or according to what would seem in a physical sense.",
                    "Rather, we must know clearly that they are in a metaphorical and incidental sense according to what we are capable of grasping with our powers of recognition, understanding, and intellect, due to our crucial need to know Him and His loftiness. But He is infinitely greater and loftier above all of this, and like the verse says \"Blessed be Your glorious Name, that is exalted above all blessing and praise\" (Nehemiah 9:5).",
                    "One of the philosophers said: \"He whose mind is too weak to understand the matter of divesting, he holds fast to the terms in the Divinely given scriptures, and does not realize that the terms in scripture are adapted to the intelligence of those to whom they were addressed, not according to (the intelligence) of the One who addressed them. Rather they are like the whistling call to a herd of cattle at the time of water drinking, which brings them to drink far more effectively than clear and accurate words.\"",
                    "When you master this level of the Unity in your intellect and understanding, devote your soul to the Creator, strive to grasp His existence from (observing) His wisdom, His power, His grace, His mercy, and His abundant providence over His creations. Become pleasing to Him by doing His will. Then you will be among the seekers of G-d (and it is written: \"those who seek G-d will understand all\" (Mishlei 28:5) - <i>ML</i>), and then you will receive from Him the help and strength to understand Him, and to know His true nature, as David said: \"The secret of the L-ord is with them that fear Him; and He will show them His covenant\" (Ps. 25:14). I will clarify for you some illustrations in the second gate of this book. When you practice them, and go in their path, the matter will be easier for you with G-d's help.",
                    "THINGS DETRIMENTAL<br>The things detrimental to the (wholehearted acceptance of G-d's) unity are numerous. Among them, to association of other beings with the Creator. This occurs in several ways.",
                    "Among them, believing in multiple gods, worshipping forms, the sun, moon, constellations, fire, plants, animals. Among them, ascribing physicality to the Creator, while understanding the true intent of scripture.",
                    "Among them, hidden association, namely trying to find favor with other people with regard to religious matters. This occurs in several ways. I will clarify them in the fifth gate of this book, with G-d's help.",
                    "Among them, turning (excessively) to the physical pleasures. This is subtle association - that a man associates the service of his lusts with the service of the Creator. And the verse says: \"There shall not be in you a strange god\", to which our Rabbis expound: \"what is the 'strange god' which is in the body of a man? - This is the evil inclination\" (Talmud Shabbos 105b).",
                    "Perhaps the simple and foolish person, when he reads this book and considers what we wrote in this gate will say to himself: \"will the matter of unity of G-d be unknown to anyone who reads even one page of the Torah whereby this author needs to stir us and instruct us it?\"",
                    "I will answer this as the wise man answered: \"Answer a fool according to his folly\" (Mishlei 26:5). For one who asks this is too weak of understanding to grasp the extent of a universal topic which is addressed to different classes of people. Such a universal topic is grasped differently depending on whether the person understood much of it or little of it, and whether he is of strong intellect or of weak intellect.",
                    "The analogy to this - the benefit of the light of the sun which is universal to all men. We find this benefit divides into three classes:",

If they hasten to heal their eyes with medications, potions, and therapeutic diets, and at the same time are careful not to expose their eyes to the light of the sun - it is possible that they will become healthy and they will benefit from the sun which was previously damaging to them. But if they delay healing their eyes, they will quickly lose their eyesight completely and belong to the class of the totally blind.",
                    "Similarly, the classes of understanding G-d's unity taught in the Torah divides into three classes. The matter is taught to all rational beings, just like the light of the sun is available to all seeing beings.",
                    "The first class: Men of clear intellect and pure understanding.",

When they put to heart to understand what they encountered in the Torah on the matter of the Unity, they will understand it, and its matter will enter their heart through their powerful understanding and pure intellect. They are of those who don't need this book, except to remind them of what has escaped their attention.",

                    "The third class who understand the matter of the Unity mentioned in G-d's Torah with some understanding, but they don't have the intellectual power to understand its matter and realize its true meaning. If a teacher instructs them and makes them understand its matter through the way of true proofs and sound intellectual reasoning - its meaning will become clear to them, and its secret will be revealed to them, and they will reach the level of the first class.",
                    "But if they shirk from investigating and are lazy in examining in that which will strengthen their understanding and sharpen their intellect - they will sink to the level of the foolish.",
                    "To those of this class, this book will be of great and comprehensive benefit, because they are capable of investigating. It will benefit them just like potions benefit those with weak eyesight, who hope to be healed by their application.",

                "The benefits in religious matters:",
                "Among them, peace of mind, and trusting in G-d as a servant must trust in his master, because if one does not place his trust in G-d, he will place his trust in something else, and whoever trusts in something other than G-d, the Al-mighty will remove His providence from such a person, and leave him in the hands of the one he trusted, and he will be as it was written: \"For My people have committed two evils; they have forsaken Me, the spring of living waters, to dig for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns that do not hold water\" (Yirmiya 2:13), \"They exchanged their Glory for the likeness of an ox eating grass\" (Tehilim 106:20),\"Blessed is the man who trusts in the L-ord; the L-ord shall be his refuge\" (Yirmiya 17:7), \"Praiseworthy is the man who made the L-ord his trust, and did not turn to the haughty and those who turn to falsehood.\" (Tehilim 40:5), \"Cursed is the man who trusts in man, who makes flesh his strength and whose heart turns away from the L-ord\" (Yirmiya 17:5). ",
                "If he places his trust in his wisdom and tactics, physical strength and industriousness - he will toil for nothing, his strength will weaken, and his tactics will fall short of accomplishing his desire, as written \"He traps the wise with their own cunning\" (Iyov 5:13) , and \"I returned and saw under the sun, that the race does not belong to the swift, nor the war to the mighty; neither do the wise have bread, [nor do the understanding have wealth, nor the knowledgeable, favor for time and chance happens to them all]\" (Koheles 9:11), and \"Young lions suffer want and are hungry, but those who seek the L-ord lack no good\" (Tehilim 34:11).

                "Or, he will be prevented from its benefit as the wise man said \"the Al-mighty will not give him the ability to eat from it\" (Koheles 6:2), and it will be by him like a deposit that he guards from damages until it reaches someone worthy of it, as written \"[For to a man who is good in His sight, He has given wisdom and knowledge and joy,] but to the sinner He has given an occupation to gather and to accumulate, to give to him who is good in G-d's sight; this too is vanity and frustration.\" (Koheles 2:26), and \"he will prepare, but a righteous man will wear them; and the pure shall divide the silver\" (Iyov 27:17). And it is possible that the money will be the cause of his destruction (in this world) and ultimate downfall (in the afterlife) as written \"There is a grievous evil that I saw under the sun; riches kept by their owner for his harm.\" (Koheles 5:12).

                "Another benefit for the one who trusts in the Al-mighty, is that his trust will lead him to the following: ",

                "* to not hope in any man, nor expect from anyone (Micha 5:6).",

                "* to not be afraid of disagreeing with them .",
                "* to divest himself of the cloak of their favors and free himself from the burden of expressing gratitude to them, and from the obligation of paying back their favors . ",
                "* if he rebukes them, he will not be afraid of slighting them.",
                "* he will not shy from humiliating them (so that his rebuke is effective - Pas Lechem).",
                "* he will not embellish their false ways",
                "As the prophet wrote: \"But the L-ord G-d helps me, therefore shall I not be confounded; therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed\" (Yeshaya 50:7), \"Do not fear them or their words\" (Yechezkel 2:6), \"And you, son of man, fear them not, and fear not their words\" (Yechezkel 2:6), \"fear them not, neither shall you be intimidated by them\" (Yechezkel 3:9).",
                "Another benefit: The trust in G-d will lead one to empty his mind from the distractions of the world, and to focus his heart to matters of service of G-d. ",
                "And he will be similar in his peace of mind, tranquility of heart, and few financial worries to the alchemist, one who knows how to transform silver to gold and copper or tin to silver through skill and procedures. ",
                "And the one who trusts in G-d will have the following 10 advantages over the alchemist:",
                "(1) The alchemist requires special materials to perform his operation, without which he cannot do anything. These materials are not found at all times and in all places. But for one who trusts in G-d, his sustenance is assured and can come through any means of all the means of the world, as written \"[And He fed you with manna, which you knew not, neither did your fathers know]; That He might make known to you that man does not live by bread alone...\" (Devarim 8:3). For at no time and in no place are the means of obtaining his livelihood withheld from him, as you know already from the story of Eliyahu and the ravens, or with the widow and the cakes and water (Melachim 17:9), or the story of Ovadia with the prophets, where he said \"I hid among the prophets of G-d, 100 men, 50 in each cave, and I fed them bread and water\" (Melachim 18:13) , and \"Young lions suffer want and are hungry, but those who seek the L-ord lack no good\" (Tehilim 34:11), and \"Fear the L-ord, His holy ones; for there is no want to those who fear Him\" (Tehilim 34:10).",
                "(2) The alchemist must perform actions and follow procedures without which he cannot successfully complete his goal. It is even possible that the fumes and odors will cause his death, along with the long work and great effort with them day and night. But one who trusts in G-d is secure against mishaps, and his heart is assured against future (potential) bad things. Whatever comes to him from G-d, he will accept with joy and gladness and his livelihood comes to him peacefully, quietly, and happily, as written \"He causes me to lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside still waters\" (Tehilim 23:2). ",
                "(3) The alchemist does not trust anyone with his secret due to fear for his life. But one who trusts G-d does not fear any man on account of his trust, just the contrary it is a source of honor, as King David said: \"in G-d I trusted, I will not fear, what can a man do to me?\" (Tehilim 54:12).",
                "(4) The alchemist must either prepare one large quantity of gold and silver for long term needs or must prepare small batches for short term needs. If he prepares a large quantity, all his days he will fear for his life that perhaps all the gold and silver will be lost in any number of ways (and he will be left penniless), and his heart will never quiet, nor will his mind be at peace due to fear of the king and of the people (finding his big stash of gold).If he makes small batches for short term use, it is possible that he will not successfully perform the procedure at a time of great need, due to a failure in one of the means. But one who trusts in G-d, has strong peace of mind that G-d will provide for him at any time He wishes and in any place, just like He sustains the fetus in its mother's womb or the chick inside an egg, which has no opening to enter anything from the outside, and birds in the air, or fish in the sea, and the tiny ant despite its weakness, while the mighty lion some days cannot obtain food, as written \"Young lions suffer want and are hungry, but those who seek the L-ord lack no good\" (Tehilim 34:11), and \"The L-ord will not starve the soul of the righteous\" (Mishlei 10:3), and \"I have been young, and now am old; yet I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread\" (Tehilim 37:25)",
                "(5) The alchemist is under anxiety and fear of everyone, from the greatest to the lowest of people as a consequence of his work, but one who trusts in G-d will be revered by great men and honorable people, even animals and stones seek to do his will (i.e. do not harm him - TL) as written in the entire Psalm \"He who sits...\" (tehilim 91), and \"In six troubles He will save you, and in the seventh no harm will touch you.\" (Iyov 5:19), until the end of the matter.",
                "(6) The alchemist is not immune from sickness and disease which hinders his joy in being wealthy, and prevents him from benefiting from what he has and enjoying what he has acquired. But one who trusts in G-d, is immune from sickness and disease except as an atonement or to increase his reward, as written \"Now youths shall become tired and weary, and young men shall stumble\" (Yeshaya 40:30), \"those who hope in G-d will renew strength\" (Yeshaya 40:31), and \"For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, but the L-ord supports the righteous\" (Tehilim 37:17).",
                "(7) It is possible that the alchemist will not be able to buy food with his gold and silver due to no food being available in the city at times, as written: \"they shall cast their money in the streets\" (Yechezkel 7:19), and \"neither silver nor gold will be able to save them\" (Tzefania 1:18), but for one who trusts in G-d, his sustenance will not be blocked at any time or in any place, as written \"in famine He redeemed you from death\" (Iyov 5:20), and \"the L-ord is my shepherd, I shall not lack\" (Tehilim 23:1), and \"They will not be shamed in time of calamity, and in days of famine they shall still be satisfied\" (Tehilim 37:19).",
                "(8) The alchemist does not linger in one place too long due to fear that his secret will be discovered. But one who trusts in G-d feels secure in his land, and has peace of mind in his place, as written \"Trust in the L-ord and do good; dwell in the land and be nourished by faith\" (Tehilim 37:3), and \"The righteous shall inherit the land and dwell forever in it\" (Tehilim 37:29).",
                "(9) The alchemist's skills will not accompany him in the afterlife, they may only provide him, in this world, security from poverty and from needing other people. But for one who trusts in G-d, the reward for his trust will accompany him in this world and in the next, as written \"Many are the pains of the wicked ; but one who trusts in G-d will be surrounded by kindness\" (Tehilim 32:10), and \"how great is Your goodness that you hid away for those who fear You\" (Tehilim 31:20. ",
                "(10) If the alchemist's work is discovered, it will become a cause for his death, because his work runs contrary to the natural order, and the Director of the world will allow someone to kill him when he fails to hide his secret . But for one who trusts in G-d, when his trust becomes known, he will be held in high esteem and honored by the public. They will feel blessed to be near him or to see him, and his presence will bring good fortune to the city and shield the people from troubles, as written \"the righteous man is the foundation of the world\" (Mishlei 10:25), similar to Lot in Tzoar .",
                "Among the benefits of trusting in G-d regarding religious matters:",
                "One who trusts in G-d, if he has wealth, will be quick to fulfill his monetary obligations to G-d and to men with a willing and generous spirit. If he does not have wealth, he will consider that lack of wealth to be among the favors of G-d to him, because he is exempt from the monetary obligations to G-d and men which wealth brings, and he is spared from the mental distraction of protecting and managing it, as one of the pious used to say: \"may G-d save me from dispersion of the mind\". They would ask him \"what is dispersion of the mind?\" He would answer: \"to own property at the head of every river and the center of every town.\" And this is what our sages referred to in saying: \"the more possessions, the more worry\" (Avos 2:7), and they said: \"who is wealthy? He who is content with what he has\" (Avos 4:1). ",
                "One who trusts in G-d will receive the benefits of money, namely, his material needs, but without the mental distraction and constant worry of the wealthy, as the wise man said \"The sleep of the laborer is sweet, whether he eats little or much, but the satiety of the rich does not allow him to sleep\" (Koheles 5:11).",
                "Another benefit, one who trusts in G-d will not diminish his trust on account of having much wealth because he does not rely on the money. He regards it as a deposit which he is ordered to use in specific ways, for specific matters and for a limited time. And if he stays wealthy for a long time, he will not become arrogant due to his wealth. He will not remind the poor person of his charity gifts since he was commanded to give to him, and he will not seek his gratitude and praises. Rather, he will thank his Creator who appointed him as a means for doing good to the poor person.",
                "If his wealth is lost, he will not worry nor mourn his loss. Rather, he will thank his Creator for taking back His deposit, just like he thanked G-d when it was given to him. He will be happy with his portion, and will not seek to damage others . He will not covet other people's wealth as the wise man said \"A righteous man eats to sate his appetite, [but the stomach of the wicked shall feel want].\" (Mishlei 13:25). ",
                "Benefits of trust in G-d for worldly matters:",
                "* Peace of mind from the worries of this world.",

And when all this is clear to the truster, he is obligated to be at peace on his friend, and to rely on him, because of the many past benefits he already received from his friend and the constant favors he still presently receives.

The buckets are the near cause. The remote cause is the man who harnessed an animal to the wheel and compels the animal to move in order to raise the water from the bottom of the well to the surface of the earth.",

Likewise for someone thirsty, who needs water. And all the more so, if he has no food prepared, until he needs to exert himself through milling flour, kneading, baking, etc . And more so, if he needs to buy the food and prepare it. And even more still, if he has no money to buy them and will need even greater exertion to pursue means to earn the money or to sell the amount he needs from the objects he uses or his other possessions, or the like. There are two reasons why the Creator obligated a man to pursue means and exert himself for his livelihood and other needs. ",
                    "(1) Divine wisdom required the testing of man in the service of G-d or rebellion against Him. Therefore, G-d tests man with what demonstrates his choice in this - needs and lacking for external things such as food, drink, clothing, shelter, and sexual relations. G-d commanded man to pursue and attain them through the available means in specific ways (according to the torah - ML) and at specific times. ",

                    "Through this process, his free choice of whether he served G-d or rebelled against Him will be demonstrated through his intention and choice, and the man will then deserve either reward or punishment, regardless whether or not he actually achieved his intentions.",
                    "(2) Secondly, if a man were not forced to exert himself in seeking a livelihood, he would kick (become defiant) and chase after sin, and he would ignore his debt of gratitude to G-d for His goodness to him. As written: \"And the harp, and the lyre, the timbrel, and flute, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the L-ord, neither consider the work of His hands\" (Yeshaya 5:12), and \"But Yeshurun grew fat, and kicked: you are grown fat, you are grown thick, you are covered with fatness; then he forsook G-d who made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation\" (Devarim 32:15). And the sages said \"it is good the study of torah with working for a livelihood because the toil in both removes thoughts of sin, and all torah study without work will in the end be abandoned and bring to sin\" (Avot 2:2). And all the more so for one who has no share in either torah or work, nor directs his attention to any of these pursuits. ",
                    "It was out of compassion for man that G-d has compelled him to be occupied with matters of this world and the next for all of his days, and so that he does not seek that which he does not need and which he cannot understand with his limited intellect, such as matters of what was before the creation and of the final end (since these things do not further his perfection and on the contrary - they damage him - PL), as the wise man said \"also the [toil of] the world He has set into their hearts, so that man should not seek the deed which G-d did, from beginning to end.\" (Koheles 3:11).",

His livelihood will come to him without strain (of the heart - PL) or toil (of the limbs - PL), according to his needs, as written \"G-d will not bring hunger to the righteous\" (Mishlei 10:3). ",
                    "If one asks: Behold we see some tzadikim (very righteous people) which do not receive their livelihood except after hard and strenuous toil, while many transgressors are at ease, living a good, pleasant life?",
                    "We will say: The prophets and the chasidim (extremely pious) already investigated this matter. One of them said \"[Righteous are you, O L-rd, when I plead with You: yet let me talk with You of your judgments:] Why does the way of the wicked prosper? why are all they happy that deal very treacherously?\" (Yirmiyahu 12:1), and another \"Why do You show me iniquity and look upon mischief; and plunder and violence are before me; and the one who bears quarrel and strife endures.\" (Chavakuk 1:3), and \"for a wicked man surrounds the righteous; therefore, justice emerges perverted.\" (Chavakuk 1:4), and \"Why should You be silent when a wicked man swallows up one more righteous than he?\" (Chavakuk 1:13), and another one said \"Behold these are wicked, yet they are tranquil in the world and have increased wealth.\" (Tehilim 73:12), and \"But for naught I cleansed my heart and bathed my hands with cleanliness\" (Tehilim 73:13), and another said \"And now we praise the bold transgressors, those who work wickedness are built up, they tempt G-d, and they have, nevertheless, escaped.\" (Malachi 3:15), and many more like this.",
                    "But the prophet refrained from giving an answer because each specific case has its own particular reason (there is no general answer which includes everything - TL). Therefore Moshe Rabeinu commented on this in the torah saying (Devarim 29:28) \"the hidden things belong to G-d\"..and the wise man said in connection to this \"If you see the oppression of the poor, and perverting of justice and righteousness in a province, marvel not at the matter\" (Koheles 5:7), and the verse says: \"the Rock, His deeds are perfect for all His ways are justice\" (Devarim 32:4).",

                    "1. A previous sin for which it is necessary to pay him for it, as written \"the tzadik will pay in the land\" (Mishlei 11:31).",
                    "2. In the way of exchanging, to pay him more good in Olam Haba (the afterlife), as written \"to benefit you in your end\" (Devarim 8:16).",
                    "3. To demonstrate his good bearing and good acceptance of suffering in the service of G-d, so that others will learn from him, as you know from the matter of Iyov.",
                    "4. Due to the wickedness of his generation, G-d tests him with poverty, hardship, or sickness to demonstrate/contrast his piety and service of G-d unlike them, as written \"Indeed, he bore our illnesses, and our pains he carried them\" (Yeshaya 53:4).",
                    "5. Due to his not being sufficiently zealous in standing up for G-d, and exacting justice (i.e. protesting - TL) from men of his generation, as you know from the story of Eli and his sons, as the verse says \"And it will be that everyone who is left in your house, will come to prostrate himself before him for a silver piece and a morsel of bread\" (Shmuel 2:36). ",
                    "Sometimes G-d sends good to the wicked for the following reasons: 1. A previous good deed he did, to pay him in this world, as written \"And He repays those He hates to their face, to destroy them\" (Devarim 7:10) which Onkelos renders: \"He pays those He hates for their good deeds during their lives to destroy them\".",
                    "2. As a temporary deposit, until G-d gives him a righteous son who is worthy of it, as written \"he prepares but the tzadik will wear it\" (Iyov 27:17), and \"to the sinner He has given a preoccupation to gather and to accumulate, to give to him who is good in G-d's sight\" (Koheles 2:26).",
                    "3. Sometimes the money is the chief cause of his evil (in the next world) or death (in this world), as written \"There is a grievous evil that I saw under the sun; riches kept by their owner for his harm.\" (Koheles 5:12) (such as Korach or Naval - PL).",
                    "4. Sometimes it is to give him time to repent and become worthy of it, as you know of the story of Menashe.",
                    "5. His father did good and it is fitting to benefit him in the merit of his father, as said to Yehu ben Nimshi \"four generations of your descendants will sit on the throne of Israel\" (Melachim II 10:30), and \"He who walks innocently is righteous; fortunate are his sons after him.\" (Mishlei 20:7), and \"I was young, and have aged, and I have not seen a righteous man forsaken nor his descendants begging bread.\" (Tehilim 37:25).",
                    "6. Sometimes it is to test those who are deceptive or have an evil interior. When they see the wicked prosper, they quickly stray from the service of G-d and hasten to win the favor of the wicked and to learn from their actions. In this way it will be clarified the pure men to G-d and it will be demonstrated who was faithful to G-d in bearing at a time when the wicked rule and persecute him. He will receive reward from the Creator for this, as you know of the story of Eliyahu and Isabel or Yirmiyahu and the kings of his generation. ",
                    "Since it has been clarified the obligation for a man to pursue the means for a livelihood, now we will clarify that not every man is required to pursue every possible means. The possible means are numerous.",
                    "Some occupations are easy, requiring little strain such as shop keeping or light work with the hands such as sewing, writing, contracting businesses, hiring sharecroppers or workers, supervisors.",
                    "Some occupations require hard physical labor such as tanning, mining iron or copper, smelting metals, heavy transport, constant travel to faraway places, working and plowing land, or the like,",

                    "Every man has a preference for a particular work or business over others. G-d has already implanted in his nature a love and fondness for it, as He implanted in a cat's nature the hunting of mice, or the falcon to hunt smaller birds, the deer to trap snakes. Some birds hunt only fish, and likewise, each animal species has a liking and desire for particular plants or animals, which G-d has implanted to be the means for its sustenance, and the structure of its body and limbs is suited for that thing. The long bill and legs of a fish catching bird, or the strong teeth and claws of the lion, horns of the ox and ram (i.e. for defense - TL), while animals whose sustenance is from plants do not have the tools to hunt and kill.",
                    "Similarly you will find among human beings character traits and body structures suited for certain businesses or activity. One who finds his nature and personality attracted to a certain occupation, and his body is suited for it, that he will be able to bear its demands - he should pursue it, and make it his means of earning a livelihood, and he should bear its pleasures and pains, and not be upset when sometimes his income is withheld, rather let him trust in G-d that He will support him all of his days.  And he should have intention when his mind and body is occupied with one of the means of earning a living to fulfill the commandment of the Creator to pursue the means of the world, such as working the land, plowing and sowing it, as written \"And G-d took the man and placed him in Gan Eden to work it and to guard it\" (Bereishis 2:15), and also to use other living creatures for his benefit and sustenance, and for building cities and preparing food, and to marry a woman and have relations to populate the world.",
                    "He will be rewarded for his intentions in heart and mind to serve G-d whether or not his desire is accomplished, as written \"If you eat from the toil of your hands, you are praiseworthy, and it is good for you\" (Tehilim 128:2), and our sages of blessed memory said \"Let all your actions be for the sake of Heaven (to serve G-d)\" (Avot 2:12).",
                    "In this way, his trust in G-d will be intact, undamaged by the toiling in the means to earn a livelihood, as long as his intention in heart and mind is for the sake of Heaven (to do the will of G-d that the world be populated and built up). ",
                    "One should not think that his livelihood depends on a particular means and that if these means fail, his livelihood will not come from a different means. Rather, trust in the Al-mighty, and know that all means are equal for Him. He can provide using whatever means and at any time and however He so wishes, as written \"for with the L-ord there is no limitation to save with many or with few\" (Shmuel I 14:6), and \"But you must remember the L-ord your G-d, for it is He that gives you strength to make wealth, in order to establish His covenant which He swore to your forefathers, as it is this day.\" (Devarim 8:18), and \"Not by might nor by power, but by My spirit, says the L-ord of Hosts.\" (Zecharia 4:6)."

                    "Since I have explained the fundamental introductions (in chapter 3) which make it possible for one to place his trust in the Al-mighty, it is proper for me to follow them with an explanation of the proper way of trust in each of the seven categories, through which one should trust in G-d and in something besides Him. ",
                    "For the first category, matters of the body alone, these are: his life and death, his income for obtaining food, clothing and shelter, his health and illness, his traits. The proper way of trust in the A-lmighty for all of these matters is to submit oneself to the course the Creator has decreed for him in these matters, and to place one's trust in G-d and to know that none of these matters can come to be unless it was previously determined by G-d that this would be the most proper situation for his matter in this world and in Olam Haba (the afterlife), and ultimately the greatest good for him (even if right now it appears to his eye to be not good, certainly, it is the best thing for him for his ultimate end - PL), and that the Creator has exclusive, total control over all of these matters. In none of them can any created being advise any plan, or exercise any control except through His permission, decree, and judgment. ",
                    "And just like one's life and death, health and sickness, are not in the hands of others, so too, one's livelihood, clothing and other bodily needs are also not in their control.",

",
                    "An example of this: Even though a human being's end and length of his days are determined by the Creator's decree, nevertheless, it is a man's duty to pursue means to survive such as food and drink, clothing, and shelter according to his needs, and he must not leave this to the Al-mighty, and think: \"if the Creator has predecreed that I will live, then my body will survive without food all the days of my life, therefore I will not trouble myself in seeking a livelihood and toiling in it\".",
                    "Likewise, one should not put himself in danger while trusting on the decree of the Creator [that he will live a set time], drinking poisonous drink or going to battle lions or other dangerous animals without necessity, or to cast himself into the sea or into fire, or other similar things that a man is not sure of them and puts his life in danger. And the verse has already warned us in saying \"You shall not try the L-ord, your G-d\" (Devarim 6:16), because either one of two things will happen. ",
                    "Either he will die, and it will be considered as if he killed himself, and he will be held accountable for this just as if he had killed another man, despite that his death in this fashion was a decree of the Al-mighty and occurred with His permission. ",

When the slave saw that the messenger was late in coming, he abandoned his post, and the master became furious at him and punished him severely. Similarly, one who causes his own death (by doing dangerous things) moves out of the service of G-d and into rebellion against Him, by putting himself in mortal danger.",
                    "This is why you will find Shmuel say (to G-d) \"And Shmuel said, \"How shall I go? For, if Saul hears, he will kill me.\" And the L-ord said, \"You shall take a heifer with you, and you shall say, 'I have come to slaughter (a sacrifice) to the L-ord.'\" (Shmuel I 16:2). And this was not considered a lack of trust in the Al-mighty, and the answer from G-d to him shows that his zeal in this was appropriate (since G-d does not do public miracles without great necessity - TL), and He answered him \"You shall take a heifer with you, and you shall say, 'I have come to bring an offering to the L-ord.'\" (Shmuel I 16:2), and if this were considered a lack of trust G-d would have answered him \"I cause death and grant life. I strike, and I heal\" (Devarim 32:39), or something similar, as He answered Moshe when Moshe claimed \"But I am slow of speech and slow of tongue\" (Shmos 4:10), answering him \"Who has made a man's mouth? Who makes a man mute or deaf, seeing or blind\". And if Shmuel, with his perfect righteousness did not find it a light matter to put himself to a slight risk of danger, and even though he would be doing so by the command of G-d, as He commanded him \"Fill your horn with oil, and go, I shall send you to Jesse, the Bethlehemite, for I have seen for Myself a king among his sons\" (Shmuel I 16:1), all the more so for someone not commanded by G-d, that this would be considered reprehensible.

Then his merits will be annulled and he will lose his reward, as our sages said on this matter (Shabbat 32a): \"a man should never put himself in danger thinking that a miracle will be performed for him, because maybe no miracle will be done for him, and even if a miracle is done for him, his merits are reduced\". And Yaakov our forefather said \"I am not worthy from all Your kindnesses\" (Bereishis 32:11), to which the targum explains: \"my merits have diminished due to all of Your favors and kindnesses.\"",

Then, when a farmer must plow his field, clear it from weeds, and to sow it, and water it, when rainwater is not available, let him trust in the Creator to make it fertile, and to protect it from plagues, to increase and to bless the crops. And it is not proper to leave the land unworked and unsowed and to trust G-d and rely on His decree that it will grow fruit without being sown first. ",

One should not think that the means can benefit or harm him in the least.",
                    "If one's livelihood comes through one of the means he worked on, it is proper for him not to trust in this source, rejoice in it, intensify in it, and turn his heart to it, because this will weaken his trust in the Al-mighty. It is improper to think that this source will be more beneficial to him than what was predecreed from the Creator. He should not rejoice for having pursued and engaged in it. Rather, he should thank the Creator who provided for him after his labor, and that He did not make his work and struggle result in nothing, as written \"If you eat the toil of your hands, you are praiseworthy, and it is good for you\" (Tehilim 128:2).",
                    "A pious man once said: \"I am amazed of he who gives to another what the Creator decreed for the latter, and afterwards reminds the latter of the favor he did for him, and seeks to be thanked for this. And I am even more amazed by one who receives his livelihood from another who is forced to provide for him and then submits himself before him, pleases him and praises him.\" ",
                    "If one's livelihood fails to come through the means he has worked on, it is possible that the money allocated to him for the day has already reached his hands (and that he doesn't realize it - PL) or that it will come through other means.",
                    "However the case, it is proper for him to engage in the means of earning a livelihood and not to be lax in pursuing after them, provided they are suited to his traits and physical abilities, as I previously explained.

                    "Similarly, we will say regarding health and sickness. A man is placed under a duty to trust in the Creator in this, while working on maintaining his health according to the means whose nature promotes this, and to fight sickness according to the customary ways, as the Creator commanded \"and he shall surely heal him\" (shmos 21:19). All of this, without trusting in the means of health or illness that they could help or hurt without the permission of the Creator.",

                    "It is even possible that He will heal him through something that is normally very harmful, as you know from the story of Elisha and the bad water, that he healed their damaging properties with salt (Melachim II 2:19), and similarly \"And G-d showed him a tree and he tossed it into the waters [and the waters became sweet]\" (Shmos 15:25), And the midrash tanchuma there explains that this was a bitter, oleander tree. Another example, \"let him smear crushed figs on the boils, and he will heal\" (Yeshaya 38:21) (and figs normally damage even healthy flesh - PL). And you already know of what happened to the pious king Asa when he trusted in the doctors, and removed his trust in G-d regarding his illness, the sharp rebuke he received for this (i.e. because he did not pray to be healed). And the verse says: \"For He brings pain and binds it; He wounds, and His hands heal.\" (Iyov 5:18).",

The proper way of trust in the Al-mighty for this is to engage in the means which G-d has made available to him to the extent necessary for his maintenance and sufficient for his needs of this world (i.e. his minimum necessary needs only - TL).",
                    "And if the Creator will decree for him more than this, it will come to him without trouble or exertion, provided he trusts in the Al-mighty for it and does not excessively pursue the means nor inwardly trust in them in his heart.",
                    "And if the Creator has not decreed for him more than his sustenance, even if all those in heaven and earth were to try to increase it, they would not be capable by any way nor by any means. And when one trusts in G-d, he will find peace of mind and tranquility of spirit, confident that G-d will not give over his portion to someone else, nor send it to him earlier or later than the time He decreed for it.

                    "Sometimes the Creator directs the livelihood of many men through one man. This is in order to test that man whether he will serve G-d or rebel against Him. And G-d will place this to be among the man's most difficult tests and sources of temptation. For example, a king who provides for his army and servants, or princes, ministers of the king, important officials, all of who are surrounded with groups of their servants, attendants, officers, wives, and relatives. They exert themselves to obtain money for those dependents through all types of means, regardless whether they are good or bad means. ",
                    "And the foolish among them will err on three fronts.",
                    "(1) In acquiring money, he will use bad and degrading means to take what the Creator has decreed he will take. And if he had sought after his wealth with proper means, he would have reached his desire, and both his religious and secular affairs would have succeeded, and he would not have received any less from what the Creator had decreed for him.",
                    "(2) He thinks that all the money that reaches him is for his own support. He does not understand that the money consists of three parts: one part, for the food he needs for his own body alone, and this is something G-d assures to all living creatures to the end of its days. The second part, for the food of others, such as his wife, children, servants, employees, and the like. This (extra money) is not assured by G-d to all people (that his business will prosper to the extent that his wife and children won't themselves need to engage in some means - PL), but rather only to a select few, and under special conditions, and this opportunity presents itself at certain times but not at others, according to the rulings of the Creator's system of kindness and justice. Third, money to hold on to. This is money which has no benefit for the man. The man guards it and accumulates it until he bequeaths it to another or that he loses it. The foolish person thinks that all the money decreed for him by the Creator is for his own sustenance and physical maintenance, and so he eagerly pursues it and exerts much effort to acquire it; and it is possible that he is amassing wealth for his widow's next husband, his stepson, or for his greatest enemy.",
                    "(3) The third error is that he provides money to those (dependents) as the Creator decreed this would happen through him, but he reminds them of his favors as if he were the one who provided for them and did them a kindness, and he expects them to thank and praise him richly, and that they serve him due to them, and he becomes arrogant, haughty, and inflated of heart. He neglects to thank G-d for them (that G-d appointed him as a means to bestow good on others whereby he would be an agent for this and receive reward for it - TL). He thinks that if he did not give this money to them, it would remain by him, and that if he did not provide for them they would not have any money. But really, he is the poor man, who will toil for nothing in this world and will lose his reward in the next world. ",
                    "The wise man, however, conducts himself in these three ways according to what will be proper for his religious and secular pursuits. ",
                    "And his trust in what is in G-d's hands is greater than his trust in what is in his own hands because he does not know if the money in his hand is meant for his own benefit or is merely placed in his care. And thus he will gain honor in this world and receive rich reward in Olam Haba (afterlife), as written in the psalm (112) \"Haleluy-a praiseworthy is the man who fears G-d..\" until the end of it.",
                    "There are some classes of people who busy themselves in acquiring money and amassing wealth only for the love of being honored by other people, and to make a name for themselves, and no amount of money is ever enough for them. This is due to their ignorance of what will bring real honor in this world and in the next. The reason they make this error is because they see the masses honoring the wealthy, but really, this honor is motivated by a desire for what they possess and to try to get some of what is in their hands. ",
                    "If the masses reflected and understood that the wealthy do not have the capability nor the power either to give or to hold back to someone except to whom the Creator decreed, they would not hope to anyone besides G-d. ",
                    "Nor would they find anyone worthy of honor except for he who the Creator has distinguished with praiseworthy qualities, for which he is worthy of the Creator's honor, as written \"Those who honor Me, I will honor\" (Shmuel I 2:30). ",
                    "And because the masses, in honoring the wealthy, were foolish in the causes of real honor, the Creator added to their foolishness in the causes of their requests [for money] (that they constantly seek to become rich - TL). And so they fell into great effort and tremendous toiling all of their days, while they abandoned that which is their duty to busy themselves with and to which they should hasten, namely, fulfilling their duties to the Creator, and to thank Him for the good He bestows on them, whereby their desire (for honor - TL) would have undoubtedly been closer to them in this way, as written \"long life is in its right, in its left wealth and honor\" (Mishlei 3:16), and \"wealth and honor is from You\" (Divrei Hayamim 29:12).",
                    "There exists among those who seek wealth, one who reaches all his heart's desire through the means we mentioned (commerce, skilled trade, etc), to another it came through an inheritance or the like, and he thinks it is due to the means, and without them, he would not have received anything, and he praises the means and not their Cause (i.e. the Creator who orchestrates all the means - PL).",
                    "How similar is he to a man in the desert, thirst weighing on him, who finds unclean water in a pit, and becomes full of joy. He quenches his thirst from them. And afterwards, he moves a bit further, and finds a well of pure water. He regrets on what he did previously, of drinking and quenching his thirst from the unpure water. ",
                    "Similarly, for the man who became wealthy through a certain means. If this means would have failed, he would have attained it through other means, as we explained earlier and as the verse says: \"nothing can prevent G-d from saving, whether through many or through few\" (Shmuel I 14:6). ",
                    "And the proper way for one who trusts in G-d, when his livelihood is withheld for some day is to say in one's heart: \"He who took me out (from the womb) to this world at a fixed time and moment, and did not take me out to it earlier or later, He is the One who is withholding my livelihood for a fixed time and a fixed day, because He knows what is good for me.\"",
                    "Likewise, when one's livelihood comes very exactly, no more than the amount for basic food, it is proper for one to reflect in his heart and tell himself: \"He who prepared my sustenance at my mother's breast, in my beginning, according to my need, and what was sufficient for me day by day, until He replaced it for me with something better, and (the milk's) coming exactly did not damage me at all, so too I will not be damaged now at all, by His sending me my food in the limited, exact amount, until the end of my days. ",
                    "He will be rewarded for this, as the Creator told our ancestors in the (Sinai) desert, whose matter was in this way: \"The people shall go out each day and gather what they need for the day\" (Shemos 16:4), and \"go and call out to the ears of Jerusalem and say 'I remember for you the kindness of your youth, the love of your betrothal, when you followed Me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown' \" (Yirmiyahu 2:2). ",
                    "Likewise, if one's livelihood comes through one means but not through any other means (that he would have preferred - PL), or in one place and not in any other place, or through one person and not through any other person, let one say in his heart: \"He who created me in a certain form, shape, characteristics, and measure and not through any other, for my purpose and benefit, He has chosen that my livelihood come through ways suitable to my purpose and benefit, and not through any other ways.\" And, \"He who brought me into this world at a fixed time, and through two specific people, and not through other people of the world, He has chosen for me my livelihood from a specific place and through a specific person, He made him the means to my livelihood for my benefit\", as written \"G-d is righteous in all His ways\" (Tehilim 145:17).",
                    "The explanation of the third category, matters of one's wife, children, household members, relatives, friends, enemies, acquaintances, those higher or lower than him among the various classes of people, the proper ways of trust in G-d is as follows. A man is necessarily in either one of two situations: either he is a stranger or he is among his family and relatives. If he is a stranger, let his companionship be with G-d during his time of loneliness, and trust in Him during his period of being a stranger. And let him contemplate that the soul is also a stranger in this world, and that all people are like strangers here, as the verse says \"because you are strangers and temporary residents with Me\" (Vayikra 25:23). And let him reflect in his heart that all those who have relatives here, in a short time, will be left a solitary stranger. Neither relative nor son will be able to help him, and none of them will be with him. (see Gate 8 ch.3 way #30 for more on this - Translator) ",
                    "And afterwards, let him consider that as a stranger, he is freed from the heavy burden of maintaining relatives and fulfilling his duties towards them. He should consider this to be one of the kindnesses of the Creator towards him, because if he needed to pursue a livelihood for providing his material needs, his exertion would be lighter without a wife and children, and their absence is peace of mind for him and it is good. And if he is concerned about his interests in the next world, his mind will undoubtedly be clearer and freer when he is alone.",
                    "And therefore the ascetics would leave their relatives and homes and go to the mountains, in order to focus their hearts in the service of G-d. Likewise, the prophets, during the era of prophecy, would leave their homes and live in solitude to fulfill their duties to the Creator, as you know from the story of Eliyahu's meeting with Elisha, which it is said of Elisha \"twelve pairs of oxen were before him, and he was with the twelfth\" (Melachim I 19:19). And as soon as Eliyahu hinted to him a small hint (to come with him), he understood him and said \"Let me, please, kiss my father and my mother, and I will go with you\", and afterwards, \"and he went after Eliyahu and ministered to him\". ",
                    "It is said about one of the ascetics, who traveled to a country to teach its inhabitants the service of G-d. He found them all dressed in the same manner and adorned in the same way. Their graves were near their homes, and he did not see among them any women. He asked them about this and they answered him: \"the reason we are all dressed alike is so that there's no noticeable difference between a rich man and a poor man, and the rich man will not come to arrogance for his wealth, and the poor man will not be embarrassed of his poverty, and so that our matter above the earth should be in our eyes like our matter below the earth (i.e. in the grave where everyone is dressed the same way - TL). It is said of one of the kings that he would mix with his servants, and there was no noticeable difference between him and them, because he would conduct himself in the way of humility in his dress and adornments. ",
                    "As to the reason why the graves of our dead are near our homes, they said, this is so that we encounter them and prepare ourselves for our deaths, and that we prepare our provisions for the afterlife. As to your noticing that we separated ourselves from women and children, know that we prepared for them a village near here. When one of us needs something from them, he goes to them and after obtaining his wants, returns to us. This we did because we saw how much distraction of the heart, great loss, and great exertion and strain there was when they were among us, and the great peace of mind from all of this, in separating from them, to focus on matters of the afterlife and to be repulsed by matters of this world. And their words found favor in the eyes of the ascetic, and he blessed them and commended them on their matters. ",
                    "If the one who trusts in G-d has a wife, relatives, friends, enemies, let him trust in G-d to be saved from them. ",
                    "He should strive to fulfill his duties to them (provide their necessities - PL), to do their wishes (to also provide them with a bit more than the necessities like the nature of the world - PL), to be wholehearted with them (to provide their needs willingly not like one forced to do so - PL). He should refrain from causing any harm to them, try to promote what is good for them. He should deal faithfully towards them in all matters, and teach them the ways that will be beneficial for them in their religious matters and the secular ways [which will benefit them] in the service of the Creator, as written (Vayikra 19:18) \"you shall love your neighbor as yourself..\", and \"do not hate your brother in your heart\" (ibid). Do not do this out of hope for future benefits from them or to pay them back for past benefits. Nor should you do this out of love of being honored or praised by them, or out of desire to rule over them - but rather with the sole motive to fulfill the commandment of the Creator, and to guard His covenant and precepts over them. (i.e. to see to it that they guard the covenant of G-d and His commandments - TL)",
                    "The person, whose motive in fulfilling their wishes is one of the [reprehensible] motives we mentioned above, will not obtain what he wants from them in this world. He will tire himself for nothing, and will lose his reward in the afterlife (since his intent was not l'shem shamayim - PL). But if his sole motive is to serve G-d, the Al-mighty will help them to make a return to him in this world, and G-d will place his praise in their mouths and they will hold him in high esteem, and he will reach the great reward in Olam Haba (afterlife), as the Al-mighty said to Shlomo \"also what you did not ask, I will give you, also wealth and honor\" (Melachim 3:13). ",
                    "But the ways of trust in G-d in dealing with those above him or below him in the various classes of men is as follows. The proper way to act when one needs to request some benefit of someone above or below him is to trust in G-d, and to consider them as means of obtaining what he needs, just like one makes the working and sowing of the land a means of obtaining his food. If G-d wishes to support him through it, He will make the seeds sprout, grow, and multiply, and one does not thank the land for this, but rather, he thanks the Creator alone. And if the Al-mighty will not desire to supply him through it, the land will not produce, or it will produce but be struck by damaging things, and one does not blame the land.",
                    "So too, when he seeks something from one of them, it should be equal in his eyes whether the person he asked is weak or strong, and he should trust in G-d for its completion. ",

",
                    "And if his request is not accomplished through them, one should not blame them, and not consider it due to their being lax in it, rather he should thank the Al-mighty who chose what is best for him in this, and praise them according to his knowledge of their efforts to fulfill his will, even though the matter was not completed according to his and their desire. Similarly, one should act with his acquaintances and friends, his business associates, employees and partners. ",
                    "If someone higher or lower than himself requests from him to do something for them, he should wholeheartedly use every means to do it, and apply his mind to do the matter, provided one is capable of doing it and that the person who requested it is worthy that he exerts himself on his behalf (but if the person is wicked, refrain from it as he wrote in the end of gate #3 - ML). And after this, he should trust in the Al-mighty for its completion. If G-d completes it through him, and makes him the cause for benefiting another, he should thank G-d for this privilege. If G-d withholds this from him, and he is not capable of doing it, he should not blame himself, and he should inform the person that he was not lax in doing it, provided that he indeed exerted himself to do it. But for one's enemies, those jealous of him, those who seek to harm him, he should trust in G-d regarding their matters. He should bear their contempt, and should not treat them back in the same way.",
                    "Rather he should pay them back with kindness, and to try to benefit them as much as he possibly can, and to remember in his heart that only G-d has the ability to benefit or harm him. ",
                    "If his enemy becomes a means to harm him, he should judge them favorably and suspect that it is due to himself or his past deeds from his bad start in life towards G-d. He should plead to the Al-mighty and seek from Him to atone for his sins, and then his enemies will become his friends, as the wise man said \"when G-d is pleased with a man's way, even his enemies will make peace with him\" (Mishlei 16:7).",
                    "The explanation of the fourth category, matters of duties of the heart and of the limbs which only benefit or harm oneself, for example, fasting, praying, dwelling in a sukka, taking a lulav, wearing tzitzis, observing the sabbath and the holidays, refraining from sins. This category also includes all of the duties of the heart since their performance does not affect others, and whose benefit or harm is limited only to oneself and is not shared by others. The proper way of trust in the Al-mighty in all of these, I will explain, and I ask the Al-mighty to teach me the truth, in His mercy. ",
                    "Any human action which is either service [of G-d] or sin can only take place if three factors occur. (1) the choice in heart and mind (i.e. a thought that it is fitting to do this thing - ML). (2) The intent and resolve to do what one chose. (3) The endeavoring to complete the act with one's physical limbs and to bring it into actuality.",
                    "[Of these three factors,] two are not beyond our control, namely, (1) the choice of service or sin and (2) intent and resolve to carry out the choice. For these, trusting in G-d would be a mistake and a foolishness, because the Creator left free choice in our hands whether to serve Him or rebel against Him, as written \"...[life and death I have set before you] and you shall choose life\" (Devarim 30:19). ",
                    "But the bringing out of the act into actuality, He did not leave in our hands, but rather, made it depend on external means which sometimes are available and sometimes are not. ",
                    "If in choosing to serve the Al-mighty, one would trust in Him and think to himself: \"I will not choose the service of G-d nor attempt to do any part of it until He chooses what is good for me of it\" - he has already strayed from the straight path, and slipped his feet away from the proper way, because the Creator has already commanded us to choose in matters of His service, and to intend and make efforts towards it, with complete, wholehearted resolve for the sake of His great Name, and He has informed us that this is the proper way for our welfare in this world and in the next. ",
                    "If the necessary means are available to us, so that we are capable of accomplishing the work in G-d's service which we chose to do, then we will receive the great reward for choosing it, for the intent and resolve to do it, and for completing the actions by our physical limbs. But if its accomplishment with the physical limbs is withheld from us, then we will receive reward for our choice and intent to do it, as we previously explained (in ch.3), and similarly for punishment of sins. ",
                    "The difference between the service of G-d and secular activities in this world, regarding trust in G-d, is as follows. For secular matters, it was not revealed to us which one of all the means is best and most beneficial for us nor the ways in which some course is more harmful and worse than other courses. We do not know which particular trade is best suited for us and most fitting for us in obtaining money, preserving health, and for general well-being. Nor do we know which business sector, which journey to undertake, or which other worldly endeavors will be successful if we engage in them.",
                    "Therefore, it follows that we must put our trust in the Al-mighty that He will help us choose and carry out what is the best choice for us, provided that we apply ourselves (in the means which are fitting to attain this thing - PL) and that we plead to Him to arouse in our hearts to make the good and proper choice for ourselves. (then after these two things we can have in our hearts the trust mentioned - PL) ",
                    "But the service of G-d is not like this, because G-d has already taught us the proper ways for it, commanded us to choose it, and gave us the ability to do it. If we then plead to Him in the choice we should make, and trust in Him that He will reveal to us what is good for us, we will be mistaken in our words (of prayer) and foolish in our trust, because He already taught us the proper way which will be good for us in this world and in the next, as written \"G-d has commanded us to fulfill all of these statutes, to fear the L-ord, our G-d, for our good, all of our days\". And regarding the reward in Olam Haba \"we will be rewarded, if we are careful to observe\" (Devarim 6:25).",
                    "Furthermore, in secular matters, sometimes a good means changes to become a bad means and vice versa, while for service of G-d and transgression it is not so, matters of good and evil do not switch positions and never change. ",
                    "Hence, for religious acts, trust in G-d is proper only in the completion stage of the act. After choosing it wholeheartedly and faithfully and after the second stage of resolving and making efforts to do it with a pure heart , and with intent to do it for the sake of His great Name. With this, we are obligated to beseech Him to help us in it, and to teach us on it, as written \"lead me in Your truth and teach me\" (Tehilim 25:5), and \"lead me in the path of Your commandments for I desired it\" (Tehilim 119:35), and \"I have chosen the way of truth, I have placed Your ordinances before me\" (Tehilim 119:30), and \"I have clung to Your testimonies; O L-ord; put me not to shame\" (Tehilim 119:31), and \"And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in Your judgments\" (Tehilim 119:43).

This is what is meant \"lead me in the path of Your commandments\" (119:35), \"support me and I will be saved\" (119:117), and many more like this. And I will explain in this gate which factors help and harm these things, and the proper path in it, with G-d's help. ",
                    "The fifth category, physical duties which affect others whether beneficially or harmfully, such as giving charity, maaser (tithes), teaching wisdom, commanding others to do good, warning them against evil, returning loans on faith, keeping a secret, speaking well of others, good activities, honoring parents, bringing the wicked back to G-d, instructing/advising others what will be good for them, pitying the poor and treating them with mercy, patiently bearing their contempt when arousing them to the service G-d, inspiring them to hope for the reward [in doing good], and instilling in them fear of punishment [for doing bad].",

And afterwards having done his utmost - to trust in G-d in the completion of the acts which he undertook, according to what G-d wants from us (that we do His will, accordingly He will help us to complete what we undertook - ML).",
                    "In all of this, one should be careful to hide his deeds as much as possible from those who do not need to know. Because if it is kept hidden, the reward will be greater than if it becomes known. And that which he is unable to hide, let him remember the important general principle which we explained, namely, that neither benefit nor harm can come from the created things, except by permission of the Creator.

                    "When the Creator completes a mitzvah (commandment) through him (that G-d benefits another person through him - PL), he should consider that this is a favor bestowed on him from the Creator. He should not rejoice if other people praise him for doing it, nor desire that they honor him for it, since this will bring him to become proud in his actions, and his purity of heart and motive towards G-d will be ruined, thereby his deeds will be spoiled and his reward for it will be lost.

For example, He specified which offences warrant capital punishment by stoning (i.e. falling from a height), burning, decapitation, or strangulation, or 40 lashes, death (through G-d's providence), premature death (karet), monetary fines - two, four or five fold, monetary damages by ox, pit, tooth, fire, damaging a man, embarrassing by seizing, slander, and other offences. But regarding the reward and punishment in the afterlife, the prophet [Moshe] did not explain anything for several reasons.",
                    "One of these is that the semblance of the soul without the body is foreign to us, and even less known is what the soul in that state would take pleasure in or suffer from. However, this was explained to one who understood such things, as G-d spoke to Yehoshua (the high priest) (who G-d granted special understanding into divine matters - PL) \"I will give you a place to walk among these (angels) that stand\" (Zecharia 3:7), and this was not referring to when the soul is joined to the body, but rather was a hint to what would happen after death, where the soul, in its simple, ethereal state, divested from and no longer using the body, resumes the form of the angels, after it had been purified and made radiant when its deeds were good in this world. ",
                    "Another reason is that the explanation of reward and punishment in the next world was received by the people from the prophets, and can be derived by the wise (in every generation, in addition to the transmitted tradition - PL), and it was left out of books as much of the explanation of the positive and negative commandments were left out, relying on the transmission from the oral tradition. ",
                    "Another reason is that the people were foolish and of little understanding (when they left Egypt) something which is not hard to see in the verses.",
                    "The Creator conducted Himself with them like a father who has mercy on his young son, when he wants to discipline him slowly and gently (so as not to overload him, so too the Creator did not want to inform them of the punishments in the afterlife which are very harsh - PL), as written \"Yisrael is a child, and I loved him\" (Hoshea 11:1). When a father wants to educate his young son in the wisdom with which he will attain exalted levels, and the youth is not capable of understanding them at that time, if he tries to induce him, saying \"bear the hard discipline and the learning, in order that you later reach the great levels\", the son would not have the patience to bear this, and would not listen to his father, because he does not understand them.",
                    "But if the father promised him with what is pleasurable right away, whether food and drink, fine clothing and a nice wagon, or the like, and warned him [that if he did not heed he would suffer] what will cause him immediate pain such as hunger, nakedness, spankings or the like, and gave him clear proofs and tangible evidence, so as to impress these promises and warnings in his son's mind and the truth of his statements, it will be easy for the son to bear the strain of the discipline and to endure its tedious work.",
                    "And when he becomes a young man and his intellect strengthens, he will understand the intent of the discipline he was put through (the exalted levels - PL) and turn towards them. He will think little of the sweetness of pleasures which he had earlier been so eager to run towards. This kind of education was a kindness toward him. (i.e. this conduct to motivate him initially through sweet things, etc. as before, was due to the father's mercy on him - PL) ",
                    "Similarly, the Creator encouraged his people with promises of rewards and threatened them with punishments that would come soon [i.e. in this world - PL] because He knew that after they would be strongly established in the service, their foolishness regarding reward and punishment here on earth would shed (i.e. that which they served primarily for reward in this world [would shed] - PL) and their intent in the service would be to Him, and they would direct their conduct for Him. And in this way, we can explain all of the physical forms ascribed to the Creator in scripture. ",
                    "Another reason, is that a man does not become worthy of the reward of Olam Haba (the next world) due to his good deeds alone (since the reward is infinitely great - TL). Rather he is deemed by G-d worthy of it due to two things besides his good deeds. (1) That he teaches other people the service of G-d, and guides them to do good, as written \"they who bring merit to the public shall be as the stars forever\" (Daniel 12:3). And also, \"to them that rebuke shall be delight, and on them will come the blessing of the good\" (Mishlei 24:25). And when the industrious man will combine the reward for those who he brought merit, with the reward for his own good deeds, and the reward for the faith in his heart and patient acceptance [of G-d's will] - he will be deemed by the Creator worthy of the reward of Olam Haba. (i.e. if he also brings merit to others in addition to his own piety, then certainly he is worthy of the reward, as written: \"to them that rebuke shall be delight\" - ML) ",
                    "(2) The second factor is a kindness from the Al-mighty, and generosity and goodness, as written \"to You, G-d, is kindness, for You pay a man according to his deeds\" (Tehilim 62:13) (i.e. even if one has only his own good deeds [and did not bring others to the good], G-d will bestow on him good reward in Olam Haba - TL).",
                    "The reason for this, is that even if a man's good deeds are numerous like the sand of the seashore, it would not weigh enough to cover even one favor the Creator had bestowed on him in this world. All the more so, if he has committed any sins, because if the Creator will hold a man strictly to account for his obligation of gratitude, all of his good deeds would be cancelled and wiped out by even the smallest favor the Creator has done for him, and that which the Creator owes him will not amount to anything. Hence, that which the Creator rewards a person for his good deeds is to be regarded as a Divine grace to him. ",
                    "The punishment in both worlds, however, is through truth and justice, and it is a debt a man must pay. Yet here too the Creator's loving-kindness is extended to us in both worlds, as written \"to You, G-d, belongs loving-kindness\" (Tehilim 62:13), and \"the compassionate One will atone for sin, and will not destroy\" (Tehilim 78:38). ",
                    "Another reason, is that good deeds are of two categories. (1) Those concealed from others, and visible only to the Creator, like the duties of the heart, and other similar duties.",
                    "(2) Those visible in the limbs and not concealed from other creatures.",
                    "For the fulfillment of the visible duties of the limbs, the Creator rewards with visible reward of this world. While for fulfillment of concealed duties, He rewards with hidden reward, namely, in Olam Haba. Therefore, King David, spoke of this with words which hint to this matter, as written \"how great is Your goodness which You hid away for those that fear You; [which you have done for them that take refuge in You before the sons of men]\" (Tehilim 31:20). And likewise, the way of punishments for hidden and revealed misdeeds, is similar to the way of reward.  ",
                    "The proof for this view is as follows. G-d has guaranteed to His people that for their visible service, He would give them visible and swift reward in this world. This is explained in parsha Bechukosai \"If you will go in My ways..\" (Vayikra 26), and likewise, for visible sins, visible and swift punishment in this world, because the masses understand only that which is visible not that which is hidden, as written: \"the hidden things belong to G-d, but the revealed things belong to us and to our children, forever\" (Devarim 29:28). And the verse says \"if the people will turn their eyes away from the [evil] acts of this man and his family, I will turn My face to this man and his family\" (Vayikra 20:4). Hence, the reward and punishment for the fulfillment or transgression of the duties of the heart belongs to the Creator. Therefore, Scripture omitted an explanation of their reward and punishment in the next world. (see Tov Halevanon for more details)",
                    "Another reason why rewards and punishments mentioned in scripture are limited to those in this world only is because the prophet is addressing worldly people. On the other hand, since Yehoshua (kohen gadol) was in the mystical world of angels (i.e. his soul was divested of his body at that time and was in the spiritual world - PL), G-d told him, \"I will give you a place to walk among these (angels) that stand\" (Zecharia 3:7). The proper way of motivating with hope and fear should be in accord with the time and place. Understand this. ",
                    "Another reason is that the purpose of reward in Olam Haba is essentially clinging to G-d, and drawing near to His supernal light, as written \"your righteousness will go before you, the glory of G-d will gather you in\" (Yeshaya 58:8), and \"the wise will shine like the radiance of the firmament\" (Daniel 12:3), and also, \"To bring back his soul from the pit (i.e. Gehinom see below Tov Halevanon), to be enlightened with the light of the living\" (Iyov 33:30). And no one can reach there except he who the Creator finds favor in, and the favor of the Creator is the root of the reward, as written \"his anger is but a moment, in His favor is life\" (Tehilim 30:6). And there are hints in parsha bechukosai that pleasing the Al-mighty [is the greatest reward], this is what is written \"My soul will not abhor you\" (Vayikra 26:11), and \"I will turn to you and be unto you a G-d and you will be unto Me a people\" (ibid, 26:9).

",
                    "It is not proper for one to trust in his own good deeds, and assure himself that he will receive reward in this world and the next due to his good deeds. Rather, he should strive and exert himself [to do good] and make efforts to thank G-d and be grateful for His constant kindnesses to him, and not be motivated by hope of future reward for his deeds. Rather he should trust in G-d and try his best to pay his debt of gratitude for His great favors towards him, as our sages have said \"Do not be like servants who serve their master on condition of receiving reward, rather be like servants who serve their master without the condition of receiving reward, and let the fear of Heaven be upon you\" (Avos 1:3) ",
                    "One of the pious said \"if one takes strict account of what he is obligated to the Creator for His kindness to him, no man would ever be worthy of the reward of Olam Haba for his deeds. Rather it is only as a kindness of the Al-mighty, therefore do not trust in your deeds.\" And King David said of this \"to You, G-d, is kindness, for You pay a man according to his deeds\" (Tehilim 62:13) (i.e. even the paying of a man for his deeds is only a kindness).",
                    "The seventh category - trust in regard to G-d's special grace to His elect and treasured ones on whom many favors which are indescribable will be bestowed upon in Olam Haba. The proper way of trust in G-d is as follows: To exert oneself in the means which bring one to the high levels of the pious who are worthy of this special grace from G-d. This entails conducting oneself in the ways of the ascetics who loath worldly pleasures, and to uproot from one's heart the love of them and desire for them and replace these with the love of the Creator, and to devote oneself to Him, to delight in Him, to be desolate/astonished from the world and its inhabitants (see commentary), and to follow the ways of the prophets and the pious, and to trust that the Al-mighty will show him favor as He will do with them in the afterlife.

But one who does not trust in G-d, even when he is prosperous, is always pained and in a state of continual anxiety. He is saddened and grieving, because he is little satisfied with his situation, and yearns to augment, increase, and hoard in. And likewise in bad times because he is disgusted by it, and it is contrary to his desires, nature and traits. So too, the wise man said \"all the days of the poor are evil\" (Mishlei 15:15) ",

Rather, he engages in them as part of his service of G-d who commanded us to occupy ourselves with the world, to maintain it and make it more habitable. If these means will yield him profit or help him avoid a loss, he will thank G-d alone for this, and he will not love and cherish the means more for this, nor will he rely more on them on account of this. Rather, his trust in G-d will be strengthened, and he will come to rely on Him and not the means. And if the means do not yield any benefit, he knows that his livelihood will come to him when G-d wants, and through whatever way He wants.

He is not even certain of paying back what he owes from past debts, all the more so for paying what he owes for future favors, because the righteous man cannot pay back the debts of gratitude of the Al-mighty on him except through the means of help which G-d renders him. And so, one of the pious in his praises of G-d said: \"Even the thinking person who has knowledge of You, does not praise his own religious acts, but rather praises Your Name and mercy, for You have prepared his heart to know You. Through You (Your help - ML) the people of Israel will be found worthy and be praised saying: \"We praised [ourselves] with G-d all day long, and we will forever thank Your name\" (Tehilim 44:9). "

As the wise man said: <i>\"Let the wise man hear and increase understanding\"</i> (Mishlei 1:5).",

He is interwoven in the forces of your soul and intertwined in the order of your spirit. He associates with you in the guidance of your physical and spiritual senses. He rules over the secrets of your soul and of what is hidden in your breast. He is your advisor in all of your movements whether visible or invisible that you wish to do. He lies in wait, watching your steps to lead you astray. You are asleep to him but he is awake to you. You look away from him but he does not look away from you. He masks himself as your friend, and pretends to show love. He enters in your inner circle of close friends and advisors. From his gestures and signs it appears he is running to do your will but in fact he is shooting deadly arrows at you to kill and uproot you from the land of the living, as the verse speaks of one like this \"like a madman who throws firebrands, arrows, and death; so is a man who deceives his friend and says, 'Am I not joking?'\" (Mishlei 26:18).",
                    "Among the strongest of his weapons which he will fire at you and wage war with you in your innermost being - is to try to cast doubt on things you deem to be true, and to confuse what is clear to you, and to confuse your mind with false thoughts and erroneous arguments, and to draw you away from what is for your benefit, and to cause you to doubt what is clear to you in your faith and religion.",

But if you leave your matters to him, and you are drawn after his will, he will not let up on you until he destroys you from both worlds, and uproots you from both lands, as written of one member of his legions: \"For many are the dead that she has felled, and numerous are all her victims; Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death\" (Mishlei 7:26-27).",
                    "Therefore, let no other war distract you from his war, no battlefield from his battlefield, no sword of a distant enemy from the sword of the enemy which is at close quarters and inseparable from you. Let not the effort to repel the enemy who will not approach you without permission (of G-d) prevent you from repelling the enemy who approaches you without [needing] permission, since he exists within you.",

Because if he defeats you, he will slay you, and if you defeat him, he will lie in wait all of your days to defeat you, as our Sages said \"do not believe in yourself until the day of your death\" (Avot 2:4). He does not consider the smallest of the smallest of your matters as too insignificant a means of defeating you, in order that he will gain a step to defeat you on a higher matter.",

Rather, let it be big in your eyes the smallest of the smallest victory over him, or the least increase of your power over him, so that you will gain a step for defeating him on higher ground. For his lust [to destroy] you will soon return, but he will not be capable of standing up to you when you stand firm against him as written: \"he will desire in you, but you will rule over him\" (Gen.4:7).",

How near is his downfall, how swift is his destruction, if you will realize his weakness! And as the wise man describes him: \"there was a small city with few inhabitants, and a great king came and surrounded it, he built high towers (to conquer it), but a poor wise man from the city defeated him with his wisdom but no one remembered that poor man\" (Koheles 9:14).",

Because they are small relative to the greatness of his heart's continuous desires for the lusts of this world, and lack of ability to attain them. The yetzer is the \"great king\", due to his possession of many tactics, soldiers, and legions. Then he \"surrounds it\", because he encompasses all matters of a man, whether public or private. Then he \"built high towers\", which refers to the many bad urges, bad thoughts, and disgraceful incidents which he strives to slay a man with, as we will explain later in this gate, with G-d's help.",
                    "And the \"poor wise man\" refers to the intellect, \"poor\", since its men and helpers are few as the verse continues \"no man remembered this poor man...and the wisdom of the poor man was despised\".",
                    "Despite [the man's] weakness, the text tells further of the yetzer's eager lust to wage war with a man, and how its power to injure him was easily removed because a little truth defeats much falsehood, just as a little light dispels much darkness.",
                    "From this analogy, there is to stir a person to wage war against the taavot (base desires), and to stand up to the yetzer with diligent exertion.

He uses imaginative arguments, which don't hold if a man contemplates them, and the purpose of this is to induce you to pursue the temporary pleasures, and fleeting desires, and so that you adopt the outlook of the group of men which the verse describes \"let us feast and drink because tomorrow we will die\" (Yeshaya 22:13). If you take counsel with your understanding on this, you will distance from this outlook with clear proofs which the early ones already brought and which are mentioned in the words of the prophets.",
                    "<i>2 - NO G-D</i><br>When the yetzer abandons hope of casting doubts in your mind on this, he will attempt to cast doubt on the [existence of the] blessed Creator. He will tell you that the world is neither new nor created. It was never different from what it is now nor will it ever be any different, and there is no existence which is more fitting to be a creator than a created (being), and no one is under duty to serve anything since everything is ancient and has existed eternally.",

Since the Creator does not need His creations, and does not lack anything, therefore your service to G-d has no reason and no purpose. But when you examine with your understanding, in the previous Gate of Reflection, regarding the beneficence of G-d towards us, and in the \"Gate of the Obligation to assume the service of G-d\" due to this, then this doubt will disappear, and you will obligate yourself in the service of G-d.",

He will tell you that what reason obligates and what the written torah obligates are both true, but what the Sages said is not essential and its acceptance is not obligatory.",
                    "But if you examine with your understanding, you will see that the rational laws as well as the scriptural laws are both greatly in need of the tradition. Because not one of them can be fulfilled completely without the tradition. For rational laws: without the boundaries and explanations of the oral torah regarding amount, kind, time, place, and other circumstances, it is impossible to derive the laws from logic alone. Similarly for scriptural laws, without an explanation from the oral torah on how to read it properly, the meaning of the words, its explanation and that of its derivatives, it will not be completely understandable from the verses alone. Therefore our Sages taught \"with 13 attributes the torah is expounded..\" (Beraita of Rabbi Yishmael) and \"the tradition is a boundary to the torah\" (Avot 3:13).",
                    "Furthermore, the torah itself, refers us to the tradition for its details as written \"If a matter eludes you in judgment,..then you shall rise and go up to the place the L-rd, your G-d, has chosen; And you shall come to the Kohanim, to the judge who will be in those days, and you shall inquire, and they will tell you the words of judgment.\" (Devarim 17:8-9), and \"And the man who acts intentionally, not obeying the priest who stands there to minister the L-rd, your G-d, or to the judge that man shall die\" (Devarim 17:12).",
                    "When you understand all of this, the doubts will leave, and it will be clear to you that [in addition to] the knowledge derived from reason and the scriptures, the oral tradition [is also indispensable].",
                    "<i>7 - NO REWARD AND PUNISHMENT IN THIS WORLD</i><br>When he gives up trying to entice you in these ways, he will try from the aspect of reward and punishment. He will claim that the course of events in the world does not follow the lines of justice because if there were justice in this world, the wicked would not prosper, and the righteous would not suffer, as one whom we mentioned in gate 4 (end of ch.3) of this book said.",
                    "But when the understanding will show to you the justice [of divine wisdom] in both of these ways as we introduced in the Gate of Trust, these doubts will vanish, and your heart will be at peace from this confusion.",
                    "<i>8 - NO REWARD AND PUNISHMENT IN THE AFTERLIFE</i><br>When the yetzer abandons the hope of overcoming us in these topics, he will try to cast doubt on us regarding the reward and punishment in the afterlife. He will try to confuse and distort this on us, due to the little mention of it in the torah and the little apparentness in it.",
                    "But if we examine what there is in the books of the other prophets (besides Moshe Rabeinu) on this matter [which is mentioned explicitly], for example \"[And the dust returns to the earth as it was,] and the spirit returns to G-d, Who gave it\" (Koheles 12:7), and \"I will give you a place among these who stand here\" (Zecharia 3:7), and \"How great is Your goodness that You have laid away for those who fear You\" (Tehilim 31:20), and \"no eye has seen O G-d besides you, who prepares for those who wait for Him\" (Yeshaya 64:3), \"your righteousness shall go before you; the glory of the L-rd shall gather you in\" (Yeshaya 58:8). When we study these and many more other similar verses in addition to what our Sages taught us in this, and with what our reason tells us, our souls will be at peace, and will be assured of the inevitability of reward and punishment in the afterlife.",
                    "<i>9 - PREOCCUPY IN SECULAR INTERESTS</i><br>When the yetzer abandons hope of trying to make us doubt in all the previous matters mentioned, he will try to make us lazy in the service of G-d, and will try to preoccupy us in our secular interests - eating, drinking, dressing, riding, and to derive enjoyment from other physical pleasures.",
                    "And when we listen to him regarding eating, which we cannot exist without, he will make superfluous things that are secondary to food appear so embellished, and rejoicing and pleasure so charming that we will envy kings and their ministers, strive to live like them, adopt their practices, and go in their statutes, in pursuit of physical enjoyments.",
                    "When the yetzer observes our desire and willingness in this, he will say:",
                    "\"Girdle your loins, bare your arms, O enticed man, exert with all your strength, O seduced man, to serve this world, and to serve its people, and you may attain some of your desire in it. Do not toil in matters of the next world. Rather, only in things which will help you in this world, to find favor among the people and the leaders, from kings to the rest of the people.\"",

This includes the knowledge of languages, the essentials of prose, fundamentals of grammar, music, charming riddles, amazing parables and unusual sayings. Try to frequently meet with charismatic people, and be knowledgeable of cultures to be able to converse with all types of people and won't sit silent and be considered a fool and a simpleton. Leave the other wisdoms because their work demand is high but their practical benefit is low.\"",
                    "But if from the beginning we did not open a door to the desires and satisfy their wants, nor accustom ourselves to indulge in superfluous things and chase after them, but instead we reply to the yetzer that we have no need for the superfluous things and that we already have enough mental anxiety in working to obtain what we need. If G-d sends us extra income without our having to trouble our heart or straining our mind for it, we will spend them in the right and proper manner as duty dictates. And if this does not happen, we will be satisfied with the basic necessities, and won't require more than this, then the [power of the] yetzer will be broken and smitten.",
                    "But if we listen to the yetzer in these things, we will descend step by step until he has brought us to hopeless destruction in this world and in the next.",
                    "All these example illustrations were on the first kind of enticements, which the yetzer uses to cast doubt on a man who is weak in wisdom and in the knowledge of G-d and of His torah.",
                    "SECOND KIND OF TEMPTATION OF THE YETZER<br><i>10 - TOPPLING THE WISE PERSON</i><br>But if a man is wise in understanding of G-d and His torah, the yetzer will strive to damage and confuse his wisdom and actions by objections and arguments from whichever side he can - from reason, scripture, and tradition. He will bring spurious proofs whose premises are not true and whose conclusions do not necessarily follow.",
                    "If your intellect is sharp and your wisdom is strong in analyzing and defending and debating a position, you will see the various fallacies in the proofs of your yetzer, and the truth will become clear to you. The correct view will be apparent to you, your knowledge will be freed from doubts and your actions, from confusion.",
                    "But if your knowledge and ability in this is deficient, his enticements on you will be (increasingly - PL) stronger. He will overcome you more frequently. His ruling over you and surrounding you in your outer and inner life will become more imperative because he comes to you with wisdom, and leads you using proofs which your mind relies on. If your understanding has become seduced by him, he will let up from you, and it will help him work against you, because you rely on your mind when you have doubts, and trust its reasoning when some matter is not understood by you.",
                    "And when the yetzer has overcome you, and rules you with the aid and support of your understanding, now, by deceiving you and representing in your eyes falsehood in the form of something demonstrated [as true], he will transfer you from this level, which was near to truth, and where falsehood was still concealed, and descend you to a lower level, where there is less truth and more falsehood.",
                    "And thus, he will not cease to lower you from one level to the next, until he will bring you to the level where the truth is completely concealed, and there is complete falsehood. And he will uproot you from this world, and topple you from the levels of reward in the next world. And your wisdom will become an evil for you, and your intellect, the cause of your destruction, as written <i>\"Hoy! They are wise in their eyes, and think they are understanding\"</i> (Yeshaya 5:21), and <i>\"they have rejected the word of the L-ord; and what wisdom is in them?\"</i> (Yirmiyahu 8:9), and <i>\"For the ways of the L-ord are just, and the righteous do walk in them; but transgressors do stumble therein\"</i> (Hoshea 14:10).",
                    "It has been said that when wisdom is used in the proper way, it is a cure for all illnesses, but if one sways from its proper path, then it becomes an all-encompassing disease without cure and without medication.",
                    "On this, the torah is compared to fire as written <i>\"Is not My word like fire?\"</i> (Yirmiyahu 23:29), because it enlightens the eyes, as written <i>\"the commandments of the L-ord are pure, enlightening the eyes\"</i> (Tehilim19:9) and <i>\"Your word is like a candle to my feet, and a light to my path\"</i> (Tehilim 119:105). But anyone who turns away from its proper path, it burns up with its fire, as written <i>\"by fire G-d will exact judgment\"</i> (Isaiah 66:16), and <i>\"on the wicked He will rain fiery coals\"</i> (Tehilim 11:6), and <i>\"Should I say; I will not mention Him, and I will no longer speak in His Name, but this was in my heart like a burning fire\"</i> (Yirmiyahu 20:9).",
                    "Therefore, be careful that your steps not stray from the path of the forefathers and the path of the early ones towards a new path you have devised, and be careful to not rely on your intellect nor to take counsel only with yourself. Do not reason on your own. Do not distrust your forefathers in the tradition they bequeathed to you as to what is good for you. Do not reject their advice in what they taught you because none of the plans you can think of were not previously known and their good and evil consequences were already weighed.",
                    "According to your reasoning, you may be impressed by the advantages which your plan brings at the beginning, but the long term negative consequences which the plan will bring are hidden to you. In your short sightedness, you will see its initial benefits but not its error and eventual damage. And the wise man said <i>\"do not remove an ancient boundary stone set up by your forefathers\"</i> (Mishlei 22:28), and <i>\"listen my son to your father's instructions\"</i> (ibid 1:8), and it is said of one who condemns the ways of his forefathers <i>\"a generation clean in its own eyes, and yet are not cleansed of their excrement\"</i> (ibid 30:12), and <i>\"there is a generation that curses its fathers\"</i> (ibid 30:11), and <i>\"the eye that mocks a father, [that scorns obedience to a mother will be pecked by the ravens of the valley, will be eaten by the vultures]\"</i> (ibid 30:17).",
                    "However, if you see fit to take on yourself additional duties, what you can, beyond what is required, then, provided you are fulfilling those that are obligatory and that your motive is love of piety, and after your understanding has [examined it and] agreed, and that it is far from lusts - then the resolution is good.",
                    "You will receive reward for this and are not deviating from the way of the forefathers. Because they already said <i>\"make a fence for the torah\"</i> (Avot 1:1), and <i>\"why was Jerusalem destroyed? Because they pursued the letter of the law, and did not go above and beyond the letter of the law\"</i> (Bava Metzia 30b), and \"says Rav Huna - he who only occupied himself is as if he had no G-d, for it is said: 'Now for long seasons Israel was without the true God' - What is meant by 'without the true G-d'? - It means that he who only occupies himself with the study of the Torah, it is as if he has no G-d\" (Avodah Zara 17b).",
                    "And one of the pious would say <i>\"he who does no more than his duty is not doing his duty\"</i>. But these \"extra\" acts are not accepted until one first fulfills the obligatory duties.",
                    "Our Sages already permitted us, and even [sometimes] obligated us to add on to the commandments, as they said (regarding friday evening) <i>\"one must add from profane to holy\"</i> (Yoma 81:2). Other examples are additions to fasts, prayer, charity, and refraining from the unnecessary permitted foods. They also warned us against taking an oath in G-d's Name, even for the truth, and from talking excessively even if the words are free of falsehood, and from discussing the affairs of other people, even if the words are not derogatory. Likewise, to refrain from lavishly praising someone even if it fitting, and to not speak bad or be disgusted by those who are falling short in fulfillment of their duties even if they deserve it, and many more things like this.",
                    "It is proper for us to now bring some examples of the second type of enticements of the yetzer which one can learn to apply to other matters and to guard oneself from them with G-d's help when he understands them. Because necessarily, every good thing has corresponding bad things which can spoil it. Therefore, one who understands the things that damage good deeds will be capable of guarding himself from them. But one who knows only the good deeds, and does not know the things which can damage them will end up with nothing due to the abundance of damaging things which will beset him.",
                    "One of the pious would instruct his disciples: \"learn the bad things first to avoid them, and afterwards learn the good things and do them, as written '<i>Plow for yourself a furrow and do not sow upon thorns'</i>\" (Yirmiyahu 4:3).",
                    "Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakai would say regarding the falsification of weights and measures (Bava Basra 89b) \"woe to me if I say, woe to me if I don't say; if I say - perhaps the swindlers will learn from my words, if I don't say - perhaps the swindlers will say that the Sages are ignorant of our tricks.\", the question was raised: \"did he speak of them or not?\", and concludes \"he did speak of them\", relying on the verse <i>\"for the ways of the L-rd are right, and the righteous shall walk in them, while the wicked shall stumble on them\"</i> (Hoshea 14:10).",
                    "EXAMPLES OF THE SECOND KIND OF TEMPTATION OF THE YETZER<br><i>11 - STRIVE TO FIND FAVOR WITH HUMAN BEINGS</i><br>We have already mentioned in this gate regarding the ways in which the yetzer tries to cast doubts in a man's mind. If he is not successful in raising such doubts, he will attempt the method of arguments and proofs in order to revoke the truths of his faith. When you stand up to his superficiality and the weakness of his proofs and he is not capable of standing up to you, nor of annulling what you know to be clear and true of the matters previously mentioned in this gate, he will return to flatter you and mislead you in regard to yourself. He will say to you: \"How I rejoice for you on your good faith and devoted heart to G-d. You have already reached a degree of piety which others in your generation have not been able to reach, and you have already thanked G-d sufficiently for His goodness and kindness to you. Now it is proper for you to also work to pay your debts of gratitude to your fellow men. Because you already know that they are means to your benefit and harm, and it is clear also that when they like you, you will be honorable in their eyes. But if they are angry with you, you will incur losses. Therefore, endeavor in things that will please them and that will find favor in their eyes, as our Sages said: \"One who is pleasing to his fellow men, is pleasing to G-d. [But one who is not pleasing to his fellow men, is not pleasing to G-d]\" (Avos 3:10).",
                    "Answer the yetzer:",
                    "\"What will I benefit from finding favor with someone who is weak like me, who does not have the ability to help me or harm me (see gate of trust), and the verse says: 'Withdraw yourselves from man whose [life] breath is in his nostrils, for by what should he be esteemed?' (Yeshaya 2:22). And even if it were my duty, how could I possibly find favor with all my contemporaries when I don't even have the ability to find favor with the members of my own household?!\"",
                    "\"And the proofs which you brought from the words of our Sages does not imply that one needs to try to find favor in the eyes of everyone. Rather this is like the case of the wise man that left in his will a command to his son: 'My son, to find favor with the public is not in your ability. Instead try to find favor with the Creator and He will grant you favor with the public, as written \"When G-d finds favor in a person's ways, He will cause even his enemies to make peace with him\" (Mishlei 16:7).",
                    "And likewise, when you see a man whom everyone, young or old, praises him and finds favor in his deeds, it is a proof that G-d has implanted love of him in their hearts, and established a good name for him on their tongues. The Creator does not do this for those He hates. And this is a clear and powerful proof that the Creator is pleased with him. But that a pious person should exert himself and strive so that others will praise him due to his service of G-d - this is not the way of the pious.",
                    "Therefore, be careful of this or similar things among the enticements of the yetzer toward you. Because he will try to lead you in this until he topples you in the trap of (the trait of - PL) flattery.",
                    "And on his praising you, answer him: \"what is this that you are congratulating me on? Is it because I know my duties to G-d? Just the opposite - because I know my duties to G-d, there is grounds for a claim against me, namely, that I am not acting in accordance with my knowledge.",
                    "And even if I were doing enough according to my knowledge of my duties to G-d, would this be enough of an expression of gratitude to the blessed Creator for even the smallest benefits He bestows on me? And what is the measure of my days relative to the measure of the days of the universe? Even if it were equal to the age of the universe, it would not be enough time for me to recount all the favors G-d has bestowed upon me. How much less then is it possible for me to repay my debts of gratitude to G-d for them? And scripture has already said: \"<i>All flesh is like grass, and all its kindness is like the flower of the field\"</i> (Yeshaya 40:6), and our Sages said <i>\"If I am not for myself, who is for me? And if I am only for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?\"</i> (Avos 1:14).",

                    "\"I rejoice at your service of G-d with good trust, in that you have placed all your matters to Him, and have freed your heart from [the thought] that any created being can possibly benefit you without G-d. Now you are truly trusting in G-d wholeheartedly. It is not proper for you to conceal from people the high degree of piety you have attained. Rather it is proper now that you have ruled over your inclination and overcome your base desires to show your piety to others, and to reveal your heart to them. In this way you will be honored by them in this world, and will have good name and a good remembrance among them, as the verse says: \"I will give them in My house and in My walls a memorial and a name, better than sons and daughters\" (Yeshaya 56:5). It also says: \"I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the land\" (II Shmuel 7:9). Additionally, so that they will learn from your deeds, and you will receive reward for them. Hence, don't hide your deeds from them except those things that cannot be shown to people. Therefore, you will receive honor and a good name in this world and good reward in the next\".",
                    "Answer him: \"what will I benefit from praises of people, and from a good name among them, when I know that I am lacking in my obligations to the Creator? What benefit can I have from their honor and esteem, when they are incapable of helping me or shielding me from harm? In this regard, aren't they like plants and animals. And maybe if I have these intents in my deeds, I will not find favor in their eyes. Rather, they will see me as a flatterer and I will become an object of disgust and contempt, and the result will be that I will lose my good deeds in that I did not have intent to G-d and will also fail in what I had hoped to attain from people in this world.",
                    "It is said of one of the kings of Israel who was asked: \"how did you like the (torah) reading of the Chazan? His voice was pleasing and he was an expert in the chanting of the cantillation notes.\" The king answered them: \"How could I like his reading. He was reading it only so that it would be pleasing to me, and to find favor in my eyes. But if he had intent for pleasing the Creator alone - then it would have been pleasing to me\".",
                    "We can likewise say about all those leading the congregation in prayers, and the chazanim who compose new piyutim (liturgical prayers), whose intent is to find favor in the eyes of men and not of G-d - that their prayers are not acceptable to the Creator.",
                    "Answer him further: \"Maybe, if I receive honor in this world for my deeds, nothing of my reward will be left in the next world, because I received it already in this world\".",
                    "It is said of one of the pious who entered a market to buy something. He came to one of the shops to buy it and the shopkeeper's neighbor told the shopkeeper: \"give in to him, and do his will since he is a pious scholar\". The pious man answered him: \"Thank you but I don't need special treatment. I came to buy with my money, not with my torah knowledge\". He refused to buy from that shop, and instead went to another shop where he was not recognized.",
                    "(Answer the yetzer also:) \"And that which you brought from the verse: 'I will make for you a great name..', this is just like the other things people aspire to in this world, such as wealth, honor, which the Creator bestows on His servants when His wisdom deems this proper, as written <i>\"And I have also given you that which you have not asked for, both riches and honor\"</i> (Melachim 3:13), and also <i>\"long life is in its right, to its left, wealth and honor\"</i> (Mishlei 3:16). But the pious do not intend for any of these things in their service, rather their sole intent is for the Creator who bestows good to who He wishes, among his servants or others, believers or non-believers, as His wisdom dictates, as written <i>\"wealth and honor is Yours\"</i> (Divrei HaYamim 29:12).",

Even if my name does go out to part of the world, certainly my memory will reach an even smaller part, and even then it will fade away after a short time and be forgotten as if it had never existed. And scripture says: 'The sons of men are but vanity, and men of distinction are a falsehood; were they to be put on a scale, together they would equal vanity' (Tehilim 62:10), and 'his breath leaves, he returns to his dust' (Tehilim 146:4), and 'there is no memory of the early ones' (Koheles 1:11).\"",

He answered: 'No'. He said: 'if so, you have not yet arrived.

Now, think about your business partner, and make an accounting of what he owes you and what you owe him, and how much you have collected of your debts, and how much is due to you. Consider which financial means of gaining livelihood are suitable to you and which are not.

This is to distract you and ruin your deeds. Because when you do them, you are ready in body but distracted in mind and spirit.",

He will also show him how much he still has to learn in this wisdom so that he makes a personal accounting and resolves to learn it. This way, the yetzer will distract him in all his acts of service of G-d, and will cause him much more damage than gain.",

                    "Because, if I went to borrow something from someone, and I asked him for the thing with my lips but my heart was against him, if he noticed this, he would be disgusted and repulsed by me. All the more so, that he would not grant me my request. And certainly, even more so, if he knew that I were planning in my thoughts not only things which would not find favor with him but rather even things which would make him angry with me. Surely, his hatred for me would be greater and his refusal more appropriate. And certainly, I would act in this same way towards someone who asked me to borrow something and if I knew his thoughts, just like the Creator knows what is in my heart.",

How can I expect to please Him with my conduct when I would not want a weak, created being like myself to conduct himself thus towards me, and which a fellow weak, created, and dependent creature like myself would likewise not be pleased to find in me, as it is written \"Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush:[therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their punishment they shall be cast down, says the L-ord]\" (Yirmiyahu 8:12).\" Then the yetzer will be smitten.",

And to distance yourself from flattery towards other people requires completely hiding all of your deeds from them, and showing them the opposite of what is in your heart.",
                    "Therefore, when you pray, be brief, and let there be no appearance of desire or striving in them. When you learn wisdom, do so in seclusion so that none but the Creator knows. Let no good trait in you become apparent. Show others laziness and heaviness in the service of G-d so that your name will not go out and you will lose your reward. Do not instruct others to do good nor rebuke them against evil. Do not show your wisdom nor teach others, and let there be no sign of fear of Heaven on you, and no sign of being a servant of G-d so that others will not honor you on account of this. In order that your zeal in hiding your deeds to people is complete, mix with and befriend all the different classes of people. Adopt their customs and walk in their ways regarding laughter and laxness in words of truth.",
                    "Do not guard so much from lies and oaths. Join them in their feasts and drinking parties, in their riddles, in their excessive indulgences and abundant laughter. Speak of people, and speak of their faults. To summarize, avoid all things that will bring you a reputation for asceticism.\"",

But if you answer him: \"you have already helped my enemies by waging war with me, by your cunning planning to destroy my strength and promote my downfall. How could I flee from a small fire towards a big fire? I have tried to flee from love of recognition and honor in order to not embellish myself towards people, and you are instructing me to embellish myself to them by leaving the service of G-d!\"",

But to pray with the congregation, to instruct others to do good, to rebuke others from evil, the study of wisdom, doing acts of kindliness, or the like - it is not right to neglect and abandon them due to concern for flattery. It is my duty to do them with intent to G-d. If people praise me or honor me for this, my reward will not be diminished in the least because while doing them, this was not my goal.\"",

He will say to you: \"behold, you are among the pious of the Creator, and His treasured ones. A person like you is surely worthy of reward in this world and in the next. You must exert yourself according to your abilities, maybe you will earn the reward through your good deeds and your zealous pursuing of the service of G-d with a good heart and with great joy. Set the reward before your eyes, and work your hardest to reach it, because this is the greatest success and joy, as king David said: \"A light is sown for the righteous, and for the upright of heart, joy\" (Tehilim 97:11).",

If it were not for your hopes for these, you would deny the constant favors G-d bestows on you and not obligate yourself to serve Him on account of them. And furthermore, you don't see that it is befitting to serve G-d (even without these benefits) due to His greatness, infinite power, and the manifestations of His wisdom. On this the Sages said: \"do not be like servants who serve their master in order to receive reward, but like servants who serve their master without [the condition of] receiving reward\" (Avos 1:3).",

                    "\"If the Creator wanted you to serve Him, He would force you and make you zealous in this, for only what He decrees can occur. How can you stand up against His decrees or defeat His judgments? You can only do what He decreed on you to do, because all things occur through the Creator's decrees as written 'I am G-d who does everything' (Yeshaya 44:24).\"",
                    "But if he sees you engaged in secular matters and occupations, he will tell you (the opposite): \"be careful of laziness and sluggishness. Don't rely on anyone but yourself, because good and evil are in your hands and success and failure in accomplishment depends on you. Therefore, exert yourself with all your strength and work with all your ability and you will succeed in obtaining your desires of this world. Guard from damaging things with all your strength and you will be saved from them, as the wise man said \"Thorns and snares are in the way of the crooked; whoever guards his soul will keep far from them\" (Mishlei 22:5), and \"A man's folly perverts his way\" (Mishlei 19:3), and \"from your own hands this came\" (Melachim 1:9). And so the yetzer turns around the argument, sometimes he comes with necessity and divine decree and sometimes with justice and free will according to what he deems fitting for him to entice you and weaken you.",
                    "But if you wake up and put to heart what our Sages said \"everything is in the hands of Heaven except the fear of Heaven\" (Berachos 33b), you will exert yourself in religious matters in the way of someone who understands that according to his own actions in them will be his reward and punishment, as written <i>\"He repays a man for what he has done; he brings upon him according to his ways\"</i> (Iyov 34:11). And in secular matters, you will conduct yourself with the conviction that all of your movements and the course of your matters are bound to the decree of the Creator, and you place your trust on G-d on all of them, as written <i>\"Cast your cares on the L-rd and he will sustain you\"</i> (Tehilim 55:23).",

You are unequaled in your generation and singular among your contemporaries. It is proper for you to show your superiority over them, by being disgusted by them and despising them. Recall their faults, publicize the wickedness in their hearts, shame them and rebuke them for it, until they are humiliated and repent to G-d, and feel regret for their past. Thereby, you will follow the conduct of the prophets, as written \"Son of man, describe the temple to the people of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their sins.\" (Yechezkel 43:10).",

If externally he appears reprehensible, perhaps his inner being is not like his outward appearance. If the prophets shamed and rebuked their generation, they did this with the permission of the Creator who looked into their hearts and corrupt interior. But it is beyond my powers of wisdom and understanding to know what is in the hearts and the minds. Perhaps their inner heart which is disgusting in my eyes is much better than their outer appearance, and I don't even know it. Perhaps, their inner heart is better than mine in the eyes of the Creator.",

Therefore he is more pardonable than me, because my knowledge is greater than his. For the Creator claims from a man only according to the extent of his wisdom. Therefore, I am more deserving to be considered reprehensible for my shortcomings in the Creator's service, despite my knowledge, compared to this man whose shortcoming is due to his ignorance. He rebels against G-d due to ignorance and error, while I rebel against Him knowingly and deliberately.",
                    "It is possible, that the bad in him is revealed and visible while the good is hidden and concealed. For me it is the opposite. Therefore, he is more worthy of G-d's mercy and forgiveness than me. One merit of him outweighs many merits of mine, because no one observes it except G-d and no one praises him for it nor gives him any honor. But for me, it is the opposite. For my external appearance appears better than his.",

And due to other people shaming him for it, his punishment will be reduced, while for me, my reward is diminished due to my good deeds being known. He will be left with the full reward of his deeds in the next world, and will reduce his punishment for sin in this world due other's belittling him over his sins. As for me, I will be left with the full measure of my punishments in the next world.",
                    "Furthermore, if I exert my mind to search for the flaws of others and examine their bad traits, this will prevent me from examining my own flaws and lackings, which is something more useful for me, and for which I am more responsible for. My condition is like that of a sick man whose illness distracts him from the illnesses of others, and the healing of himself from the healing of others.

Therefore exert yourself more on your secular matters so that your success will perpetuate and you will reach a higher level. Receive these days with joy and enjoy them because soon you will be called by name (to die), and you will be forced to answer and will go to the darkness of the grave, a place where there is no wisdom, no movement, no pleasure, and no pain.\" He will even bring proofs of this from what the wise man said: \"Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, where you are going\" (Koheles 9:10).",
                    "In your times of difficulty, he will bring to your mind the good life of the wicked, and the success of the nonbelievers, as written \"The tents of bandits prosper, and those who provoke G-d are secure\" (Iyov 12:6). He will say to you: \"the difficulties you are going through are due to your having clinged to the service of G-d and His commandments. You are not capable of handling this due to the unbearable load and remote goal. If you had unloaded this from your heart and rested from it, you would have had joy from your situation as you see by the wicked. You can see from what scripture says: \"with those near Me, I will be sanctified\" (Vayikra 10:3), and \"Only you did I love above all the families of the earth; therefore, I will visit upon you all your iniquities\" (Amos 3:2), and many more like this.",

Similarly with all the types of mitzvot and acts of kindliness, he will try to scare you and exaggerate the matter in your heart, in order to weaken your resolve.",
                    "But if the thought of sin enters your mind, he will inflate (in your imagination) the pleasure it will bring and will try to make you forget its punishment and encourage you to do it and tend towards it.",

It quickly passed and vanished, and the reward is mine forever. It will never fade nor end. One who fasts during the day and eats at night, is the same as if he didn't fast. His strength will return and his reward is reserved for him. And similarly one who rises for part of the night, and then sleeps, his alertness will return as if he never rose early, and the reward for his rising early and prayer will remain forever. And for the matter of charity, I have already explained this amply in the gate of trust.",

Don't you know that the torah is endless and has no final objective? Put your aspiration in knowing the elementals of faith and the foundations of the torah, and then learn what will make you esteemed with people, such as music and poetry, the depths of grammar, proverbs and famous sayings. Leave over the study of Jewish laws and the disputes of the sages in them. Do not enter into the study of the fundamentals of logical demonstration, comparisons, proofs, examining cause and effect, the connection between concealed wisdom and revealed wisdom, and other ways of reasoning because these subjects are deep and subtle. Rely on those who know the explanations of the tradition, even in matters which you can attain clarity through your own efforts, just like you rely on them for those matters which you cannot do so.",

You will become haughty, and praise yourself for your wisdom until you claim that you know more than you do. In your inflated spirit, you will think you know everything and don't need to learn more. [When teaching,] you will be annoyed when others raise a question on your words. You will increasingly consider yourself a wise man. You will seek to honor yourself by exposing the ignorance of others, and glee in embarrassing your peers.

Because, if it were not for this man, you would be in the eyes of men and G-d the most righteous of your generation. Denigrate him, envy him, hate him, seek out his faults, wait for his transgressions, watch for his mistakes and publicize them as much as you can, and belittle him for them.

Is it not enough that I am lazy in not doing the service of G-d as zealously as him, that I must also hate one who serves G-d? This is certainly no way to repay the Creator for what I owe Him. Rather, it is my duty, out of love of G-d, to love those who love Him, and out of honor of G-d, to honor those who honor Him, as written and he honors those who honor G-d\" (Tehilim 15:4).

Among them: a soft tongue, a low voice, humility at a time of anger, little exacting revenge when one has the power to do so. It as was said about a certain king who told a man who was convicted and a whip had already been brought [for punishment]: \"I swear by G-d, if I did not feel such a strong anger against you, I would have exacted a severe revenge on you.\" Then he pardoned him. It is said of him that he would say: \"I don't know of any sin of others which are greater than mine\"."

                    "<b>How many divisions it divides into</b><br>The explanation of the divisions of submission is as follows. Submission divides into three categories.",
                    "(1) One category applies to human beings and many species of irrational animals. It is poverty of the spirit and patient bearing of harm it is capable of avoiding due to ignorance regarding the right ways to remove the harm. This sort of submission is found among foolish and ignorant people due to their little knowledge and weak understanding of their soul and its capacities. This is called submission in the way of common language only, but in truth, this is merely spiritual poverty and blindness due to stupidity that has overcome the soul and prevents it from seeing what could further its welfare, as written <i>\"For You have hidden their hearts from understanding; therefore, it cannot raise itself\"</i> (Iyov 17:4).",
                    "Rather, true submission is that quality which comes into being after an elevation of the soul, after rising above being similar to the animals, with their base traits, and after it has elevated itself from being of similar traits to the lower class of men. This elevation stems from having greater wisdom than them, greater esteem of one's soul than them, and clear knowledge of which traits are good and which are base. When submission and lowliness comes after this elevation - then it is a praiseworthy trait. Otherwise, it dos not enter into the category of good traits and qualities of the soul, but rather among the disgraceful traits, since its submission is like that of the animals.",
                    "(2) The second category - submission towards other human beings. If because they rule over him, such as a prisoner in the hands of his enemy, or a slave in the hands of his master; or because he lacks what they have and greatly needs what they possess such as a tenant to his landlord or a poor man who looks to the generosity of the wealthy man, or a student to his teacher, or a substantial loan that one is unable to repay and he must be submissive and lower himself before his lender, as written <i>\"A rich man will rule over the poor, and a borrower is a slave to a lender\"</i> (Mishlei 22:7).",
                    "To this category belongs the submission of one who knows about himself that he is falling short regarding the bounds (the torah set -PL) in matters of this world and the next, and is ignorant of the proper path. When he finds the prophet of his generation or righteous teacher or anyone else who preaches the proper path, he will submit to him and lower himself before him, as our teachers said: <i>\"serving (a wise man) is greater than learning by him\"</i> (Berachos 7b), as written: <i>\"Elisha ben Shafat who poured water for Eliyahu\"</i> (Melachim II 3:11), it does not say: <i>\"who studied by Eliyahu\"</i> but rather: 'who poured water', this teaches that serving a Sage is greater than studying by him (one grows more from this); and also: <i>\"his (Moshe's) attendant, Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, would not depart from the tent\"</i> (Shmos 33:11). Likewise the wise man said regarding the general masses: <i>\"A rich man will rule over the poor, and a borrower is a slave to a lender\"</i> (Mishlei 22:7).",
                    "This category of submission, proper though it may be, is not of universal character, since it does not apply to all human beings, nor does it apply at all times and in all places. Because, when the prisoner leaves his prison, or when the slave redeems himself, or the lender pays back his debt, or the student leaves his teacher's presence, or the poor man leaves the rich man's presence - it is not their duty to submit to them, and to humble themselves and lower themselves before them anymore.",
                    "(3) The third category: submission to the blessed Creator. This duty applies to all rational beings. They are obligated in it at all times and in all places. To this (category of submission) was our intent in this gate.",
                    "The submitted one is called in scripture: \"humble\", \"low in his eyes\", \"modest\", \"broken\", \"low of spirit\", \"broken spirited\", \"crushed\", \"soft hearted\",\"weak in spirit\", \"broken hearted\", \"bowing spirit\".",

                    "(9) When the Creator rebukes him and humiliates him on having rebelled against Him, he will become submitted and terrified, as written on Achav <i>\"Have you seen how Ahab has submitted himself before Me?\"</i> (Melachim 21:29).",

If it is improper to speak disparagingly of a dead dog, all the more so for a living human being. And if it is proper to praise the carcass of a dead dog for the whiteness of its teeth, how much more so, according to this, is it a duty to praise a human being endowed with intelligence and understanding.

He should always strive to reach a higher level, as the verse says of Yehoshafat <i>\"And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the L-ord\"</i> (Divrei Hayamim II 17:6), and let one always complain to himself that he is not doing enough of his torah duties to G-d and men.

For the sake of G-d, he should put aside all haughtiness, and renounce personal pride and dignity while he is performing any religious service, whether he is alone or among a crowd of people. As the verse said about Aharon, in his exalted status (as head priest), <i>\"And he shall lift out the ashes\"</i> (Vayikra 6:3).

Likewise, let one not conduct himself in his personal way of forgiving others, when he sees a man oppressing another man. Rather, he should come to the rescue of the oppressed and help to free them from the hands of their oppressors, as written <i>\"O house of David, thus said the L-ord; Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor\"</i> (Yirmiya 21:12), and <i>\"I broke the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth\"</i> (Iyov 29:17).",

He should exhort them on the good, and warn them on the evil forcefully and by word of mouth to the extent of his ability, and be swift to exact the punishment G-d commanded to administer to one who is guilty. He should not be humble or lowly in this, as written by Pinchas: <i>\"Then Pinchas stood up and exacted justice, and the plague was stopped. It was accounted for him as a merit for generation to generation forever\"</i> (Tehilim 106:30).",

No falsehood should come out of his lips. He should not sit in the company of men engaged in laughter and idle talk, nor delight in the worldly things ignorant people delight in. He should act like this out of submission and lowliness of spirit, not out of arrogance and pride as the prophet said <i>\"I sat not in the assembly of merrymakers, nor did I rejoice; because of Your hand I sat alone, for You filled me with indignation\"</i> (Yirmiya 15:17)."

If you knew the full extent of my bad deeds and transgressions, you would flee from me, fearing that the punishment of the Creator which they merit, would befall you too, as a poet once said: \"if my neighbors could smell my sins, they would run away and keep far from me\", and as Iyov said: <i>\"Did I, like men, cover my transgressions, to conceal my iniquity in my hiding place?\"</i> (Iyov 31:33).",

Stop my brother, and be concerned for your merits, that you do not lose them without your noticing it.

                    "(6) The service of the humble man is acceptable to G-d, as written: <i>\"The sacrifices of G-d are a broken spirit; [O G-d, You will not despise a broken and crushed heart]\"</i> (Tehilim 51:19). His sin is quickly forgiven if he repents from it, as written: <i>\"He who conceals his sins will not succeed, but he who confesses and abandons [them] will obtain mercy\"</i> (Mishlei 28:13), and <i>\"When men are cast down, then you shall say, There is lifting up; and He shall save the humble person\"</i> (Iyov 22:29).",
                    "FINAL WORDS<br>These ten roots of submission will clarify for you, my brother, the remaining qualities of this important, supremely lofty virtue, which I have not mentioned in this gate. Remember therefore what I have called to your attention concerning this virtue. Place it before your eyes. Ponder it always. Strive to acquire it. Be constantly checking it with your soul and faculties. Seek the help of G-d in this. Plea to Him for it, in order that you be drawn closer to Him and attain His favor. Perhaps He will and straighten you to this virtue, thereby preparing for you the path to Him, as the pious would ask after their prayers: \"O G-d, keep my tongue from evil and my lips from deceit. Help me to be silent in the face of derision, and let my soul be like dust to everyone.\"",

The wise man already exhorted us as to the right road a man should take in this world in saying: \"Two things have I asked of you... Remove far from me vanity and lies: [give me neither poverty nor riches]; give me my daily bread. [lest I become sated and deny, and say, 'Who is the L-ord?' Or lest I become poor and steal\" (Mishlei 30:7-9).",
                    "Wake up my brother! Do not evade from healing the sickness of pride from your soul and your traits with the medicines I have taught you. Let not your observing of the masses' neglecting the healing their souls from this disease stop you from doing so, in saying to yourself: \"I will share the same fate as them\". Because, if a blind man finds the potions which can benefit and heal him if he applies them, it is not proper for him to procrastinate using them and say \"I will share the same fate of my blind friends\". Anyone who heard him saying such a statement would scorn his words and ridicule his reasoning.",
                    "According to this, examine your soul, and exert yourself with all of your might to promote its well-being. Do not neglect what will benefit you in this world and in the next, lest you die without fulfilling your longing for exalted spiritual levels which you are capable of reaching, as the wise man said: <i>\"The desire of a lazy man will bring about his death, for his hands refuse to labor\"</i>(Mishlei 21:25), and <i>\"By the fields of a lazy man, I passed and by the vineyard of a man without sense. And behold, thistles had grown all over it; nettles had covered its surface, and its stone fence had been torn down\"</i> (Mishlei 24:30), and the rest of the matter.",

                "Since our preceding discussion dealt with the subject of submission, which is the root and beginning of repentance, I deemed it fit to follow with a clarification of its essential parts and the ways to complete its fulfillment.",
                "I will start with the obligation and necessity for repentance. For it is already clear to us through reason and scripture that a human being falls short in the fulfilment of his service to the Creator which he is under duty to perform.",
                "Through reason:",
                "By what we observe of man, his changing nature, his composition of different elements, his opposing natures, his changing moods and emotions, the changing of circumstances which motivate his behavior. All this inevitably causes changes in his actions according to the state he is in, such as from decent to indecent, wicked to righteous, good to evil. For this it was necessary for the torah to restrain him (from evil) and guide him (to good).",
                "Through scripture:",
                "Among them, what the verse says: <i>\"for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth\"</i> (Bereishis 8:21), and <i>\"the L-ord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually\"</i> (Bereishis 6:5), and <i>\"a man is born as a wild donkey's colt\"</i> (Iyov 11:12), and <i>\"Behold, the moon has no brightness\"</i>(Iyov 25:5) and <i>\"how much less, man, who is a worm, and the son of man, who is but a maggot!\"</i> (Iyov 25:6), and <i>\"[How then can man be justified with G-d,] or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?\"</i> (Iyov 25:4).",
                "Since we have clarified the reality that man's actions fall short, it was out of Divine grace to man that the Creator gave him the capability of rectifying his mistake and of returning the loss of his service through repentance. G-d encouraged the matter and promised (its effectiveness) through his servants, the prophets. And He expanded the possible excuses (vindications) for the man who went off the path of His service, and promised us that He would accept these excuses from us, and desire in us quickly, even if we rebelled against His word and broke His covenant for a long time as written: <i>\"And when a wicked man repents of his wickedness and performs justice and righteousness, he shall live thereby...\"</i> (Yechezkel 33:19).",
                "Since tzadikim (righteous people) fall into two categories: (1) those saved from sin and iniquity, (2) those who sinned but repented. Since the vast majority of tzadikim are of the penitent (second type), therefore the psalmist opened with <i>\"How blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, Whose sin is covered\"</i> (Tehilim 32:1), and afterwards spoke of the first type.",
                "And even though, those saved from ever sinning are on a higher level (than the penitent), since every penitent was a tzadik before he sinned, but not every tzadik was a penitent. And David said of them <i>\"How blessed is the man to whom the L-ord does not count in him iniquity\"</i> (Tehilim 32:2), and the reason he mentioned them second is because they are few to be found in every generation, as written: <i>\"If You, L-ord, should mark iniquities, O L-ord, who could stand?\"</i> (Tehilim 130:3), and <i>\"For there is not a just man on earth who does good and sins not\"</i>(Koheles 7:20), and <i>\"for (there is) no man who does not sin\"</i> (Melachim 8:46).",
                "Because of this our Rabbis instituted in the beginning of our (Amida) prayers the matter of repentance and forgiveness in saying <i>\"harotze biteshuva\"</i> (who desires repentance), and <i>\"hamarbe lisloach\"</i> (who abundantly forgives).",

                    "If his withdrawing out of the service consists only in abandoning what the Creator commanded to do (but not in doing what He warned against), then the repentance for his shortcomings will be to exert himself in the proper acts and to cling to the roots of repentance which I will clarify in this gate.",
                    "If his withdrawing consisted of doing what the Creator warned against, the way to make up his failing will be in guarding from returning to do any form of this act, to endeavor to do its opposite, and to cling to the roots and conditions of repentance which I will clarify in this gate with G-d's help.",

After he returns to his original balance, he can reduce his diet to normal amounts.",
                    "If his illness was due to habitually eating food harmful to him (ex. too much spicy food), the way of his healing would be to abstain from this food or others similar, and to habitually eat foods of an opposite nature and composition (ex. non spicy), until he returns to his original state. When his health is restored and he reaches a balanced state, he can eat foods midway both types of nature and composition (mildly spicy), and the verse already compares moral iniquities to bad food as written: <i>\"But every one shall die for his own iniquity. He who eats the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge\"</i> (Yirmiya 31:29)."

But when he does find the opportunity, his evil inclination overpowers his understanding and he does not refrain from it. After he finishes the deed, he realizes the shamefulness of his act and regrets what he did. This person repented with his mouth but not with his heart, with his lips but not with his deeds, and he is guilty and deserving of the punishment of the Creator. Of such a person, it is written: <i>\"Will you steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely,... And come and stand before Me in this house, which is called by My Name, and say, 'We are saved'...? Has this house, which is called by My Name, become a cave of thieves in your eyes?...\"</i> (Yirmiya 7:9).",
                    "(2) One who repents in his heart and in deed. His understanding stands up to his evil inclination. He trains himself to discipline his inward being, and fight its lusts until he defeats it and restrains it from what is hateful to the Creator. But his inner being always desires to draw him to the opposite of the service of G-d, and longs to do transgressions. He exerts himself to restrain it. Sometimes he defeats it, sometimes it defeats him. This person is not complete in the way of repentance. It will not secure an atonement, until he renounces the sins completely, as written: <i>\"Therefore by this the guilt of Jacob will be atoned for, and this will be the full fruit of the removal of his sin: when he makes all the stones of the altars like chalkstones crushed to pieces, no Asherim or incense altars will remain standing\"</i> (Yeshaya 27:9).",
                    "(3) A man who has fulfilled all the conditions of repentance (as will be explained later), which means, has strengthened his intellect over his lusts, and habituated himself in making a personal accounting (see gate#8), fears his Creator, is in awe of Him, contemplates the greatness of his sin and error, recognizes the infinite greatness of the One who he rebelled against and He whose word he transgressed, places his sins always before his eyes, regrets them and prays for forgiveness on them all the days of his life, until his final end comes - to the Creator, this person is worthy of being spared."

Because, if this is not clear to him, and he is in doubt or ignorant of it, it is not possible for him to regret it and seek forgiveness for it, as written: <i>\"For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me\"</i> (Tehilim 51:5)",
                    "(2) He must understand the gravity of his sin and its disgracefulness, since if it is not clear to him that his deed was evil, he will not regret it nor take on the conditions of repentance for it. He will imagine that his act is like unintentional and that he will easily be able to justify himself, as written: <i>\"But who can discern their own errors? Forgive my hidden faults\"</i> (Tehilim 19:13).",

But, if it is clear to him that he will be punished for it, he will regret it afterwards and seek forgiveness, as written: \"<i>For after my return I have completely changed my mind, and after I had been brought to know myself (the punishments waiting for me) I smote upon my thigh</i>\" (Yirmiyahu 31:18), and <i>\"My flesh bristles from fright of You, and I dread Your judgments\"</i> (Tehillim 119:120).",

It is not subject to being neglected, forgotten, or overlooked, as written: <i>\"Is it not laid up in store with Me, sealed up among My treasuries?\"</i> (Devarim 32:34), and <i>\"By the hand of every man He seals so that every man should know His deed\"</i> (Iyov 37:7). Because if one thinks that since he has not been punished for it until now, therefore the sin is discarded and not pending for him, then he will not regret it nor seek forgiveness for it, as written <i>\"Because the sentence of an evil deed is not executed swiftly; therefore, the hearts of men are fully set in them to do evil\"</i> (Koheles 8:11).",
                    "(5) He must be fully convinced that repentance is the remedy for his illness, and the road to recovery from his evil deed and disgraceful conduct, and through it he will correct his error and recover what he had lost. Because if this is not clear to him, he will despair from obtaining the Creator's atonement and mercies, and he will not seek forgiveness for past wickedness, as written <i>\"So have you spoken, saying: For our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and because of them we are melting away, so how should we then live?\"</i> (Yechezkel 33:10), and they were answered by the Creator through His prophet: <i>\"Say to them: As I live, says the L-ord G-d, I do not wish for the death of the wicked, [but for the wicked to repent of his way so that he may live. Repent, repent of your evil ways, for why should you die, O house of Israel]\"</i> (Yechezkel 33:11).",

He should weigh the punishment of the sin in the next world against the pleasure (he got from the sin in this world), and the sweet bliss of the reward for good deeds he will get in the next world against the suffering he has [here] in doing them, as our sages taught: <i>\"Consider the loss from doing a mitzvah against its reward and the gain from doing a sin against the loss it involves\"</i> (Avos 2:1).",

It is said of one who persists in his sins for a long time: <i>\"no man repented himself of his wickedness\"</i> (Yirmiyahu 8:6). We ourselves can see in relationships between human beings, that when one who wronged his fellow shows regret for having wronged him, this will be strongest the factor for his fellow's granting him forgiveness.",

Abandonment (of sin) is a sign of his firm faith in reward and punishment, as written: <i>\"The wicked shall give up his way, and the man of iniquity his thoughts, and let him return to the L-ord, who shall have mercy upon him, and to our G-d, for He abundantly pardons\"</i> (Yeshaya 55:7). Of one who persists in his [evil] ways for a long time, the prophet says: <i>\"For the iniquity of his covetousness was I angry, and smote him, and he went on forwardly in the way of his heart\"</i> (Yeshaya 57:17).

Beseeching forgiveness demonstrates submission and humility before G-d, and confession of one's sin is a ground for forgiveness, as written: <i>\"he who confesses and renounces them will obtain mercy\"</i> (Mishlei 28:13). Regarding the opposite of this, it is said: <i>\"[Yet you say, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me.] Behold, I will contend with you, because you say, I have not sinned\"</i> (Yirmiyahu 2:35), and <i>\"he that conceals his transgressions will not succeed\"</i> (Mishlei 28:13). Similarly we can observe among human beings, that if one wrongs his fellow, and afterwards humbles himself towards him, and admits that he sinned against him and wronged him and beseeches forgiveness from him, and the fellow recognizes that he truly regrets the wrong he committed, the fellow will not refrain from forgiving him and will overlook the wrong-doing, and the grudge in his heart against him will be removed.",

The resolution not to repeat [the sin] reflects his understanding of the wickedness of his deed and the gravity of his sin, as written <i>\"If I have committed iniquity, I will do no more\"</i> (Iyov 34:32), and <i>\"Assyria shall not save us... nor will we say any longer to the work of our hands, you are our gods\"</i> (Hoshea 14:4). Of one who acts in the opposite manner, it is written: <i>\"Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may you also do good, that are accustomed to doing evil\"</i> (Yirmiya 13:23). And similarly we can observe among human beings that when one who wronged his fellow takes on himself not to wrong him again, and demonstrates that he regrets and abandons his sin and confesses it, this will complete the grounds which lead to forgiveness and removal of his iniquity, and cancelling the punishment from him.",

                    "(4) By tears, lamentations, and mourning, the penitent should express remorse for the sin he had committed, as written <i>\"Rivers of waters run down my eyes because they did not keep Your commandments\"</i> (Tehilim 119:136), and <i>\"Let the priests, the ministers of the L-ord, weep between the porch and the altar\"</i> (Yoel 2:17)",

                    "The conditions for renouncing (of sin) are also five, as follows:",

This is like the Rabbinic fences which our sages commanded us, in saying <i>\"make fences for the torah\"</i> (Avos 1:1).",

He should not be like those which the verse speaks of: <i>\"with their lips they honor Me, but their heart is far away from Me. their reverence for Me consists of tradition learned by rote\"</i>(Yeshaya 29:13), and <i>\"Yehoash did what was proper in the eyes of the L-rd all the days that Yehoyada the priest instructed him\"</i> (Melachim II 12:3, which implies after the death of Yehoyada, his teacher, he stopped doing what was proper).",

He feels full of shame before the Creator, his heart penetrated by the fear of the punishment, his spirit is broken.

For the tzadik is not assured that his heart will not become proud and haughty for his deeds. It was said that \"sometimes a sin is more useful to the penitent than all the righteous deeds of the tzadik, and sometimes a good deed damages the tzadik more than all the sins of the penitent\".

The person afterwards repented from his evil path, and fulfilled all the conditions and requirements of repentance. In this case, forgiveness will not be granted until he receives suffering in this world with what he will be able to bear and so be cleansed of his sins.

He is not subject to forgetting nor overlooking anything. No matter can distract Him from another matter. None can escape from His justice, and there is no end to His reign?

And the slave considers the teachings of the torah and its rousing as to what is the will of G-d and what is against it and will bring G-d's wrath upon him - he will use all movements of his body and all powers of his spirit for what will find favor in the eyes of his Master, and bring him closer to Him. He will remove the veil of foolishness from himself, and don the garment of awe and reverence from Him and love of Him, and he will desire what G-d wants - then the great good, and the great light from G-d will come upon him, as written \"O G-d in the light of Your countenance they shall walk\" (Tehilim 89:16), and \"the L-ord will cause His countenance to shine on you and favor you\" (Bamidbar 6:25).",

                    "I will answer this question as follows: Abstinence is a term which connotes many matters. The term is commonly used but the true matter is a hidden secret. When the cloak is removed, and the seal is broken - its hidden matter will appear, and its purpose will be revealed.",
                    "The plain meaning of abstinence is to bridle the inner lusts and to refrain from something, that one has the ability and opportunity for due to a reason which obligates this. It is said: \"the abstainer is one who has the power but does not use it\".",
                    "The reason which obligates bridling the inner lusts divides into two categories:",
                    "1. That which applies to human beings [collectively] and many of the other living creatures",
                    "2. That which applies specifically to men of torah (Jews).",
                    "General abstinence is that which is practiced for the welfare of our bodies and to keep our secular matters in good order. Examples are: the practice of kings in instituting laws of the land, the regimen prescribed by doctors for the healthy or the sick, the practice of every intelligent person to bridle his lusts for food, drink, marital relations, clothing, speech, and his other activities and pleasures.",
                    "The abstinence which applies specifically to men of torah (religious people) is that kind which the torah and reason teaches on for the benefit of the soul in the Afterlife, as I will explain later on with G-d's help.",
                    "The need for abstinence in its general sense is due to what I have already introduced in the third gate of this book. Namely, that the Creator's purpose in creating mankind was in order to bring difficulties to the soul and test it in this world so that it purifies itself and attains the form of the holy angels, as written <i>\"If you walk in My ways, and if you keep My charge, you, too, shall judge My house, and you, too, shall guard My courtyards, and I will give you a place to walk among these that stand (i.e. the angels)\"</i> (Zechariah 3:7).",
                    "Divine wisdom necessitated the testing of the soul [by union] in physical earthen bodies which can grow and gain mass through eating foods suitable for it. G-d then implanted in the souls of human beings a desire for the foods appointed to its body in this world in order to sustain and maintain them during the time of their union.",
                    "G-d also implanted in human beings another power. Through this, a man longs for marital relations, so that a human being should procreate another individual to take his place. The Creator granted him reward for these functions, namely, the pleasure in this.",
                    "G-d instituted on man an inclination which drives him to eat, drink, engage in marital relations, and partake of other pleasures and relaxations, which further the welfare of his body, as written: <i>\"also he has set the world in their heart[...that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labor, it is the gift of G-d]\"</i> (Koheles 3:11-13).",
                    "But when this inclination predominates over the understanding, and the soul is drawn to it, the man turns to the excesses which bring to his detriment and to the destruction of his body. It is necessary because of this, a measure of abstinence from pleasures and relaxations, in order to balance his tendencies, and that his affairs be in proper order in this world, so that he will be considered praiseworthy in them, as written: <i>\"A good man shows favor, and lends: he will guide his affairs with judgment\"</i> (Tehilim 112:5).",
                    "Since it is necessary for human beings to practice abstinence which will further their welfare in this world by taking from it only what is necessary, it follows that there should be in this world complete ascetics which separate and cut themselves off completely from secular occupations. So that all of mankind can learn from them on abstinence, each person according to his need, and according to what is fitting for his customs and tendencies.",
                    "It would not, however, further the welfare of mankind if everyone would practice asceticism like them, because this would lead to the abandonment of civilization and to the end of the human race, and the verse already said: <i>\"He did not create it to be a deserted but formed it to be inhabited\"</i> (Yeshaya 45:18).",
                    "Abstinence is one of the cornerstones of the world, and the need of human beings for it is just like their need for other sciences and trades in which some nations excel over others, for the benefit of all of mankind. Each class takes from the world according to its needs and what is suitable for it. It would not further the welfare of the world if everyone devoted themselves to only one field and no others, because the general welfare of the world is furthered by the cultivation of all fields, as the wise man said: <i>\"also He has set the world in their heart\"</i> (Koheles 3:11), and <i>\"everything has a time and place...\"</i> (ibid 3:1).",
                    "We have explained, with this introduction the concept of general abstinence and the need of human beings for it. So that they may order their affairs in this world through it."

                    "The torah's aim is to make the understanding rule over and prevail over all the lusts of the [lower] soul.",
                    "It is well known that the overpowering of lust over the understanding is the beginning of all sin, and the cause of all that is reprehensible. The people did not incline towards (the lusts of) this world until they had turned away from the torah. Then the evil inclination enticed them to abandon cultivating the world of their salvation. And thus, they turned away from the path of their forefathers who limited themselves to what was necessary and in the amount that was necessary, and who were contented with what was sufficient for their livelihood.",
                    "The inclination enticed them by making hoarding and increasing worldly possessions seem beautiful, by making indulgence in worldly pleasures seem desirable, and by inducing pride in owning worldly possessions, until they sank in the depths of its seas.",
                    "The evil inclination then forced them to suffer the pain of [being tossed by] its waves. This world rules over them and stops up their ears and shuts their eyes. There is not one of them who does not occupy himself with indulging in its pleasures whenever he can reach it and an opportunity presents itself. This is his torah and his religion, until he is led completely astray from his G-d, as written: <i>\"Your own wickedness shall correct you, and your backsliding shall reprove you... [know that it is evil and bitter that you have forsaken the L-ord your G-d]\"</i> (Yirmiya 2:19).",
                    "Included in this class of people, is also one who has been denied that pleasure, but his mind is set on it, his soul longs for it and lives for it, and he heartily pursues it night and day, as written: <i>\"He devises mischief upon his bed; he sets himself in a way that is not good\"</i> (Tehilim 36:5).",
                    "Both these classes are drowning, each in his matter, and yet they are cut off and weary from ever reaching any good out of it. They are losing in their business trade. Their soul is diminished, and their choice is bad.",

They exert themselves and take pride in their business trade, in which they are losing, and which never ceases to distract their minds from the resulting vanities, and to entrench in their hearts its never-ending desires. The more they become embroiled in this world, the more they distanced themselves; and the further they distanced from the light of truth from which they parted due to their association with the evil inclination, and the more the darkness engulfed them, and the world grew on them.<br>The striving for its improvement became embellished in their eyes, and they ingrained themselves in it to the destruction of their understanding. The more this world was improved, the greater was the destruction of their understanding, until they considered its evil ways to be good, and its straying to be right, and they turned this into a statute and a moral outlook.",
                    "Parents then bequeathed this outlook to their children, their teachers aroused them in it. The masses were commanded to follow it. Their nobles vied with each other on it, until the evil inclination became firmly entrenched in them and they filled their homes with vanities. What had been strange to them became familiar to them, while the right way became strange to them. Whoever was contented and refrained from pursuing the superfluous, they considered him to be neglecting his duties.",

One who delayed to accumulate of it was considered a slacker. One who was contented with only what he needed was considered a weakling, while he who surpassed this amount was regarded as an industrious man.",

With the help of abstinence, we should hold firmly against the evil inclination until reaching the proper torah way for religious and secular pursuits.",

Thus these special people are the doctors of souls to the religion.<br>They bring healing to those who stray from the good traits and tended towards the disgraceful traits.

If one who magnifies G-d's omnipotence, they magnify him. If he sins, they will exhort him to repent immediately. If he is physically sick, they will visit him and if they have more than they need of the world, they will bestow to him of it. If some trouble befalls him, they will come to his assistance.",

They left civilization to dwell in the deserts, the wastelands, and the high mountains, places where there is no companionship and no acquaintance. They eat whatever can be found, vegetation growing on the soil and leaves of the trees. They dress in worn garments and raw wool. They take shelter in the rocks.

                    "This class is the furthest extreme of all the classes from the middle way prescribed by the torah. For they renounce worldly interests completely and the torah does not bid us to give up social life entirely, as we have introduced earlier from the verse <i>\"He did not create it to be a waste but formed it to be inhabited\"</i> (Yeshaya 45:18).",
                    "2) The second class, men who went in the middle way of abstinence. They are completely repulsed with the superfluous things of this world, and undertake to bridle their lust in them.",

                    "This second class has renounced all things that are \"superfluous\", but did not deem it fit to withdraw from society. They stayed to provide their bodies with its minimum need, as is their duty. They exchanged the deserts and mountains with confinement in their homes and solitude in their dwelling. They attained both matters and reached both portions. They are closer to the middle way of the torah, than the previous class.",
                    "3) The third class consists of those who walk on the lowest level of abstinence. These separated themselves from the world in their hearts and minds. But they associate outwardly with other people in the rectification of the world, such as plowing and sowing. They also actively toil with their bodies in the service of G-d. They realize that a man is being tested in this world, and that he is like a prisoner and a stranger in it, taken from the world of spirits and brought here.",

They then claim that abstinence has pushed them to live like this.",

Of such people, the wise man said: <i>\"a man whom G-d has given riches and property and honor, and his soul lacks nothing of all he desires; [yet G-d gives him not power to eat of it, but a stranger eats it: this is vanity, and it is an evil affliction]\"</i> (Koheles 6:2).",

They deemed proper to maintain their self-respect and subsist with whatever food they can obtain rather than having to stand to ask and embarrass themselves to beg from other people. They restrained their desires by bearing constant hunger and by covering themselves with basic clothing. They do this in order to avoid receiving charity and to not be ashamed of asking help from others, thereby becoming disgraced. But, they claim to be doing all of this out of asceticism.",

Because it moves easily and swiftly, it easily completes its deed, and has the power to do good or evil without any intermediary.",

Do not unleash it to speak words except for what is indispensable for your torah needs and your worldly needs. Diminish extra words of your tongue as much as you can, perhaps you will be saved from its damage, as the wise man said: <i>\"Life and death are in the power of the tongue\"</i> (Mishlei 18:21).",
                    "They (the Sages) began exhorting on the tongue before the other senses and limbs, because it is more difficult to control than all of them as David said: <i>\"Who is the man who desires life... guard your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking deceit [depart from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it]\"</i> (Tehilim 34:13). In our holy books, the exhortations to minimize speech are so numerous and well known that it is not unfamiliar to anyone.",

If you can write it all, do so. Afterwards, at night, when you are free from your matters, go over it and reflect on it. See which of them were necessary and which of them were superfluous and without benefit; and which of them were harmful to you, such as falsehood, tale bearing, swearing, lashon hara (negative speech about others). Then you will recognize your faults and you will see your iniquity.",

If the tongue is unbridled and does not keep careful guard over what is in the inner being, then the gate to the treasury will be open, and things will go out which you do not wish them to go out, and things will become visible which you do not wish them to be visible. But if you guard the gate, you guard the treasury and what is in it, as the wise man said: <i>\"even a fool who keeps silent is considered wise\"</i> (Mishlei 17:28). He also said: <i>\"do not be quick with your mouth, do not be hasty in your heart to utter anything before G-d\"</i> (Koheles 5:1), and: <i>\"permit not your mouth to cause your flesh to sin\"</i> (Koheles 5:5).",

Separate yourself as much as you can from superfluous sights, just like you separate from looking at things which are forbidden to look at. The Creator has already exhorted on this in saying <i>\"you shall not wander after your hearts and after your eyes\"</i> (Bamidbar 15:39), and our Sages said: \"the heart and the eyes are the two agents of sin (the eye sees, then the heart desires...) \" (Talmud Yerushalmi Berachos 81). Rather use your eyes to gaze at the works of the Creator, to examine them, to contemplate them, and to understand the omnipotence of the Creator, and His wisdom and benevolence from them, as David said: <i>\"When I consider your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and the stars, which You have ordained\"</i> (Tehilim 8:4), and <i>\"The heavens declare the glory of G-d; and the firmament proclaims His handiwork\"</i> (Tehilim 19:2).",

Do not lend ear to listen to what will not be beneficial to hear such as superfluous words, lies, tale bearing, slander. Separate from hearing what will lead you to rebel against G-d or neglect His commandments such as the various types of songs and melodies, comedy and merrymaking, which distract you from fulfilling the commandments and performing good deeds. Rather, lend your ears to the words of the Sages who know G-d and His torah, as the wise man said: <i>\"Incline your ear, and hear the words of the wise\"</i> (Mishlei 22:17), and <i>\"The ear that hearkens to the reproof of life, abides among the wise\"</i> (Mishlei 15:31).",

It also says: <i>\"that shakes his hands from holding bribes\"</i> (Yeshaya 33:15). Rather, use your hands for fulfilling the commandments of G-d, open them to give to the poor and needy, as written: <i>\"you shall surely open your hand unto your brother, to your poor, and to your needy, in your land\"</i> (Devarim 15:11), and it says: <i>\"she stretches out her hand to the poor; she reaches forth her hands to the needy\"</i> (Mishlei 31:20).",

Likewise, so that you won't be a burden on people, as one of the Sages said: \"G-d will have [great] mercy on His servants who separate from this world, but only if his separation has not become a burden on his friends, because he engaged in a trade thereby freeing them from troubling themselves for him\", as written: <i>\"For you shall eat the labor of your hands: happy shall you be, and it shall be well with you\"</i> (Tehilim 128:2). It has already been said: \"the beginning of abstinence is the securing of a livelihood\".

Rather, hasten to do all good deeds, and to the gatherings of the wise, as written: <i>\"He who goes with the wise will become wise [but he who befriends the fools will be broken]\"</i> (Mishlei 13:20), and it says: <i>\"in order that you go in the way of the good...\"</i> (Mishlei 2:20).",

He that walks righteously, and speaks uprightly; [he that despises the gain of oppression, that keeps his hands from the holding of bribes, that stops his ears from hearing of blood, and shuts his eyes from seeing evil]\"</i>(Yeshaya 33:14).<br>And afterwards, the wise man gathered them and added to them the heart in saying: <i>\"There are six things that the L-ord hates, and the seventh is an abomination of His soul; Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood; A heart that thinks wicked thoughts; feet that hasten to run to evil; A false witness who incites quarrels among brothers\"</i> (Mishlei 6:16), and likewise they are found in the Psalm 15: <i>\"O G-d, who will dwell in Your tent?...\"</i>",

For the early ones such as Chanoch, Noach, Avraham, Yitzchak, Yaakov, Iyov and his company, their intellect was pure and their evil inclination was weak. So their souls were drawn after their intellect. The few mitzvot they had combined with their heartfelt faith in G-d were sufficient for them to complete their service of G-d, as written by Avraham <i>\"You found his heart faithful before You\"</i> (Nehemiah 9:8). They did not need the abstinence which goes out of the middle way which the torah prescribes.",
                    "But when their descendants descended to Egypt, and dwelled there 70 years in peace during Yosef's lifetime, their lust became strong, their desires grew, and their evil inclination overpowered their reason. They then needed, an abstinence, which would be counter to their lusts, and which would allow them to resist their evil inclination. The Creator added on them additional commandments, which reason does not obligate. This would serve as a substitute for the abstinence which was proper for them, according to their ability, and even less than that.",
                    "When they conquered the land of Israel and settled it, and enjoyed its good, they started to seek superfluities in food and drink, indulgence with women, and in erecting buildings. The more the land was developed, the more their intellect deteriorated, as written: <i>\"Lest when you have eaten and are full, and have built goodly houses, and dwelled therein...[then your heart be lifted up, and you forget G-d..]\"</i> (Devarim 8:12).

                    "In later generations, the intellect has become weaker still while the lusts have strengthened more.

            "Introduction": [
                "Since our previous discussion in the ninth gate dealt with clarifying the subject of separating from this world, and our intent in it was to unify the heart and free it for love of the Creator, and for yearning to do His will, I saw proper to follow with a clarification of the ways of love of G-d, because it is the purpose of all the steps, and the final stage in the levels of the men who serve G-d. I will begin, and I seek from G-d to help me.",
                "It is proper for you, my brother, that you understand and that you know, that everything we previously mentioned of the duties of the heart and limbs, and the volunteering of the soul, they are all rungs and steps leading to this sublime matter, which is our intent to clarify in this gate. It is also proper for you to know that every duty and every good quality, whether it comes through reason, scripture, or tradition, are all steps and stages by which one ascends to this matter, and it is their ultimate purpose and destination. There is no level above it or after it.",
                "Therefore, because of this, the prophet (Moshe), peace be upon him, placed it immediately after the unity of G-d, in saying: <i>\"Hear, O Israel: The L-ord is our G-d; the L-ord is one; And you shall love the L-ord, your G-d...\"</i> (Devarim 6:4), and he exhorted on it, and returned to it many times, as written: <i>\"To love the L-ord your G-d, to hearken to His voice, and to cleave to Him\"</i> (Devarim 30:20). The meaning of cleaving is: faithful love, and wholehearted devotion, as written: <i>\"there is a friend who cleaves closer than a brother\"</i>(Mishlei 18:24).",
                "Frequently the torah places fear of G-d before love of Him, as written <i>\"And now, Israel, what does the L-ord your G-d require of you, but to fear the L-ord your G-d, to walk in all His ways, and to love Him\"</i> (Devarim 10:12), and it says: <i>\"You shall fear the L-ord your G-d; and to Him shall you cling\"</i> (Devarim 10:20). It is correct to place fear of G-d before love of G-d because [fear of G-d] is the final purpose and furthest end of abstinence, which in turn is the nearest level approaching the lowest level of love of G-d, and the first gate of its gates, and it is impossible for a man to reach it without preceding fear and fright of G-d.",
                "And therefore, we have preceded the gate of abstinence, because it is impossible to establish love of G-d in our hearts if the love of this world is established there. But when the heart of the believer is empty from the love of this world and free of its lusts, out of recognition and understanding - the love of the Creator will establish in his heart, and it will be set in his soul according to his yearning to Him, and his recognition of Him, as written: <i>\"In the way of Your judgments, O L-ord, have we waited for You [the desire of our soul is to Your Name, and to the remembrance of You]\"</i> (Yeshaya 26:8).",

                    "What is love of G-d? It is the longing of the soul - and its turning, on its own, to the Creator, so that it can cleave to His supernal light. For the soul is of an essence which is pure and spiritual, it tends towards spiritual things similar to itself. By nature, it removes itself from what is opposite to its nature, namely the coarse physical bodies.",
                    "When the Creator, blessed be He, bound the soul to this coarse physical body in order to test it, how it would guide the body. G-d aroused the soul to care for the body, and further its welfare, through the partnership and companionship which was naturally ingrained between them from the beginning of the development (of the body).",
                    "When the soul senses something which will benefit the body or further its welfare, she will turn in her thoughts to that thing and desire it, in order to secure for herself peace from the pains of the body and the external things (worries, drives) which pain the body, similar to the desiring of a sick man for an expert doctor who appoints a helper to (the doctor) so that the doctor can focus on him.",
                    "But when the soul senses, that there are matters which will increase light in her own essence and power in herself. The soul will then tend instead towards G-d, and will cling to Him in its thoughts, and in its imagination will ponder instead how to come closer to Him, and will desire to Him and long to Him. This is the highest level of pure love (of G-d).",
                    "But since the matter is so (that the soul also worries for the needs of the body), and the callings of the body are numerous, and its callings for that which will fill its lackings are constant, at all times, and all periods, and the soul is not able to pause from thinking on all of this, because she has no tranquility and no rest without having peace from the ailings of her body (which always has a demand, lust, or worry) - therefore the soul became constantly distracted with the matters of the body from the things she loves which are fitting for her, and resemble her essence, through which are found her success in the abode of her tranquility (in the afterlife).",
                    "But when the light of the understanding penetrates to the soul, and it will reveal to her the disgrace of having turned to the body in love, and having been drawn after it in her thoughts, along with ignoring what will bring her salvation in both worlds - she will desist from this, and leave all of its worldly interests to the gracious Creator, and will turn in her thoughts to seek ways of her salvation from the great trap she is ensnared in, and by which she had been so greatly tempted. Then she will separate from the secular world and all of its pleasures, and will despise the body and its lusts.",
                    "Not so long after this, the soul's eyes will open, and her vision will clarify from the cloud of ignorance of G-d and His torah, and she will discern the truth from the false, and the truth of its Creator and Guide will be revealed to her.",
                    "When the soul understands His omnipotence, and His infinite greatness, it will kneel down and prostrate before Him, in fear, fright, and awe of His power and greatness, and she will not leave this state until the Creator will reassure her, and quiet her fright and awe - then it will drink from the cup of love of G-d, and will enjoy the bliss of being alone with G-d, devoting herself wholeheartedly to Him, loving Him, putting her trust in Him, and yearning for Him. She will have no other occupation than the occupation of His service, and no musings other than of Him and no thought other than of Him. She will not move any of her limbs except to do something which will gain His favor. She will not unbind her tongue except to recall Him, praise Him, thank Him, and laud Him out of love for Him and out of longing to do His will. If He bestows a benefit on her, she will thank Him. If He brings suffering on her, she will patiently bear it, and will only increase her love for Him and trust in Him, as said about one of the pious who would rise in the middle of the night and say: <i>\"My G-d, You have starved me, left me without clothing, and set me in the darkness of night, and I swear by Your might and greatness that if You burn me in fire, I will only increase in love of You and joy in You.

                    "His intent in saying <i>\"And you shall love the L-ord, your G-d, with all your heart and with all your soul, and with all your might\"</i>, is to correspond to the different types of people, with their different mindsets with respect to their giving of themselves versus not giving of themselves of their bodies, money, and honor. Because some of them are prepared to give of themselves their body and money, but not of their honor, which they withhold. Others, are prepared to give of themselves their money and honor, but not their body. Others, still are prepared to give their body and honor, but not their money, as our sages said: \"If it says 'with all your soul', why should it also say, 'with all your might (means)' and if it says 'with all your might', why should it also say 'with all your soul'?

One who volunteers towards doing the will of the one he loves with his money, body, and life, as the wise man said: <i>\"Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it\"</i> (Shir HaShirim 8:7), and it is written about Yehonatan and David: <i>\"for he loved him as he loved his own soul\"</i> (Shmuel 20:17), and <i>\"wonderful was your love to me, passing the love of women\"</i> (Shmuel II 1:26).",
                    "Therefore, the prophet exhorted us in the love of the Creator, that it should include one's life, body, and money, that a man should volunteer all of these out of love of the Creator, and not be sparing in any of them in the fulfillment of the Creator's will. So our Sages said: <i>\"'with all your hearts' means with your two inclinations, the good inclination and [resisting] the evil inclination. 'With all your soul' means even if we have to give up our life. 'With all your means', means with all your money\"</i> (Talmud Berachot 54a). They also said: \"Do His will as if it were your will that He may do your will as if it was His will. Nullify your will before His will that He may nullify the will of others before your will\" (Avos 2:4).",

But put forth Your hand now, [and touch all that he has, surely he will blaspheme You to Your face]\"</i> (Iyov 1:9), which he meant: \"he is like a merchant doing business with You, since with his love and fear of You, his price from you in return is honor and wealth of the world. But if You take away from him what You have bestowed on him and he remains in his piety with You - then he is faithful in genuine love of You\". The Creator answered the Satan: <i>\"behold, everything of his is in your hands...\"</i> (Iyov 1:12). And then Satan did what you know from the text with his money and his children, and Iyov did not change, neither inwardly or outwardly towards G-d. He maintained his faithful love to G-d, as he said: <i>\"Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return [to the grave]: the L-ord gave, and the L-ord has taken away; blessed be the name of the L-ord\"</i> (Iyov 1:21).",
                    "Then the Creator said to Satan: <i>\"Have you considered my servant Iyov, that there is none like him on earth, a wholehearted and upright man, that fears G-d, and shuns evil? And he still holds fast his integrity, though you moved Me against him, to destroy him without cause\"</i>\" (Iyov 2:3). And Satan answered: <i>\"Skin for skin, yes, all that a man has will he give for his life; But put forth Your hand, and strike his flesh and bones, and he will curse You to Your face\"</i> (Iyov 2:4). What Satan meant was: \"many people will give up their money, their wives and their children, in order to keep their own bodies unharmed. But the genuineness of Iyov's love for You can only be demonstrated when he is tried and tested in his own body and flesh, through pains inflicted on him, and which he will resent\".",

What? shall we receive good at the hand of G-d, and shall we not receive the bad?\"</i> (Iyov 2:10).",

And the Creator will praise their choice of His service, even if they are prevented from fulfilling the acts, as He said to David <i>\"Since it was in your heart to build a house unto My name, you did well that it was in your heart\"</i> (Melachim 8:18).",
                    "In their hearts and minds, they abandoned matters of this world, and care of their body's welfare, except for what is necessary and urgent, due to its pettiness by them, and insignificance in their eyes. They concentrate their hearts and souls to their religious matters and to the service of G-d, due to His glory and exaltedness. Their bodies are on earth but their hearts are in the heavens. Due to the knowledge of the greatness of G-d in their hearts, they serve Him as if they were with the holy angels in the highest heavens.",
                    "The [physical] lusts have melted away from their hearts, and the desire for pleasures has been uprooted from them, due to being replaced with the yearning for the Creator's service and their love of Him.",
                    "The fire of the evil inclination has extinguished from their hearts, and its heat is gone from their thoughts due to the magnitude of the light of divine service which has engulfed them, similar to a candle in the presence of the light of the sun. They are humbled by awe of their G-d. They confess their shortcomings before Him. They bore their shoulders to His service, not caring about any losses",
                    "When coming in contact with them, they seem shy, but when one speaks with them, their wisdom will appear. When one asks them something, they seem knowledgeable. When they are sinned against, their humility will appear.",
                    "When you look at them, their faces appear radiant, and if you could peer in their hearts, you will see a broken heart to G-d. In His word they are resident, but in worldly matters they are desolate.",
                    "Love of G-d has filled their hearts. They have no desire for joining the conversations of men, nor do they derive any pleasure therein. They are disgusted by corrupt ways, and chose the choicest paths,",
                    "In their merits, sufferings go away, and the rains fall. In their merits man kisses the ground (the earth produces food and men are happy), since they refrained themselves from lewdness, retracted their hands from all treats, and their souls have fled from forbidden things, and because they went in the good and righteous path. They reached exalted levels for bearing a short time (the few dozen years allotted to man in this world), profited in both worlds, combined both goods, and achieved two distinctions, as written in the psalm: <i>\"Praiseworthy is the man who fears G-d...\"</i> (Tehilim 112), until the end.",
                    "What is wondrous in their matters, is that the commandments which the Creator has commanded them in seem few in their eyes compared to their duties to repay Him for the good He bestows on them, and compared to the exertion, devotion, bearing, and patience which they took on themselves in order to cling to the Creator, as I will now explain.",
                    "According to how the sages counted the commandments of the Creator, the total number was found to be 613. Of these, 365 are negative commandments, to not do, 65 of them are commandments for the congregation but not for the individual. Further, some of them are positive commandments whose fulfillment depends on time, namely, they apply at certain times but not at others, such as the Sabbaths, festivals, fast days. There are also commandments which apply only in the land (of Israel) such as the offerings which an individual is obligated in, the teruma, maaser (tithes), and the offerings of the festivals, or the like. Some commandments depend on other things, and are only obligatory when the things are found, but if they are absent one is exempt from them, such as the mitzva of Brit Mila (circumcision) for one who does not have a son, or pidyon haben (redeeming first born male) for one who has no first born male, and the mitzva of making a roof-fence for one who does not own a house, or honoring father and mother for an orphan, and others like this.",
                    "When they counted the commandments, they said: \"we will not count in the negative commandments because merely refraining from them is their performance and the fulfillment of their obligation. Such service of G-d seemed too insignificant in their eyes, and their service seemed little to them due to their desire and longing for reaching the favor of G-d. Therefore they sought positive commandments of the limbs for individuals which apply at all times, places, and circumstances. They did not find any precepts that fits this except reading the torah and studying the commandments, as the verse says: <i>\"These words, which I command you this day, shall be in your heart; And you shall teach them diligently unto your children, and speak of them..\"</i> (Devarim 6:6). And the prophet (Moshe) exhorted on this a second time in saying: <i>\"You shall teach them to your sons, speaking of them, when you sit in your house and when you walk on the way and when you lie down and when you rise up\"</i> (Devarim 11:19).",
                    "And all of this seemed too small in their eyes due to what they perceived of their duties of service and deeds to the Creator. So, they served the Creator with rational precepts (not prescribed in scripture - RMH), special disciplines, and good spiritual customs. In their pure hearts to G-d, they appended to the known commandments and they learned from the ways of the prophets and the regiments of the pious ones, how to seek the favor of G-d by them, and obtain His acceptance of them - these belong to the duties of the heart, which was our intent to clarify their fundamental principles and to speak of their divisions in this book. This is the wisdom hidden in the hearts of the wise and concealed in their interior. If they speak of them, everyone will see that they are correct in them, because all intelligent men can testify that these things are true and just.",
                    "By it they reached the lofty heights and the precious levels in the wholehearted service of G-d, in love of Him with a faithful love, with their heart and soul, body and means, as the prophet, peace be unto him, exhorted in saying: <i>\"And you shall love the L-ord your G-d with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might\"</i> (Devarim 6:5). Men of these levels are nearer than all other men to the level of the prophets, the pure ones, and the pious one, which scripture has termed them: <i>\"those who love G-d\"</i>, and <i>\"those who love His Name\"</i>, and on them it is said: <i>\"That I may cause those that love Me to inherit substance\"</i> (Mishlei 8:21).",
                    "And if, my brother, you desire to be one of them, and to be included in their class - abandon the superfluous things of this world and avoid them. Be contented with taking only your [necessary] food from them. Train yourself to do without the superfluities. Lighten the burden of the affairs of this world from yourself, and free your mind from thinking deeply in them. Hasten to do the things necessary for you with your body only, but not with your heart and will, just like one who drinks a bitter medicine, who drinks it with his mouth, not with his desire, and he abhors the drinking itself, but he allows himself to bear its bitterness in order to cure himself from the illness. Likewise, should be the worldly needs in your eyes.",
                    "You know, my brother, that your mental exertions about your secular matters will not add anything to your livelihood in the least [because this is pre-determined by G-d]. So too, minimal exertion and zeal in them will not decrease your allotted portion in the least. Your mental distraction in them will prevent you from thinking in what will benefit you in your torah matters and in the Creator's commandments, which are in your hands, and that you undertook to toil in them all the days of your life. Thus you will wind up losing in this (religious) without gaining from the other (secular).",
                    "Therefore desire for yourself that which furthers your salvation and peace in your religious and secular life. Apply your mind to stand with all your strength to [perpetuate] the wellspring of your way of life.",
                    "Precede zeal before yourself for matters of your end (the hereafter). Appoint understanding as your king, humility as your deputy, wisdom as your guide, and abstinence as your close friend. Proceed slowly and thoughtfully in acquiring the good traits, according to how your matters allow you to bear. Beware of taking on too much, or too quickly, without moving gradually, lest you become lost, because too much oil in a candle is a cause to extinguish its light.",
                    "Beware of becoming neglectful, lazy or lax. Let one level of zeal follow with another level of zeal, and one level of endurance with another level of endurance. Strive to follow each level of good traits, with the next higher level which is near it. Do not neglect checking your heart and making a spiritual accounting always. Engage in the in-depth study of this book, read it, review its matters, and memorize its roots. Investigate its deductions always. You will reach through it to the pinnacle of exalted and treasured qualities, and the utmost of the noble traits that are pleasing to G-d. Straighten yourself with it and then straighten others with it.",
                    "Do not hope that you will reach this without having freed your mind of the worries and distractions of this world, even if you abhor them, just like it is not possible for a drunkard to heal himself from his craving for wine until he is completely free from it. One of the pious would say: \"if we were truly ashamed of the Creator['s presence], we would not be speaking of love of the Creator, so long as we are drunk from the wine of love of this world\".",
                    "Therefore, endeavor, my brother, let your mind be free of this world when your body is free of its affairs. Because when your body is in solitude, your soul should also be in solitude. For it is still possible for the mind to be absorbed in worldly affairs even when the body is free from them and is at rest from engaging in them.",
                    "Check yourself in this always, my brother, and strive to keep the lusts of this world far from your heart. Replace them with matters of your end and duties of your heart. Ponder them in your thoughts always, you will attain through them that the Creator will be pleased with you. His face will shine upon you, and He will accept your good deeds, forgive your sins, and you will find favor in His eyes, as written: <i>\"I love them that love Me; And those that seek Me diligently shall find Me\"</i> (Mishlei 8:17), and <i>\"those who honor Me shall I honor, and those who despise Me will be disgraced\"</i> (Shmuel 2:30).",
                    "I saw proper for the completion of your benefit and instruction, my brother, that I summarize the main topics of the matters of this book into ten hebrew stanzas, where each one contains a summary of each of the gates, and according to the order of the book. I conclude my book with them in order that they serve you as a reminder, so that you can memorize them and set them in your heart and mind, day and night, when you rest or are active, so that you will not cease to investigate the matters of this book and remember its fundamental principles.",
                    "When you are involved in an act of service, these phrases will remind you to devote your heart wholly to G-d in it. If you are involved in a secular work, they will remind you of your spiritual accounting. If you are in some trouble in a worldly matter, they will remind you of trusting in G-d. If it will be in a situation which brings to arrogance and haughtiness, they will remind you of submission. If your heart is free, they will remind you to reflect on the favors of G-d on you. If you are in a situation of physical joy or pleasure, they will remind you to abstain from the pleasures of this world. If you are involved in some matter where you are rebelling against G-d, they will remind you on repentance. If you are neglecting your torah and faith, they will remind you to cling to the service of G-d. If you are engaged in declaring G-d's Unity, they will remind you that your declaration should be wholehearted.",
                    "And likewise they will remind you during your recital of prayers, musings of your heart, bridling your tongue, binding of your senses, ruling over your lusts, restraining your limbs, checking your thoughts, weighing your deeds against your knowledge, and the rest of what I have discussed in this book of good conduct, and higher ethics.",
