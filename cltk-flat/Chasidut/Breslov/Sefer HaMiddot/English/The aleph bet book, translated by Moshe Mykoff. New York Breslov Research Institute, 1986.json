Understand this! For a wonderful and very pleasing explanation of this, see <i>Likutey Halakhot, Yoreh Deah, Milah</i> 5:23ff. The truth is that one who looks with a positive and true eye and with an upright heart will find no difficulty in comprehending this. One the contrary, he will see the wonders of God’s greatness and that of the true Tzaddikim. These opponents, who arrogantly speak against the Tzaddik and from the very outset view the Tzaddik’s holy writings with an eye to finding fault, will never find a satisfying explanation. Even after all these explanations and truths, they continue to look for pretexts and devise false charges with which to haughtily speak against the Tzaddik and his disciples, may their merit protect us. Nevertheless, I could not hold myself back from presenting a bit of what I heard regarding this. For truth stands! ‘But a lying tongue is for a moment’ (Proverbs 12:19), ‘and the truth of God is forever’ (Psalms 117:2). He will save us from the double-edged sword; and, as His mercy has supported until now, so will it support us evermore. Amen!

However, sometimes, the demons attach themselves to the other members of the household, causing them to suffer as a result of their quarreling and contentiousness. This is explicitly found in the verse, “Their homes are peaceful, without fear...” (Job 21:9), about which the Sages teach: “without fear”—these are the demons. And this is “peaceful, without fear,” because peace and fear are opposites; fear being the demons that destroy peace.
