        "125_Daf, 9_Line": "And Rabbi Yehudah further interpreted in honor of Torah and explained  (Deuteronomy 27:9): “Pay attention and listen, Israel, this day, you have become a people.”  Was it on this day that Torah was given to Israel?  Was it not on that day that was at the end of the forty years [of wandering? This seems to be a contradiction! How can Israel be made a people twice?]  Rather, this comes to teach you  that Torah is beloved for those who learn it every day. And [therefore] every day is like it was given on Mt. Sinai."
