He leads me in straight paths [(protecting me from my foes)], for His name's sake.Though I walk in the vale of darkness [(the desert of Ziph [viz. I Samuel 23:15])], I will fear no evil, for You are with me. Your rod [of afflictions] and your staff [of succor] — they comfort me [(both tending to forgiveness of sin)]. [Thus, I trust that] You shall set before me a table [(of kingdom)] in the face of my enemies. You have [already] anointed my head with the oil [of kingship]; my cup runs over [with good]. Only good and lovingkindness shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the L rd forever.",
