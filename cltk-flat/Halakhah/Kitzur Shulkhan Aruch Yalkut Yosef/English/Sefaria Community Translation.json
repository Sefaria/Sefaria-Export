And everybody who is able to wake up in the middle of the night, he should do it and say \"Tikkun Hasot\". And also, if you remain awake until the middle of the night, try not to sleep until you say Tikkun Hasot, to join with the pain of the Shekhinah in exile. However, when you pray and learn Torah you should be happy. And in any case, if you cry during the prayer, you prayer is accepted more.",

And anyone who completes his [weekly] Torah portion [study] with the congregation [is blessed with] lengthy days and years. And also, one who is engrossed in the study of Torah the entire day, and his Torah study is his profession, may not withdraw from reading the weekly Torah portion with the congregation.

Rather, he should put forth his claims with truth and simplicity before an established Rabbi, asking him to rule whether or not he is obligated to return money to his fellow. And even if his fellow is not bringing him to court, he is still obligated to fulfill his obligation towards heaven by asking a Torah scholar who is an expert decision-maker, as it is written (Mishna Avot Ch.1) \"Make for yourself a Rabbi and avoid doubt\". And even if his fellow does not know of the theft that was taken from him, one still has to return what was stolen and appease him. [Yalkut Yosef Moadim pg. 78.
