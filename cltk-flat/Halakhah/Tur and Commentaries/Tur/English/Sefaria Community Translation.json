        "2_Even HaEzer, 0_Siman, 0_Seif": "Blessed be the name of the Holy One, blessed is He, who desired goodness for his creations. For He knew that it is not good for man to be alone and therefore He made a fitting helper for him, for the intent of the creation of man is to be fertile and to increase, and this is impossible without a helper. Therefore He commanded him to cling to the helper whom He made for him. Thus every man is obligated to marry a woman in order to be fertile and increase, for anyone who is not involved in reproduction is like one who sheds blood, as it is written, \"Whoever sheds the blood of man,\" and juxtaposed to it , \"Be fertile, then, and increase.\" And it is as though he is diminishing the [Divine] image, for it is written that in the image of God did He create him, and you shall be fertile and increase. And he causes the Divine Presence to be removed from Israel. And anyone who remains without a wife remains without goodness, without blessing, without a dwelling, without Torah, without a wall, without peace. Rabbi Elazar said, \"Anyone who does not have a wife is not a man.\" When he marries, his sins are buried, as it is said, \"He who finds a wife has found happiness And has won the favor of the LORD.\" It is an extremely great commandment, for we only sell a Torah scroll in order to be able to learn Torah and to marry a woman. A man is commanded to marry a woman when he is eighteen years old, as it is taught, \"eighteen years for the [wedding] canopy,\" but one who does so earlier at the age of thirteen, this is a choice [fulfillment of the] command. Our Rabbis have taught, one who marries off his sons and daughters close to their period of puberty, regarding him Scripture states, \"You will know that all is well in your tent, etc.\" Abaye said, I am better than my colleagues because I married at the age of sixteen, but had I married at fourteen, it would have been an arrow in the eyes of Satan. But one must not marry them before thirteen, for this is like lewdness. Under no circumstance should one pass twenty years without a wife, as Raba said, and the school of Rabbi Ishmael taught, until the age of twenty the Holy One, blessed is He, waits for a man to marry. When he passes twenty years without marrying, the Holy One, blessed is He, says, \"His bones shall swell.\" My father wrote of a single man who has passed twenty years and does not want to marry, that the court forces him to marry so that he may fulfill the commandment of reproduction. However, one for whom it will be impossible to study should he marry is not obligated to marry by twenty. The words of the Rambam: If he is busy with Torah and is occupied by it, and is afraid to marry because the burden of providing sustenance will distract him from Torah, he may delay, as one who is involved in a mitzvah is exempt from another mitzvah, and all the more so in the study of Torah. One whose soul has constantly desired Torah, such as Ben Azai, and he clung to it all his days and did not marry, he has not sinned as long as his desire does not overcome him. My father the Rosh says this refers to when it would be impossible for him to study [after marrying]--then he should study and afterward marry. I do not know the extent of this study, but it cannot be that one could abstain from reproduction all his days, for we have not seen such a thing other than Ben Azai, whose soul desired Torah. Therefore, because man consists of male and female, there is a commandment of reproduction. Should the son be a eunuch or the daughter an <i>aylonit</i>, he has not fulfilled the command of reproduction. If he had sons and they died, he has not fulfilled the command of reproduction. However if they died and left behind children, since the son had a son or daughter or the daughter had a son or daughter, reproduction has been fulfilled. But if one of them died without children and the second has a son or daughter, he has not fulfilled it. If he had sons through his Cuthean wives and he and they converted, he has fulfilled reproduction. But a slave who had sons, and he and they were freed, has not fulfilled reproduction. And even one who has fulfilled his obligation of reproduction is forbidden from remaining without a wife, as Rabbi Nachman said: Even if a man has several children, he is forbidden from remaining without a wife, as it is said, \"It is not good for man to be alone.\" Rabbi Yehoshua said: If he married in his youth, he shall marry in his old age. If he had children in his youth, he shall have children in his old age. As it is said, \"Sow your seed in the morning, and don't hold back your hand in the evening.\" There is no difference between one who has children and one who does not except with regard to the matter of selling a Torah scroll:", 
        "1_Yoreh Deah, 104_Siman, 0_Seif": "All halachos that apply to cooking issur with heter also apply if one soaks one in the other for one complete day -- 24 hours -- because soaking is considered like cooking. But if one soaks for less than one day: if they are cold, one only needs to wash off the item; if they are scalding hot then they are assur by cooking. ", 
        "2_Even HaEzer, 3_Siman, 0_Seif": "These [people] it is not appropriate to marry [them] either because of a disqualification in their lineage or because of something physical or because of [something] illicit. A male Israelite is forbidden to marry a Mamzer, or a Netin who is from the Gibeonites that Joshua decreed against marrying them. There is a prohibition against marrying an Ammonite, Moabite and, Egyptian. [Marrying a] Mamzer or Netin, is an eternal prohibition for all generations and it makes no difference whether they're male or female. Male Ammonites and Moabites are eternally prohibited but the females are immediately permitted. Egyptians and Edomites, males and females, are prohibited for the first two generations, after an [Egyptian father] converts, he and his son are prohibited but the [Egyptian father's] grandson is permitted. A pregnant Egyptian woman who converts, her son is a second generation Egyptian. A male Israelite who copulates with one of these [mentioned above], the child is like her [ s/he has the mother's lineage], however one of those [mentioned above], except for a Mamzer, who copulates with an Israelite woman, the child may marry in to the community although it is disqualified for the priestly lineage. If a female of one of these [mentioned above] converted and married an Israelite or a male of one these [mentioned above] converted an Israelite woman, the child take the lineage of the [more] disqualified one therefore a converted second generation Ammonite or Egyptian convert who married an Israelite woman their daughter is accepted for no matter which one of them [i.e. her parents] we follow she is acceptable even for [marriage into] the priesthood even though her copulation was a transgression. A second-generation male Egyptian who marries a first-generation Egyptian woman, his son is a second-generation [Egyptian]; a first-generation Egyptian man who marries a second-generation Egyptian woman, his sone is a third-generation [Egyptian] for it all follows the mother. An Ammonite male who married an Egyptian female their child is an Ammonite, an Egyptian male who married an Ammonite female their child is an Egyptian for among the nations [in matters of lineage] we follow the males. If they converted then the child follows the more deficient of the two of them. For example an Amonite male convert who follows an Egyptian female convert or an Egyptian male convert who married an Ammonite femal convert and they gave birth to a son his status becomes an Ammonite who is eternally prohibited, if they gave birth to a daughter her status is Egyptian who is prohibited for two generations. Regarding all other nationalities, immediately after converting they have the status of an Israelite immediately. Rambam wrote that in our time both an Egyptain and an Ammonite are permitted [to marry an Israelite] immediately [after conversion] for Sennacherib arose and intermixed all of the nations and anything removed [from a mixture is viewed as if it was] removed from the majority [of the mixture] and we estimate the [individual convert] descends from the majority of nations who are permitted. My master and father the Rosh wrote that Ammonites, Moabites and Edomites are immediately permitted but also now Egyptians are prohibited [after conversion] until the third generation. A male slave who was immersed [by his Jewish master] for the purpose of becoming a [Canaanite] slave is prohibited form marrying an Israelite woman, and an Israelite man is prohibited from marrying a female slave who was immersed [by her Jewish master] for the purpose of becoming a [Canaanite] female slave, regardless of whether she was his slave or another's [slave]. However, after his master frees him, or abandons him, or lays phylacteries on him, or if his master was a prayer leader and called him to go up to the Torah [ for an aliyah] behold he comes like an Israelite in all matters but if he lay phylacteries in the presence of his master or called him or read the Torah in his presence [during an aliyah] he does not go out to freedom. If his master married him off to an Israelite woman or even if he married an Israelite woman in the presence of his master, the betrothal takes effect for certainly he [his master] has released him since he permitted him to marry an Israelite woman and certainly if it is he [the master] who is marrying his own female slave that betrothal with her takes effect. Who is a Mamzer? It is [the offspring] of a man who copulates with one of the illicit [unions] where the punishment is death administered by the [earthly] Beth Din or Kritut [death / childlessness by the Heavens] with the exclusion of one who copulated with a Niddah who is not a rabbinic Mamzer.  Rambam wrote that if her husband was overseas and she gave birth then the child is is presumed to have the status of a Mamzer for a fetus does not stay in its mother's womb for more than twelve months but the Behag wrote that the child is not presumed to have the status of a Mamzer for we attribute it to the possibility that maybe her husband arrived [home] discreetly and copulated [with her]. A married woman who gained a reputation of copulating promiscuously while under [marriage] to her husband and everyone is chattering about her, we need not worry about her children that maybe they are Mamzerim for we excuse it and say that the majority of instances of intercourse takes place with the husband but as for her we suspect her of being a promiscuous woman [zonah] and if she is exceedingly promiscuous then we are even concerned about [the Mamzer status] of her children.", 
        "0_Orach Chaim, 239_Siman, 0_Seif": "And if he was married he should not be too regular (often) with his wife, and if as they say \"that talmidai chachomim should not be found by their wifes and roosters\" (this ment) not sposificly talmidai chachomim but the same law is also every man, they wrote \"talmidai chachomim\" since abstinent if found by them, ...", 
        "0_Orach Chaim, 582_Siman, 0_Seif": "In the first chapter of Keritot, we have the text (Keritot 5b): Rabbah said, \"That person that wants to know whether he will take out the year or not, should bring a candle during the ten days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur  into a room where the wind is not blowing. If its light (its flame) continues, he will know that he will continue the year. And a person that wants to conduct a business deal and wants to know if the deal will be a successful one or not, should feed a chicken. If it becomes nicely fat, he will know that it will be successful... Abbaye said,\"Now that you have said that a sign is a [correct] matter, a man should accustom himself to eating citron, squash, beans (<i>rubia</i>), leeks (<i>karti</i>), beets (<i>silkei</i>) and dates (<i>tamrei</i>) on Rosh Hashanah.\" Rashi explains that <i>rubia</i> is clover.  <i>Rubia</i> - our merits should increase (<i>yirbu</i>); <i>karti</i> - (the enemies) should be cut off (<i>yikaretu</i>), etc.; <i>silkei</i> - removed (<i>yistalku</i>), etc.; <i>tamrei</i>  finished (<i>yitamu</i>), etc.; squash because it is quick to grow. And from this grew the [various] customs, every place according to its custom; as in Germany, where they are accustomed to eating sweet apple with honey at the beginning of the meal, to say, \"Let this new year be sweet for us.\" And in Provence they are accustomed to bring all types of novelties [to the meal] and to eat a sheep's head and lung, to say, \"Let us be at the head and not at the tail;\" and the lung because it is light. And our teacher, Rabbi Meir of Rothenberg was accustomed to eat the head of a ram to commemorate the ram of Yitzchak.  ", 
        "0_Orach Chaim, 262_Siman, 0_Seif": "And he should be cautious to make a fine lamp, as R. Huna said: One who is regular [to light] a Shabbat lamp, to strive to perform this, and to make it attractive, will have sons who are scholars. And there are those who make two wicks, one to correspond with \"Remember\" and one to correspond with \"Observe.\" But if he cannot afford to buy a lamp for Shabbat and a lamp for Hannukah, Shabbat takes priority. Similarly if he cannot afford to buy a candle and wine for Kiddush, the candle takes priority because of domestic tranquility, for there is no domestic tranquility without a lamp. And he should not hurry to light it while the day is still long, for then it won't be known that he lights it for the honor of Shabbat. Nor should he light late. And when he lights he blesses: Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the universe who has sancitified us with his commandments and commanded us to light the Sabbath lamp. Both men and women are commanded to light this, but women are more commanded than men, as it says in the Midrash: Since she extinguished the lamp of the world, meaning she caused the death of the first human. And the Rambam explains [that women are more obligated] because they are found at home and they take care of household needs. And there are those who says that we should not recite a blessing over it, and they explain that if the lamp was already lit he need not extinguish it in order to go back and light it again, nor need he light another lamp. But this is not a good reason, for with regard to covering the blood [of a bird or wild animal that was slaughtered] we taught: If the wind covered [the blood] he need not go back and cover it again, and nevertheless we bless the covering. Furthermore, Rabbenu Tam said that if it was already lit he must extinguish it and go back and light it again. For an elder said: We have taught: As long as he doesn't do it too early or too late. And so too wrote Rav Amram: One who lights the Shabbat candle blesses. And so too wrote the Halakhot Gedolot that the acceptance of Shabbat is dependent upon the lighting of the candle, for once he has lit the Shabbat candle Shabbat has begun for him. And for this reason he wrote that one must first light the Hannukah lamp before the Shabbat candle for if he does Shabbat first, he cannot afterwards light the Hannukah candle. But the Tosafot wrote that [the beginning of Shabbat] is not dependent on the lighting of the lamp for even after he lights, Shabbat has not begun for him. Rather it is dependent on the maariv prayer, for Shabbat begins once he has prayed maariv.   ", 
        "0_Orach Chaim, 3_Siman, 0_Seif": "And one should wash his hands clean and bless, \"Blessed are you Adonai, our God, King of the universe, that has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us regarding the washing of hands.\" One should be meticulous to pour [water] on them (i.e. the hands) three times because of the evil spirit that rests upon the hands, before they are washed, and does not leave until [water] is poured upon them three times. Therefore, before one's hands are washed, one must refrain from touching the mouth, the nose, the ears, and the eyes with one's hand, as the evil spirit rests upon them. And if one does not have water, one should wipe his hands on a stone or anything that cleans, and bless, \"\"Blessed are you Adonai, our God, King of the universe, that has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us regarding the cleanliness of hands.\"", 
        "0_Orach Chaim, 8_Siman, 0_Seif": "All kinds of clothing are obligated in tzitzit. Tzitzit made of wool or of linen fulfill [this mitzvah] for [garments made of] any kind of fabric, but [tzitzit made from] any other kind of fabric, like silk or cotton do not fulfill [this mitzvah] unless [the fabric of] the tzitzit match the fabric of the garment. The Rambam wrote that one must make the tzitzit the same color as the tallit: i.e. if the tallit is red, the tzitzit should be red, and if the tallit is green, the tzitzit should be green. Rashi agrees with this. Rabbi Yehuda explained that this is not necessary. ", 
        "0_Orach Chaim, 0_Siman, 0_Seif": "Judah ben Tema says: \"Be as strong as a panther, as light as an eagle, running like a gazelle and mighty as a lion to perform the will of your Father in heaven.\"  He specified four things concerning the service of the Creator, may He be blessed. And he began with ‘strong as a panther’ since it is a great general principle of service to the Creator, may He be blessed, since sometimes a person desires to perform a mitzvah but is prevented from performing it because of people who mock him; therefore he warned that he should have fortitude against the mockers and not refrain from performing the mitzvah. So said Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai to his students: “May it be your will that the fear of heaven be upon you like the fear of flesh and blood.” And so he says concerning the subject of shame, that sometimes a person is ashamed before a person more than he is ashamed before the Creator, may He be blessed. Therefore he warned that you should have fortitude against the mockers and not be ashamed. So too did David, peace be upon him, say “I will speak of your decrees in the presence of kings and not be ashamed,” though he was pursued and he fled among the nations, he had taken strength in his Torah and learned, though they had mocked him. And he said ‘as light as an eagle’ corresponding to the eye’s vision, and compared it to an eagle because just as the eagle soars through the air, so too does the eyes’ vision, meaning that you should shut your eyes from seeing evil, for it is the beginning of transgression, for the eye sees, the heart covets and the person's limbs [?] complete the act. And he said ‘as strong as a lion’ corresponding to the heart, for the might of service of the Creator, may he be blessed, is in the heart, and he stated that you should strengthen your heart for His service. He stated ‘run like a gazelle’ corresponding to the legs, for your legs shall run toward the good. So too would David the king, peace be upon him, pray for the three of them, but he changed the sequence, “Lead me in the path of your commandments” about legs. Following that he said “Turn my heart to your decrees.” And after that he said “Avert my eyes from seeing falsehood.” Concerning the heart he mentioned ‘turn,’ whereas concerning the eye, ‘avert,’ for the heart is in his power to turn toward the good path or the evil one, even after he has seen a false [?] incident. Thus he prayed that he should help him to turn to the good path. But seeing falsehood is not in his power, for it is possible that it will come upon him suddenly, and he will see it. Thus he prayed that he avert his eyes from seeing falsehood, and he did not summon him [?] before him at all. Thus a person needs strengthen himself as a lion to stand in the morning for the service of his Creator, even if his evil impulse taunts him in winter, saying ‘How can you get up in the morning when the cold is so great?’ or taunts him in summer, saying ‘How can you get up from your bed when you have not had enough sleep?’ he should strengthen himself to rise, for you should awaken the dawn, but it should not awaken you, as David, peace be on him, stated “Awake, my soul, awake, harp and lyre; I will awaken the dawn,” ‘I awaken the dawn, but the dawn does not awaken me.’ So much the more so had he awakened prior to the morning light to rise and offer supplications before his Creator, how great His beauty, and how good. And it is good that one who begins early should aim for the hours when the guard shifts change, which are at a third of the night, and at the end of two thirds of the night and at the end of the night, for at these times does the Holy One, blessed be He, recall the destruction of the Temple and the dispersion of Israel among the nations, and the prayer which a person offers at that hour for the destruction and the dispersion is propitious and close to acceptance. His supplication shall fall before God whether drawn out or cut short, it is only that he should orient his heart toward heaven in his supplications, for better a little with intention than increasing them out without intention. It is well to say the section of the Akedah and the section of the manna, and the Ten Commandments and the section of the sacrifices, namely the section of the burnt offering and the meal offering and the offering of well being and the sin offering and the guilt offering. Of course it is preferable to say the section of the sacrifices during the day, for they are in place of the offering of the sacrifice, whose time is during the day. When he concludes the section of the burnt offering, he shall say ‘Master of the universe, may it be your will that this be considered and accepted before you as if I had offered a burnt sacrifice in its time. So too shall he say after the section of the meal offering and the offering of well being and the guilt offering. But after the section of the sin offering, he shall not so say, since it does not come freely. And if he is not able to rise early, prior to morning light, in any case he designates the time of the prayer which he is designates for all of life, and should not tarry. And he should well consider in his heart, if he had been in the service of a flesh and blood king who commanded him to rise early at the morning light to his service, he would have taken care and rushed to arise for the service which he commanded him, so much the more so, all the more and all the more so much the more so  before the King of kings of kings, the Holy One blessed be He.",

Sinai. It goes without saying that he shouldn't sell his Torah, even if he has many, and it is even forbidden to sell an old scroll in order to buy a new one, or even to buy food. However it is permitted to sell a Torah scroll in order to learn Torah or to get married if he has nothing else to sell.",

        "0_Orach Chaim, 688_Siman, 0_Seif": "All are required in the Reading of the Megillah: Cohens, Levites, Israelites, slaves, an invalidated Cohen, a mamzer, a natin, a tumtum, an androgynous person; children are also educated in this commandment, and women are also required to fulfill [the Megillah's] reading. Rashi interprets that women can fulfill men's obligation to read the Megillah, but the author of the [halachic work] Halachot Gadolot says that even though this may be the case, they do not fulfill men's obligation. The Ba'al HaItur wrote that it makes sense, because just like women say Grace After Meals to themselves and don't make a zimun, so too here they do not join the communal reading from the outset. An androgynous person fulfills the obligation of both those like him and others; a tumtum, and a one who is half free and half slave, he does not fulfill the obligation even of others like him. A deaf person, someone with mental handicaps, and a child, even one who has reached the age of education, do not fulfill the obligation of others. Rabbi Yehuda allows a child, because he has reached the age of education. The Ba'al HaItur held like [Rabbi Yehuda]. My father brought the Mishnah in its form, and established the law like the first opinion [that a child cannot fulfill the obligation of others], and the author of Halachot Gadolot held similarly. In the Jerusalem Talmud it says that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi gathered all the members of his household and read in front of them.
