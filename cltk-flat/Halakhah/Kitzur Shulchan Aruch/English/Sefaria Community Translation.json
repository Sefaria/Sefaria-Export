        "5_Siman, 9_Se'if": "A person should be careful to say the word Amen properly not swallowing the aleph or nun. One should be sure not to answer amen before the person reciting the bracha finishes the bracha because this is called 'a cutoff amen'. However, one shouldn't delay too long to answer amen because that's considered 'an orphaned amen'. Rather one should answer amen immediately as the one reciting the bracha finishes the bracha. He should raise his voice above the voice of the one making the bracha as it says \"aggrandize Hashem with me and praise His name together\" (Tehillim 124). ", 
        "3_Siman, 4_Se'if": "One must be careful to wipe himself well. Because even if he has a minuscule amount of excrement on his anus, it is forbidden to recite any word of sancity - as is stated later on in 5:3. He must not wipe with his right hand, because he uses it to fasten his phylacteries. And for this reason as well, he should not wipe with the middle finger of his left hand, because he wraps the Tefillin-strap around it. And a left-handed person must wipe with his \"left\" [weaker] hand, which is the \"right\" [stronger] hand of all right-handed people.", 
        "112_Siman, 1_Se'if": "It is permissible to eat <i>chamets</i> until the third of the day (and the day is calculated from the dawn to the coming out of the stars). And it is permissible to benefit [from it] one more hour and it is permissible to sell it [then] to a non-Jew. But afterwards it is prohibited to benefit [from it]. And one needs to burn the <i>chamets</i> and nullify it at any time when it is permissible to benefit [from it] (434, 443).", 
        "21_Siman, 4_Se'if": "When praying in the house of a mourner, or in the house of the diseased (clarification needed) even though there is no mourner present, we do not say Tachanun all seven days of mourning - even in the afternoon service (Mincha) of the seventh day [when the mourners have risen from their state of mourning already]. Our custom is that [the mourners] do not say [Tachanun even] if they have returned to their [respective] houses. If a mourner is in the Synagogue, the congregation is not drawn after him, and they [still] say Tachanun, but the mourner [himself] does not say it.", 
        "2_Siman, 2_Se'if": "One must wear neither expensive clothing--for this brings a person to arrogance, nor very scant or dirty clothing--so that he will not be disgraced in the eyes of others.  Rather, his clothes must be moderate and clean (see Rambam, Hilchot De'ot 5:9).  A person must always sell even the beams of his home to buy shoes for his feet (Orach Chayyim 2:6).", 
        "14_Siman, 3_Se'if": "...One should be careful not to count the members of the Minyan individually (using numbers), because it is forbidden to count Jewish people even if it is for a mitzva... Instead the practice is to count using the phrase \"Save your people and bless your inheritance, carrying them always\" (Psalm 28:9), which has ten words.", 
        "2_Siman, 6_Se'if": "It is forbidden to walk with an upright posture and an outstretched neck, as it is said, \"And walk with stretched-forth necks\" (Isaiah 3:16) (see Orach Chayyim 2:6).  Nonetheless, one must not bend his head too much, but rather a moderate amount, such that a passerby can see his face and that he can watch his step (Sefer HaYir'ah).  Even from the manner in which a person walks it is recognizable whether he is wise and knowledgeable or a fool.  And so said Solomon in his wisdom, \"Yea also, when a fool walketh by the way, his understanding faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool\" (Ecclesiastes 10:3).  [That is], he makes it known to all that he is a fool (Rambam, Hilchot De'ot 5:9).", 
        "8_Siman, 0_Se'if": "The commandment of tzitzit is very important, since the verse teaches that all the commandments depend on it, as it says, \"And you will see them and remember all of the commandments of Hashem.\" Tzitzit is 600 in gematria (which is a numbering system, assigning each letter in the alphabet to a number. For example, aleph to 1, beit to 2, etc.) (See further in the Tur). There are 8 strands and five knots. All of this together adds up to 613 (which is the total number of commandments). Therefore, every person needs to be diligent to wear a tallit katan all day. It should be made of white wool from lambs and should be big enough to meet the size requirements, which are 3/4th amot long and a half of an amah wide. Some hold it needs to be an amah by an amah. Regarding those who sew the sides of talit katan together (making it look more like a shirt than a four cornered garment), you need to be careful to make sure both sides remain visibility open. You shouldn't even use hooks to connect the sides together. Also, every person needs to be diligent to wrap himself in a talit gadol during prayer times. Your talit should also be beautiful, just like regarding all commandments we require that they be done the most beautiful way possible, as it is written, \"That is my God and I will glorify Him.\" We learn from here that I will glorify Him through the commandments. One should be particular to buy tzitzit from a trustworthy man, whom you are certain twined and spun the tzitzit with the intention of doing so for the commandment. The tzitzit should be long enough too, according to the required length. ", 
        "3_Siman, 5_Se'if": "Each time one defecates or urinates, even one drop of urine, he must wash his hands with water and recite the blessing \"He Who formed\". If he urinated or defecated and forgot to recite \"He Who formed\", and afterward urinated or defecated again and remembered that did not recite the blessing after the first time he relieved himself, he only needs to recite the blessing once. And one who is drinking a laxative remedy and knows that he will have to defecate several times, he should only recite the blessing when he is finished relieving himself. ", 
        "2_Siman, 4_Se'if": "One must be careful not to don two garments together, for this causes forgetfulness.", 
        "110_Siman, 4_Se'if": "We must check in all of the places in the holes and in the cracks as much as is possible. And checking is also required in the pockets of his clothes and his infants,' as <i>chamets</i> is sometimes placed there. And he should shake them well on the morrow at the time of the disposal [of <i>chamets</i>] (433).", 
        "101_Siman, 2_Se'if": "An <i>eruv tavshilin</i> is only effective to permit [one] to do all of his needs for Shabbat on the holiday when there is still much [time in the] day. This is when there is [enough] time in the day that if guests that had not eaten that day were to chance upon him, they would [be able] to eat and enjoy on that day before twilight, from the work that he did on the holiday. But if there is not [enough] time in the day [for them] to benefit from his work, the <i>eruv tavshilin</i> is not effective. And therefore we are accustomed that when a holiday comes out on the eve of Shabbat, we pray the evening service of Shabbat earlier while it is still day [on Friday afternoon], such that [people show alacrity] to be quick to finish everything before they say, \"A psalm of verse for the Shabbat day\" (which comes before the evening service). And the cooked foods that we insulate for Shabbat need to be insulated when there is much [time in the] day, such that they are already cooked before twilight - at the very least a third cooked. ", 
        "4_Siman, 1_Se'if": "Even just thinking about things that are holy is forbidden in a place that has feces, urine, or anything else that exudes an unpleasant smell until one covers it up, as the verse states: \"And you will cover that which comes out from you.\" Alternatively, one may pour a revi'it of water into urine that was from one session [which dilutes it enough to make it acceptable to think and do holy things by]. It's the same whether the urine was originally in a vessel and then one pours in it water or the water was originally in a vessel and then one pours in it the urine. (But if the urine was in a vessel that is exclusively designated for urine, then pouring water doesn't help [make the urine acceptable] as is mentioned later in sif 13). Two revi'it of water is needed for urine from two sessions, and so on. Even if the urine was absorbed in the ground or in clothing, water is still needed to dilute the urine as long as the item is still a little damp. ", 
        "110_Siman, 8_Se'if": "The <i>chamets</i> that he leaves over for eating or selling he should put in a well guarded place before the checking. And so [too] the <i>chamets</i> that he finds in his checking and that he needs to burn on the morrow, he should put in a guarded and tied place that he should not lose [anything] from it; and he should put it in a place that he will see it on the morrow and not forget to burn it.", 
        "110_Siman, 6_Se'if": "Before one begins to check, he recites the blessing, \"Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us about the disposal of <i>chamets</i>.\" And even though now he does not yet dispose of it, nonetheless he blesses on the disposal; because immediately after the checking, he nullifies the <i>chamets</i> that is not known to him - and that is the disposal of the <i>chamets</i> that is not known to him. And he should not interrupt between the blessing and the beginning of the checking. And it is good that he should not interrupt until the end of the whole checking, except for that which is related to the checking. And he can check several houses with one blessing. ", 
        "21_Siman, 1_Se'if": "During the morning service (Shacharit), since one is wearing t'fillin on his left hand, one should incline his head to the right in deference to his t'fillin. In the afternoon service (Minchah), he should incline his head to the left.", 
        "0_Siman, 2_Se'if": "\"Yehudah Ben Teima said: Be strong like the leopard, light like the vulture, quick like the gazelle, and mighty like the lion to perform the will of your Father in Heaven'\" (Avot 5:20).  \"Strong like the leopard\" means that one must not be ashamed by people who mock his service of the Lord, blessed be His Name.  \"Light like the vulture\" refers to sight of the eyes.  That is, is should be easy to shut your eyes against evil, for that is the beginning of sin--the eye sees, the heart desires, and the actions finish the deed.  \"Quick like the gazelle\" refers to the legs, that your legs should run toward good.  And \"mighty like a lion\" refers to the heart, for strength in the service of the Creator, blessed be His Name, resides in the heart.  He [Yehudah son of Teima] means that you must strengthen your heart in the service [of the Lord] and overcome your desire to defeat it, as a hero who overcomes his enemy to defeat him and throw him to the ground.", 
        "1_Siman, 3_Se'if": "He must use a vessel to wash his hands.  It is forbidden to benefit from the waters of the washing, for an evil spirit rests in them, and he shall pour them in a place where people do not go.", 
        "39_Siman, 0_Se'if": "One who wants to eat bread whose blessing is \"hamotzi\" must [ritually] wash his hands first.  If the bread is the size of an egg or larger, he blesses on the washing.  If it's smaller, he does not bless on the washing.", 
        "106_Siman, 1_Se'if": "We do not fast, even a fast for a <i>yahrzeit</i> (the memorial day for his parent), in [Nissan]. But we do fast for the fast of a dream. And the firstborn sons fast on the eve of Pesach, as - God willing - will be elucidated in Section 113. And a groom and bride also fast in [Nissan], and even on Rosh Chodesh of Nissan (429).", 
        "21_Siman, 2_Se'if": "One should say Tachanun seated, but in pressured circumstances one may be upstanding. After Tachanun, we say \"And we do not know...\" - which should be said seated - after which we stand to say \"what to do...\" (i.e. we stand between the words \"we do not know\" and \"what to do\").", 
        "1_Siman, 0_Se'if": "Because when a person rises from his bed in the morning he is like a new creation regarding the service of the Creator, may His name be blessed, he must sanctify himself and wash his hands from a vessel, like a priest who would sanctify his hands every day from the laver [in the Temple] before beginning his service.  And the basis for this washing is in Scripture, as it says, \"I will wash my hands in innocency; So will I compass Thine altar, O LORD, That I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard\" (Psalms 26:6-7).  There is yet another reason for this washing:  During the time of sleep, when the holy soul leaves him, an impure spirit comes and rests on his body.  And when he wakes from his sleep, the impure spirit leaves his entire body, except for his fingers, which it does not leave until he pours water on them three discrete times.  It is forbidden to walk four cubits without having washed the hands unless there is a very great need.", 
        "110_Siman, 14_Se'if": "One should not throw kernels of grain to chickens in a wet place within thirty days [of Pesach], lest he forget to dispose of them.", 
        "101_Siman, 0_Se'if": "[When] a holiday comes out on the eve of Shabbat, it is forbidden to bake or cook specifically for the Shabbat [on that day], except by means of an <i>eruv tavshilin</i> (literally, a mixing of foods) that one makes on the eve of the holiday. This is when he takes a particular cooked or roasted food, that is fitting to accompany bread, and also bread and he says the blessing, \"Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us about the commandment of <i>eruv</i>.\" And he then says [in Aramaic], \"With this mixing, it shall be permitted to bake and cook and insulate [food] and light candles and do all of our needs from the holiday for Shabbat.\" And if he does not understand this language, he should say [it] in a language he understands.", 
        "2_Siman, 5_Se'if": "It is forbidden to walk four cubits or utter sacred words while bareheaded.  We must also accustom children to covering their heads, so that the fear of Heaven should be upon them.  It is as we find with Rabbi Nachman son of Yitzchak.  \"Astrologers told the mother of Rabbi Nachman son of Yitzchak, 'Your son will be a thief.'  She did not allow him to go bareheaded.  She said, 'Cover your head so that the fear of Heaven will be upon you.'\"  (Shabbat 156b).", 
        "106_Siman, 2_Se'if": "On Shabbat Hagadol (the Shabbat preceding Pesach), we are accustomed not to say [the Psalm that begins,] <i>Barchi nafshi</i> (bless my soul),\" but rather, \"<i>Avadim hayinu</i>, (we were slaves) etc.\"; since the beginning of the salvation and the miracles was on Shabbat Hagadol.  ", 
        "18_Siman, 6_Se'if": "If one made a mistake in the summer and said \"[God who gives] dew and rain,\"  he should return to \"Bless us,\" [i.e. the beginning of that blessing,] and if he didn't remember that he did that until he said the verse, \"May the words of my mouth, etc.\" [at the end of the Amidah], he should return to the beginning of the Amidah.", 
        "101_Siman, 1_Se'if": "It is necessary that the cooked food be something that is customary to eat with bread - for example, meat, fish or eggs. But something that is not customary to eat with bread is not effective. The [required] size of the cooked food is a <i>kezayit</i> (the size of a large olive) and of the bread is a <i>kebeitsah</i> (the size of an egg). And one should enhance [and seek] a nice portion for the honor of the commandment. And the bread should also be complete and [so] he should leave it for the second bread (<i>lechem mishneh</i>) [required for his meals] on Shabbat and break it [to eat] at the third meal. As since he did one commandment with it, he should also do another commandment with it. ", 
        "110_Siman, 0_Se'if": "We check for <i>chamets</i> (leavened grain products) at night on the eve of Pesach. And we are obligated to check immediately at the beginning of the night. And it is forbidden to start eating or do any work for half an hour before the [beginning of the] night.", 
        "64_Siman, 1_Se'if": "One who infringed and took interest is obligated to return it (besides for רִבִּית מֻקְדֶּמֶת  &amp; רִבִּית מְאֻחֶרֶת as explained later in 'סָעִיף ו)", 
        "4_Siman, 0_Se'if": "It is written: \"And you will cover that which comes out from you because Hashem your God walks amidst your camp... And your camp will be holy, and it will not be seen in it anything that is immodest.\" From here our Rabbis taught, may their memory be blessed, that anytime that Hashem our God walks among us, that is when we're dealing with a matter of holiness (i.e. reading Shema, Shmona Esrei, Torah, etc.), our environment must be holy. There must not be any revealed feces, and one who is reading the Torah or praying must not see a something that is immodest.", 
        "1_Siman, 5_Se'if": "It is good to be careful about the washing of the hands in the morning using a vessel, water, and human effort as in the washing of the hands before a meal (see below, Siman 40).  However, in a pressing situation when he has no fitting water and he wants to pray, he may wash his hands from anything with any type of water and without human effort, and he may bless, \"On the washing of the hands.\"  If there is a river before him, it is better that he dip his hands in it three times, or even in snow.  But if he has no water at all, he must wipe his hands on something and bless, \"On the cleaning of the hands,\" and this is enough [to allow him] to pray.  When water becomes available to him afterward, as well as a proper vessel, he washes his hands again as is fitting, but he does not make another blessing.", 
        "1_Siman, 4_Se'if": "He must not, before washing, touch his mouth, or his nose, or his eyes, or his ears, or his anus, or any foods, or any open wound, for an evil spirit rests on his hands prior to washing, and it harms these things.", 
        "29_Siman, 0_Se'if": "It's written: ''Do not go around as a gossiper among your people.''  Who is a gossiper? One who collects information and then goes from person to person, saying: ''Such is what so and so said; such is what I heard about so and so.'' Though it might be true and are not necessarily shameful,  this is a violation of a prohibition and it is a terrible sin and can cause the deaths of Jews.  So (the Torah) connects it to (the commandment): ''Do not stand upon the blood of your fellow.'' See what happened to Doeg, the Edomite, who told King Saul that Achimelech gave David bread and a sword. Even though the matter was true and was not shameful to Achimelech, for in doing so he did not perform any wrong. Furthermore, if (King) Saul himself had asked Achimelech, he would have told him about what he did, for he did not intend to sin by this against Saul. Nevertheless, Doeg's gossiping caused the deaths of many priests....", 
        "110_Siman, 9_Se'if": "After the checking, he should immediately nullify [the <i>chamets</i>]. And the main nullification is in the heart, such that he should decide in his heart that all of the <i>chamets</i> that is in his possession, behold, it should be as if it were not [in existence] and not be considered anything; and behold, it is like dust and like something that he has no use for at all. And the sages decreed that he should express these words also with his mouth and that he should say [in Aramaic], \"All  <i>chamets</i>, etc.\" And whoever does not understand its meaning, should say [it] in a language he understands. (\"All leavening and all leavened grains that I have in my possession, that I have not seen and that I have not disposed of, should be nullified and ownerless and considered like the dust of the earth.\") (434)", 
        "76_Siman, 3_Se'if": "Women are also obligated in Kiddush. Therefore, they should listen carefully to Kiddush and answer \"Amen\", but not say \"Baruch hu ubaruch shemo\" (See above Siman 6 Seif 9). And a child, even if he is thirteen, if it is not known that he has grown two [pubic] hairs, he does not fulfill the woman's obligation, and therefore, the woman should do Kiddush by herself. If she does not know, she should say Kiddush along with the minor word by word. And even if the hears the Kiddush from her husband or another man, it is better that she say it word by word along the person making Kiddush (see Dagul MeRevava. And see Shulkhan Arukh HaTanya). (And if there are several men in one house, see above Siman 135 Se'if 6) (Rabbi Akiva Eiger).", 
        "110_Siman, 13_Se'if": "And if he makes a storage room in a pit with unleavened wheat, and afterwards the wheat on the floor and walls of the pit become leavened due to the dampness of the pit; even though he stored them within thirty days, he does not need to clear the pit on the night of the fourteenth and check it. Rather the nullification is sufficient for him, since at the time that he stored [the wheat], he stored it in a permissible way. And if there is wheat that became leavened amongst it, there are differing opinions about this, and [so] he should pose the question to a rabbi. (436)", 
        "2_Siman, 1_Se'if": "We do not act in the ways of the nations, and we do not emulate them--not in dress, nor in hair style, and the like--as it says, \"And ye shall not walk in the customs of the nation\" (Leviticus 20:23).  And as it says, \"Neither shall ye walk in their statutes\" (Leviticus 18:3).  And as it says, \"Take heed to thyself that thou be not ensnared to follow them\" (Deuteronomy 12:30).  One must not dress in clothing unique to them for pride, i.e. clothing worn by officers.  For example, it is stated in the Gemara (Sanhedrin 74a) that it is forbidden for a Jew to act like them, even regarding shoelaces.  If they would tie [their shoes] in one way, and Jews would tie another way, or if their custom was to have red laces, and Jews would have black (for the color black is instructive in humility, lowliness, and modesty), it is forbidden for a Jew to differ.  And from this every person should learn, according to his time and place, that the clothing that is made for arrogance and licentiousness--a Jew may not use it.  Rather, his dress must be made in a way that is instructive of submissiveness and modesty.  So it is said in the Sifri that you must not say, \"Since they go out in purple, I too will go out in purple,\" or \"Since they go out with <i>kolasin</i>, i.e. weapons, I too will go out with weapons.\"  For these are matters of arrogance, and this is not the portion of Jacob.  Rather, their [the children of Jacob] way is to be modest and humble, and not to turn toward conceit.  And so too anything which they [the nations] do that can be suspected of containing an iota of foreign worship, a Jew may not do it.  And so he may not shave his head or grown his hair like them.  Rather, he must separate himself from them in dress and speech and in all his other actions, just as he separates himself from them in his knowledge and opinions.  And so it is said, \"And I have set you apart from the peoples\" (Leviticus 20:26).", 
        "106_Siman, 0_Se'if": "[During] the whole month of Nissan, we do not say <i>Tachanun</i> (supplicational prayers), nor justification of judgement [normally recited after someone's death]. And we do not say [the prayer that begins with] \"your justice\" during the afternoon prayers on Shabbat. From Rosh Chodesh (the beginning of the month) and onward [for the first twelve days], we are accustomed to read the section of the [tribal] leader who made an offering on that day [in <i>Parshat Nasso</i>]. And on the thirteenth day, we read <i>Parshat Beha'alotecha</i> up until (Numbers 8:4), \"so did he make the <i>menorah</i>,\" which corresponds to the tribe of Levi.", 
        "3_Siman, 1_Se'if": "One must be modest in the restroom. One may not uncover himself until he sits down. And even then he should limit what he uncovers, so he only uncovers what is necessary in order to not soil his clothing. He must also be careful regarding this at night as he is during the day. If one defecates in an open area where there are no barriers, he should orient himself such that he faces the south and his back is to the north, or vice versa. However, if there is a barrier, he may defecate in any direction as long as his back is facing the barrier. And it is permitted to urinate in any direction. He may not defecate in front of any person. Even in front of a Gentile, it is forbidden. But to urinate is permissible even during the day in front of many people if it is necessary, because there is a potential danger if he withholds himself. Nevertheless, he should remove himself to the side [out of the sight of people]. ", 
        "112_Siman, 4_Se'if": "It is forbidden to eat matsah the whole day. And even to little boys and little girls - so long as they understand the matter of the exodus from Egypt - it is forbidden to give them matsah. But every person is permitted to eat cooked food that we make from ground matsah until the tenth hour, which is until the last quarter of the day. And from then and onward, it is forbidden to eat, except in a time of need [to eat] a small amount of fruits or meat and fish. And he should be careful not to fill his stomach, so that he will eat matsah at night with desire (471). ",

        "112_Siman, 7_Se'if": "Those that enhance [their religious practices] bake the matsah for the commandment (which will be eaten at the beginning and end of the Pesach seder) on the eve of Pesach after midday, which is the time of the offering of the Pesach sacrifice. And since then is the time that <i>chamets</i> is forbidden, it is good that he explicitly nullify the crumbs, and say this matter in a language that he understands: \"All crumbs that will fall during the time of kneading and setting up, and also the dough that will stick to the vessels, I am nullifying and making them ownerless.\"",

        "3_Siman, 2_Se'if": "One may not defecate while standing. And one should not force himself too much to defecate, so that he does not detach the teeth-like protrusions of the bowels. He should also not hurry to leave the restroom until it is clear to him that he no longer needs to relieve himself. And when he urinates while standing, he must take care that the urine does not drip on his shoes and clothing. He must also be very careful not to hold his male organ--see later 151:3...", 
        "110_Siman, 15_Se'if": "One who goes on a journey should, before he goes, appoint an agent to check and nullify his <i>chamets</i>. And he should say explicitly that he appoints him as an agent for the checking and also for the nullification. And the agent should say in the nullification, \"The <i>chamets</i> of so-and-so, etc.\" And nonetheless in the place that he is, he should also nullify his <i>chamets</i> that is in his possession on the eve of Pesach in the morning (432, 434, 436).",

        "110_Siman, 12_Se'if": "And if he makes the storage room with the thought that he will not clear it until after Pesach, then there is a distinction [based on] time: If it is thirty days before Pesach, he does not have to check it (but if there is known <i>chamets</i> there, he must dispose of it first) and his nullification is effective for him when he nullifies all of the <i>chamets</i> at its time. But if it is within thirty days before Pesach, the obligation of checking falls upon it (since we ask [about] and elucidate the laws of Pesach thirty days before Pesach) and he must check it. And even, ex post facto, if he forgot and did not check it; he needs to clear the storage room and to check it at night immediately after he remembers. ", 
        "110_Siman, 3_Se'if": "A cattle pen, where grain is given to the animals to eat; and so [too] a chicken coop, where grain is given to them there, do not require checking. As perhaps the grain never became leavened; and if you will say that it did become leavened, perhaps they ate all of it and there is nothing left.

He shall do so three times.  It is good to wash them until the wrist.  However, in a pressing situation, it is enough [to wash] up to the knuckles.  He washes his face in honor of his Maker, as it says, \"For in the image of God made He man\" (Genesis 9:6).  He shall also wash his mouth because of the mucus that is in it, as he must mention the Great Name [of God] in sanctity and purity.  Afterward he dries his hands.

Because it is not how a person sits, moves and works when he is alone at home but how he sits, moves and works when he is in the presence of a great king. Similarly, neither his conversation, nor his attitude, when he is among his family and friends, like when he is in the presence of royalty. For then he will certainly take care on his behaviour and his speech that they will be suitably correct. How much more should a man watch himself, because the Great King, the Holy One, blessed be He, whose glory fills all the earth, is standing over him and observing his actions, as it is said: \"Can a man hide himself in secret places that I cannot see him?\" says the Lord, \"Do I not fill heaven and earth?\", he will certainly immediately acquire a feeling of reverence and submission from fear of the Blessed Name and he will be ashamed [to do wrong].",

There are authorities who are lenient with regard to this requirement, but it is proper to behave stringently. However, if he has even a small amount of excrement in the rectum, even thought it is covered, according to all authorities the fact that it is covered does not help because in its place it is considered especially vile.

And if it is not possible for him to arise at midnight, he should anyhow strengthen himself to arise before dawn.  This is like what King David said, \"I will awake the dawn\" (Psalms 57:9)--I wake the dawn, but the dawn does not awake me.

The explanation being that each morning man is made into a new creation. He should therefore thank God, blessed be His Name, with all his capabilities for this. And while he is still lying on his bed, he should say \"I thank You, O Living and Eternal King, for you have returned my soul to me with compassion; great is your faithfulness!\" And even though his hands are still not clean, he can say this, since it does not include God's Name.

So too, if the market day is on Shabbat it is forbidden to give to the non Jew money before Shabbat in order that he should buy something is not found to be bought, only on Shabbat. So too its forbidden to give something to sell in this fashion. However, in a way where it is not specified explicitly that it should be done on Shabbat, it is not forbidden, only if it is given on Erev Shabbat. But beforehand it is permissible to give the item, or the money to buy. And it is good not to live at all in a city that the market day is on Shabbat, because it is impossible not to sin.
