        "6_Chapter, 13_Verse": "In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God has made the one as well as the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.",
        "6_Chapter, 14_Verse": "All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in his wickedness.",
        "6_Chapter, 15_Verse": "Be not righteous overmuch; nor make thyself overwise: why shouldst thou destroy thyself?",

        "6_Chapter, 19_Verse": "For there is not a just man upon earth, that does good, and sins not.",
        "6_Chapter, 20_Verse": "Also take no heed to all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:",
        "6_Chapter, 21_Verse": "for oftentimes also thy own heart knows that thou thyself hast likewise cursed others.",

        "6_Chapter, 23_Verse": "That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?",
        "6_Chapter, 24_Verse": "I cast about in my mind to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly and foolishness which is madness:",
        "6_Chapter, 25_Verse": "and I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands are fetters: he who pleases God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be caught by her.",

        "7_Chapter, 5_Verse": "For every matter has its time and method, though the misery of man is great upon him.",
        "7_Chapter, 6_Verse": "For he knows not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?",
        "7_Chapter, 7_Verse": "There is no man who has power over the wind to retain the wind; nor has he power over the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; nor shall wickedness deliver those who are given up to it.",
        "7_Chapter, 8_Verse": "All this have I seen, and have appointed my heart to every work that is done under the sun: there is a time when one man rules over another to his own hurt.",
        "7_Chapter, 9_Verse": "And so I saw the wicked buried, and come to their rest; but those who had done right were gone from the holy place, and were forgotten in the city: this also is vanity.",
        "7_Chapter, 10_Verse": "Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.",
        "7_Chapter, 11_Verse": "Though a sinner do evil a hundred times, and his days are prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with those who fear God, who fear before him:",
        "7_Chapter, 12_Verse": "but it shall not be well with the wicked, and, like the shadow, he will not prolong his days; because he does not fear before God.",
        "7_Chapter, 13_Verse": "There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there are just men, to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked; again, there are wicked men, to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.",

        "7_Chapter, 16_Verse": "then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; furthermore; though a wise man think to know it, yet he shall not be able to find it.",
        "8_Chapter, 0_Verse": "For all this I laid to my heart, and sought to clarify all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their deeds, are in the hand of God: no man knows whether love or hatred is in store: all is before them.",
