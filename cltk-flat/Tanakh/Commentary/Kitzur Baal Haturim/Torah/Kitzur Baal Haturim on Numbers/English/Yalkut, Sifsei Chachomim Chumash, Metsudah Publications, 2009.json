        "30_Chapter, 3_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>One thousand from each tribe.</b> The verse begins with an <i>aleph</i> and ends with an <i>aleph</i>, which teaches that they were all of one heart to their Father in Heaven.", 
        "2_Chapter, 1_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>These are the names of the sons of Aharon, the firstborn, Nadav, and Avihu, Elazar and Isamar</b>. There is a pause between the words “the firstborn” and “Nadav” because it does not refer to Nadav who died without children, and there is no practical ramification of his being the firstborn. Rather, it refers to Aharon who was the firstborn ahead of Moshe.", 
        "5_Chapter, 22_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>This is how [כה] you shall bless.</b> The language כה evokes the merit of <i>Akeidahs Yitzchak</i>: “and I and the lad will go to that place [עד כה]” (Bereishis 22:5) and the blessing to Avraham “so [כה] will your descendants be” (Ibid. 15:5), and this is the meaning of “forasmuch as Hashem has blessed me thus [כה]” (Yehoshua 17:14). There are 25 (<i>gematriya</i> of כה) letters in the verse of <i>Shema Yisrael.</i> The language of blessing and peace is used in the Torah 25 times. Therefore, the blessing of the <i>kohanim</i> begins with the language of blessing and concludes with peace. This is hinted at in the verse, “Hashem shall <b>bless</b> His people with <b>peace</b>” (Tehillim 29:11).", 
        "2_Chapter, 37_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>Moshe and Aharon</b>. There is a pause between Moshe and Aharon, to inform that Moshe was alone in one place, and Aharon and his sons were alone in another place.", 
        "4_Chapter, 27_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>And shall bear seed.</b> This is in juxtaposition to “this is the law (Torah) of jealousies,” which teaches that if she is pure she will have righteous sons who will know the Torah."
